    <Title>Social Welfare Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>&ldquo;I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the increases in the rates of social welfare payments and other changes in <Col N="2090" /> social welfare schemes announced in the budget.  The Bill also contains some miscellaneous provisions affecting the social welfare code.  I trust that Deputies will have found the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill a help in their consideration of this legislation.</P>
    <P>The necessity to make available from the overall allocation for social welfare services in 1983 an additional £31 million for unemployment services has meant that the improvements in social welfare services this year are not as high as we would have liked.  The options in this regard were to provide a lower level of increase from April or a higher level of increase from a later date.  In the event the Government decided that rates of payment should be increased from the end of June.  This means that it is possible to provide for increases of 12 per cent in long-term payments and ten per cent in short-term payments and this level of increase could not have been provided from an earlier date.  The full year cost of a 1 per cent increase of all benefits, excluding children's allowances, is £14.5 million.</P>
    <P>In the past a climate of economic growth and moderate inflation has enabled social welfare services to expand and to represent an ever-increasing percentage of national income.  In the current economic climate further real improvements are very difficult to achieve and the immediate problems of the public finances must be faced.</P>
    <P>Recession and inflation means less income and greater expenditure for social welfare.  In a recession yields from general taxation and social insurance contributions decline, due to a decrease in aggregate earnings levels as a result of increasing unemployment, and employers suffering from cash-flow problems may delay in remitting payments.  On the payments side a recession gives rise to increased expenditure on unemployment benefits as well as extra expenditure related to unemployment, such as retraining and youth employment programmes. Furthermore, increases in social insurance contributions needed for balancing receipts and expenditure create other problems by reducing the <Col N="2091" /> disposable income of the working population and pushing up the cost to employers of taking on employees.  Inflation has the effect of increasing expenditure because those dependent on social welfare must be given additional payments.</P>
    <P>The new rates of payments provided in the Bill come into effect from the end of June and beginning of July and represent increases of 12 per cent in the weekly rates of long-term and ten per cent in the weekly rates of short-term social insurance, occupational injuries and social assistance payments.  The increases for long-term beneficiaries are designed to protect, within the very severe constraints of very limited available moneys for the 1983 budget, the purchasing power of their benefits.  In the case of short-term beneficiaries the increase is indeed less, but it must be remembered that many such persons qualify for pay-related benefit in addition to the flat-rate payments.  I regret very much that in present financial circumstances it was not possible to provide a significant real improvement in the level of social welfare payments.  I fully appreciate that many persons dependent on social welfare incomes &mdash; the sick, the unemployed, the widowed and the retired &mdash; are finding it extremely difficult to make ends meet in this severe and prolonged recession.  It is unfortunate that at a time like this, when the need for income maintenance services, particularly unemployment benefits, is greatest, that the State's ability to make an adequate response is limited because of the critical position of the public finances.  However, I can assure Members of the House that as soon as circumstances permit, hopefully by next year's budget, it is my firm intention to secure further real improvements in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>It is relatively easy to give generous increases to social welfare recipients during periods of economic growth with low rates of inflation, but the real test of a caring society lies in its response when our economy is in recession.  This Government have no intention of allowing the weaker sections of our community who are dependent on social welfare <Col N="2092" /> incomes to suffer a drop in their real living standards.  We will take whatever steps are necessary to achieve an equitable distribution of the national resources.  Neither will we permit these scarce resources to be misused by a minority at the expense of people in genuine need and of the working population who support the benefits through their PRSI contributions and general taxation. I refer here to the employment-related expenditure.</P>
    <P>The rapidly rising live register made it necessary to provide for a very substantial increase in expenditure by the Department of Social Welfare before any allowance was made for improvements in existing services.</P>
    <P>The previous Government in preparing their Estimates for 1983 had forecast that an average of 177,000 people, excluding persons working short-time and the over 65s, would be unemployed during 1983.  Already in the very first month of the year it became obvious that this figure was significantly underestimated and that the average for the year is likely to be in excess of 190,000.  The Government have assumed an average of 193,000 for the year and have allocated an additional £31 million to meet the cost of this increased level of unemployment over the amount provided in the published Estimate.  When allowance is made for the increased rates of payments, the overall costs of the unemployment services this year, including smallholders' unemployment assistance, will be around £473 million or some 25 per cent of social welfare expenditure.</P>
    <P>The impact of rising unemployment on social welfare expenditure can be illustrated by looking at the level of expenditure on unemployment services during recent years.  In 1980 expenditure on all unemployment payments, including smallholders' unemployment assistance, amounted to some £170 million.  By the following year this figure had risen to some £255 million.  In 1982 the expenditure had increased to some £381 million. These figures illustrate the problem posed by rising unemployment in terms of financing social welfare expenditure.</P>
    <P>It may be necessary to further increase <Col N="2093" /> the £473 million now provided for the unemployment services, depending on the emerging unemployment situation. No Government in recent years have been able to accurately predict in advance what the level of unemployment would be and estimates have consistently been exceeded by the actual results.  In drawing up the Estimates for 1983 it was assumed that the numbers of short-time workers and persons over 65 would be of the order of 10,000.  Already there are indications that this figure may be an underestimate because the end of February live register shows the number to be 15,000 &mdash; 13,500 short-time and 1,500 over 65s.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the effect of the increases on individual payments. The increases in social insurance and occupational injuries benefits are provided in section 2 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>A contributory old age pensioner under 80 years of age will receive an additional £4.85 per week bringing his rate of payment to £45.10 per week.  If he is married with a wife under age 66 he will get a total increase of £7.95, bringing the pension to £73.90 per week.  A married couple both over pensionable age will get £78.75 compared to £70.30 at present.  Higher increases are paid for pensioners over 80.  Additional payments are also made for persons living alone.</P>
    <P>While speaking of pensions I feel that I should draw attention to the fact that the real value of the pension is much greater than its face value.  All pensioners over age 66 are entitled to free travel and in addition they may qualify for fuel vouchers and, if living alone, increased living alone allowance of £3 a week and free electricity, free telephone rental and free TV licence.  These additional benefits add appreciably to the overall value of the pension.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of widow's contributory pension is being increased by £4.35 per week to £40.60.  Widows over 66 receive higher payments.  A widow with, for example, three dependent children will receive £75.40 per week, which is an increase of £8.10.</P>
    <P>The personal rate of invalidity pension goes up from £35.50 to £39.75 for a person <Col N="2094" /> under pensionable age and a married couple with two children will receive £84.80, an increase of £9.10.</P>
    <P>A person in receipt of disability or unemployment benefit will have a new personal rate of £34.80 per week, an increase of £3.15.  Where the recipient is married the increase will be £5.20 per week.  Maternity allowance is also being increased to £34.80.</P>
    <P>I think Deputies would be interested to know that the rates of social insurance benefits in this country can be compared favourably with those payable in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.  For example, the standard rate of unemployment benefit and sickness benefit in the United Kingdom is now £25 sterling for a single person and £40.45 for a married couple. These payments, at current exchange rates, are equivalent to £27.30 and £44.17 in Irish money terms.  The corresponding Irish payments from June are £34.80 and £57.35.  Also in the United Kingdom flat-rate unemployment and sickness benefits only are payable, the earnings-related supplement having been withdrawn in June 1982.  Another difference is that the duration of unemployment benefit is 15 months in Ireland as against 12 months in Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>The new rate of social assistance payments are provided in section 3 of the Bill.  The maximum personal rate of non-contributory old age pension for a pensioner under 80 years of age goes from £34.45 per week at present to £38.60 per week.  It will go up to £41.40 for persons aged 80 or over.  The overall maximum payment for a pensioner under 80 with a dependent spouse under 66 years will increase by £6.25 to £58.  The allowance payable in respect of a prescribed relative giving full-time care and attention to an incapacitated pensioner is being raised to £21.60.</P>
    <P>Widows receiving non-contributory widows' pensions at the present rate of £33.80 will get an increase of £4.05 per week.  A widow with two dependent children will get £58.55, an increase of £7.40 per week.  Similar increases will apply to deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2095" /> Those receiving unemployment assistance in urban areas will get an increase of £2.65 per week in their maximum personal rate.  In rural areas the increase will be £2.55 per week.  There are also increases in respect of dependants.  An applicant in an urban area who has a wife and three dependent children will get an increase of £6.55 per week in the present rate of £65.00.  The special rates of unemployment assistance payable to smallholders in certain areas with land under £20 valuation whose means are assessed notionally by reference to land valuation are being maintained at their existing levels. The maximum rate of supplementary welfare allowance for a married couple goes from £43.95 per week to £48.35 with additional payments for children.</P>
    <P>Sections 5, 6 and 7 provide for reductions in the benefits payable to persons engaged in short-time employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>These proposals have been the subject of some controversy since their announcement and I would like to clarify the reason for the Government's decision in this regard.  It is simply this.  An examination of the benefits available to short-time workers shows that very often they are better off than if they were working full-time. There are indications that the present system inhibits a return to whole-time work when the need for short-time working has ceased.  I might add that the previous Government had similar proposals to restrict the benefits available to short-time workers and intended to bring them in from the first week of January 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most common arrangement for short-time working is where workers, normally engaged on a five day week, work for three days and are laid off for two.  In general, these workers receive three-fifths of their basic pay and, after the statutory waiting period, three days flat-rate unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit, representing half the appropriate weekly rate of these benefits <Col N="2096" /> which are payable on the basis of a six day week.  To illustrate the extent to which short-time workers are better off than when working full-time, I would cite the following examples.  As a percentage of his normal take-home pay when working full-time, a worker on a three day week with gross earnings of £100 per week would receive by way of pay and benefit amounts ranging from 104 per cent if he is single to 113 per cent if he is married with two children.  The corresponding replacement ratio for a worker earning £145 per week ranges from 103 per cent to 114 per cent.  In addition, many short-time workers also qualify for income tax refunds because of their reduced earnings.</P>
    <P>The measures in the Bill are aimed at ensuring that short-time workers' pay and benefit will be generally limited to 90 per cent of their normal full-time take-home earnings.  This is somewhat more than the limit of 85 per cent which applies in the case of those fully employed.  The 90 per cent limit is being achieved by restricting benefit payments to two-sixths of the flat-rate, instead of three-sixths as at present and also by abolishing pay-related benefit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Should it not be two-fifths?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Broadly speaking, about two-thirds of the short-time workers will have incomes ranging from 81 per cent to 90 per cent of their full-time net income and about one-third will have net incomes in excess of this level but less than they had been receiving under the existing arrangements.  The new arrangements come into operation as and from 4 April next.</P>
      <P>During 1982 an estimated £77.8 million was paid on pay-related benefit.  The 1983 provision is £61.3 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Changes in the pay-related benefit scheme are provided in sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill.  This benefit is payable as a supplement to the flat-rate unemployment and sickness benefits.  The overall levels of benefit available during sickness or full-time unemployment have been the <Col N="2097" /> subject of a degree of concern for some time.  Much of this criticism has been exaggerated.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, an examination of the position indicates that despite the existence of various limits, the level of benefits, particularly when account is taken of tax refunds, can be relatively high when compared with previous take-home pay. For example, a married man with three children whose gross earnings are £145 per week can now receive disability benefit and pay-related benefit amounting to 98 per cent of his normal take-home pay.</P>
    <P>The 1983 Estimates prepared by the previous Government allowed for a reduction of pay-related benefit from 40 per cent to 30 per cent for the first six months and 20 per cent for the remaining nine months for all claimants from January 1983.  For the reasons I have already given, this Government accepted the need to reduce the levels of pay-related benefit but deferred implementing the proposal until April 1983.  To meet the cost of deferment and to provide a contribution towards additional expenditure, the initial rate of pay-related benefit was reduced to 25 per cent.  At the same time the waiting period for pay-related benefit is being increased from two to three weeks, the earnings floor for calculating pay-related benefit is being increased from £32 to £36 and the overall benefit ceiling for disability benefit purposes is being set at 80 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings instead of the present 100 per cent.  This last measure which also was intended by the previous Government to commence in January last will now also come into effect in April and will be provided for by regulation.</P>
    <P>Another matter to be implemented by regulation from April is the raising of the earnings ceiling for the purpose of calculating pay-related benefit from £9,500 to £11,000.  This will mean increased levels of benefit for persons in that earnings bracket.</P>
    <P>The effects of the changes in pay-related benefit to which I have referred will mean that in the example of the married man with three children earning <Col N="2098" /> £145, disability benefit plus pay-related benefit will amount to 86 per cent of his net weekly earnings increasing to 88 per cent from June.  This compares to 98 per cent under present arrangements.  The same man drawing unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit is limited to 85 per cent of his take-home pay at present and this limit will continue to apply in his case from April.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for the withdrawal of maternity grant in respect of confinements on or after 4 April 1983.  This grant of £8 is no longer of any real significance in the context of the maternity allowance scheme which was substantially improved two years ago for employed women on maternity leave.  The scheme for working women now provides average amounts of about £900 while in the case of the general scheme the average amount is £500. These two schemes are of far greater importance to women than the £8 grant being discontinued.</P>
    <P>Section 12 provides for the disqualification of apprentices from entitlement to children's allowances with effect from 1 July 1983.  While in the past apprentices between the ages of 16 and 18 years may have had little or no wages, they now earn between £30 and £50 a week. Accordingly, at a time when financial resources are limited, the continued payment of children's allowances in such circumstances can no longer be justified. Unemployed workers between 16 and 18 years lose the children's allowances and here the anomaly is being rectified.  Both the abolition of maternity grant and the withdrawal of children's allowance for apprentices were also allowed for in the Estimates prepared by the previous Government.  I wanted to make that point very strenuously.</P>
    <P>I come now to measures which do not fall within the scope of the budget.  Section 13 provides for the discontinuance of the notional method of assessment of means for smallholders for unemployment assistance purposes by reference to the rateable valuation of land.</P>
    <P>Under section 147 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, landowners in certain areas of the country have the option of having their means assessed <Col N="2099" /> by reference to the rateable valuation of their land where the valuation does not exceed £20.  Following the High Court judgement of 30 July 1982 that sections of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, were unconstitutional, the Attorney General advised that the continued use of the notional method of assessment of means is unlawful and the 1981 Act should be amended as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Some 14,000 smallholders who are at present notionally assessed will, under section 13, retain entitlement to unemployment assistance on the present basis of calculation until such time as their means can be assessed on a factual basis. The Bill provides that factual assessment must be completed not later than three years from the commencement of the section.  For practical reasons related to staff availability, factual assessment of such large numbers could not be completed in a short time without seriously disrupting other schemes and services. Assessment must therefore of necessity be undertaken over a period.  The first phase of the review operations will commence in April and be completed within three months.  This will involve 2,000 cases and each local office will proceed on that basis and the work will commence almost immediately.</P>
    <P>Regarding the PRSI contributions applicable to retrospective lump-sum wage settlements in 1982-83, section 14 provides for the determination of the rate of social insurance contributions payable in respect of certain lump-sum wage settlements in the 1982-83 contribution year.</P>
    <P>Following representations concerning the impact of the new youth employment levy and the increased rates of PRSI contributions which would be payable on lump-sum wage settlements paid after 6 April 1982 but which related to periods before that date, the then Taoiseach gave a commitment in April 1982 that refunds would be payable as early as practicable where back money is initially charged to PRSI at a rate higher than that applying when it was earned.  The arrangements for the making of refunds in such cases <Col N="2100" /> were announced in May 1982.  Section 14 provides the statutory basis for these arrangements.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer at this stage to the financing of supplementary welfare allowance.  Under existing legislation, local authorities are obliged to meet a share of the expenditure on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards.  The balance of the expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance is met by the Exchequer.  The local authorities are obliged to recoup the health boards the full cost of administering the scheme. There is no provision for an Exchequer contribution to these costs.</P>
    <P>In recent years the payment of the sums involved has been causing problems for the local authorities as the rate of yearly increases in supplementary welfare allowance expenditure has exceeded the rate of increases in their incomes prescribed by the Minister for the Environment. Local authorities were advised in April 1982 of limits on their liability in 1982 to contribute to the cost of supplementary welfare allowance, including certain amounts due in 1982 in respect of allowances paid in 1981.  These limits were to apply both as respects the local authority's share of the cost of payments and the cost of administering the scheme, the resulting deficit to be made good to the health boards by increased payments towards the cost of the scheme from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In order to give legislative effect to the limits imposed, section 15 of the Bill provides that the amounts payable by local authorities towards the cost of supplementary welfare allowance in respect of 1981, 1982 and subsequent years may be limited by regulations made by the Minister for Social Welfare in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The section also provides that the liability of local authorities for costs of administration for 1982 and subsequent years may also be limited by regulations made in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Provision is also made for Exchequer <Col N="2101" /> subvention of administration costs where such costs are not fully defrayed by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Section 16 of the Bill extends the scope of the occupational injuries benefit scheme to trainees under schemes approved by the Youth Employment Agency.  I am sure Members will welcome this.  A similar provision already applies in the case of trainees under AnCO schemes.</P>
    <P>The Department's powers to prosecute for offences are being strengthened and clarified under the provisions of sections 17 to 25 of the Bill.  The measures in sections 17, 19 and 24 are designed to combat the problem of collusion between employer and employee in regard to concurrent working and drawing of benefit. The other provisions (sections 18, 20 21, 22, 23 and 25) deal with the time limits for taking prosecutions.  These measures are being taken following the advice of the Attorney General in relation to defects in the existing legislation which have come to light in recent years.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we take effective measures to deal with abuse or misuse of the social welfare system and to strengthen the legislation where this needs to be done.  This applies not only to the abuse which occurs where people obtain benefits to which they are not entitled but also and perhaps more urgently, where employers withhold social insurance contributions payable in respect of their employees.  This is an area in which I am particularly concerned to see that effective action is taken.  This would be in the interests not only of the social insurance fund and the Exchequer but also of reputable employers who pay their contributions as and when they are due and who are, in effect, put at a disadvantage in relation to others who are less conscientious. The practice of some employers of avoiding or holding off on remittances of PAYE-PRSI for as long as possible is not acceptable and in my view the existing legislative provisions in this area should be applied vigorously and, if necessary, strengthened.</P>
    <P>The evidence in relation to the last complete income tax year &mdash; 1981-82 &mdash; is that at the end of December 1982, by <Col N="2102" /> which time all remittances in respect of that tax year should have been already made, there was some £25 million of PRSI contribution income alone still outstanding from approximately 11,000 employers.  While a proportion of this is under various forms of control, for example, being remitted under instalment arrangements or involved in liquidation proceedings and the like, a large proportion is not and its eventual collection will merely involve the Revenue Commissioners in time-consuming recovery action which in some instances may go on for years.  Some £14 million is still outstanding in respect of the 1980-81 tax year and some £6 million in respect of 1979-80.</P>
    <P>Cases have been reported where considerable arrears of PAYE-PRSI are revealed when a company goes into liquidation with perhaps large debts and few assets.  It is argued in some instances that the collection system is too inflexible and does not make sufficient allowance for trading conditions in individual cases.  I think this line of reasoning is too facile.</P>
    <P>The fact that so many firms have gone into liquidation leaving behind large commitments for PAYE-PRSI without assets to meet them is clear proof in itself that abuse of one system will not solve the problems of another system where the difficulties are of a fundamental nature.</P>
    <P>While the primary responsibility for the collection of PRSI contributions now rests with the Revenue Commissioners I will be ensuring that the role of the inspectorate of my own Department in detecting cases of non-payment of PRSI contributions is in no way diminished and, if possible, increased.  In 1982 my Department reported over 3,000 employers to the Revenue Commissioners for failure to pay contributions totalling almost £4.5 million.  I am concerned to see effective combined action by Revenue and Social Welfare in this area so that cases of withholding of contributions are speedily detected and that this particular form of abuse, the burden of which, in the final analysis, falls on other contributors, to the system and on taxpayers generally, is eliminated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2103" /> The overall cost of the social insurance and social assistance rates increases being provided in the Bill is £80.6 million.  This will come to about £160 million in a full year.  The extra social insurance expenditure, £50 million in 1983, falls to be met out of the social insurance fund which is financed by contributions from employers and employees and the Exchequer. There is no increase in the rates of social insurance contributions but the proposal of the previous Government to increase the earnings ceiling for contribution purposes from £9,500 to £13,000 has been adopted and is provided for in section 4 of the Bill.  The extra yield, £16 million in 1983, was incorporated in the Estimates prepared by the last administration.</P>
    <P>In recent years the ceiling for PRSI contributions has been increased more or less in line with increases in average earnings. On this basis an increase from £9,500 to £11,000 would be indicated for 1983-84.  This is the level of increase which will apply to the ceiling for calculation of pay-related benefit.  It was decided, however, in the context of the preparation of the 1983 Estimate by the previous Government, that, for contribution purposes, a ceiling of £13,000 would be applied from April 1983.  The raising of the ceiling from £9,500 to £13,000 was estimated to increase social insurance fund income in 1983 by some £16 million.  The total abolition of the ceiling would have increased contribution income by a further £10 million approximately, about three-quarters of 1 per cent increase.  If the ceiling had been raised to £11,000 the increase in contribution income would have been £11 million approximately.</P>
    <P>The ceiling for health contribution purposes is to be £11,000 from April.  This is in line with the increase in the health eligibility limit.  No ceiling applies for youth employment levy or income levy purposes.</P>
    <P>All contributors earning over £9,500 will be affected by the raising of the ceiling to £13,000.  The numbers involved are roughly estimated at 148,000 full-rate contributors and 92,000 modified rate <Col N="2104" /> contributors, a total of 240,000 contributors. Of these some 54,000 and 49,000 respectively are estimated to be earning in excess of £13,000 &mdash; a total of 103,000.</P>
    <P>The Government are conscious of the need to supplement the income of families depending on low earnings.  The absence of such a scheme has led to a poverty trap in the case of the larger families where the return from employment is only marginally better than unemployment payments.  The sum of £5 million is being provided this year for the payment of supplements to low income families.  Details of this scheme are being drawn up and I hope to bring forward new legislation in this area in the near future.</P>
    <P>Apart from the £5 million in respect of the new family income supplement, the budget improvements in social welfare payments will amount to £80.6 million in 1983 and some £160 million in a full year. To this must be added the cost of the improvements in health allowances which will amount to £3 million in 1983 and £5.9 million in a full year.  These figures are not insignificant even in the context of pre-Budget expenditure on social welfare of the order of £1,780 million. They are indeed an indication of my commitment and the commitment of the Government to do our best for those in need even in the most difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I would also like to mention that a provision of £500,000 was made in the budget for suitable voluntary bodies in the social services area.  My intention is that this money will be allocated by way of grants preferably for once-off projects.  I am, however, consulting the health boards about this matter and I will be making a further statement about it in due course.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House for favourable consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the first occasion on which I have been in the House with the new Minister and I take this opportunity of wishing him success in his office. I have always found him courteous and helpful and I trust now that anything I say in this debate will be constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2105" /> Since I first came to the House in 1977 successive budgets showed a commitment to improving the living standards of social welfare recipients.  I am sure it will come as a shock and surprise &mdash; indeed it has to those dependent on social welfare &mdash; to find this Government within only a few months of taking office, having made so many promises before taking office, now showing themselves insensitive to the needs of the weaker sections of our community by introducing a budget and a Social Welfare Bill the effects of which will be to lower living standards.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to what the Minister had to say.  Early on in his opening statement he said: &ldquo;This Government have no intention of allowing the weaker sections of our community who are depending on social welfare incomes to suffer a drop in their real living standards&rdquo;.  Shortly after that statement we were told of the measures which will be introduced during the coming year and it is noteworthy that these measures will do the exact opposite of what the Minister stated.  He did say earlier that he hoped as a result of next year's budget to give further real improvements in social welfare payments but that is not in any degree helpful to those who are dependent on social welfare. Looking forward to next year's budget will not enable them to meet their commitments this year.  What is really important therefore is not expressing concern but rather showing performance.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member of the House every budget introduced significant improvements in conditions for social welfare recipients.  This is the first year since 1977 in which there is no real improvement for those dependent on social welfare.  If one might just enumerate some of the changes this year, pay-related benefit is reduced from 40 per cent to 25 per cent for the first six months and 20 per cent for the remaining nine months for all claimants from the beginning of April 1983.  The pay-related benefit waiting period is to be extended from 12 to 18 days, reducing the maximum duration of the new 25 per cent rate from 147 days to 141 days from April 1983. The pay-related benefit income floor, <Col N="2106" /> above which benefit is calculated, is being raised from £32 to £36 a week from April 1983.  The PRSI ceiling is being raised from £9,500 to £13,000.</P>
    <P>The pay-related benefit ceiling is also being raised from £9,500 to £11,000 and the maximum rate of benefit will be £46 a week.  The overall benefit ceiling for disability purposes will be reduced from 100 per cent to 80 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings for all claimants. Apprentices will be disqualified for children's allowance purposes from April 1983.  The maternity grant of £8 will be abolished from April next.  The flat rate unemployment benefit for all short-time workers will be reduced from three days to two days and pay-related benefit will be withheld from April next.  Small holders whose means are calculated notionally on the PLV system will not qualify for increased rates of unemployment assistance.  There will be a temporary 1 per cent levy on income and the levy will apply in the same manner as the youth employment levy.</P>
    <P>That is a list of some of the changes. All are designed to take away from social welfare recipients.  If one compares that with 1982 and the provisions in the budget of that year and in the Social Welfare Bill the rates of payment are being increased by 12 per cent for long-term and 10 per cent for short-term categories. Last year there was a 25 per cent increase in social welfare payments.  Free travel was extended to those receiving pensions from the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland.  Children's allowances last year were increased by 25 per cent. There is no increase in children's allowances this year.  Free telephone rental was extended last year to blind pensioners under 66 years of age.  The prescribed relative's allowance was extended to invalidity pensioners.  There was a double payment of child dependant allowances in September and again in December.  No provision for that is made in this year's Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>That is a comparison of the differences between the Social Welfare Bill before the House and the Social Welfare Bill passed last year.  When we consider the increase of 25 per cent allocated to social <Col N="2107" /> welfare recipients in the last three years it is some what difficult to accept that, with the present rate of inflation, the Government are prepared to provide only 12 per cent for long-term beneficiaries and 10 per cent for short-term beneficiaries this year.  With the increased cost of so many items since this Government came to power, especially the 5 per cent increase in VAT, it is obvious that the purchasing power of the money received by social welfare claimants will be greatly reduced.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment on the Minister's remark that many of those receiving payments would qualify for pay-related benefit in addition to the flat rate payment.  As a result of the provisions of this Bill many who would have qualified will not in future.  I am thinking in particular of those on short-time work and those who, through no fault of thier own, find themselves on disability benefit or are out sick.  Those people will find that they will not receive pay-related benefit for the first three weeks of their illness. That is longer than has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the economic difficulties facing all Western countries but we must bear in mind that society is judged by its attitude to its poorest and weakest sections.  It is important that social welfare recipients should have their income kept in line with inflation. That was made clear in Report No. 61 of the National Economic and Social Council which stated that levels of support for those most in need, and the degree of redistribution, within the community should at least be maintained in times of economic difficulty.  This year not alone will the increase not be in line with the cost of living but a new departure is to be introduced, to pay the increase from the end of June and the beginning of July.  In effect that means that for the year from 1 April long-term and short-term recipients will receive only 9 per cent rather than 12 per cent and 7½ per cent rather than 10 per cent respectively. In other words, they will receive the payments only for nine months of the year.</P>
    <P>The Government are withholding <Col N="2108" /> £39.3 million from old age pensioners, the disabled, the unemployed and recipients of other social welfare payments by the delay I have outlined.  Having regard to the increase in the cost of living we cannot accept that there should be such a delay in making these payments.  Those increases should operate, as in the past, from the beginning of April.  Inflation for 1982 averaged at 17 per cent and during that year social welfare recipients received a 25 per cent increase in benefit and allowances.  That amounted to a real increase in their standard of living.  Inflation by mid-April this year is expected to be running at an average of 16 to 17 per cent but by that time social welfare recipients will not have received any increase in benefits.  Had they been granted an increase from April those on short-term benefit would receive an increase of 10 per cent&mdash;inflation is running at 16 to 17 per cent&mdash;and those on long-term benefit would receive an increase of 12 per cent. It is hard to understand the Minister's statement this morning that the Government have no intention of allowing the weaker sections of the community who are dependent on social welfare incomes to suffer a drop in their real living standards. It is obvious that they will suffer such a drop in the current year.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 to 10 deal with pay-related benefit.  The ceiling for social insurance payments is being raised to £13,000 while the rate for benefit is raised to £11,000 thus creating for the first time a gap between the ceiling for payment and benefit. The Minister told the House that we proposed to raise the ceiling for payment to £13,000 and the ceiling for benefit to £11,000 but we did not propose at any stage the introduction of a 1 per cent levy.  Fianna Fáil, when formulating policy in power or in preparing the Estimates for 1983, did not envisage such a proposal. The effect of the payment of the 1 per cent levy, together with increasing the ceiling to £13,000, will create a problem for many workers.  Those on short-time work will receive two days social welfare benefit instead of three days when they are on a three-day week.  They will not receive any pay-related benefit while they are on short-time work.  The <Col N="2109" /> number of waiting days for pay-related benefit is extended to 18 days.  That means that those unfortunate enough to lose their jobs, or be absent from work through illness, will not receive any pay-related benefit for the first three weeks. In addition there will be a reduction from 40 per cent to 25 per cent in the pay-related benefit and an increase from £32 to £36 in the amount of income to be disregarded for pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>Those changes in pay-related benefit, together with the reduced payment for the three day week, against an increase of 10 per cent in the flat rate will mean that those who suddenly fall ill, or lose their jobs through no fault of their own, and the most needy will be severely penalised. We all agree that people should not earn more through social welfare payments when unemployed than they would earn at work but nevertheless it is important to take account of the difficulties facing those who through no fault of their own are unable to go to work.  For example, after 3 April a man or woman earning £9,500 per year, a net weekly income of £190 per week, will have £36 deducted from that figure as against £32 at present before calculating the pay-related. The pay-related benefit at present amounts to 40 per cent of that figure for the first six months, £63.20, but from 3 April pay-related benefit on £154 will amount to £38.50.  That is the difference which the change the Minister proposes will mean to those on pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>While we had proposals to reduce the amounts of pay-related benefit from 40 per cent to 30 per cent we did not propose the measures being introduced by the Government.  They are reducing pay-related benefit down to 25 per cent.  They have increased the income floor above which income is calculated from £32 to £36.  They have extended the waiting period from two weeks to three weeks, 12 days to 18 days.  Those were not part of our proposals and we are opposing sections 8 and 9 because we believe that this package put together by the Coalition Government is too harsh and will create undue hardship.</P>
    <P>I will give another example.  If our policy was implemented, on the third week <Col N="2110" /> of illness a man earning £190 per week would receive £47.40 pay-related benefit. Under the Coalition policy now to be implemented he will receive no pay-related benefit.  For the fourth and succeeding weeks up to 24½ weeks in the case of our policy he would receive £47.40 per week.  With what the Coalition Government are now going to implement he would receive £38.50.  Pay-related benefit is to be at 25 per cent for the first 141 days, that is 23½ weeks, where the former rate of benefit was paid for 24½ weeks.  At the end of the 23½ weeks pay-related benefit will be paid at 20 per cent.  Our proposal would include pay-related benefit of 30 per cent for the first six months reducing to 20 per cent for the next nine months.</P>
    <P>The proposal to extend the waiting period to 18 days is particularly hard on people who find themselves ill for three or four weeks.  This is common in Ireland and many of these people are having difficulty already in meeting their commitments. I find now from representations that a new type of person is coming along, a person who finds himself out of work through unemployment or through sickness and is unable to meet his commitments. If any Members of this House check with their own county councils they will find that for the first time the local authorities are having difficulty in getting repayments on SDA loans through the inability of people to meet their commitments. We must keep in mind when introducing legislation in this House people's ability to cope.  It was never part of our policy to reduce the payment of pay-related benefit by such amount as is at present before us and this Government must take full responsibility for those measures.</P>
    <P>Regarding the withdrawal of the maternity grant, as the Minister said, £8 is not much money nowadays and it is small compared with what a woman will lose through the changes in pay-related benefit in her maternity allowance. Women receiving maternity allowance will have their income reduced in the same way as those on unemployment and disability by the reduction of pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2111" /> There is no increase in children's allowance and no allocation for a double child dependant's allowance similar to those of September and Christmas last year.  Like other sections of the community, children do not appear to be high on the list of priority with this Government.  You have only to look at the selective method of imposing school bus charges and the more recent charges of £10 to persons applying for posts in the public service to realise this.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill is of great importance. The smallholder's unemployment assistance was introduced in 1966 because it was believed that ordinary unemployment assistance was a disincentive to increased farm output.  In 1980, 21,500 farmers received £22 million, that is about £20 per week.  Section 13 of this Bill will abolish the notional method of assessment and in future small farmers will be assessed on a factual basis.  It is hoped in the next three years to phase out the notional system altogether.  We are opposed to this section because we believe that there is need for a notional system or some similar method of assessing eligibility.  The Minister said this morning that the Attorney General had advised the Government that PLV was an unacceptable method of assessing eligibility but some similar way must be found.  Fortunately, we have moved away from the days of the small, uneconomic farms in the State, particularly in Connaught and right down the west coast from Donegal to Kerry when an investigating officer called to the house and counted the chickens and hens.  It is important to recognise that for very many small farmers this assistance was a very necessary supplement to income.  It enabled them to remain on the land to rear families in meagre comfort.  It would be most regrettable if as a result of factual assessment the small farmers were unable to survive on the land and had to relinquish their way of life.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this does not happen.</P>
    <P>Many Members of this House have campaigned at by-elections in counties where we have these very small uneconomic <Col N="2112" /> holdings, such as Donegal, west Mayo, Galway, Kerry and my constituency, Monaghan.  Members of this House will have seen small, uneconomic farms where the farmers do an excellent job to survive and to rear their families, but it is obvious that they are not making the type of income on which they could survive without some State support.  These people should have support on their very small holdings of less than £20 valuation as they are now.  Some other system must be found so that these people on the small, uneconomic holdings will get assistance from the State to ensure that they will be able to remain on the land. I ask the Minister to look at some other way if the Supreme Court finds, as the High Court did, that the PLV is an unacceptable means of assessing eligibility for these people.</P>
    <P>We believe that the scheme of assistance is necessary for small farmers.  It would be desirable if it could be linked to productivity, but it is difficult to see how this could be done.  The notional method of assessment should be retained and we would all agree that any abuses in the system should be eliminated.</P>
    <P>Speaking about the supplementary welfare allowance, the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Under existing legislation, local authorities are obliged to meet a share of the expenditure on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards. The balance of the expenditure on supplementary welfare allowance is met by the Exchequer.  The local authorities are obliged to recoup the health boards the full cost of administering the scheme.  There is no provision for an Exchequer contribution to these costs.</P>
    <P>The Minister further stated that regulations will be introduced by the Minister for Social Welfare in consultation with the Minister for the Environment and with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The time has come when we should look closely at the financing of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  There has been an ongoing problem between the local authorities and the <Col N="2113" /> health boards in relation to the transfer of funds and there is a case for financing this scheme directly from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see in section 16 an extension of the occupational injuries benefit scheme to trainees in schemes approved by the Youth Employment Agency.</P>
    <P>There are abuses of the social welfare system, some of which the Minister highlighted this morning, and it is important that they be stamped out.  While abuses should be sought out, our prime concern must be to ensure that those in need of and dependent upon social welfare payments should receive those payments on time and in the correct amounts.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, before taking up that office, stated in Tullamore, County Offaly, on Sunday, 14 November last, that research suggested that abuse of the disability benefit scheme was costing the taxpayer £70 million per annum and that this sum was increasing.  One might question that figure, but nevertheless it is agreed that we must eradicate abuses.  I would hope that the philosophy behind this Bill is not the result of the Taoiseach's research into abuse of the social welfare system.  Misuse and abuse of the system are separate issues but they must not be dealt with by the introduction of harsh measures which would have an effect on so many honest and decent people at a time when they are most vulnerable.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is a very serious problem. I believe that as a result of the policies of this Government it will continue to rise.  The Government should research the effects of unemployment on family life.  There are now 188,000 people unemployed who would prefer the dignity of work rather than to be indebted to the Government for their weekly payments. It is essential to tackle the unemployment problem and the Government showed a defeatist attitude when they increased the estimate for unemployment assistance by £31 million.  It is much more important that they should come to grips with this very serious problem and get people back to work.</P>
    <P>I should now like to make some comments on schemes administered by the <Col N="2114" /> Department.  I would ask the Minister to examine the national fuel scheme.  Many of those who are entitled to benefit under this scheme do not receive their vouchers until well into the winter and in some cases until the winter is almost over.  I am not sure that the categories listed by the Department help to make this scheme as fair as it might be.  I have known people in receipt of UK pensions, having no other source of income, who were turned down because they did not fit into any of the required categories.  Similarly a person was turned down who was in receipt of an American pension which was not above the old age pension in this State because she had a source of income other than an Irish pension.  The fuel scheme is valuable but it is important that those who need fuel vouchers should receive them.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that this Bill does not contain any extension of the very human provisions made in previous years, such as an extension of the prescribed relative's allowance which was made last year to invalidity pensioners. Not only is this a very human scheme but it is also very economical.  A son or daughter or other close relative of an ill person wishing to stay in the community who gives up a job to care for that person should benefit under the prescribed relative's allowance scheme.  This is particularly so where the patient is terminally ill.</P>
    <P>Another question which is becoming more pertinent is the length of time a person receives disability benefit before being transferred to the invalidity pension. Obviously it is to a person's advantage to be in receipt of an invalidity pension if he or she is permanently incapacitated.  One sees numerous people who are in receipt of disability benefit for many years before being transferred to the invalidity pension.  This is an area which should be examined.</P>
    <P>I had the pleasure of working in the Department of the Minister of State for a few weeks before the last general election. I had great respect for the officials there for the manner in which they attended their duties.  Is our system geared to the rapidly escalating number <Col N="2115" /> of unemployed we have to cater for? Some of the buildings around the country were never intended to cater for such large numbers.  Is there sufficient staff to deal with the large number?  The Minister should look at this immediately.  It is important that claims for unemployment assistance are processed much more rapidly than they are at the moment.  Some way must be found to improve the system whereby a claim goes through the branch manager, to the supervisor, back to the social welfare officer, up to the central Department in Dublin.  It is unreasonable to expect a person to wait an undue length of time for what that person is entitled to.  It leads to serious problems for families where there is no income and they have to go along and look for supplementary welfare allowances.  I hope the Minister will have a look at this.</P>
    <P>We also have the frustration of young people turning up at employment exchanges for a number of weeks and finding their money has not arrived.  This needs to be attended to.  There should be more decentralisation in relation to unemployment assistance.  More decisions should be made on the spot.  One of the problems facing any Department, particularly Departments like Health and Social Welfare, is the question of control. Members have a serious responsibility to ensure that the moneys voted are spent correctly.  I believe in those two Departments the emphasis must be on service rather than on control.  If decisions in relation to the payment of unemployment assistance were made at local level by the supervisors and then monitored through the Department so that there was a standard throughout the State this would be one way of ensuring that those dependent on unemployment assistance received it at an earlier time than they do at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister said this morning that the real value is greater than the face value. I find it hard to understand that, having read through the Bill and listened to the various changes he announced this morning. He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2116" /> The rates of social insurance benefits in this country can be compared favourably with those payable in Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>He went on to state the standard rates in Great Britain.  He converted them into punts and said they were equivalent to £27.30 for a single person and £44.17 for a married couple, compared with £34.80 and £57.35 here.  There is one very important point which is that the cost of living is much less there than it is here as a result of the policies pursued by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Ceann Comhairle is very much aware of what I am about to say because his constituency is beside the Border. When the price of petrol was raised by 36p a gallon in this State in the first two months of this year that caused many people in the Border counties to cross the Border to buy petrol at a cheaper rate. The reason for the difference is the taxation imposed by the Government.  When those people cross the Border to buy petrol they do their shopping there for convenience.  It has been estimated that in the Border counties the State, apart from all the people depending on business along the Border counties, will lose £150 million in revenue as a result of trade across the Border.  This is very serious for the Border towns.  Concern is expressed every day of the week by chambers of commerce and various traders.  I have been told that the sales of wholesalers going to that area have dropped alarmingly in the last two months.  There was a time when one could stand up and say that we were proud of the fact that our social welfare benefits were greater than those in the UK and Northern Ireland.  I am afraid, having regard to what is happening every day of the week in the Border counties, that we cannot say that any longer.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated this morning:</P>
    <P>I might add that the previous Government had similar proposals to restrict the benefits available to short-time workers and intended to bring them in from January 1983.</P>
    <P>We did not have any proposal to reduce <Col N="2117" /> the pay-related benefit down to 25 per cent for the first six months, we did not have any proposal to increase the level above which the benefit is calculated from £32 to £36 and we did not have any proposal to increase the waiting time from two to three weeks.  We did not have any proposal whatsoever to introduce a 1 per cent levy.  That is an entirely new proposal.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the Minister is making £500,000 available to voluntary bodies and I hope this will be a feature of his policy in the coming months.  The voluntary bodies make a very valuable contribution to society.  Very often they are in the right place at the right time to offer help to those with problems.  It is only right that the State would support these voluntary bodies especially in times of recession and of undue hardship.  I am confident that the health boards will decide on the ideal way in which the £500,000 should be spent.</P>
    <P>The previous Government were committed totally to the needy sections notwithstanding the difficult economic circumstances that prevailed.  We gave the highest priority to maintaining and advancing the social provisions for the needy and the disadvantaged.  Our priority in this House must be always to ensure a basic standard of living for those who must depend on social welfare payments, both in terms of income and of services. We would have expected any self-respecting Government to grant increases in this area that are at least in line with inflation but this is not the case. We will be opposing the Bill generally. We are unhappy also that these payments are not being made until 29 June.  The changes in the pay-related benefit are much too severe and will create hardship for many workers.</P>
    <P>We are opposed to section 13 which abolishes the notional system of assessment in determining eligibility for smallholders. There must be some system similar to the notional system if we are to ensure that the very small and uneconomic farmers, particularly along the west coast, are given assistance.</P>
    <P>On many occasions members of the Government have expressed concern for <Col N="2118" /> the less well off but unfortunately those expressions are not being matched with performance so far as this Bill is concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It ought to be said at the outset that this is a difficult Social Welfare Bill for any Minister to introduce in the sense that because of the state of our public finances and of the great recession in which we find ourselves, it has not been possible to make some of the financial improvements to the social welfare code that many of us would wish to have made.  However, it is difficult for one to sit here and witness the crocodile tears shed by Deputy O'Hanlon for what he refers to as the failure of the Government to make the type of improvements that were made by previous administrations. The Deputy referred specifically to improvements incorporated in the Social Welfare Act, 1982.  That Act included some significant changes in the social welfare code but effectively these improvements were the same as those prepared by the previous Coalition prior to the General Election of February 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be made clear that the responsibility for the state of the economy, for the current budget deficit, for the massive recession in which we find ourselves and for the gigantic increase in the numbers out of work rests firmly on the shoulders of the Fianna Fáil Administration who <Col N="2120" /> were in office between the period 1977 to 1981.  We should not mince words in talking about this.  The profligate and irresponsible economic policy, if it could be described as such since it was more significant from our point of view of the absence of policy, followed during those years lies at the root of our present difficulties.</P>
    <P>Any measures this Government must take in a period of deepening recession and of increasing unemployment are dictated by the failure of that previous Fianna Fáil administration.  I have come in here constantly and pleaded with Members not only of the Opposition but of my own party to deal with issues in a constructive way instead of merely trying to score party political points but the fact remains that our present difficulties derive from the failure of the Fianna Fáil administration I have referred to.  These difficulties were exacerbated by the failure of the Government who were in office from February 1982 to November 1982.</P>
    <P>There is imposed on this Government the duty, in the interest of all of us, of restoring our finances to some sort of sensible order and of tackling the major problems which confront us.  We have an absolute duty to ensure that we do not make notional improvements in our social welfare code and produce what can be described at best as happy money &mdash; in other words, money improvements which on the surface look real but turn out to be meaningless, either because through Government policy inflation rapidly increases or this country rapidly heads into a state of bankruptcy and our currency becomes worthless.  We have a duty to restore economic credulity to Government policy.  We also have a duty to ensure that those who are badly affected by the present recession are fully and properly protected.  That financial protection must be related to the state of the economy, the public finances and what they can bear.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to increases over a period of three years in the region of 25 per cent per annum in social welfare payments.  The reason for those increases is obvious to anyone following the country's economic progress <Col N="2121" /> over the years.  Firstly, during the initial period 1977 to 1978 some of the social welfare payments fell behind the rate of inflation.</P>
    <P>Not all of these increases commenced in April.  It was the practice of the previous Fianna Fáil Government to increase social welfare payments from the beginning of July rather than the beginning of April, so there is nothing new in that practice.  The increases, in real terms, did nothing other than maintain the value of social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>With reports produced, one can examine present social welfare payments in the context of those made at the start of the seventies and see that with the rate of inflation since then, basically, they maintain living standards.  There have been no real improvements, but it is part of the party political argy-bargy of this House for different Governments, parties and Ministers to try to convince the general public, themselves and, indeed, the media, that they are making real increases.  There have been innovations, new welfare benefits, a providing for people in different areas who were not formerly protected by the social welfare code; but, in real terms, the rate of payments has not greatly increased in the context of the general economy over and above what people received many years ago.</P>
    <P>It is not enough for Members of the Opposition to criticise the Bill before the House and the Minister for not providing all sorts of additional payments for people in different areas, or for curtailing in certain cases social welfare payments, without providing coherent or constructive suggestions as to how the financial savings which are part and parcel of the provisions contained in this Bill can otherwise be attained.  This party political point-scoring and nonsensical political approach has been seen here over the years from all sides of the House.  It does no credit to the Members.  We have now gone beyond the stage where Members can simply criticise legislation which has a financial content, which not merely provides finance to assist people in need but which is financed by the taxpayers.  It ill behoves any Member to criticise the <Col N="2122" /> effect of such legislation on the recipients without also looking at the position of those who are paying for that legislation. If legislation is part and parcel of Government policy to keep the current budget deficit at a permissible level and if particular aspects of that legislation are open to criticism &mdash; in particular aspects which can effect some form of economies &mdash; it is not sufficient for any Member to criticise them <i>simpliciter.</i> There is a duty on the public representative to indicate what alternative options are available to the Government of the day.  It is no use washing one's hands of the problem, saying &ldquo;This is an interesting issue.  Here is a Minister who might be criticised.  We might be able to get at the Government, so we will criticise it.  No doubt we will get great press publicity and many people will congratulate us for our criticism.&rdquo; Negative criticism is a discredited approach which has got this country into its present mess.  Constructive criticism, suggesting alternative options, alternative ways of tackling problems, is well worth making and can form the basis for constructive debate and, indeed, the implementation of policy.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will not discuss this measure simply in terms of Members on the Government side saying that it is a fine Bill which one ought to support and Members of the Opposition saying that it is a terrible Bill which one ought to oppose, all feeling that they have done their duty.  We have a far greater duty than that, and it is in the area of constructive suggestions in the context of constructive policy.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon said &mdash; and I am paraphrasing his remarks &mdash; that by making this additional money available for unemployment benefit assistance the Government are giving up on the problem of unemployment.  That is a part of the party political battle engaged in in this House, an Abbey Theatre approach to political issues.  We make funny comments in the hope that somebody outside the House will give us a round of applause for them.  The problem of unemployment faces everyone in this country.  It was not tackled credibly by the previous administration who laid the foundation for that <Col N="2123" /> problem.  Senator O'Donoghue, well before I was involved in party politics, said that unemployment would be solved by him and would no longer exist.  The Fianna Fáil administration, during the period 1977 to 1981, laid the foundations for an unemployment problem of a nature not experienced here during my lifetime.</P>
    <P>This problem is so serious that it will not be solved overnight and for Members to suggest that it will is being totally unrealistic and irresponsible.  The problem has a major structural base to which the party opposite contributed, and they could offer no credible policy for tackling it.  In the Estimates published prior to the November election, Fianna Fáil provided during the course of 1983 for an unemployment rate of 177,000, basing the financial allocation for the Department of Social Welfare on that number. Deputy O'Hanlon criticised the Minister for providing additional funds for unemployment benefit and allowances.  When that Estimate was fixed, we had reached in 1982 the rate anticipated for 1983. Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the fact that there are now 188,000 on the live register, as it is called.  There are 10,000 more in March of 1983 than the Fianna Fáil Government estimated would be the overall figure for the entire year of 1983.</P>
    <P>This Government, in existence since November 1982, have not created 188,000 unemployed.  The suggestion implicit in some of Deputy O'Hanlon's remarks that that was the case is another illustration of the nonsensical arguments engaged in in this House.  We need a constructive approach.  It is recognised by everybody outside this House which party laid the foundations, by their policies in Government, of the present rate of unemployment.  But that problem will not be tackled if we simply engage in mutual recriminations in this House.  I hope Deputies opposite will not start engaging in the type of fiction that our present problem has been created or caused by the present Government.  That is nonsense; they know it is nonsense. Presumably they hope that if they say it often enough somebody somewhere <Col N="2124" /> might believe them.  In the course of his remarks the Minister indicated that in 1982 the total expenditure in respect of the payment of unemployment allowances and benefits came to £381 million. In 1983 it is calculated that we will be spending approximately £473 million in this area.  These are enormous sums of money.  The amount that will be spent this year will be equal to half the current budget deficit.</P>
    <P>We must start looking anew at the manner in which we deal with unemployment, at the manner in which we deal with unemployment allowances and benefits, at the manner in which we tackle these problems.  Whilst we had rates of unemployment far lower than obtain at present it became accepted &mdash; as it has in other areas of the social welfare code &mdash; that the way to deal with the problem was to provide social welfare allowances or benefits to provide assistance for those people unfortunate enough to find themselves unemployed, to ensure that they and their families maintained some standard of living, albeit not reflecting the standard of living they would expect were they in employment.  In other words, it is generally accepted that we simply hand out funds.  We are now reaching the stage at which the level of funding being paid out requires an innovative approach in dealing with this whole area.  In talking about funds being handed out I would not like what I am saying to be taken wrongly.  All of those in receipt of unemployment benefit are people who, by their contributions over the years, have contributed to the creation of funds to permit these benefits to be paid out; they have contributed through the taxation system to these benefits and they are entitled to them as of right.  I do not think anybody should take a different view.</P>
    <P>In the context of a country whose basic infrastructure is not fully or properly developed, in the context of a country that does not have sufficient funds fully and properly to fund local authorities and the basic structural services that are required to attract employment, the time has come for innovation.  We need to ascertain whether there is some way that <Col N="2125" /> the 188,000 unemployed and the £473 million that will be paid in this area this year can be marshalled in the interests of improving our structural base and in the interests of the people themselves.</P>
    <P>I have not yet met anybody who wants to be unemployed.  There is a great myth abroad that some people deliberately render themselves unemployed so that they can reap the benefits.  There is certainly a problem and I shall come to that in the context of some of the short-term benefits that are taken up but, in general, nobody has ever said to me, &ldquo;I would like to be unemployed for the next six months so that I can get benefit&rdquo;.  That does not happen.  The vast majority of people want employment for the sake of their self-respect, they want to feel they are contributing to their community, they prefer to earn money for work done than to receive money through a social welfare system, even though they are entitled to such moneys through their own and their families' contributions made over the years, through taxation and social welfare, when in employment.</P>
    <P>The problem we have also is that there are many people unemployed who want employment in particular areas only.  In some of those areas there may be no employment opportunities, not merely this year but for a number of years. Unemployment does not affect only the younger section of our community, though this is a major problem in the under 25 age group.  Unemployment is now affecting the community right across the board.  It affects many in the 40 to 50 age group who, having been made redundant, or whose employers have gone into liquidation, feel desperate, feel there are no opportunities available to them, certainly not in the short-term, of getting employment again.</P>
    <P>We need to get across to many people who are unemployed the desirability of widening their horizons in the context of the type of work they may be willing to undertake.  There is a need, through constructive discussion with the social partners, the trade unions and employers, to ascertain whether a means can be found whereby many of those people at present in receipt of unemployment benefits and <Col N="2126" /> allowances could contribute in some way, through employment, to the State and to the improvement of our basic infrastructure, or indeed contribute through their own work in some other areas.  The time has come for us to reconsider our approaches in these areas.</P>
    <P>Lest anybody take me wrongly I am not suggesting &mdash; and no doubt somebody might caricature what I am saying into this &mdash; that people should get unemployment benefit only if they go out and do what was done in the Famine, dig roads, or lay roads in parts of rural Ireland where there is no traffic anyway.  I am not suggesting that.  The point I am trying to make is that I feel there are many people at present unemployed who are entitled to their benefits but who would welcome the opportunity &mdash; in return for the allowances and benefits they are receiving &mdash; to make some contribution to the community, to the State, or to tackling the major problems confronting us.  I do not believe people can be required compulsorily to make such contribution.  If some forms of work schemes were devised, if there was some form of incentive to partake in such schemes, there could be major benefits for the State.  Indeed, in the interim period while we are tackling the unemployment problem, the contribution that could be made in this area could itself make a unique and important contribution in coming to terms with our difficulties.  I do not believe the answer will emerge by increasing annually the sums of money we pay out.  I believe many people now would start to take the view that there should be some way in which the time of many people could be employed &mdash; people at present in receipt of unemployment benefits and allowances &mdash; thereby making some contribution. I believe many people would welcome such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>However, this type of approach would not work without the co-operation of the trade unions and employers, indeed without the State sector looking at itself very seriously to ascertain in what way contributions of this nature could be made.  I believe many unemployed people would welcome an opportunity to do something <Col N="2127" /> other than find themselves at home, with no job and no prospect of a job.</P>
    <P>There is need for innovation in other areas also.  There are at present people receiving unemployment allowances and benefits, some of whom would wish, having found it impossible to obtain employment to start up small businesses or become self-employed.  They often find themselves in what can be described as a Catch-22 situation.  They know that while they are making themselves available for employment they will receive their benefits or allowances and they know that if they start to work even as self-employed persons, they will have to advise the Department of Social Welfare and the Department will cut their allowances or benefits because they are no longer available for employment.  If they succeed in establishing a business in which either they work themselves or at some future date become employers, they will not benefit because they will no longer be entitled to payments from the Department. The Department will no longer have a liability, and those people will become taxpayers again, as will the people they employ.</P>
    <P>Many people who are unemployed are starting to take up work as self-employed people but because they are unsure of the financial consequences of what they are doing do not tell the Department, and quite understandably they continue to draw social welfare allowances or benefits for periods because if they did not do so they could not support themselves or their families.  In doing that they are of course in breach of the social welfare code and they are liable to prosecution by the Department who seek to reclaim some social welfare money paid to them from the time they started their businesses. Therefore, this provision provides a disincentive for unemployed people to take up jobs of their own as self-employed persons, because is there any point in risking the possibility of not succeeding in business and risking loss of social welfare payments, causing starvation to themselves and their families over a period of months?</P>
    <P>We need to have another look at this. <Col N="2128" /> We must ensure, of course, that the social welfare code will not be abused, but we must also ensure it is not a disincentive to the creation of jobs, a disincentive to employment and to thousands of people who are unemployed but who might otherwise take the initiative themselves to provide jobs for themselves, thus refusing to continue to rely on the possibility that the private sector or the State at some stage will provide them with jobs. The Minister and the Government should examine seriously this area to see if some modifications could be made to our social welfare code to permit a person who is unemployed to advise the Department that he intends to start his own business. Many such people start in a small way, operating out of their homes, possibly as decorators, window cleaners or providing secretarial services or a telephone service for businessmen who do not have such a service.  Many people might set up small businesses, some of which mushroom and some of which do not.  Such people should not feel that if they take the initiative they will have the option of knowing that if they continue to draw social welfare benefits they might be prosecuted, or if they refuse to do so and they do not draw social welfare benefits they will be left without funds of any kind.</P>
    <P>There should be a procedure whereby an unemployed person who wishes to start on his own could notify the Department of his intention, to do it honestly and openly, and be given a period of grace from the Department during which time he would continue to receive a benefit or an allowance, say for a period of three months during which time his business could be monitored by the Department. At the end of the period such a person would have the duty again to notify the Department and advise the Department whether he meant to terminate his self-employment and continue to receive the benefit or allowance, or whether he wishes to continue the business because it was proving successful.  I do not foresee any major difficulty in doing this.  It would remove the disincentive that exists which prevents many people unemployed from taking the initiative.</P>
    <P>We have a growing black economy, <Col N="2129" /> part of which is composed of people in receipt of social welfare benefits who are also in employment in some way or another.  The area I have been talking about is part of that back economy.  I am sure we all have in our constituencies people who are receiving unemployment benefit and who at the same time are trying to establish jobs as self-employed people.  A system like that which I have been suggesting would provide incentives to unemployed people to become self-employed and in the long-term it would save money for the Department.  Many of those people would much prefer to deal with their financial circumstances in an honest way with the Department.  I believe such a scheme could work.  It is part of the new approach we should begin to look at.  We should begin to look at our unemployment benefits and allowances not simply as cash hand-outs. There should be a more sophisticated view of the situation.  It is something that could be welcomed and could create employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a provision in the Bill which was criticised by Deputy O'Hanlon, although I suspect he agrees with him.  I refer to benefits for short-time work.  In certain circumstances, due to the way in which PRSI and unemployment benefit schemes are administered, people in employment in some sectors of the economy would often be better off working three days a week and then taking benefits for two days.  This has been said by many people inside and outside the House.  It is something that needs to be tackled and I welcome the fact that the Minister is tackling it in the Bill.  It is causing a major problem of absenteeism in some industries.  In some sectors of the economy, by habit or by tradition we have built up in the last two or three years the practice of workers regularly appearing at work for only three days a week and taking unemployment payments for the other two days.  They do that because at the end of the year they would have a larger sum of money in their pockets than if they had gone to work every day or made themselves available for work.  It is a real problem because in some areas of employment people will not work unless <Col N="2130" /> they are permitted to behave in this way. We are talking about a small minority of the work force.  Let us not exaggerate.  It is not suggested it is happening on a widespread scale, but it is a significant minority of the work force.</P>
    <P>It is happening in particular in certain industries.  In recent weeks we heard a great deal about the difficulties being experienced by the construction industry. They are very real difficulties, and nobody should suggest otherwise. Despite the difficulties in the construction industry, despite the fact that a number of workers who used to be employed in that industry are unemployed at present, many small building firms find it impossible to employ workers unless they employ them in certain ways.  There are no specialist workers available to carry out certain jobs in the construction industry unless the employers agree to employ them for three days only so that they can collect benefit for the other two days.  I have come across a number of instances of employers who require skilled workers but cannot get them unless they are willing to collude with them in providing some form of short-time work when the employer wants a full week's work done on the job.</P>
    <P>We have another problem which is not particular to the construction industry but is applicable generally to some of the small builders within the construction industry.  It is impossible for them to get skilled workers in certain areas unless they pay cash through the black economy.  This is one of the great ironies in the context of the unemployment problem we have.  We actually have workers with particular skills in certain areas of the economy who are not willing to work on a proper basis, to receive their wages, pay their taxes and make their social welfare contributions.  The incentive for them to behave in this way in the context of short-term benefits is provided by the fact that you can get a larger sum of money in your hand by working part-time than by working full-time.  To the extent that this Bill will tackle this problem I welcome it and the provisions contained in it.</P>
    <P>There is one other problem in this area <Col N="2131" /> and one particular firm got publicity over the past few days.  Due to economic difficulties a firm have been forced to operate a three-day week.  When the viability of the firm has improved and larger orders have been made available to enable them to return to a five-day week, the workers they wish to bring back to a five-day week look for compensation due to the fact that they would lose out by working a five-day week because of a reduction in their net take-home pay by virtue of the fact that they would no longer receive unemployment benefit. That system cannot be upheld, and I hope the provisions in this Bill will tackle that problem and prevent this type of abuse of the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to another area of unemployment benefit and redundancy payments which the Minister should tackle.  This area needs to be tackled if workers who find themselves unemployed are to receive protection under our social welfare legislation.  Vast numbers of workers on the PAYE system have their tax and social welfare contributions deducted from their wages on a weekly or monthly basis by their employers. The employer is under a statutory obligation to deduct these moneys and pay them to the State.  The employee has a statutory duty to permit the employer to behave in this way.  The employee is entitled to presume that the employer will deal with such funds deducted from his gross salary in the way he is obliged to deal with them by statute.  The employee is entitled to presume that the moneys are being handed over by the employer to the State.</P>
    <P>The employee on whose behalf the employer deducts this money is entitled to presume that, if through no fault of his own, he becomes unemployed because the firm employing him goes into liquidation, or redundancy arises, the deductions from his weekly or monthly wages have been properly made and entitle him to receive benefits and redundancy payments for which the deductions are supposed to cater.  I am afraid that is not always the position.  A disturbing number of employees find upon losing their jobs <Col N="2132" /> that moneys deducted from their gross wages by employers have not been paid to the State.  They discover that their social welfare contributions have not been paid to the State.  Having been in employment for many years, they discover that, rather than being entitled to unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit, all they can get is the reduced unemployment allowance.</P>
    <P>This problem needs to be tackled seriously. In the Bill the Minister is changing some of the provisions in the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, which relate to this area.  He is changing the criminal penalties and the statutory provisions for prosecution.  In itself the prosecution of the employer will provide no great help or assistance to the unemployed person seeking to support his wife and children unless he is assured of getting the benefits to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of different provisions in the 1981 Act, some of which will be amended by this Bill, which seek to ensure that the employee who becomes unemployed will receive payment.  The reality is that they do not work properly. They do not appear to be properly supervised. They certainly do not provide employees with the type of protection to which they are entitled in the light of the fact that these moneys are deducted at source by the employers.  There is no way in which they can monitor regularly what the employers are doing with these moneys to ensure they are going to the State, unless the employee is to contact the Department of Social Welfare regularly, or inspect his employer's books, or ask the employer to show him the cheque he is passing on to the Department, which of course would be a nonsense.</P>
    <P>There are a number of statutory provisions relating to this area, some of which are totally unrealistic from the point of view of an employee who finds himself redundant or unemployed.  If an employer has defaulted on making payments to the Department of Social Welfare, the employee can sue the employer through the courts for a simple contract debt and try to recover the money.  I do not think we have too many people in the 188,000 unemployed who feel they have <Col N="2133" /> sufficient funds available to them to employ lawyers, solicitors, senior counsel and possibly junior counsel, to sue an employer for moneys of this nature if they discover the employer has not handed over the money.  This is a legal mechanism which is unrealistic.  It does not provide any assistance in real terms for an employee who finds himself unemployed or redundant and who needs immediate funding to support himself, his wife and his children.</P>
    <P>Under the legislation the Minister has power to prosecute the employer.  This Bill is increasing those powers and making them somewhat more sophisticated to get around some of the anomalies which exist in the 1981 Act.  The problem is that these powers will not necessarily help the employee.  If the employer is prosecuted he can be liable on conviction to pay the total moneys deducted from the salary of his employee and he can also be liable to a term of imprisonment, but if he has spent the money that is of no help to the employee.  If we expect workers in the PAYE sector to co-operate in the deduction of payments of this kind they are entitled to an assurance, if they become redundant or unemployed, that the redundancy payments, the pay-related payments or the unemployment benefit to which they have contributed will be paid to them.  It is not their fault that the employer did not pass on the payments to the State.  If a small group of employees become unemployed or are made redundant and apply to the Department for benefit, they can find themselves on unemployment allowance for one or two years if the Department tell them that their employer has not passed on the contributions they have made.  It could happen that these workers will never receive the pay-related payments to which they are entitled.  This is partly due to the fact that the Department do not, and presumably cannot, police adequately the social welfare code to ensure that contributions which are deducted are paid.  We need new mechanisms and a more efficient monitoring service to ensure that employers hand over moneys on a regular basis and that we do not <Col N="2134" /> have the scandal of moneys not being handed over by major or minor companies for a few years.  There is need for a far more sophisticated monitoring system.</P>
    <P>The problem at the moment is that, if the Department do not prosecute, an employee who has been paying contributions for five or ten years and which have not been handed over to the State can be stuck with an unemployment allowance payment much less than the amount he would otherwise be entitled to legally.  He can be left in receipt of a sum of money that makes it impossible for him to support his family adequately and to meet his financial commitments.</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, provides that a Minister may make regulations to provide for treating contributions deducted by an employer but not paid as paid for the purpose of rights and benefits where it is shown that the employee did not connive or was not negligent in the context of the failure of the employer to pass on the contributions to the Department of Social Welfare.  For this provision to be activated the consent of the Minister for Finance is required, but it is my understanding that there have not been any departmental regulations to activate this section.</P>
    <P>We should look at this matter seriously. If an employee can properly prove he was in insurable employment, that he was getting wage slips showing deductions and that through no fault of his the employer had failed to hand over money to the Department, if the Department knew they were under an obligation in the circumstances to make payments to the employee regardless of whether they had received the contributions from the employer, we would have a far more efficient operation by the Department of monitoring the receipt of social welfare deductions from employers.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to compare the way an individual employee will be treated as against a large group of employees who find themselves in difficulties.  In recent weeks there was considerable publicity and discussion regarding the position in Carrigaline where a number of employees <Col N="2135" /> found that deductions made had not been passed on to the Department. Under the 1981 Act &mdash; I am open to correction on this by the Minister &mdash; once the payments had not been made the employees were not entitled to receive unemployment benefit or pay-related benefit.  I am not an expert on the problems that existed in Carrigaline but my understanding is that the Minister indicated that, despite the fact that payments had not been received by the Department, arrangements would be made to make the payments to which the workers were entitled.  That was an exception made for a relatively large number of employees in a situation that became a matter of public controversy.</P>
    <P>However, an individual employee or three or four employees in a small firm cannot get the same type of publicity as that given to the Carrigaline situation. They are not in a position to put the same kind of pressure on the Department of Social Welfare and I found that to be the case with regard to individual constituents of mine.  An individual employee who finds himself in this situation is not treated in the same way as the workers at Carrigaline are being treated.  I am not saying they should not be treated in this way, but if an employee is having his money deducted at source and if the employer is under an obligation to make the payments, there is an obligation on the Department to monitor the position and to ensure that the payments are received when due, not two or three years later, or in some cases not at all.  An employee has no way of monitoring on a weekly or monthly basis whether his employer is passing on the deductions to the Department.  An employee could not undertake such a task: he would probably alienate himself from his employer. Indeed, the vast majority of employers comply fully with their statutory obligations: we are talking about a small minority who do not so comply.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this matter.  The Department have not been as efficient as they should have been in ensuring the collection of contributions that are deducted at <Col N="2136" /> source by employers.  As a result, the State has not received money to which it is entitled.  I should like to know how much money has been deducted by employers in recent years which has not been sent to the Department.  That would indicate the level of efficiency in the Department to deal with the matter.</P>
    <P>I said in previous debates that essentially the social welfare code has developed piecemeal during the years.  We tend to identify groups who are in need and to provide for them without undertaking a comprehensive examination of the social welfare code and the philosophy or basis on which it is decided that payments should or should not be made in the context of social welfare assistance.  The Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, was a very useful and important measure in that it consolidated in one document all social welfare enactments before that date.  However, it did not provide for any major or basic reforms.  It is very valuable as a document for reference to the social welfare codes.</P>
    <P>We need to examine the philosophy behind which we make social welfare payments in different areas.  If we did that we would find there is no real consistency behind it and that we often discriminate against one group and favour another.  We do this for no other reason than that one group succesfully agitated in public for assistance and the other group either were not so successful or kept quite about their difficulties.  I know it took many years to prepare this consolidation Bill due to the amount of legislation in this area but we are now two years further on.  A number of social welfare Bills have been enacted since then. We should not allow ourselves to go back to the position we had pre-1981 when there was a labyrinth of social welfare Bills.  The legislation had become so complicated that nobody understood the way the Bills interacted.  The Minister might seriously consider providing, by way of an administrative instruction in his Department, that every five years a new consolidation Bill should go through the House.  If this was done the Department officials would not face the same difficulties as they experienced in putting the <Col N="2137" /> 1981 Bill together.  That was a very useful exercise and the officials in the Department deserve great praise for it.  If it was the practice to have a consolidation Bill every five years it would not take up the time of the House unduly and would simplify the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>To return to the point about the payments we have and the lack of any philosophy behind them, this applies particularly to the area of marital breakdown. In the seventies we had a scheme to provide financial assistance to wives who had been deserted by husbands and who were unsupported by them.  This was deserted wife's allowance.  In 1973 we introduced deserted wife's benefit which provided for payment of a sum slightly in excess of deserted wife's allowance to wives who were deserted by husbands who were not contributing towards their support.  The benefit was payable on the basis of social insurance contributions made by the husband or wife over the years.  A wife in employment can receive the benefit whereas to receive the allowance a wife cannot be in employment. She can earn a small sum of money but cannot be in general employment with a normal income.</P>
    <P>In those days the chief bread winner was always regarded as the husband but this is no longer the case.  The philosophy behind the payment of deserted wife's allowance and benefit was that a wife and mother unsupported and deserted by her husband requires a basic income to meet the family's requirements and to support herself and her children.  That philosophy was correct.  However, the argument equally applies to husbands who are deserted by wives and left to support young children.  We have many instances of this.</P>
    <P>During the seventies many people highlighted, including myself, discriminations against women in the legal system and the need for reform in a very wide variety of areas including the social welfare code.  In tackling many of the problems which affect women, wives and mothers, we have introduced discriminations against men, husbands and fathers, which have no rationale and which create real financial difficulties for a number <Col N="2138" /> of people.  These have not been fully recognised by Members of the House.</P>
    <P>In 1972 the Commission for the Status of Women reported and said there was great need to tackle a large number of areas affecting women.  Only a portion of those have been tackled.  We could just as justifiably establish a commission for the status of men to deal with some of the discriminations which affect husbands who are deserted by their wives.  I am not in favour of establishing any more commissions in this area.  We all know the problems but we are not tackling them.</P>
    <P>The position of a deserted husband left to support young children is different from that of a wife.  I have come across cases where husbands were left with three or four children.  His salary was adequate while his wife was also an income earner or was looking after the children at home. I do not want to be interpreted as saying that all wives should always be at home looking after their children.  While the wife was at home assisting the husband or earning an income with him they were able to support themselves and their children adequately.</P>
    <P>In the seventies we tended to believe that it was always husbands who deserted wives but in reality wives also desert husbands and leave them with young children. The husband is left with young children and wishes to maintain his home, look after the children and keep the family together.  As it is a single parent family, a deserted husband like a deserted wife requires the assistance of someone else, be it a relative or friend to look after the children during the day when he is at work, or he may have to employ somebody to look after them. How many husbands find that with a wife gone, their income is such that they cannot afford to employ someone, without assistance from the State, to look after their children?  When the wife's contribution is no longer there they find themselves in an impossible financial position. A number of husbands in those circumstances, if they wish to have their children living with them and do not wish to create a situation where, due to the absence of a husband and wife, their children might be placed in care, have to do one of two <Col N="2139" /> things.  They either give up employment and rely on social welfare payments or do additional work which involves them being away from home, creates more financial problems and also affects their relationships with their children.</P>
    <P>A husband who has to give up work to look after his children at home will receive, through the social welfare code, a far lower sum of money for his support and that of his children than a wife who is deserted by her husband and looking after the same number of children.  If there is a need for a deserted wife's allowance and benefit, as I believe there is, there is equally a need for a deserted husband's allowance.  I do not think anybody in this House should be in any doubt about that.  There is absolutely no logic in having one without the other.  It is creating discrimination and contributing to social problems.  It is a problem that was tackled in this House in the early seventies before I became a Member, but only in the context of wives.  It is also a problem that needs to be tackled in the context of husbands.</P>
    <P>Presumably, like any extension of the social welfare code, it would cost the State money.  At present it is estimated that this year an estimated £15 million will be paid out through the Department of Social Welfare on deserted wife's allowance and benefit payments.  I do not know whether it would require a further £15 million to meet the problems of husbands in this area.  I suspect it would not because there are fewer husbands in this situation although their number is significant. It is impossible to calculate the financial cost of reforming present legislation to introduce a deserted husband's allowance because when I put a Dáil Question to the Minister for Social Welfare asking if his Department had any relevant information or statistics from which he could ascertain the number of husbands in this situation, that information did not exist.  It is a problem the Department of Social Welfare has never even considered or discussed.</P>
    <P>Some of these husbands get assistance through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme but nothing has been <Col N="2140" /> done by the Department to monitor this problem and to see what the cost would be if we amended the law in this area.  If the Department do not tackle this problem we will continue to create major problems in a country in which the Constitution affords protection to the family although, apparently, the protection extends to mothers but not to fathers. There is no justification for that.</P>
    <P>The position of a deserted wife or unmarried mother in receipt of a deserted wife's allowance or an unmarried mother's allowance is similar to that of the person in receipt of unemployment allowance.  A wife in receipt of the deserted wife's allowance is entitled to earn a small sum of money and still receive the full allowance.  If, through her employment, she increases the sum she is earning, the allowance will decrease. The problem is that many wives have employment open to them and could supplement their incomes, which they badly need to do, but are frightened to take up such employment because the work would often do nothing more than generate the same net income that they would get if they remained on deserted wife's allowance.  The form of these allowances provide a disincentive to single parent families from helping themselves and prevents them from supplementing the income they get through the deserted wife's allowance or the unmarried mother's allowance.</P>
    <P>Someone in receipt of deserted wife's allowance or unmarried mother's allowance should be entitled to earn a larger sum that is at present possible whilst also being in receipt of these allowances.  If their income from both brought them into the taxation area the State would then benefit from that system.  I do not think we should penalise the deserted wife or the unmarried mother in receipt of one of these allowances who asserts some independence and earns money to assist her in supporting her family.  There is no logic in the inbuilt disincentive to work in the schemes that puts great pressure on deserted wives or unmarried mothers and prevents them from assisting themselves.  The effect of this often is that a deserted wife or unmarried mother will <Col N="2141" /> not take part-time employment because they fear losing their allowances.  If financial problems arise they look for additional payments through the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>There are basic structural problems in our social welfare code and they act as disincentives in the context of unemployment. They act as disincentives in the creation and obtaining of employment and, in the context of deserted wife's allowance and unmarried mother's allowance, they inhibit wives and mothers from going out to work to increase the income of their families.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Hanlon's remarks in relation to the free fuel scheme.  That scheme has been with us for many years and there is no logic in the way it works.  People who live in the old borough or urban areas are paid on a different basis from those who live in corporation areas.  There is no coherent philosophy behind the scheme.  There are no statutory mechanisms behind it.  It is administered partly by the Department of Social Welfare and partly by the health boards and through local authorities in the context of schemes operated through corporations.  It has many discriminations attached to it and creates a great deal of injustice to many elderly people.  For example, in my constituency the boundary between the city and the county runs along the centre of the road, elderly pensioners living on one side of the road are entitled to free fuel and elderly pensioners in exactly the same circumstances living on the other side of the road are not entitled to it.</P>
    <P>Everybody who is a member of a local authority has long recognised that the scheme is inadequate, illogical and discriminatory. It should be reformed and there should be some proper statutory basis on which payments are made rather than payments in portion being made as they are at present.  I hope the Minister will look at the free fuel scheme and replace it with a more logical, nationwide scheme that does not discriminate against people purely on the basis of which side of the street they happen to live.</P>
    <P>Referring to the need to ensure that we retain the social welfare legislation in <Col N="2142" /> a consolidated fashion, the same should be said for the enormous number of statutory instruments that are made under our social welfare laws.  I do not think anybody could ever suggest that they have a comprehensive understanding of the social welfare code.  So many statutory instruments have come into force affecting it right across the board, and the vast majority which preceded the 1981 Act still remain in force under that Act.  There is an urgent need to carry out the same type of work on the statutory instruments that have been made under social welfare legislation.</P>

      <P>As the Cork-Dublin pipeline has been successfully completed I now intend to move ahead as quickly as possible to consider the supply of gas to other population centres where this can be done on an economic basis.  My first priority will be to look at centres with existing town gas industries since these should be in a better position to achieve the kind of rapid market expansion required to maximise sales in the premium market.  If such developments are proceeded with the next logical step would be to consider expansion of the grid to centres, which although not having the advantage of an existing town gas industry, are close enough to the Cork-Dublin pipeline to justify connection.  Mallow is among the centres which will be considered.</P>

      <P>Natural gas is the ideal fuel for the food processing industry due to its low cleaning content.  Is the Minister aware of that?  Instead of fiddling around with pipes all over the place, will he concentrate his work on food processing, an industry which is so much neglected and under such stress and strain?

      <P>In the case of the towns mentioned, Clonmel alone has an existing town gas system.  Both Bord Gáis Éireann and the Clonmel gas management have carried out engineering and economic studies to define the works necessary for a successful supply to and conversion and development of the Clonmel gas system.  The latest engineering study of the Clonmel system was made available to my Department last week and discussions to clarify certain details will be held this week. Subject to satisfaction in these discussions, the way will be clear to have a decision taken by the Government on the proposal to link Clonmel with the Cork-Dublin pipeline.  However, the general commercial and administrative arrangements for running the smaller town gas companies are not yet decided.  The development of natural gas in provincial centres provides an opportunity for participation by the private sector.  Where it is likely to prove economic, a joint venture of private interests, local and national, and public bodies, local and national, will be considered.</P>
      <P>For the other towns mentioned, their prospects of developing a proposition to earn an allocation of natural gas clearly depend on the success which attends the plans to bring natural gas to centres which have town gas systems and the technical and economic considerations relevant in each case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The recent successful completion of the Cork-Dublin pipeline represents the first stage in the development of gas from the Kinsale field.  Consideration will now be given to the extension of supplies to other premium market areas where this can be done efficiently and economically.</P>
      <P>My next priority is to consider the extension of supply to provincial centres which have existing town gas industries, provided of course that it can be demonstrated that it is technically and economically viable to do so.</P>
      <P>The extension of supply to other population centres such as Tralee, north Kerry, County Meath, Galway and the west of Ireland which do not have an existing supply of town gas may be examined in the longer term.  It would not be realistic to assume a likelihood of supply for several years.  I must emphasise that proximity to the main trunk pipelines will be a major factor in determining whether or not it would be economic to supply natural gas to a particular area.</P>
      <P>As part of this staged development, I will also be examining the feasibility of extending supply to suitable industrial enterprises along the route of the main trunk pipelines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now agreed that the south, east, and perhaps the north of Ireland will benefit substantially as far as bills for domestic and industrial use of natural gas are concerned, and that the west, according to the Minister, will not benefit from this national natural resource.  Would the Minister agree that, consequently, the west is at a promotional disadvantage because of his decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be realistic about this matter.  The two major population centres are Dublin and Cork and it is simply economical and, indeed, technically possible to bring a supply of natural gas to these major centres because they have existing gas utilities there.  The logic of the development of a gas grid for the country must take into account the existence of such gas utilities.  It may, in <Col N="2157" /> fact, be uneconomic and not feasible to bring natural gas as far west as I would like.  It would also be dependent on future gas finds either in the south or off the west coast.  This is something which is down the line.  We must be realistic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister recognises that there is an imbalance in the situation as far as natural gas is concerned.  Would he then be agreeable to recommending a preferential price structure for other sources of energy until such time as there is a find of natural gas off the west coast?</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that, for future industrial development in Kerry, it is essential to have a spin-off of natural gas into the county, that otherwise industrialists will not be interested in investing there?  Last December I was given a commitment that a survey would be possible within 12 to 18 months.  I understand now from the Minister that it may take some years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong of me to say that a supply of natural gas would be brought to Tralee or to north Kerry in the short-term.  That is not possible at this time.  In reply to a number of questions I have outlined the development of a natural gas grid for the country. We must accept that the gas find itself is <Col N="2159" /> limited.

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern of the Deputy.  At this time there is a supply of natural gas in Cork city and Dublin.  Discussions are taking place with regard to an onward supply to Belfast. The Government are also agreeable, in principle, to bringing a supply of natural gas to Limerick and Waterford cities where there are gas utilities.  When that phase is completed we can then think of other areas for a supply of natural gas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I must stress that, in replying, the Minister said that premium market areas within proximty of the trunk line would receive favourable consideration for a supply of natural gas.  I assume that when the trunk line is passing from Dublin to Belfast, County Meath and in particular Cement Roadstone and Tara Mines in Navan, both of which need it very badly, will receive favourable consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to any application by an industry it must be borne in mind that the pricing policy in relation to natural gas is that which is related to heavy fuel oil prices.  Therefore each industry or company must consider economies in their own operation by converting to natural gas.  It may very well be that a conversion to, say, coal would be more economic.</P>

Secondly, I might remind the Minister &mdash; just to keep the record straight &mdash; that it was the previous Government who took the first steps to bring natural gas to the western seaboard by deciding to go to Limerick and indeed to Clonmel and Waterford?  Thirdly, would he not agree that there is need for decisions to be taken so that advance planning can be done to ensure that the crews there &mdash; who did such an excellent job on the Cork to Dublin line &mdash; are fully occupied, thereby ensuring that the job will be done efficiently?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not seem to have the right evidence so I am giving this for his information.  Is he aware there are industries in that area that will not survive unless there is some relief given to them?  If there is no quick decision to send the pipeline there, relief will have to be given through easement of the hydrocarbon tax.  I am sure the Minister is aware of the serious situation that has arisen there because of energy costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy when he expects to sign the contract, which has already been negotiated, for the supply of Kinsale natural gas to the North of Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations are continuing at ministerial and official level for a supply of Kinsale natural gas to Northern Ireland.  The two Governments involved have agreed, in principle, to a supply of gas being made available subject to agreement being reached on satisfactory terms.  The current negotiations are directed at defining and clarifying the terms of sale which had been agreed in general terms.  Subject to agreement on the issues now under discussion, I would then request Bord Gáis Éireann to enter into a supply contract with the appropriate purchasing authority in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister be more specific and tell us exactly what is the position?  Last May, agreement in principle was reached in Stormont Castle between Mr. Butler and me.  Is the Minister now saying that the terms are being disputed, that new terms will have to be negotiated?  Is there some deviation from the terms negotiated and approved by the previous Government last August?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Discussions are continuing in that regard.  Of the 11 heads of agreement, six have been agreed together with one of the three annexes. The remaining five heads of agreement and the relevant annexes cover more crucial areas, such as the date of agreement, <Col N="2167" /> transmission, capital contributions, escalator and currencies.  They are matters of a complex nature which will need a lot of negotiation in order that a fair deal is done for BGE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to five heads which are not agreed.  I suggest to the Minister that before I left office agreement was reached.  Who is trying to change the terms of that agreement?  Not only was the capital cost agreed and the escalator, but the terms of the contract were agreed. The total supply was agreed.  The Minister is now trying to say that somebody is trying to change them.  Who is trying to change them?  Is it our Minister or the Minister up there?</P>

In the Chair's opinion that virtually excludes it from being dealt with in depth at Question Time.  The Chair has no control over the way questions are answered.  The Standing Order says that supplementary questions both as to relevance and to numbers are in the discretion of the Chair.  I am exercising that discretion now.  I am giving one further supplementary to Deputy Reynolds on this matter, and then I am passing on to the next question.  Normally we deal with 25 to 30 questions in the hour allocated to Question Time.  Today it looks as if we will deal with less than half of that number.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if, in view of its importance as a major opportunity for North-South economic co-operation, he will outline the present state of negotiations for the construction of a bulk coal carrier by the Belfast shipyard of Harland &amp; Wolff for the conveyance of coal to the ESB generating station at Moneypoint, County Clare; and if he will make a statement on the Government's attitude to this project.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my assumption of office I have given this matter detailed attention.  A number of possible options linked to the coal carrying contracts for the ESB which might have resulted in the placing of a ship-building order at Harland &amp; Wolff were very fully explored. Contacts were made with the various interested parties, including the new managing director of Harland &amp; Wolff. I regret that the conclusion reached was that the potential financial penalty in placing a coal carrying contract, on the basis of a ship order being placed in Belfast, was too high, especially considering the time that would be necessary to secure firm tenders.  Had it been possible to obtain terms for an order that would reduce this penalty to an acceptable level, the outturn might have been different.  I <Col N="2174" /> intend in relation to further coal carrying contracts, to follow up the matter and the contacts made.</P>

      <P>I shall be very brief. May I ask the Minister of State if he would agree that the transferring of this question from the Taoiseach to whom it was originally put to himself indicates a lack of interest by the Taoiseach in this matter which is of fundamental importance to North-South economic relations? Secondly, will the Minister of State indicate if the ESB, in contravention of all the desirable aspects of this matter, went ahead unilaterally and placed a contract with a Japanese shipping firm to the value of US$23 million without any benefit resulting to this country out of the placing of that contract?</P>

      <P>The first part of the question relates to the transferring of the question.  The Taoiseach has, of course, a great interest in this matter.  I should like to refer the Leader of the Opposition to a letter he, as Taoiseach, sent to Deputy Cluskey, dated 23 April 1980 which dealt with the transferring of a question from the Taoiseach's office to another relevant Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to answer the first part of the question.  In a letter the then Taoiseach laid out quite clear reasons for transferring questions.  There are two paragraphs to which I would like to refer.  The first is as follows:</P>
      <P>Where such questions relate primarily not to statements made by me but to matters which are the responsibility of other Ministers they will, in accordance with well-established procedures, continue to be transferred to those Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The other paragraph states:</P>
      <P>The practice of addressing questions to the Taoiseach of the day on matters which, while he may have spoken about them, are statutorily the responsibility of a particular Minister would, if acceded to, lead to Question Time becoming totally imbalanced and could have serious consequences for ministerial accountability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the basis on which the question was transferred to my Department and I think Deputy Haughey should accept it was proper to have it transferred.  In relation to the second part of his question, I am not at all satisfied with the manner in which the then Taoiseach's Department handled the whole matter. The ESB opened their tender procedure for the shipping of coal in April 1982.  No action was taken by his own adviser until July 1982 when the matter was well <Col N="2176" /> advanced.

I asked if the ESB unilaterally proceeded to place a contract for the shipping of coal to the Moneypoint station with a Japanese shipping firm at a cost of US$23 million without any benefit ensuing to this country and thus set at nought all the negotiations with the Harland &amp; Wolff Company?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The cost of placing an order with the Harland &amp; Wolff Company would have been prohibitive.  The ESB, acting within their own statutory responsibility, placed the order for the coal-carrying contract with the best tender.  In doing so they protected themselves in relation to any further retendering <Col N="2177" /> process which would have had to be entered into and which would have caused not only a long delay but which would have opened up the possibility of a cost penalty of many millions of pounds if any other procedure had been taken by the ESB.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>When the House <Col N="2221" /> adjourned for lunch I was referring to certain aspects of our social welfare legislation and the need for reform.  I made reference to the anomalies which exist in the context of deserted wife's allowance and deserted wife's benefit being available to wives who are deserted and left with dependent children but no such allowance being available to husbands.  I urged the Minister to consider reforming this area of our law and to seek the possibility of introducing a single parent allowance which would not discriminate on grounds of sex but which would deal with the real needs of single parent families. I hope it will be possible for such an allowance to be introduced and that the Minister will give serious consideration to it.  It would greatly ease the difficulties and burdens faced by many single parent families.  I referred to the fact that the basis on which the present allowance is paid is totally discriminatory and has little rationale attached to it.</P>
      <P>In the context of the present economic climate the supplementary welfare allowance scheme the Minister briefly referred to during the course of his speech has a particular role to play.  Under this scheme payments are available as a right in particular circumstances but there are payments of discretionary nature which supplementary welfare officers or community welfare officers can make in certain circumstances.  I have no doubt that in the context of the difficulties being experienced by many families who are affected by unemployment additional assistance will be sought by them through this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two problems with the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which I urge the Minister to tackle.  I have representations from some of the officers employed as supplementary welfare officers or community welfare officers and from many people who have made applications under the scheme.  The problem from the point of view of the recipients relates to the manner in which the scheme is administered and from the point of view of those who administer the scheme the controls which are exercised over them through the Department of Social Welfare.  Applicants seeking assistance <Col N="2222" /> frequently complain that it is very difficult to get any of the discretionary payments the Government empower the supplementary welfare officers to make available in a variety of different needy circumstances.</P>
    <P>Those administering the scheme complain they are hampered by Departmental guidelines.  It is suggested that these guidelines are in conflict with legislation relating to the supplementary welfare allowance.  It appears there is a real problem here.</P>
    <P>For some reason unknown to me the Department of Social Welfare under successive Governments regard these guidelines given to community welfare officers as matters of such great national importance that they cannot be made available to anybody else.  There is no Member of the House, to my knowledge, who has available to him a copy of the guidelines. I am aware of the fact that members of different health committees including the one with which I am involved, the County Dublin health committee, sought copies of the guidelines directly from the Department.  They have been refused. This is particularly strange in view of the fact that the scheme is effectively administered through the health boards.  The health boards cannot have access to guidelines relating to a scheme administered by them and controlled by the Department of Social Welfare.  There is a suspicion that the content of these guidelines differs substantially from the content of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Community welfare officers find themselves in an invidious position.  As employees of the State they are reluctant to act contrary to the guidelines but know that in complying with the guidelines which I understand came into force during the course of the Fianna Fáil administration of 1977-81 and have remained in force under successive Governments since, they are actually in breach of their statutory functions under the social welfare supplementary allowance legislation.  They come across instances where under the legislation they have discretion to make payments to people in need of such payments but <Col N="2223" /> their interpretation of the guidelines is that it is strongly suggested through the guidelines that such discretionary payments should not be made.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to recognise the fact that there is a need to remove the social welfare code from the aura of mystery and mystique which surrounds it. Decisions on administering all aspects of social welfare law are made by officers employed by the Department.  Often reasons are not given for decisions taken particularly when applications for allowances or benefits are turned down. People who are refused benefits or allowances are suspicious that they are being done out of an entitlement.  There is a need to remove the aura of mystery which surrounds the manner in which the Department administer allowances and benefits.  The refusal by the Department to publicly make available the guidelines used by all officers administering the scheme is a classic example of the secret approach which is adopted in this and all other areas.  It is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary.  If the Act is being properly administered and the guidelines comply with the legislation, there is no reason why they should not be made publicly available.  By not making them available suspicion is created in the minds of the public.  It puts health boards, who are responsible for the administration of the scheme, in an impossible situation.  They are supposed to exercise political responsibility for the manner in which the scheme is administered, but have to do it with their eyes closed because they are unable to see the guidelines used by their own officers.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to arrange for these guidelines to be made available to each Member of this House, because we all get queries from constituents about the supplementary welfare allowance code.  It is indefensible that these guidelines have not been made available to members of this House.  I also appeal to the Minister to make available copies of decisions or judgments of a general nature on social welfare applications by deciding officers.  In the United Kingdom a whole body of law has developed relating <Col N="2224" /> to the social welfare code.  People there can clearly see what their entitlements are and ascertain, with or without professional advice, whether a particular claim would be successful and how people making claims in similar circumstances were dealt with.  We have never arranged for publication of decisions of this nature.  This adds to the secrecy surrounding the operation of our social welfare code.  It is in everybody's interest to know how legislation passed through this House is administered and that it is fulfilling the functions for which it was originally intended.  It would also help us to be aware of anomalies and problems that arise and to press for reforming legislation when it is required.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to payments made available through the Department of Social Welfare to tenants of formerly rent-controlled dwellings whose rents have now increased as a result of legislation and who are in need of financial assistance to make the increased payments fixed by the District Court.  There is a great deal of confusion about this scheme.  Elderly people feel threatened and upset at the sudden and rapid increases in rents they have to pay for homes that many of them have lived in for decades.  They are not aware of provisions that are available to assist them in meeting these extra rental payments.  The type of payments available should be publicised and all Members of this House should be given the fullest information about the criteria being used in the making of these payments.</P>
    <P>A special effort should be made to ensure that the availability of these payments is communicated to those who are most in need of them.  The Minister might even consider using the good offices of his colleague, the Minister for Justice, to ensure that district justices, when fixing new rents, make it known to a tenant whose rent is increased that they may seek social welfare support in making the compulsory higher payments.  I am sure I am not the only Member of this House who has received representation from constituents who have to pay increased rents and are uncertain of what to do.  I have received representations from many <Col N="2225" /> constituents who were unaware of the fact that there was any assistance available to them.</P>
    <P>In our present financial predicament there is little room for major innovations in our social welfare code.  However, there is a great deal of room for manoeuvre in reforming aspects of our existing social welfare laws that are discriminatory and where removing them would not cost the State large sums of money. If we made available to the public the method of deciding social welfare applications, publication of decisions, and made available the supplementary welfare allowance guidelines, it would do a lot to assure them that our social welfare legislation is being properly administered. We must get away from the secrecy surrounding its administration.</P>
    <P>Many families are feeling the effects of the severe economic recession and those who have never sought assistance in the past are now doing so.  I know the officers employed by the Department try to deal compassionately with people seeking assistance, but in some instances that compassion is lacking.  There is often a great delay in replying to correspondence from members of the public &mdash; as well as from Members of this House &mdash; who are trying to ascertain why their application for assistance has been turned down.  I would like to see the Department operating more efficiently than heretofore. The Department is probably under more pressure now than in the previous decade but there is a need to ensure that people who are in distress and dependent on the social welfare system are treated with compassion.</P>
    <P>I agree with the closing remarks of Deputy O'Hanlon that the social welfare code must be regarded as a service available for those in need and entitled to assistance.  There must be a crackdown of abuses in the code and we must ensure that the minority who abuse the social welfare code are not used as an excuse by the deciding officers to behave as if the vast majority are applying for benefits to which they are not entitled.  The concern of the Department of Social Welfare, once the statutory provisions are enacted to make the benefit available, <Col N="2226" /> should be to ensure that those entitled to allowances should have them paid to them.  On occasion it seems the concern of the Department is to split hairs and, if there is a 50-50 decision due to legislative anomaly, all too often one feels the Department err on saving an extra few pounds for the State rather than acceding to the application.</P>
    <P>We should all of us, whether in Government or in Opposition, remember that the Department of Social Welfare is a service Department designed to provide assistance for those entitled to it under the laws made in this House.  I would hope that in the coming year, which will inevitably be a difficult year, all those who seek assistance, and who are entitled to it, will be granted it.  I hope that those of the general public who query decisions made by the Department because they feel they have not been properly dealt with or badly dealt with will have their inquiries swiftly and sensibly replied to in a humanitarian and considerate fashion.  I look forward in the years ahead to the Minister implementing at least some of the reforms that have been suggested.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is part and parcel of the budget provisions announced in February and can only be regarded as an attack on the old, the unemployed, the sick and the pregnant. I intend to go into some detail to show why I consider that to be case but, before doing so, it is essential to make the point that social welfare policy cannot be divorced from the rest of Government policy in other areas.  The attitude displayed in other areas of Government will obviously be reflected in the approach we have to social welfare recipients and Government policy towards them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach of the present Government seems to be one of battening down the hatches and hoping against hope that the present recession will come to an end in the USA and in Europe and that the proverbial tide in the affairs of men will save all our skins.  To me that is no policy at all.  If a Government have any purpose in a modern State it must be that of <Col N="2227" /> planning the economy, no matter how distasteful that may be to the free enterprise lobby which seems to control the two major parties in this House.  Planning must be more than simply accepting the existing state of affairs and hoping to manipulate as best the Government can the resources within a collapsing economy.  Even if we accept for a moment the approach of the present Government, which concentrates on balancing the books, in my view they are even failing in manipulating the resources within those terms of reference.  They are failing to implement their declared concern for the less well-off.  In fact, they are reneging on that concern because they are reluctant to tackle tax evasion and tax fraud, twin evils in our society today and, as a result, they find themselves in the position that they must take from the weakest sections in our society.</P>
    <P>In the recent general election the Labour Party manifesto indicated that social progress must not stop in times of economic difficulty.  An adequate social system must be paid for and the burden spread more widely.  They also said social welfare expenditure must be maintained in line with the cost of living.  This Social Welfare Bill moves away from that position and moves to a point where the Government hope to maintain social welfare benefits and expenditure in line with take home pay, not in relation to what it costs a person to live but in relation to average take home pay, the take home pay apparently of the average industrial worker.  That, again, is reneging on a solemnly made promise at election time.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, when negotiating for joining the present Government the programme arrived at between the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party indicated, as is indicated in this Bill, that unemployment and disability benefit would be kept in line with take home wages and salaries.  Here we now have a dilution of the Labour Party principle and that is now being extended to all social welfare benefits despite the fact that the joint Fine Gael/Labour programme stated that expenditure on social welfare benefits would be maintained in <Col N="2228" /> ment are moving away now from what they declared themselves to be in favour of three or four short months ago.  That is why I say the Government are reneging on their promises to the less well-off in our society.</P>
    <P>The sharpest cuts in this Bill have been made in relation to the ill, the unemployed, those on short-time working, and those claiming disability, maternity or unemployment benefit to whom pay-related benefit was also payable.  The position now is that these people can lose anything up to £20 a week on benefits for which they paid over the years.  Some of the increases indicated, the 10 per cent for short-term and 12 per cent for long-term benefit, may in real terms amount to an increase of only 2½ per cent.  In some cases there will be a net loss of 20 per cent in real terms.</P>
    <P>This whole Bill is an attack on those least able to carry the burden of the present recession.  The present pay-related benefit is calculated on the basis of a person's gross weekly earnings from 1981 to 1982.  Not only will the Government be cutting pay-related benefits completely for those on short-time but the benefit is being related to a year which is up to 12 months old.  It is not related to their current earnings and that results in a cut in income.  The combined effects of all the apparent minor adjustments will be far harsher than most people realise. In some cases people will lose up to £20 per week.  It is most unsatisfactory that people who have paid for pay-related social insurance should now be faced with the fact that they will not get this insurance. The idea when it was introduced was to enable people to ensure against short time working, unemployment or illness and it is questionable if the Minister has a legal right now to deprive these people of these benefits.  If private insurance tried to do this it would be definitely deemed to be illegal and there would be a legal remedy for persons so affected.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the greatest conflict of all in the present social welfare code is the decreases which will be brought into effect at the beginning of April and the fact that increases which have been given <Col N="2229" /> to various categories will not come into effect until the end of June &mdash; a gap of three months.  Fianna Fáil have made political points in complaining about that kind of activity when they had imposed similar things themselves and they have done so in relation to pay-related benefit for short-time workers.  Not alone did they include that in Estimates for the year, but in <i>The Way Forward</i> they indicated very clearly the trend which they intended to pursue, and that was one of the reasons why they ultimately lost power last November.</P>
    <P>There is need for a rethink in relation to social welfare and what exactly it is all about.  The last speaker, Deputy Shatter, indicated that it was a service &mdash; and of course, it is &mdash; but it is a service which the people who are working in this State are paying for either by PRSI contribution or general taxation.  They are not getting something for nothing.  It is entirely improper for any Minister to come into this House and say, &ldquo;Right, you have paid for this but you are not going to to get it because we need the money for some other activity&rdquo;.  It is a common approach of Deputies in this House to say that there is no such thing as a free dinner, and of course there is not.  We are all aware of that, but there is the question of how effective the Government are in taking in or collecting or ensuring that those who can afford to pay for various services are paying for them, that those who can afford to pay a greater share in income tax are paying that share and that those who have been levied are paying that share which they have been levied.  I refer in particular to areas of the population who pay a very small proportion of their income in income tax compared to others in order to pay for the running of this State.</P>
    <P>In answers given to me recently in this House by way of written reply the Minister for Finance indicated that the PAYE worker on average is paying £1,600 a year in income tax while the farming sector are paying an average £550 per annum. That is taking the average over those who would not pay any tax in the normal run of things and those who pay a great deal more tax than the average figures indicate. <Col N="2230" /> Those figures indicate gross inequality in the way that income tax is levied.  Further figures indicate a fall in the return from inheritance tax.  I will read out some figures.  As a percentage of total taxation, income tax rose from approximately 25 per cent in 1972-73 to 30 per cent in 1982, while capital taxes fell for the same period from 3.5 per cent to 2.2 per cent.  Taxes on company profits rose slightly from 3 per cent to 4.7 per cent, mainly from the increase in the number of companies in existence, while at the same time taxes on inheritance and gifts as a percentage of total income tax fell from 1.9 per cent to .3 per cent.</P>
    <P>To put that in perspective in terms of cash, in 1972-73 the real value of taxes on inheritance and gifts was £8.6 million while in 1982 in real terms the value of tax on inheritance and gifts fell to £2.1 million.  That is a clear indication of the type of approach pursued by not just the present Coalition.  The Coalition were in power from 1973 to 1977 and a decline in inheritance tax commenced in that period.  The decline continued while Fianna Fáil were in office from 1977 to 1981 and continues to the present day. Despite the fact that wealth tax, property tax, capital acquisitions tax and all such taxes declined, at the same time income tax on PAYE earners is rising and those who are least able to meet the present recession are being asked to take a cutback in their earnings.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the present Government are taking the wrong line completely in relation to social welfare.  At a time like this, because of increasing levels of unemployment &mdash; and therefore sickness seems also to increase &mdash; greater amounts of money need to be made available for social welfare purposes.  I would accept the argument that no money is available if I could see a realistic effort being made by the Government to tackle those areas which are not paying their share of the taxes.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech makes an extraordinary admission that something like 11,000 companies in the State have not to date paid their PRSI contribution to the Revenue Commissioners for up to two years.  That is entirely unacceptable <Col N="2231" /> on two levels.  First of all, to allow companies to act in that fashion gives them the edge over those companies who are efficient in operating their enterprises. The PRSI contribution and the tax which are being withheld are being used as a form of cheap loans.  It is unsatisfactory that companies which are inefficient and unable to meet their commitments should be allowed, using State funds in this way, to compete with companies who are paying their way, paying their share of running the facilities in this State.  The social welfare provisions would be acceptable if all efforts were being made to raise more money elsewhere but clearly that is not being done and it would appear from the general approach of the Government that they have no intention of seriously going after those who are not paying their share.</P>
    <P>The introduction of PRSI in this area was an advance in our social code and it appears that a start has been made at dismantling that code.  The ICTU said last night in a statement that it would appear that this Government are going to out-Thatcher our friends across the water.  The whole approach of the Government is one of hoping that things will get better.  It is clear, from answers which I have received in the last few days to questions in relation to unemployment and Government policies in that regard, that the Government, effectively, have no answers.  They are forming committees here, there and everywhere and have no clear idea how to deal with the present recession.</P>
    <P>I do not hold with the view that unlimited funds are available at any time for social welfare benefits.  Clearly, all the services provided by the State must be paid for from some source or other.  The State must take control of the economy and utilise the available resources, using the millions collected in taxes from the workers to invest in those available resources.  I am talking about direct Government involvement in industrialisation. Unless the Government become involved in that area, there will not be enough money for any of the existing services.  It is pointless for Ministers to <Col N="2232" /> say that they do not have the money. They are failing to collect money which is available from people who are in a position to pay and at the same time misusing the available resources.</P>
    <P>We have referred frequently to our belief that private enterprise has failed to provide for the industrialisation which this State needs.  So long as the present approach is adopted, that will continue to be the position.  So long as hand-outs are given to private industry, regardless of how they use that money, and so long as it is thought easier or more palatable for Governments to take money from those on social welfare and more and more money out of the pockets of the PAYE sector, instead of adopting a realistic, progressive approach to industrialisation, we will this time next year be discussing further cuts in social welfare benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to confine myself to two aspects of the social welfare system and the proposals contained in this Bill, in so far as they affect the scheme of unemployment assistance for smallholders.  I am firmly convinced that the decision-making process within the Department of Social Welfare should be decentralised.  I have the strongest objection to the proposal to discontinue the notional method of assessment of smallholders' means for unemployment assistance purposes.  The notional system up to now has been based on the poor law valuation of the land.  The High Court judgment of 30 July 1982 declared that the PLV system is no longer applicable as far as the relationship between the quality of land and its value in different parts of the country is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should, and must, as a matter of extreme urgency, get an alternative notional system in place of the poor law valuation system.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that provision is being made for the discontinuance of the notional method of assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes by reference to the rateable valuation of land.  This memorandum states that the section provides that persons assessed under the notional <Col N="2233" /> method of assessment will be entitled to unemployment assistance on the present basis of calculation until such time as their means can be assessed on a factual basis.</P>
    <P>The Minister, when introducing the Bill this morning, informed the House that the valuation system would be phased out within about three years.  At the same time, he said that about 2,000 cases would be means-tested or investigated within the next three months.  How will those 2,000 cases be selected for reassessment, as one must bear in mind that there are 14,000 smallholders receiving unemployment assistance under the notional system.  Over the past month or six weeks, certain smallholders in certain parts of south Kerry have been means-tested. They cannot understand why they were selected for reinvestigation while other smallholders in similar, or better, circumstances were not selected.  Some people think that anonymous letters are being submitted to the Department of Social Welfare and to the local social welfare out of petty jealousy, or perhaps, motivated by political reasons. Social welfare recipients should have their entitlements reassessed under a fair, sensible, regulated and widely-accepted system, rather than haphazardly as at present, which is setting the trend for investigations over the coming months.</P>
    <P>The background to this scheme of unemployment assistance for smallholders is important.  This scheme was brought into operation following the report of a commission set up to investigate and recommend ways and means of improving the lot of the smallholder in the 12 western counties and to suggest ways and means of enabling them to increase production on their holdings. This scheme, known as the small farmers' dole scheme, first came into operation in 1965.  I recall, on coming first into this House in 1966 that it was operable then on a six-monthly basis during the winter months only, but it was extended in 1967 to cover the entire year.  We know the thinking behind this scheme.  It was that smallholders who were unable to make a living on their holdings should be assisted <Col N="2234" /> in order to keep more people on the land in those 12 western counties.  The idea was that a scheme of unemployment assistance would be provided for such smallholders.  Under the means-tested system any smallholder who improved his holding or acquired additional stock would have his unemployment assistance cut or substantially reduced; thus the incentive to improve a holding or increase production would be lost.  We know what that scheme meant to smallholders in the west and south-west.  We know also what this scheme meant to local communities, to the small towns and villages in each of those 12 western counties.  It meant that local villages become viable which, in turn, led to increased business in small towns in those western counties principally because those smallholders were able to expend this money sensibly in increasing production, improving their holdings, thereby generating increased spending in local economies which in turn benefited those communities.</P>
    <P>We must also bear in mind &mdash; and this is very significant &mdash; that the population of the 12 western counties, with the exception of a few isolated areas, increased substantially in the years 1971 to 1981.  I have no doubt but that the assistance available under the small farmers' scheme played a vital role in not alone maintaining that population but in its increase.  It is a wellknown fact that smallholders who might otherwise have had to close their doors, emigrate or sell their holdings and move to Dublin in search of employment, for the first time under this scheme, were able to concentrate on their small holdings, get married, have a family and play a vital role in the development of their local economies. This was a scheme that operated very successfully.  I know there were abuses to a certain extent as the years progressed when more and more people came within its ambit, as social welfare increases were granted in successive budgets and as the valuation theresholds were raised.  But in so far as 80 to 85 per cent of smallholders were concerned it played a vital role in enabling them to provide for themselves and their families, <Col N="2235" /> to keep bread on the table, so to speak, during the winter months.</P>
    <P>The Government must devise an alternative to the PLV system for that scheme. Indeed it is in the duty of the Government to devise an alternative notional system. It is not easy for an Opposition to come up with an alternative.  I believe that the production unit accounting system, as recommended by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association, and detailed in a revised January 1983 publication which was submitted to the Government in connection with farming taxation, is a sound one that should be examined by the Government as an alternative to the PLV system in the operation of the scheme of assistance to smallholders. This scheme is linked with productivity and is worthy of examination.  The reason the Government are not now introducing an alternative notional system is that they want to have each smallholder means-tested as soon as possible.  Indeed I was surprised to learn from a reply to a parliamentary question last week that EEC headage grants will now be taken into account in calculating means for unemployment assistance.  I agree that the sale of milk and cattle must be taken into account in any means-tested system but allowance should be made for smallholders in relation to the time spent on their holdings and in relation to the time spent by their wives and families on agricultural activities.  Experience has shown that, in relation to means tests as applied generally, these considerations do not enter in.</P>
    <P>I have been an advocate for a long time now of the decentralisation of certain matters appertaining to the Department of Social Welfare.  I should like to see explored the possibility of having the records section broken down at county level, operated on a county basis at local level. There are numerous complaints of delays in the processing of applications for unemployment assistance.  These are understandable having regard to the ever-increasing number of persons coming on to the unemployment register and also to the fact that staff numbers are not being increased to cope with those applications. Delays in handling applications <Col N="2236" /> for unemployment assistance cause undue hardship and frustration to applicants and their families and this spills over on to local authorities and health boards. We are all aware of many instances of people seeking unemployment assistance waiting six, eight or ten weeks for a decision on their application and who must go to their local social welfare community officer to seek supplementary allowance. This adds to administrative costs in relation to this scheme.</P>
    <P>I understand why certain cases must be referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of means but these cases eventually should not have to be sent to Dublin for decision.  There should be a deciding officer in each county who could give decisions on applications coming before him or her within a reasonable time.  I suggest the provision of more staff at local level and that there should be decentralisation of the records section.  It would mean that applications for unemployment benefit could be dealt with quickly, that applicants would not have to wait considerable periods for decisions and that they could be paid promptly.</P>
    <P>As regards social welfare disability benefits, I find it hard to understand delays of up to seven or eight weeks in many cases in deciding applications and getting cheques out to applicants.  A system should be devised by which applications accompanied by first medical certificates would be processed through some local office based on area rather than a county.</P>
    <P>I can recall when local social welfare agents maintained a supply of application forms and advised people on their proper completion.  When that system was in operation delays never occurred in making payments because the forms were completed and the cheques were issued by the Department on receipt of the properly completed applications.  Some local machinery should be set up to deal with the first application for disability benefit from any individual.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that, if the suggestions I have made for the improvement of consideration of applications for unemployment assistance, unemployment benefit and disability benefit were adopted and <Col N="2237" /> the system streamlined, the Department would save time and money not only in regard to administration put in preparing replies to parliamentary questions.  As far as I know, the vast majority of Deputies put down questions in relation to applications for social welfare services purely out of frustration.  Undue delays are not the fault of any individual working within the social welfare code but of the system. The saving in cost of administration and the preparation of replies to questions would go a long way towards paying extra decision-making officials at county or local level.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement announced by the Minister can be of tremendous assistance to families depending on low earnings, if the scheme is operated properly.  I hope the Minister will give us details of the scheme as soon as possible.  On numerous occasions each week during the course of my constituency work people in serious financial difficulties, whose incomes are remarkably low and who have difficulty in paying routine bills such as electricity accounts, come to me.  Some weeks ago I asked the Minister by way of parliamentary question if he would be prepared to recommend that the Department would pay 50 per cent of electricity bills to families in certain circumstances.  His reply was that the cost would be such that the Exchequer could not carry it in present financial circumstances.  I can visualise assistance being given to such families under the family income supplement proposals the Minister intends to present.</P>
    <P>I can never understand, and I have queried it on many occasions, the reasons for such problems in dealing with applications from self-employed persons who apparently have no employment at certain times.  I understand it is the policy of the Department to base their incomes for means purposes on the previous tax year or financial year while at the same time persons in insurable employment, with incomes of between £15,000 and £20,000, would be automatically paid the benefit from the day they ceased to be employed or failed to get further employment.  I should like the Minister and his Department to have another look at that anomaly. <Col N="2238" /> When the businesses of small business people fold up and they cannot get employment, they should be able to get unemployment assistance until they can procure employment.</P>
    <P>I should like to compliment the officials of the Department of Social Welfare at all levels from the local district offices right up to the Minister's office.  I have always found them most courteous and obliging.  They are working in very difficult circumstances at the moment having regard to the various constraints placed on them.  I thank them for their co-operation and the way in which they help public representatives.  They show an understanding of the role of public representatives who try to sort out quite a number of difficult social welfare problems relating mainly to applications for unemployment assistance or benefit, disability benefits and pensions, daily and weekly.</P>

      <P>At a time of austerity and hardship such as we are going through at the moment we in this House have a responsibility to ensure that the weakest and most vulnerable members of our society are protected and are not subjected to even greater hardships than they are already suffering.  This Bill is intended so far as possible to ensure that the necessary benefits and assistance will be paid to the unemployed, widows, deserted wives and other social welfare beneficiaries.</P>
      <P>Most of us would echo the sentiments expressed by the Minister when he said he regretted that the increases could not be greater this year.  Last year the increase in benefit and assistance was to the tune of 25 per cent.  Those of us who know the problems of the poor and disadvantaged would like to think that type of increase was possible this year, but it is not feasible.  In order to ensure that the real needy and deserving will not suffer, cutbacks and reductions have to be accepted by the better off.  We have to take a responsible position and ensure that there will not be any great hardship for people who need and deserve help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our social welfare system is not by any <Col N="2239" /> means a bad one.  If we look at countries very much richer than Ireland we will realise that.  If we examine the social welfare system in Canada and America we see that we are not at the bottom of the league.  We are not rich by general western standards, but we can be proud of the social welfare system we have had.  It is not as good as we would like it to be.  In America and Canada there is no regular payment for deserted wives.  When we make the comparison the deserted wife's allowance and the single mother's allowances are cases in point.  We have a high percentage of single breadwinners and, judged by European or American standards, we have a low percentage of women working outside the home.  We have a high dependency rate.  We have more children per family than other EEC countries have.  Despite all those facts, we have ensured that there is no great deprivation and that people are protected from poverty.</P>
    <P>At the moment we are in bad economic circumstances, perhaps even in a crisis. Those of us who are employed know that we will have a pay packet at the end of the week or the month.  We are the fortunate ones and we can make provision for ourselves.  Naturally people will suffer from the cutbacks.  There will be higher prices and higher taxes.  For those of us who have jobs and security in those jobs, it is a time to sit down and reflect, and realise that this is not the reality for several thousand families.  We must also realise that the pressures and stresses on those living on social welfare will be great next year.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement was a feature of the Coalition budget last year. I was sorry it was not carried forward by the next Administration.  In this Bill it is envisaged that it will cater for something in the region of 20,000 families.  It is intended to assist families on low incomes.  Many families are living on £60, £70 or £80 a week.  They can be families with one breadwinner and up to six or seven children.  They need and deserve extra help.  For that reason I welcome the reintroduction of the family income supplement. I hope the allocation under this <Col N="2240" /> heading will not be eaten up by administrative costs.  That would be disastrous. While I accept that there is a need to administer it fairly and equitably, it should be possible to allocate most of it directly to families in need.  As was featured in the budget of the last Coalition, it was to cater for families where there was one worker not eligible for tax.  I hope that when the Minister starts to formulate his policy on paying the family income supplement the administration will be as streamlined and as inexpensive as possible and that we will use existing machinery to pay it.</P>
    <P>Voluntary funding to the value of £500,000 is to be made available to help organisations and groups in community work.  This is very important, although I do not agree that we should consider the needs of people in terms of voluntary aid. That would be rather risky, as though we were getting back into the area of charity. I am sure it will not develop in this way. At a time of pressure and of hidden poverty it is desirable that money be made available to bona fide community groups who would be able to direct the funds where they are most needed.  One is often struck by the difference that exists between one family and another.  There can be great poverty in one family but not in another family, even though the income may be the same.  The reason for the difference is a greater ability to cope on the part of one household.  This is a personal problem and where possible men and women should be given information and help on how to cope with the family income and on how to make it stretch.  We are all aware that in some families £70 can mean as much as £150 but in other families it will only mean as little as £25.</P>
    <P>Section 17 relates to prosecutions.  This is an area in which there has been much public debate and discussion.  It is frequently implied, or even evidence is given, that people with big cars and who go on continental holidays are collecting social welfare, are on the dole or are getting public funds in some way.  At a time when work is scarce and when public funds are limited we have a responsibility <Col N="2241" /> to ensure that public funding goes to the area where it is most needed.  It is important to have standards.  I hasten to add that I am not suggesting that those on welfare should lead lives of lesser quality than anyone else.  Perhaps as a nation we are too quick to judge, but I pose the following question.  When looking for someone to carry out work in our homes or in our gardens, do we ask if the person or the firm proposing to do the work has fulfilled the necessary requirements? How many of us will go for the cheapest price knowing that the person concerned is on the dole?  Many of us will then complain about that kind of situation.  I wanted work done at my house and I got in touch with various people whom I knew had work carried out for them.  I was told that the work had been done but that the people who carried out that work would not do the work for me: I was told &ldquo;They would not touch you with a barge-pole.&rdquo; I asked the reason and I was told it was because I would make inquiries about returning tax, about registration and so on.  We have a responsibility to ensure that firms work in accordance with the required procedures.  We must ensure that employers make the required returns in respect of PRSI and PAYE.</P>
    <P>I make my remarks in the full knowledge that all our Ministers had an extremely difficult task in making the necessary cuts and in ensuring that we can pay for the services that are necessary and I know that this was more difficult in some Departments.  However, I wish to refer to the abolition of the maternity grant scheme.  The Minister said the grant was £8, which was very little, but the administration of the scheme possibly added another £3 or £4 to that amount. Nevertheless I regretted that the scheme was abolished.  I would ask the Minister to consider the 15,000 women who qualify for it on their husbands' insurance.  I agree that the maternity allowance is well worthwhile.  There are 10,000 claimants who get a maternity allowance which is paid before and after the birth of a baby and there is also the 14 weeks scheme for women in employment.  The group which concerns me most are those who were <Col N="2242" /> entitled to it on their husbands' insurance.</P>
    <P>The maternity grant was brought in under the National Insurance Act, 1911. It operated from 15 July 1912.  The amount paid in 1912 was £1.10s.  It went up to £2 in 1920, which was quite a sum. In 1978 it was increased to £8.  It has not been increased since.  I would not dare to say that it is unimportant for any woman because for mothers at home any payment is significant and worthwhile.  I know how much children's allowances mean to them.  In 1978 the amount was depressed at £8.  I am worried about this being abandoned.  It is very difficult to reintroduce things which are abandoned. I should like the Minister to look at this category &mdash; the wives of insured workers &mdash; particularly since we are debating the amendment to the Constitution.  This section are being discriminated against. The fact that the grant has remained at £8 reflects no credit on any Government. In other European countries a birth grant, which probably is not substantial, is paid to women who have a baby.</P>
    <P>The Bill will ensure that we can maintain a reasonable level of help and assistance for those who need it.  It is unfortunate that we cannot do more.  We would all like to be able to do much more for the people we see in our clinics who are struggling on low incomes and trying to cope with ever-rising prices.  They find it difficult to keep food on the table let alone have the luxuries which some of us take for granted such as holidays and cloths.  It is important to protect this group.</P>
    <P>I look to the future with optimism, but if we are to have any hope for the future sacrifices will have to be made.  We will have some tough years.  I do not envisage that we should have to concede that emigration is the answer to our problems. I do not see us working towards that answer in this Government.  I was an emigrant in the fifties and subsequently returned.  I benefitted from that emigration and I know the ardours and grim reality of having to leave the country.  It is for this reason that the Government must take on the role of tough responsible government for the next four years so. <Col N="2243" /> that our children and their children will not be burdened with an unbearable national debt but will have a future with jobs here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I preface my remarks by extending every good wish to Deputy Desmond on his appointment as Minister. We entered the House together and I wish him well.  I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on this Bill and to have the experience of seeing such a Bill introduced by a Labour Minister.  They are a minority party in the Coalition but it is being brought in by a Minister who has been as long on the sideline as I have and whose concern for the less well of and for social welfare recipients in general does not appear to be confined to Dún Laoghaire and Rathdown but embraces the whole country.</P>
      <P>When I look at some of the provisions in the Bill I fear the Minister's concern may be somewhat diluted or modified west of the Shannon.  As a representative of a Leinster constituency with a practically unbroken Labour representation I can understand how the gullible people who voted Labour are now asking: &ldquo;Where are they?&rdquo; Members of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union who will be marching in Newbridge tomorrow will include people who are unemployed and on short-time in Newbridge, Naas, Kildare and elsewhere. They will ask the same question and will want to know where the Labour Party are and if those who espoused women's rights so vociferously in the past have become dumb now.  Is the mild spring we are experiencing in tune with the mild Spring that does not like to ruffle the hard line attitude of a Fine Gael-dominated Cabinet here in the Dáil?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How is it that the Minister who could not be kept off radio and television before the election is not seen on it now, apart from a still life picture I saw the other night?  I would like him to explain some of the changes that have been made.  The introduction to the explanatory memorandum says that the Bill provides for increased rates of payment in the schemes for social insurance and <Col N="2244" /> assistance from the end of June 1983.  It also says that occupational injury benefit payments are being increased.  That is a PRO job because in many cases it is from 1 July.</P>
    <P>I realise that the provisions of the Social Welfare Bill stem from the Budget.  Our first priority would have been to provide employment.  In the 1982 budget our first priority was to reduce inflation.  We succeeded in reducing inflation from 23 per cent to 12 per cent in nine months, which was a very creditable performance.  Even a casual observer would realise that jobs should be the first priority of Government.  I cannot detect anything in the budget that will provide employment for anybody, apart from the special advisers that have been appointed in certain positions.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have a philosophy of caring for the less well off, the poor and the elderly.  Our leader has been a trendsetter and pioneer in this regard.  Proof of that can be seen in the 25 per cent increase in pensions which was provided at the end of every year for three years: it proves that that concern was translated into hard cash when times were not good.  Naturally, we regretted that a 25 per cent increase was necessary to cushion these unfortunate people against inflation and that is why we applied ourselves to the reduction of inflation.  On the Minister's own admission, 3½ per cent has been added to inflation by the provisions of the budget, and it more likely that 4 per cent has been added.  The 10 per cent and the 15 per cent increases in pensions and other provisions in the budget will not cushion these people against inflation.  It is important to remember, too, that pensions will remain static until the end of June but the cost of living will not.  The 4½ per cent imposition, which started even before the budget, is in operation now and old people will continue to feel the pinch.</P>
    <P>It has been argued by some people that this Social Welfare Bill will help to stop abuses, but I do not think so.  It will not do anything to prevent spongers, nixers or those drawing the dole from abusing the system.  We all want to see those parasites eliminated, but I do not consider <Col N="2245" /> that this Bill will make any difference in that regard.  The purpose of the Bill is to give an increase in payments under social welfare insurance and assistance, and it makes quite a few changes. Fianna Fáil realised that there were loopholes in short-term employment, especially the three-day week and three-day social welfare payments.  We intended to make it a two-day social welfare week and to reduce social welfare payments to five days in this instance.  I am glad that this provision has been incorporated in the Bill.  The balance should be weighted in favour of working rather than remaining idle and some workers and employers use the three-day week to benefit themselves.  We must create a climate where there is a greater inducement to work rather than remaining idle or going on short-time.  Naturally, if someone is going to pay tax for working there must also be a provision whereby people who get money for not working will also pay tax if the sums are comparable.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a deliberate policy by the Government to make more people unemployed.  Who pays the greatest burden of taxation?  When the Government were in Opposition it was agreed that there was an unfair burden placed on the PAYE sector.  We were told they were been sucked dry.  This year it is worse than ever.  The ceiling has now been raised to £13,000 per annum, but the benefits only apply to people earning up to £11,000 per annum.  Why are people in the £13,000 income group paying for something from which they cannot benefit?  In Kildare, where we like to have a bet, you get your money back if you have no hope of winning.  The assumption is that if you cannot win, you cannot lose either.  Last week there were two races where all bets were returned because there was not betting on the race.  If people earning £13,000 contribute to a scheme, they are entitled to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>I would now like to deal with the most penal levy of all, the 1 per cent to be deducted from salaries and which has brought the ceiling up to 8.5 per cent. That is a very savage increase on gross <Col N="2246" /> wages.  Is it a temporary measure?  Once our ancestors fought a tithe war when one-tenth of their hay or corn and so on was taken from them.  The people rebelled against that and we are getting very close to a situation where the 8.5 per cent is also a tithe.  I can well understand why the rumblings of discontent have become a clamour.</P>
    <P>When we use terms like PRSI and PRB in a hackneyed way we should analyse their meaning.  We must remember that the worker is paying for benefits and insurance; they are not a handout.  The payments probably go back to the previous year on the understanding that certain benefits will be available if they are unfortunate enough to need them the following year.  This Bill increases the number of waiting days to the fourth week instead of the third week.  When the person paid the money they did not anticipate that they would have to wait four weeks.  It is not aimed solely at spongers but at ordinary working people who are out of work through no fault of their own.  You may well say to me, as the Minister might say: what is another week, or as Johnny Logan might say, what is another year?  The PAYE people might well be saying &ldquo;When is the next election?&rdquo;. I cannot understand the thinking behind the waiting period.  If it is something intended to encourage people to work, we must remember that not a great percentage of the unemployed are spongers, so you are aiming at the 10 per cent and thereby victimising the other 90 per cent prepared to work.</P>
    <P>Section 9 brings about a reduction in pay-related benefit.  That is the benefit for which people have paid in proportion to their wages.  The reductions have been brought down to 40 per cent in the first 147 days, 30 per cent for 78 days, 25 per cent for the next 78 days and 20 per cent for the following 78 days.  Now we anticipated we would have to make changes in order to ensure people on social welfare would not have more money than they would if they were working.  But these provisions here are much more savage and much steeper than anything we ever suggested or hoped to introduce. We certainly never went as low as 20 per <Col N="2247" /> cent in any estimate on which we decided. It would appear, then, that here the Minister has out-Heroded Herod.  There is no point in harking back to what Fianna Fáil intended doing because you are the people in power now.  You are the people who made the promises.  You are the people who have broken those promises. You are the people who have reneged on the promises you made to the workers. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, did a very good hoovering job in the budget because every spare bob was taken up here.  I sympathise with any Minister sitting over there who must now empty out the dust bag and let the people see what has happened.</P>
    <P>Section 12 disqualifies apprentices in the 16 to 18 age group for children's allowances.  As a previous speaker remarked, the maternity allowance is being withdrawn from 4 April.  Very paltry sums are involved.  I can understand why the previous Fine Gael speaker deplored the fact that a maternity allowance of £8 was being done away with.  I realise the amount was out of date. Would it not be possible to incorporate this into some other type of benefit?  I know the Labour Party are anti-amendment. It now appears they are anti-maternity grant as well.  Can anyone tell me why there is no increase in children's allowances?  This is the first time a year has passed in which we do not have an increase in children's allowances.  The allowances have remained static.  It would appear anti-children measures are very much in vogue.  First of all, there is no maternity grant, no increase in children's allowances and, up to recently, there was to be no school transport.  My reference to out-Heroding Herod is very appropriate remembering the massacre of the Holy Innocents.  This is what we are seeing now in the Coalition programme.</P>
    <P>There will be no double weeks benefit for the dependants of the poor.  Deputy Dr. Woods in 1982 introduced the double week in September and December as a help to dependants of the poor.  They will now be denied that double week.  I have done a little calculation and I am <Col N="2248" /> informed that the delay in paying old age pensions to 1 July will save the Government £15.5 millions.  It should be remembered that, if it does, it will also have taken £15.5 millions away from old age pensioners.  It was obviously decided to make the old age pensioners do without that £15.5 millions, and the total saving for widows and others by this delay is £39.3 millions.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters to which I should like to refer.  Employers who take social welfare contributions from their employees and do not remit those contributions to the Department should be pursued and prosecuted.  When a worker applies for his pension a very, very exact analysis is done of the amount of stamps he has and there is no redress if he has not the correct amount.  Any employer who acts in such a criminal fashion, who takes money from the worker and does not pay it to the Department, should not have his action condoned. There is an opinion at large that certain elements in the Fine Gael Party do not regard such criminal action as criminal, as one would imagine they should.  Those who believe this is not a crime should be disillusioned.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a very retrograde step.  In shipwreck the usual cry is women and children first.  I would add old people as well.  These unfortunates will be the first to suffer, the old and women and children. I would ask the Minister at this stage to have another look at this or at least listen to those within his own party who have a humane attitude and who realise that some of the provisions here will have dire repercussions and impose dreadful burdens on people.  Above all, I would ask the Government to have a look at the provisions and give the PAYE worker a fair deal for once.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointments.  I am not sure whether to offer condolences or congratulations.  They have an extremely difficult task ahead.  This Department has a total budget of £1,780 million.  It is the largest Estimate in the Book of Estimates. <Col N="2249" /> They are faced with an extremely difficult job in trying to protect the living standards of the needy and the deprived.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some anomalies that need to be corrected.  When discussing the desirability of expenditure on social welfare the basic problem is the demographic structure of the country.  There is a predominance of people over 66 and children under 16.  The burden of taxation must obviously be immense because our dependency ratio is the highest in Europe.  Over the coming years the Government will have an enormous problem in trying to protect living standards. I would urge that there should be some way at EEC level to enable a review of expenditure through the European Social Fund in such a way as to take account of those governments who have an inability in regard to problems in social welfare budgets.  At the moment there is no structure other than training and youth employment and other regional aids and European funds do not move into this area at all.  That situation should be reviewed and changed forthwith.  We must at all times in relation to such a large amount of money look for value for money.  In terms of unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance, which total £473 million&mdash;our minimum estimate this year&mdash;ways must be found of getting better value for money.  Whatever the increase, whether 12 per cent after a pause as in this case or the usual 1 April increase, there must be some formal link between pay increases negotiated in either a national pay agreement or a national understanding so that those at work can see direct parity between the percentage increases for industrial earnings and the percentage increases for social welfare, especially for those who are out of work, who in some cases are available for work but unable to find it and in other cases are sick and incapable of work.  Last year there was a 25 per cent social welfare increase and a 12 per cent increase in pay.  This whole area must be looked at.  All the social partners are at present having talks with the Government, the unions who have a special interest in this area, and the employers, and some formalised relationship should <Col N="2250" /> be brought about between increases in pay and increases in social welfare.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn to the estimated 193,000 people who will draw either unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit.  An extra £31 million has been provided in this respect for this year.  It is difficult to predict accurately the outturn but unfortunately one could not say under all predictions at present that this estimate is anything other than conservative.  This vast amount of money, £473 million, a quarter of the total budget for social welfare, raises some very fundamental questions about expenditure of this nature.  When I was Fine Gael spokesman for employment creation I felt that there was a very important need to review this total expenditure.</P>
    <P>That can be done in various ways through direct job creation by the State. First we could say to those on unemployment assistance that for six months' work we could pay them at the rate of benefit, and in that way we would get some return for our money and those participating would get some job satisfaction.  Another way would be for someone on unemployment assistance with only a wife and no children drawing £50.50 or someone with five or six children drawing £74 per week would do a certain number of hours' work per week on two or three days, thus overcoming his frustration and getting some fulfilment rather than existing as at present where there is no return from the State and the result is vandalism, frustration and depression among people who have no hope of a job.</P>
    <P>I would envisage the Department of Social Welfare having discussions with local authorities and other agencies to bring about in some way flexibility of funds between different State departments. I know of one local authority who within the last 18 months let off 30 men and the cost to the State was more by virtue of the entitlements when they were unemployed than it was to keep them in their jobs.  That is not value for money and in some ways it is economic lunacy. The Government must make a determined effort to review the fundamental change that I am speaking about.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2251" /> I envisage it being done at, say, Enniscorthy employment exchange or any exchange where unemployment would go over, say, 15 per cent of the work force there.  You would invoke an emergency scheme there whereby you would set up a local committee made up of employers, unions and district engineers of the local authority who would combine.  The people would be available for work if offered jobs after two months in the scheme.  It could be a successful recruiting ground.  It would mean tangible environmental improvements in each locality.</P>
    <P>In regard to individual cases, some people in my constituency wished to set up a bicycle repair shop.  Because they were means-tested they found it very difficult to draw their social assistance and still get the type of money they needed to set up this business.  The Department of Social Welfare and all other Departments must be anxious at all times to attain a flexibility that will ensure that those who want to work and employ themselves on self-help will be encouraged fully.  Conversely if people on full-time social welfare unemployment benefit assistance put a proposal to the Department that they work three days a week and spend the other two days setting up whatever small enterprises they want, they should not be inhibited in any way from collecting their payments and going ahead and getting some opportunity of sustaining their own livelihood.</P>
    <P>I wish to turn now to short-time working. In my constituency in my home town of Enniscorthy three factories are on three-day short-time working and they will be affected severely by the cutbacks in this budget.  Sections 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill are relevant to this.  I would like to give an example of the effects of the present cuts and the anomalies and the disincentive to work at present.  A married man with no children working a five-day or forty-hour week in a bacon factory I have in mind, which is at present on a three-day week, would take home £117.71 per week pay.  He would pay PAYE £13.50 and his employee contribution only on PRSI would be £10.64. <Col N="2252" /> His gross pay would be £141.85 a week and his take-home pay £117.71 a week. At present what is the situation on short-time working?  He works 26 hours, that is three days a week, and his gross pay from the company is £92 a week.  His tax out of this is £1.25 a week and his PRSI deduction, employee's only again, is £6.95 per week.  This comes to total deductions of over £8 per week.  His total social welfare at present for three day's signing is £41.08.  Including pay-related this comes to a total of £124.93 a week. I ask anyone in this House how he can justify someone with no children working a five-day week, taking all tax allowances into account, taking home £117 while under the present situation he gets £7 more for working two days fewer.</P>
    <P>All sides of the House prior to this election recognised this problem.  How can we be less than hypocritical when we make speeches about absenteeism, man-days lost, work ethic and incentive to work if at the same time a man married with no children is £7 a week better off for not going to work?  Therefore, I welcome the change whereby workers can draw three days' or 26 hours' earnings in the bacon factory and two days only on social welfare.  This would have the net effect of reducing the cut only in terms of the days lost.  It would reduce the social welfare payment to £17.38 a week.  In other words, they would get £27.38 per week which is a loss of £13.69, an acceptable level whereby he would have an incentive to go back to a five-day week. The pay-related cuts, especially after 147 days, will have the effect of reducing his take-home pay to £101.23.  That is now a cut of £23 or, if he is working a full five-day week, £16 a week.</P>
    <P>I urge all concerned to ensure that there is a full and proper incentive to work.  It is only logical and reasonable that those on a five-day week should be better off than those on three days.  If they are making PRSI contributions it is only right that some, at least, of the pay-related benefit should be retained. Perhaps the matter could be reviewed. When the effects are felt, it will be obvious that an improvement in the situation of the five-day week worker will <Col N="2253" /> prove an incentive to work.  The extent of the abuse has been pointed out.  Last year, industrial earnings increased by approximately 12 per cent and social welfare payments by 25 per cent.  People were paying PRSI and when out of work they were collecting pay-related benefits. Instead of paying PAYE, they were getting a tax-free allowance to top up their payments.  No Member could justify that situation.  It is recognised in the Opposition party document <i>The Way Forward</i> that that piecemeal approach created such inequity that it had to be stopped. The approach on the five-day week should be rigid, but flexible on pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>I welcome specifically the budget allocation direct to the Department of £½ million for voluntary bodies.  Health boards have a total budgetary constraint imposed on them for the year and partnership projects between voluntary and statutory bodies tend first to feel the cold breeze.  We must examine the Government attitude in every area to the role of voluntary bodies.  The relationship between the Department, the Minister and various voluntary bodies should be formalised to the extent that on a project there would be a rigid pound for pound arrangement &mdash; every pound collected through local voluntary contribution would be matched by a pound from the Department, or some other ratio to give an incentive to so many communities with so much goodwill and expertise in raising money.</P>
    <P>In Wexford, we have a family centre run by the ISPCC which is caught in the classical squeeze but, through the intervention of the Minister it is now possible that the needed £36,000 will be forthcoming. The health board, with its own social work structure for deprived families and young children, is not the best source. There should be a formal relationship between the Department and the ISPCC and full assistance given.  I agree with the Minister that to initiate and aid projects rather than groups is preferable.  Too much money in every spending Department is consumed by administration.  The more we can channel into projects rather than administration, the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2254" /> Various anomalies exist under the present social welfare code.  This is the first social welfare Bill on which I have spoken and my first opportunity to speak in the House on these matters other than by parliamentary questions.  I will deal with these matters concisely and in detail. In regard to deserted wife's benefits and allowances I know of genuine cases of married women with three, four or five children being beaten up by their husbands, beaten out of the house and openly degraded by the husbands bringing other women into the house, ensuring that the wife can do nothing else but leave the house.  If they return to the family home it will not be long before they have to leave it again.  These women have to find refuge, with their children, with in-laws who will not accept them for very long, or live in mobile homes.  They apply for whatever assistance is available.  They are, in real terms, deserted wives because their husbands have given them no other option.  What do we find?  They are refused the deserted wife's benefit or allowance, regardless of their contributions, simply because they left their husbands of their own volition.  This is inequitable. There is need for a new scheme of a separated woman's allowance or a single parent's allowance for these people.  When the deciding and appeals officers come to the family home for evidence the husband's deliberately do all they possible can to stop their wives and children from having a reasonable livelihood. These women are not favourably considered for housing and are in desperate circumstances.  They are as deprived as anyone under the social welfare code.  Their only recourse is to supplementary welfare assistance.  They are degraded and condemned by society and we need urgent review in this area.</P>
    <P>Another anomaly relates to widowers. There are many well organised pressure groups in our society, no doubt doing great work to ease the plight of widows and I will come to that aspect later. Young widowers with two or three small children, whether at work or unemployed, receive no allowance for them. The State gives no recognition to the fact that nine times out of ten the widower <Col N="2255" /> must employ a housekeeper or babysitter to look after his children.  Some discretionary payment must be made through unemployment assistance when these widowers are unemployed.  They should not have to sign for work because they are not really available to work, not being able to afford to pay somebody to mind the children.  They are engaged full-time in minding the children.  Widows get 10 or 12 per cent more, but because these people are male they are discriminated against.  That is inequitable and anomalous.</P>
    <P>Another small anomaly which would not cost much to cure relates to the free telephone rental allowance.  A clause in the legislation says that in order to obtain the free rental allowance you have to be living with another person who is so permanently incapacitated that he or she needs constant care and attention.  There is an example in my constituency of a totally iniquitous case in relation to this clause.  A man with muscular dystrophy is in a wheelchair.  He is married, with three children and they have a phone which is needed.  They applied for a free telephone rental allowance and were refused.  I made further representations on their behalf, but they were refused again.  This was because the woman of the house did not require constant care and attention.  If they were both incapacitated, they could not look after each other.  Quite clearly, from the results of representations to the Department, the only way they would receive this allowance would be for both to be incapacitated. That is both anomalous and illogical. A change in that clause should be considered.</P>
    <P>In relation to the free travel pass, anyone on the disabled person's maintenance allowance who is totally mentally and physically handicapped and 15 or 16 years of age is entitled to a free travel pass, and rightly so.  The difficulty, however, is that families dependent on social welfare allowance who have such a child cannot put this child on the train for Dublin or Cork simply because he or she could not look after himself or herself. <Col N="2256" /> It seems only reasonable that if there is a free travel card issued to such a person it would be ensured simultaneously that somebody would accompany them because their card is rendered totally meaningless unless they have somebody to accompany them.  Therefore I might suggest that the present blue card be replaced by a red one for people who are physically or mentally handicapped and which would allow one person to accompany them.  It would entail a very small cost and it would be only reasonable and logical to do so.</P>
    <P>One other area which might cost money but is worthy of consideration &mdash; and in respect of which there have been repeated representations by their association &mdash; is that of all social welfare widows pensions.  They should be entitled to a free travel pass.  I do not think the cost would be exorbitant.  Quite often such people are lonely and they like to visit their families who have obtained employment far away from their original residences.  Regardless of the fact that they could be under 66, these people should be given a free travel pass.</P>
    <P>There is one final area in respect of which I should like some clarification. When someone makes a claim for disability benefit their contributions record governs that claim.  Very often I come across the case of someone who had been working for, say, two years in a factory, became unemployed, signed on, used up their 12 to 18 months stamps and then went on unemployment assistance for one, two or three years.  Let us suppose such a person is 62 or 63 years of age. Very often claimants for disability benefit &mdash;people who are genuine because they cannot work and are genuinely sick&mdash; because they do not have any contributions but only credits, are sent around in a circle trying to obtain that benefit.  I can never ascertain from the Department whether or not they are entitled to disability benefit.  Perhaps someone some time could clarify that for me.</P>
    <P>With a budget of £180 million we can readily see the reason there were no increases granted in children's allowances this year.  The present payment at a rate of £11.25 represents a substantial <Col N="2257" /> increase on the rate of two or three years ago.  I cannot understand why people who have an income in excess of that to qualify for a medical card &mdash; an easy way of establishing a cut-off point &mdash; should get children's allowance payments.  In these hard times we could effect a straightforward saving there.  I do not think we can retain a situation in which every child in the State is entitled to children's allowance payments.</P>
    <P>In regard to the prescribed relative allowance, one must remember that the average weekly cost of geriatric care in State institutions, especially in my constituency, is £196.  I will never understand why we cannot encourage family geriatric care rather than State geriatric care.  I would suggest that a number of changes be made in the present system of prescribed relative allowances.  First, there should be a clause inserted which would mean that an application is refused if any person other than the prescribed relative is over 18 years of age and resides in the House.  I came across an instance recently of a young girl who was working in a paper shop, whose aunt was seriously ill and staying with them at home.  That girl was earning £45 a week.  She gave up her job because her brother, who is 19 years of age and working, does not give a damn about the aunt in question.  There was nobody to care for her other than the girl in question, so she gave up her job, went home to mind the aunt, and was refused the prescribed relative allowance on the basis that her brother who was 19 years of age was living with them.  The brother was contributing nothing to the household income.  Eventually the aunt went into geriatric care at a cost of £196 per week.</P>
    <P>That situation defies logic and does not represent prudent value for money.  I would suggest that in a genuine case especially where someone has given up a job to look after a relative, where there is any young person over 18 years of age in the house not contributing to the household income, that situation should be reviewed.  I know the South Eastern Health Board, whatever about the others, have stopped payments of home help; it has been abolished for all practical <Col N="2258" /> purposes.  The prescribed relative allowance must be reviewed.  It must be ensured that any money that would have been available for home help could be combined with the prescribed relative allowance, thereby effecting a saving and keeping people out of State geriatric care.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some points in relation to the administration of the Department of Social Welfare.  Every Member of this House is a full-time social welfare officer and will have a certain amount of experience of the administration of the Department.  Of its very nature this Department must deal with applications as a matter of urgency.  They deal with bread and butter issues, the question of whether or not somebody has money for the week.  These are not like other problems that can be tackled in due course &mdash; there is a degree of urgency. Therefore we must seek maximum efficiency in all areas.</P>
    <P>The problems encountered at present are many.  The whole procedure of deciding officers, appeals officers and so on, especially in cases of unemployment assistance, is extremely protracted.  In the last 12 months I have noticed that in cases where a deciding officer decides, in his or her wisdom, that Mr. and Mrs. X have an income from fishing, or farming, or an income from some self-employed activity, or are working with some relation and are assessed to have an income on their qualification certificate of which they know nothing and which they cannot understand, under present procedures the reversal of that departmental decision takes three to four months.  There is no saving effected in such cases on the part of the Department because naturally the applicant must live in the interim and cannot live on £5 or £7 a week or even £15 a week unemployment assistance for themselves and family.  They go to their community welfare officer and get paid, so there is no saving to the State.  This only initiates a whole cycle of paper-pushing between the local social welfare officer, the appeals officer, the deciding officer, the Department and the supplementary welfare officer.  When that appeal is decided finally, any rebate due <Col N="2259" /> to the social welfare people is paid.  I should like to see that matter investigated.</P>
    <P>I am glad to report that the problems in relation to the telephones in Store Street and in other central Departments have been greatly alleviated.  The position there has improved enormously. However I cannot understand &mdash; and this does not apply to the Department of Social Welfare alone &mdash; why when individual members of the public write to a Department, if they do not do so by registered post, half of their letters are not replied to within one to two months. I do not have any firm statistics in this regard, but many people tell me they write to Departments and hear nothing. I would not be in this House very long had I the same attitude to my correspondents, nor indeed would any other Deputy.  That whole area needs to be sharpened up so that we Deputies will not continue to be social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>We must be constructive in this respect.  I might make a number of suggestions by way of alleviating these problems. Firstly, there is need, especially in the country, to have one social welfare officer per county.  This would take a couple of years to implement but could be done.  Certainly in my constituency there are massive waiting lists in every Department, waiting lists for transfers from Dublin to Wexford, to Gorey, to Enniscorthy, to Arklow, Wicklow, wherever. There would be no extra cost in terms of employment to decentralise these offices so that in one centre of a county or large area a person could submit a disability certificate or could apply for an invalidity pension application form &mdash; that is a long procedure because application forms are not available at present. In all such instances one could have only humane compassion.  There could be old age couples of whom one spouse dies and the book has to be returned.  They have the fear that they will not get paid for a particular week.  The Department have a sensitive attitude towards it, but still such couples have fear.  Decentralisation would alleviate all that because, like a local tax office, their problems could be <Col N="2260" /> solved there and then.</P>
    <P>In regard to the whole supplementary assistance system, I have the utmost regard for the community welfare officers because they are the most compassionate and humane people in the entire Department. They use their discretion fairly and properly.  They would have my entire support, but if someone is waiting for payment of disability benefit, having submitted the required certificates, I cannot understand why he should have to go to an official employed by the health board. Surely there is a need to integrate the community welfare officers into the Department of Social Welfare so that any deductions that have to be made out of later payments, delayed payments that will come to the applicants because they are entitled to them, could be expedited. The disabled person's maintenance allowance should also be paid by the Department of Social Welfare.  They adjudicate in other payments in which a medical interpretation is involved.  This could only do good because it would harmonise the entire work of the Department.</P>
    <P>If there is need at all for an ombudsman it exists in the Department of Social Welfare. It might not be necessary to employ a State ombudsman but there could be one or two people who could adjudicate at ministerial level on long term grievances in relation to difficulties with that Department.  It could be, possibly, that the Department would not be wrong in all instances, but there would be this final recourse to justice that would be over and above the heads of TDs and Ministers. It could be established at a small cost.  It would give greater public confidence in terms of accountability.</P>
    <P>I should also like to see integration of employment exchanges, which are, as we know, unemployment exchanges, with the National Manpower Service.  I suggest there is agreement across the House on this.  It would reduce the number of nixers and would make employment exchanges literally that.</P>
    <P>In relation to PLV means testing, following the High Court decision and the abolition of the national system, although it does not affect my county or constitutency, I suggest that the same problem <Col N="2261" /> that the Department of Social Welfare will have will be experienced by the Revenue Commissioners.  They will have to assess somebody who formerly had £14.30 PLV, or a person with £2.50.  All are now liable to tax although most of them are entitled to farmers' dole or unemployment assistance.  Whatever two-page simplified document comes out after discussions with the Revenue Commissioners could be used to assess unemployment assistance claims.  Automatically and simultaneously that would integrate the two, it would halve the bureaucracy and eliminate the duplication, and the work could be done simply and effectively.</P>
    <P>There has been much discussion of late about the witholding of PRSI and PAYE. Deputy Power said that people who withhold such payments should be prosecuted. I would take a stand here that would be different from that of even the Minister and the majority of the House. I know in my home town of three companies and if they had to pay on the dot all outstanding contributions of VAT, PAYE and PRSI over the last financial year, I have no doubt that at least 186 jobs would be gone overnight, and the State is only a preferential creditor.</P>
    <P>The Government should tread very catiously here.  I do not condone abuse. I welcome sections 17 to 25 of the Bill, which will provide for penalties.  But I have always believed that penalties should fit the crime.  I have no time for companies that are deliberately making money out of the Government by withholding payments, but in the financial year up to December last how much of the £25 million PRSI outstanding from 11,000 employers would directly cause liquidations?  The Minister says that asking to tread warily in this matter is a facile argument.  So is the reverse.  Recent IDA reports compared the position, as between foreign and indigenous industries. The average cost of a job is somewhere between £7,700 and £14,500.  We can see the real cost and we must look at it as positive protection towards employment. There should be an official happy medium in the Department whereby they would assess the liquidity position, the <Col N="2262" /> cash flow situation and thereafter determine, but it should not be left to a personality clash between a Revenue Commissioner and an employer as to whether a number of jobs should be lost.  In ultimate cost terms of unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and all the additional costs in terms of unemployment compensation and the status of the State as preferential creditor, there is a percentage advantage in withholding and arranging payment in such a way that would relieve the cash flow of a company.</P>
    <P>I feel very strongly about the free fuel system.  In trying to make commonsense of all these schemes, I cannot understand the difference between the urban and the rural schemes.  On top of Shannon Hill in Enniscorthy people were entitled to free fuel because they were in the urban area, but people ten yards across the road were not entitled to it because they were on the wrong side of the boundary.  I cannot understand why that should be.  There is an urgent need to equate the free fuel system to ensure that urban and rural people will be treated alike.  In that scheme there is a list of categories, including contributory pensioners, non-contributory pensioners, widow pensioners and invalidity pensioners who are entitled to free fuel.</P>
    <P>I should like to give the House an example of how I see it as being totally unfair.  Let us take a single man in receipt of unemployment assistance and a single man with a non-contributory old age pension. The non-contributory old age pensioner gets £34.45 at the maximum rate. A single man on unemployment assistance living alone gets £25.45 a week.  He is worse off by £9 a week.  Yet he is alleged to be less entitled to free fuel than the man who is £9 better off.  I cannot understand that.  A married man with no children gets unemployment assistance of £50.50 a week and a pensioner in the same circumstances gets £68.90 a week, a difference of £18.  The person who is better off by £18 is deemed to be more entitled to free fuel.  People on unemployment assistance who have no other livelihood should be entitled to free fuel. Perhaps it would be better if everyone who had a medical card was entitled to <Col N="2263" /> free fuel.  If that is too expensive I would encourage the introduction of a means test or some discretionary payment by the local community welfare officer.  I am not blaming the Government for this problem.  It is a technocratic inequity which should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>In the area of the family income supplement £5 million is promised.  In overall terms I support the family income supplement. I fully accept the sincerity behind this move; I accept that there is a poverty trap; but this sounds to me like bureaucracy gone mad.  In everything they take in revenue and spend, the Government control about 60p in every £1 circulating in this economy.  We are now moving into the area where the Government decide that a particular income is too low and should be supplemented and subsidised.  That is very valid in itself and I totally agree with that sentiment. It could be interpreted by a neutral observer as the Government underwriting the inability of certain market sectors to pay a reasonable wage.</P>
    <P>If we look at this carefully, there are immense implications in it.  Under a national pay agreement employers of agricultural labourers or low paid groups like hotel workers could say to the Government: &ldquo;We are having hard times this year.  With your family income supplement you should give them the increase.  We cannot give it to them because there would be redundancies.&rdquo; The precedents involved here are very important.  We would want to tread very carefully in relation to actually increasing lower paid workers' incomes.  That is moving into an area where the Government are discouraging economic activity.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be misinterpreted.  I fully accept the sincerity behind the move and I fully realise the poverty trap these people are in.  I suggest that with different Departments charging for services, there should be some way of giving these people a tangible benefit.  Perhaps a certificate could be issued to them and they could be given a rebate against these charges, or perhaps more medical cards could be issued.  I would not be in favour of giving them an extra pay packet <Col N="2264" /> because that is getting into a very difficult area in which we would have to consider who would get it and how it would affect national pay bargaining.  In economic terms it does not make sense that the State should decide what is a desirable wage.  I am not speaking about national wage agreements.  I mean national minimum wage rates.</P>
    <P>I should like to put on record a constituency matter to which I know the Minister of State is sympathetic.  I refer to the employment exchange in Enniscorthy, County Wexford.  Including the environs and district of Enniscorthy, 17,000 people approximately are signing on there.  The office is antiquated.  It has been in use for many years.  There are queues hundreds of yards long.  There is no shelter.  Different types of assistance have to be collected in a two-hour session and there is no way queueing can be avoided.  The office is in a very public place and this is degrading for those who pass and those who collect.  An adjacent shop owner has taken out an injunction. He cannot carry on his business because of the crowds queueing outside.  This is a real problem.  The administrators in that office are doing their utmost, as I am, to try to find an alternative site.  I do not criticise anyone.  If it is possible to find an alternative site in the locality, I hope the Department will consent to go a little over the statutory payment per office per year and meet a deputation to try to finalise the arrangements.  This is one of the most serious social welfare problems in my home town.</P>
    <P>If this allocation of £1,780 million were for education or for the environment or any area other than social welfare, every commentator in the country would be saying it was a public scandal.  We must realise this is the biggest spending Department.  We must also realise there are limits to our resources.  I have mentioned reservations about small aspects of the social welfare code to which I should like favourable consideration to be given.  The difficulty we face economically &mdash; and this is the tragedy of our whole economic situation &mdash; is that no one owes us any guaranteed increase.  We <Col N="2265" /> can produce it only through external trade.  On that realistic note I support and welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom labhairt i gcoinne an Bhille seo.  I listened with interest to the previous speaker. Obviously he has a comprehensive knowledge of the social welfare code.  I have no doubt my colleagues, Deputy Browne and Deputy Byrne, will support the plea he made about his constituency problem in Enniscorthy.  He also spoke about deserted wives and whether or not claims are genuine.  I support his plea for a far more human approach towards a problem the solution of which is often thwarted by devious people and devious means.  I commend him for raising the problem.</P>
      <P>On the Bill I cannot be so complimentary. The wheel has turned full circle since I came into this House.  I never thought I would see a Labour Minister introducing such a repressive Bill.  My party can claim to have taken a caring human approach to the problems of the under-privileged in good economic times and bad.  It is true that as a Government we had contemplated taking such measures. The Minister laid great emphasis on them although he ignored, possibly deliberately, areas in which we made improvement.</P>
      <P>We cannot discuss this Bill without turning to the budget proposals and strategy. Many of us complained at the time that the strategy would lead to further inflation.  On the Minister's own admission here at that time he admitted that the direct taxation increases imposed by him would be equivalent to an increase of 3½ per cent on the CPI.  I accept that any Minister for Finance is inclined to be conservative in such matters and will not include the knock-on effect but when we consider that, we are talking of a figure of about 5 per cent.  When one takes that into account and considers the long delay in implementing the benefits being accorded to the various categories under the social welfare code one sees that the first time for many years the increases being granted are meagre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Minister <Col N="2266" /> laid much emphasis on the increases, paltry and meagre though they may be, but he spent little time on the more reactionary impositions in the measures proposed. I lay much of the blame on the strategy of the budget which was anti-employment and was geared towards unemployment.  Given the tone of the defeatism of the Minister so far as unemployment is concerned and the average of 193,000 unemployed, that must mean that during the current year the figure will be in excess of 200,000 unemployed. The last figure available was 188,000 people unemployed and the Minister has referred to a figure of 193,000.  He must have resigned himself to the fact that the Government are not prepared to do anything to protect people against job losses.</P>
    <P>In addition to the deliberate strategy of the budget, the severe cutbacks in public capital expenditure are affecting employment.  For the first time the Construction Industry Federation have taken advertising space in the national dailies to point to the hidden penalties of the budget and to show how they are affecting employment.  Because the figures have increased the cost is greater and the figures have increased and will continue to do so because of the strategy of the Government.  This is something the Minister and the Minister of State must face. To their eternal shame they are carrying the responsibility imposed on them by the people around the Cabinet table who took the decisions.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael and Labour Party backbenchers are being told that this is the strategy, that things will improve as time goes on and the election gets nearer.  This is how the parties hope to keep their backbenchers happy.  They are being told that money will be released when election time is near, that they will try to reduce unemployment.  However, in the meantime they will penalise every section.  This started some weeks ago with regard to school transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. I am relating it to budget strategy on unemployment and developments since then, particularly the charge of £10, the penalty being imposed on the job seekers. That strategy is responsible for the 193,000 unemployed, which figure will increase to 200,000 during the year.  The cutbacks in the public capital programme will make a further impact on employment. My party have always been caring and concerned.  We have had a human approach to the underprivileged, even when times were not good.  The parties opposite must realise they are the Government.  The responsibility is theirs and they should not try to lay it elsewhere. At the time of the general election we put our policies before the people and we explained what we would do.  At that time the advertisements issued by Fine Gael and the Labour Party were very clear.  They told the people that Fianna Fáil would put an end to many schemes. The people did not give us an overall majority but a situation was created where a deal of some sort was hammered out between the two parties.  Certain proposals were put to a meeting held in Limerick.</P>

The parties opposite said they would do the job much better and this Bill shows us what are their methods in the area of social welfare.</P>
      <P>I will refer briefly to the small farmers' dole because the matter has been covered very well by my colleague, Deputy O'Leary, this afternoon.  While it is not an issue that is causing any problems in my constituency, I am aware of the contribution it has made in the development of west Cork, the west coast generally and the south west.  The explanatory memorandum states that the decision was made because of the High Court judgment of 30 June 1982 which rendered unconstitutional sections of the Valuation Act.  We should be honest about the matter.  Everyone knows the case has been appealed.  This is an excuse advanced by the Minister who is embarrassed and ashamed to think that a Labour Party Minister is virtually spelling out the end of the dole for small farmers. If it were in any other country it would be regarded as an incentive scheme to help disadvantaged farmers.  The Ceann Comhairle knows the benefits and advantages gained by many small farmers in his constituency over a long period.  We all remember the situation 30 years ago and the improvements which have taken place since then.  It may sound attractive to say these things on the east coast but the people of rural Ireland will realise full well that, like many other things in this Bill, they are being used as a smokescreen to keep the emphasis off what is happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2269" /> Over the week-end the Minister for Social Welfare used abortion as a smokescreen to take the heat off this Bill. On another occasion there was a banner headline in a newspaper &mdash;&ldquo;crack down on dole spongers, says Desmond&rdquo;.  We all agree with this sentiment but it was used as a smokescreen.  There is nothing in this Bill which will cut out abuses.  I do not condone abuses.  My colleague Deputy Woods made considerably more progress in that area than any other holder of that office.  This Bill has been introduced for a different reason.  The blame has been laid on our shoulders. The Government said that certain proposals were suggested by us.  That is irrelevant now.  Even if some improvements were necessary these go beyond what we contemplated.  It is incomprehensible that a Labour Minister should introduce this Bill in the House and try to justify it.</P>
    <P>A fund has been created from PRSI contributions.  We are cutting back from 40 per cent to 25 per cent.  We did not contemplate going back that far.  We were contemplating 30 per cent, not 25 per cent.  The Coalition are not finished at that.  The Minister decided that 12 days was too short a time and he has extended it to 18 days.  In other words, one must now be idle for almost four weeks before one qualifies for pay-related benefit.  In his reply the Minister should take the case of a father of five children who is genuinely out of work through illness and say how he justifies cutting back the 40 per cent to 25 per cent, increasing the waiting time to 18 days and raising the £32 limit to £36.  A person has to be out of work for three and a half weeks now before he gets anything.  This is a vicious attack on the PRSI contributor who, for whatever reason, qualifies for entitlement to pay-related benefit.  It will create poverty to an extent never known before.</P>
    <P>Those of us who hold clinics are familiar with the people's problems.  This is why I criticise the Minister for having the big headline about cracking down on dole spongers.  We must eliminate those abusing the system, but this Bill does not do that.  The person I referred to is not a sponger nor is he abusing the system.  The amount of his benefit is cut substantially <Col N="2270" /> but the person abusing the system can still do so.  Perhaps he will not qualify for as much as he did before but he will do well by comparison with the genuine person. I suggest that 90 per cent or more of those on benefit are genuine.  There is no doubt that poverty was used to a disgraceful extent by the two parties opposite to solicit support.  I saw the crocodile tears shed in this House about poverty committees and organisations and the pittances being thrown out to keep them going.</P>
    <P>Members who run clinics know well about that&mdash;the young married person with a few children and a mortgage on his house genuinely wants a job and cannot get one.  They come to us and say they cannot pay the mortgage.  These people will be further penalised under this Bill. As Minister for Labour I was responsible for establishing the manpower consultative committee which did good work.  The Department of Social Welfare were represented on that and played an important role in the survey which was carried out. Very often that Department is criticised but as a public representative I received only courtesy, co-operation and help from all members of the staff.  I thank them and admire them for that because it cannot be easy in these difficult times. People are often criticised and vilified unfairly.  They deserve to be thanked when the service is as good as I found it.</P>
    <P>The committee carried out a survey on the unemployed and found a strong weighting in favour of the recent unemployed as compared with those who are longer down the road.  There is a serious anomaly between the two categories which should be looked at.  The committee did not offer any solution.  Did the Minister look at the survey and say that they would do it in such a way that everyone would be badly off from the beginning? That must be Labour Party philosophy.  If it is they should spell it out to those who look on them as being supporters of the workers.  Admittedly an unemployed person qualifies for a tax rebate or redundancy payments in the early stages and then qualifies for pay-related but when they have been on the live register for two years they come to <Col N="2271" /> us desperately looking for work and are distraught because they cannot get it.  The vast majority of those on the live register want work and would prefer to be working rather than to be in receipt of contributions from the State.</P>
    <P>Poverty was used and crocodile tears were shed by the Taoiseach when in Opposition.  They were also shed by members of his party and of the Labour Party.  When oppressive legislation was introduced in this House a number of years ago a colleague of mine spoke against it and said that the Labour Party were mopping up the crocodile tears. There is nobody to mop up the tears now. This measure goes very far in imposing new poverty and hardship on many people.</P>
    <P>Section 16, dealing with occupational injuries benefit and its extension to youth schemes, is the only section I welcome. It extends the scope of occupational injuries benefit to trainees in schemes approved by the Youth Employment Agency.  It says that this provision is intended to give such trainees the same cover as trainees under AnCO schemes. Everything else in the Bill will cause hardship and it is repressive.</P>
    <P>I agree with the need for the control of abuse of the three-day week.  However, what is the position of a docker, for example, who works one day per week and draws unemployment benefit for five days?  Will that now be reduced to four days?  I would have sympathy with someone in that position; he is drawing the dole because of scarcity of work.  I would like the Minister to spell out the impact and the effect that this one-day week will have.  People will suffer because of this and it will have far-reaching effects.  I want to expose the reason the Minister went to such pains to try to align the previous Government with the measures he is now bringing in.  He said that the previous Government had similar proposals to restrict the benefits available to short time workers and that we intended to bring them in from January 1983.  I want to refute the word &ldquo;similar&rdquo; because details had not been worked out by us and I suggest that we would have <Col N="2272" /> been wise and experienced enough to think of the man who could get only one day's work in a week.  I support the necessity for eliminating the abuses which existed but these are not measures to eliminate them.  They are measures to make less money available to people in need.  We have often heard about the Minister who cut back on the old age pension in the thirties.  Deputy Desmond will go down in history as the Minister who cut back so savagely on pay-related benefits.</P>
    <P>The Government are constantly trying to lay the blame for these measures elsewhere, especially in relation to pay-related benefits.  The Minister said in his speech that changes in the pay-related benefit scheme are provided in sections 8, 9 and 10 of the Bill and that this benefit was payable as a supplement to the flat rate unemployment and sickness benefit. One detects a patronising approach here. He said the overall levels of benefit available during sickness have been the subject of a degree of concern for some time but that much of the criticism had been exaggerated.  I agree with that.  But there are those, including the Minister, who are saying that this measure is designed to control the spongers and the abusers. That is not the case.</P>
    <P>I listened briefly to the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Fennell, rather weakly defending the withdrawal of the maternity grant.  I did not think she was defending it with as much enthusiasm as some other Minister would have liked her to do.  She said the grant of £8 was no longer of any real significance in the context of the maternity allowance scheme which was substantially improved two years ago for employed women on maternity leave. She did not say what Government introduced that measure.</P>
    <P>Deputy Desmond presented his case very weakly.  Obviously, he is a man who has no commitment to what his colleagues in Government have insisted he should do.  I have sympathy for him, because I know that he had a caring, human and social concern for the workers.</P>

I am sure Deputy Dukes is fully aware of the penal impositions which I presume he has forced Deputy Desmond to introduce. They have increased the waiting days to almost four weeks, so the man who is out of work for three and a half weeks gets no pay-related benefits.  They have increased the £32 disregarded reckonable earnings to £36, so we have had a three-pronged attack on the recipients.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday evening I dealt in detail with some of the problems that would arise for hotels, restaurants and other establishments as a result of a fall-off in tourism.  Ordinary weekend motoring is now a thing of the past.  The Minister yesterday announced that he intended to recoup a further £15 million from the hard-pressed petrol consumer, the consumer who needs his car to take him to his place of employment.  If that £15 million were passed on to the consumer the price of petrol per gallon could be reduced.  I am not sure of the exact calculation.  It could be 10 pence.  With the fall-off in revenue from petrol, with cross-Border traffic and so forth, I cannot say exactly what the differential would be and it would be hard for the Minister and his officials to give the exact figure. Indeed, in my long experience here, with all due respect to officials, sometimes their calculations could be inaccurate.  I have to remember that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hardest hit in the community is the motorist.  The same number of new cars will not be sold this year as were sold in other years.  The result of the increase in VAT has been the setting up in back yards of motor repair shops with the proprietors going from supplier to supplier for various parts.  Neither I nor my party condone that situation.  Most of the major garages are letting workers go.  Over the years garage owners have received no grants of any kind from State agencies. When garages were established it was through the goodwill of the proprietor and his bankers that the business got off the ground.  The situation now is that thousands of mechanics and panel beaters will become unemployed because of the increase in VAT and other higher <Col N="2277" /> charges on the motorist.  I believe that before the middle of the year the price of crude will be about $10 a barrel.  The price war is hotting up.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated he would be taking £15 million off the motorist.  In the budget he left the figure vague.  I am open to correction on that.  I shall be very interested to hear from my friends in America what the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Cluskey, is telling them in New York, Chicago and Philadelphia about tourism here, because if he tells the truth he will have to admit we are the dearest for petrol, for hotel accommodation, for food and many other things.  Leading economists have admitted that.  The Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism should prepare a package for tourists coming into the country, the Americans and the British, who will spend money in the country.  He should make a grant available to the travel agents to enable them to put special packages together to make the country attractive to the tourist.  We must remember the enormous sums spent in past years by tourists.  We are no longer attractive and travel agents say there is a big drop in bookings.  The position must be reviewed immediately.  If it is not reviewed the trade will collapse and, once it collapses, it will be impossible to restore confidence.  I emphasise that point.  The issue involved is most important. I trust our contributions to this debate will be borne in mind.  A great deal of harm has been done because of the policy adopted by the Minister. Nevertheless at this last minute maybe he will be able to take our advice on this and put a package together which will help the tourist coming to this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;about the recent price increases to which the Deputies have <Col N="2278" /> referred in their motion.  There has been more than one reason for price increases in petrol and oil products since the beginning of the year.  On 8 January the excise duty on petrol was increased by 15p a gallon and on 1 March VAT changes brought about an increase of 11p a gallon. On 8 January there was an increase of between 2p and 6p a gallon on petrol arising from the requirements of the INPC and the oil companies as recommended by the National Prices Commission, and on 1 March there was an increase of some 3p a gallon arising again from a recommendation of the National Prices Commission on foot of a request made by the petrol retailers.</P>
      <P>I know that Deputy Flynn and his colleagues are deploring the recent number of price increases and I would like them to state if they are deploring tax increases &mdash; which of course they are &mdash; the increase for the petrol retailers in whose defence Deputy Connolly has been very eloquent, and the increases for the oil companies who had presented a request duly sanctioned by the National Prices Commission.  I would like to have it clear whether they are deploring all of them, and if so, what answer they have to give to petrol retailers to defend their deploring of the increase on the margin for the petrol retailers.  I am afraid that this motion is one of those rather unreflecting motions that take one matter in isolation. Both Deputy Flynn and Deputy Connolly, to their credit as orators I suppose, have worked up a fine head of steam about this, completely on one side of the issue without examining in any way the other side which they have been very careful to avoid but to which I would like to draw some attention.  I would like to know what Deputy Flynn and Deputy Connolly would have in mind from a budgetary point of view.  To help them in their thinking about that I remind them of a few more facts that underlie the case they are making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In January we had excise duty increases.  The total revenue raised by those excise duty increases, taking all of the products covered, was £119 million. In the budget we had taxation and other increases, all of them recorded there, <Col N="2279" /> which raised another £349 million gross in revenue.  I add as a sweetener that the tax increases on petrol and other oil products this year will raise a total of some £76 million.  We are talking about substantial sums of money.  That figure for the increases in taxes on petrol and oil of £76 million in the context of the total budget and total public spending does not appear so very large, but is nevertheless a considerable sum.  The total amount of new revenue between excises in January and budget increases is over £460 million.  At the end of that we still have a current budget deficit of just under £900 million for this year.  That is a very considerable sum, but I am bound to point out that Deputy Flynn's and Deputy Connolly's party opined towards the end of last year that the current budget deficit should be £750 million. How in deploring these price increases, the reasons for which I have given, would they go about arriving at the targets which they have stated as being desirable for the current budget deficit?  In order to do that they would have had to find another £150 million either of expenditure cuts to which they seem to object and which they seem to rule out, because on every occasion when we talk about that in this House we have a storm of wails from the Opposition benches or by taxation increases which they deplore.  If it were to be by way of taxation increases they would have to find £150 million on top of the £460 million which we have had to find this year. In other words, they would have had to find another £1 for every £3 in taxation that we have raised.  If we apply that proportion, for example, to the excise duty increases in petrol instead of finding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is commendable of the Opposition that so many of them seem to have a great feeling that they would like to join one of the parties in government. I would advise them to take that up in the right quarter.  The next point I am making is that in order to get the kind of result which the Deputies opposite say they would have got in the overall budget context they would have had to impose new taxation or expenditure cuts on a much larger scale than we have done.  The motion they have put down patently ignores that and is being milked simply for the facile kind of remark that we have heard from both of the Deputies in this debate so far.  Is Deputy Flynn aware that <Col N="2281" /> we have gone about as far in reducing expenditure as we could because we are within a budgetary framework which is very constrained?  As a country we are within an economic framework which is very constrained and we must live within that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In that context we have gone as far as we could in the short time available to us in adjusting expenditure in order to bring expenditure into line with what we believe to be the proper and prudent overall financial targets.  In doing that we have had to take action to validate Estimates decisions made by the main Opposition party when they were in government.  I am not so sure if Deputy Flynn and Deputy Connolly are aware that we had to take action to avoid a £151 million overrun or potential overrun on expenditure in order to get the kind of balance that we now have, less desirable in their own terms than the kind of targets they put up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking Deputy Connolly to explain how he could have done it.  The fact remains that it would not have been possible for the party opposite to do what would get the kind of results they wanted to get without imposing an even higher level of taxation than we have imposed or without reducing expenditure by an even larger amount than we have reduced it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we had to look to extra taxation, I think we would all agree that on taxation the options are rather limited and that we are forced inevitably to look at taxation of what we call the old reliables and VAT.  There we are constrained also. Our VAT rates are held by many people to be very high.  In fact, if one looks at the total incidence of value-added tax on <Col N="2282" /> the total consumer expenditure on goods and services the result is an effective average flat rate of 14 per cent, which is not very high by international standards. The distribution of this incidence of taxation is a matter very much for ourselves to decide.  We have decided over a number of years that a large proportion of consumer expenditure would be effectively free of VAT.  That inevitably means that the rate of VAT on the products subject to it must necessarily and inevitably be rather high, which it is at the moment.  That is what has brought us to the present levels of taxation.</P>
    <P>Last night, Deputy Flynn voiced the opinion that I was adjusting the figures in the budget to suit myself, in the hope of creating a fund which I could use in some underhand way to purchase votes at an election.  If I were given to the use of unparliamentary language &mdash; which I am not&mdash;I would be tempted to say that that is exactly the kind of empty-headed repetition of secondhand ideas for which the Deputy is justly famous.</P>

I will skip a sentence or two and continue: &ldquo;The Government proposed to absorb some of this reduction at retail level by increasing the excise duty on petrol and other road vehicle fuels&rdquo;. I skip another couple of sentences.  &ldquo;I am providing for a yield of £15 million this year from this source.  The Dáil will, of course, be given an opportunity to debate these increases&rdquo;.</P>

It is the kind of thing which he, as a Member of this House, should not allow himself to say inside or outside this House.

I am glad to say that there is no way in which any Government in this country can impose taxation increases of that kind without being subject to democratic procedures. As the Deputies opposite know very well because they did it themselves, if the Dáil happens not to be in session when revenues like this are raised, there is a procedure, and order under which the revenues can be raised and the order can then be debated when the House is next in session.  The Deputies opposite know all about it if they have any memory, because they have done it themselves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies opposite call upon the Government to ensure that consumer prices fully reflect reductions in world prices of oil.  I have explained this evening, as I explained in the Budget Statement, why the Government have chosen a different course.  There are a few basic facts which it would do the Deputies well to reflect on.  Any reduction in the world price of this commodity benefits this country.  It increases our real income, it reduces the price of something which we need to buy in order to produce our goods and services, it increases our real income by improving our balance of payments position, for example.  It increases our wealth because we export less goods in order to cover the cost of the imports.  Whatever the incidence of the reduction within our economy, whether we reflect it all in consumer prices or use part of it to finance necessary Government expenditure, the fact remains that there is a real benefit to the economy as a whole from any such reduction.  We are all justifiably hopeful that this year there will be a real benefit in our country, our economy and our people from this development.  However we apply the benefit, there is a gain to the country as a whole.  The Government decided in this case that it was better to absorb the sum of this reduction in price by way of an increase in tax revenue rather than finding themselves in the position of being obliged to raise additional tax revenues on products, the price of which has not fallen.  In the circumstances, that is a perfectly reasonable way of going about our business and a perfectly <Col N="2286" /> reasonable way of raising finance to fund the necessary expenditure which we all believe has to be met.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Flynn argued that the benefit in this way will not directly go to the consumer, the fact remains that had we not raised the revenue in this way we would have had to raise it elsewhere.  As we all on this side know and Deputies opposite are gradually becoming aware, there is only one group of people who can pay the cost of any measure to finance the running of this country and that is our people.</P>

He went considerably outside the terms of the Opposition motion in suggesting a number of other schemes, concessions or <Col N="2287" /> measure which would have an effect on industries about which he and all of us were worried.

      <P>We must, as a legislature, show some responsibility in the way we go about dealing with the problems. Deputy Connolly, in making that case, carefully omitted any reference as to how he would raise the necessary funds for those measures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not getting £15 million extra?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy omitted any reference as to how he would raise the revenue.  He still has not understood, apparently, that the £15 million which we expect to get on the source in question is fully accounted for in the budget arithmetic, clearly and unambiguously set out. Deputy Flynn spoke last night of what he alleges to be the narrow fiscal mentality of this Government.  I ask where are the vestiges of the party who, when in Government, produced a spurious plan solely on the basis that it was done with the advice of experts and economists? The very party whips a short while before that in Opposition decried the contributions to be made by experts and economists. On this issue that party, and Deputy Flynn in particular, are doing what they have always done, weather-cocking, bending with every wind that blows without any consistency.  That problem is shown very clearly in this motion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, since Deputy Connolly asked me last evening what kind of increases would be required to raise revenue in the way I have mentioned &mdash; he spoke about 10p or 15p and he did it again this evening &mdash; I am bound to say I am very glad he is over there and not here because, quite honestly, his arithmetic is rather bad.  If we were to raise this revenue by putting it on petrol only from 1 April next we <Col N="2288" /> would need 7p per gallon in order to raise that revenue over the remainder of the year, or 8p per gallon from 1 May next&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>And it would depend on buoyancy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and less than that if we spread it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and less than that if we spread it over other oil products, and less than that again if we varied the timing of the measure over the year, dependent on the changes in world prices.  I am confident that the revenue I expect to raise from that will be there because of what we already know about the likely developments in oil prices at world level this year.</P>
      <P>For all of those reasons I would ask the House to look at the amendment the Government have tabled.  I shall read it for Deputy Connolly in case he has not understood its significance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply want to explain why the amendment was put down to the motion.  I agree with the arguments advanced by Fianna Fáil Deputies in regard to the effect of the increase in the price of petrol on prices and on the economy generally because of the huge effect which the cost of transport have on all products.  Therefore I would agree with the motion that the lowering of prices should be reflected in a reduction of price at the pumps.  But I submit that their motion will not bring about this effect because the Minister not absorbing the price into the Exchequer does not mean that the oil companies will pass the lowered prices on to the consumer.  Therefore I suggest that the Fianna Fáil motion does not take into consideration the power and control which the major oil companies have on products and prices and thereby also on the economy on the cost of transport and so on.  It is for that reason that I put down this amendment No. 2 reading:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;ensure&rdquo; and substitue:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;that there is adequate modern refining capacity in the country, under State control, so that the price of petrol and oil products to Irish consumers can fully reflect reductions in the world price of oil.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2292" /> The Minister in his opening remarks made it very clear that the oil companies would not be reflecting the lower cost of oil products in the price to the consumer. He made the point that the oil companies are very profit-oriented.  He pointed out that when they closed down the Whitegate refinery because of its cost &mdash; it was affecting their profits, it was too costly &mdash; they did not pass on the reduction to the consumer at any stage.  This is a very significant point made by the Minister which indicates to me that the oil companies would not pass on any further world reductions by lowering the price of oil at the pumps.</P>
    <P>The oil companies here want to decide our oil policies &mdash; they want to have total control.  They are very profit-oriented and they deal solely with their parent companies in Britain.  They decide their policies here on the basis of the parent companies' policy in Britain.  They tell us that they do not make profits here and therefore pay no tax because they actually pass on the profits to the parent companies and the profits are not reflected in the Irish subsidiaries but they are in the parent companies.  By this trick the oil companies here do not pay the taxes they should be paying.  Only some hundreds of thousands of pounds have been paid in taxes here in the past couple of decades rather than millions.  The result is that the motorists here have to pay the taxes, part of which the oil companies should be paying.  All are put back on to the motorists and the transport companies.</P>
    <P>They wish also to decide our policy in regard to refining capacity here.  They do not want us to have our own refining capacity.  They did not want to build Whitegate in the first place and when the opportunity came they closed it down. They fought tooth and nail some years ago against an independent company that wished to establish an oil refinery in Dublin port.  The battle they put up then was very significant.  They did not want any rival company to set up refining capacity here because what they want to use is the major refinery at Milford Haven and the other parent companies' refining capacity.  The danger was shown <Col N="2293" /> during the oil crisis some years ago when not alone were we not given the total of the capacity of Whitegate but some oil products of Whitegate went back to England.</P>
    <P>The oil companies decide our policy to a great extent.  We must control them if we are to bring the price of petrol down for the consumer.  The Minister said it would cost £600 million to establish a refinery.  I do not know where he got that figure because I do not think it has been costed to that extent.  Whitegate, for which the Minister made a strong case &mdash; the Coalition and the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government were totally committed to the need for Whitegate for strategic reasons &mdash; is totally out of date as a refinery and within the next decade it must go in any case.  The present Minister and the outgoing Minister will be aware of that.  It will not be a viable proposition throughout the next decade.  Therefore, modern oil refining capacity will be required.  If we believe, as the present and previous Governments did, that we must have our own refining capacity in ten years, we must consider the establishment of a modern oil refinery.  In this amendment I simply ask the Coalition Government to make the appropriate decisions now to provide through the INPC a modern oil refinery.  If we are to plan for a decade hence we must make the decisions now because it would take ten years to bring such a refinery into production.  The amendment, therefore, is simply asking for reality in the debate.</P>
    <P>I agree with the purpose of the Fianna Fáil motion but I do not think they took into account the decisions and policies which the oil companies would be operating. I regard the Minister's amendment as being totally unacceptable and unconstitutional. They propose that a decision can be made now that any lowering of prices will be added at the petrol pump and taken into the Exchequer.  It is totally unprecedented and should be totally unacceptable by all in the House.  A decision like that should not be made in advance without each time coming before the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann deplores the recent number of large increases in the price of petrol and other oil products and, in view of the effects of these increases on the family budget, calls on the Government to ensure that the price of petrol and oil products to the consumer fully reflects reductions in the world price of oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion was ably and eloquently moved by Deputy Flynn and supported with some vigour by Deputy Connolly. The massive increases in the price of petrol and other oil products since the change of Government already have had a devastating effect on the economy. When stocks of oil bought in before the savage increases run out the effects will be all the more severe.  If we move into <Col N="2295" /> a period when oil usage will increase, particularly in the agricultural sector, input prices in that industry will skyrocket and greatly damage an industry which has taken a very bad beating in recent months.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the nation's greatest industry, a fact not readily accepted by many, certainly not by the Government. They have missed no opportunity to strangle the industry.  They show little sensitivity to its potential.  With proper attention and commitment the industry can grow and be the saviour of the economy.  Our agricultural exports are the envy of the industrial world.  Their value has increased significantly in the last ten years.  Since the introduction of the farm modernisation scheme the industry has become more regulated and production has grown out of all recognition, which means that any incentives provided to farming are reacted to and will repay State investment a hundredfold. With the demise of the farm modernisation scheme, caused by this Government, we can expect production levels to fall and exports to fall with a dramatic consequent loss of jobs and revenue to the State.</P>
    <P>Farming needs fair play.  Farming deserves fair play.  Every £1 spent on farming yields handsome dividends.  We put down this motion to ensure that the improvement in world oil prices is passed on to the consumer.  In the case of agriculture it would certainly be a wise investment. It may not &mdash; and I emphasise this &mdash; be regarded as a prop-up situation. We are witnessing a change in world oil prices.  It is confidently expected that there will be a significant drop in those prices.  This drop is a result of many factors, the major one being the fall-off in usage because of the recession, which was caused in the first instance by massive increases in oil prices in the seventies when the OPEC countries stretched their prices beyond the limits of world endurance.</P>
    <P>Oil was bought in this country at those enormous costs.  This increased the cost of living beyond our capacity.  To retain set standards of living, people spent <Col N="2296" /> beyond their means.  Now that a little sanity has come into the world situation it was hoped that sanity would prevail here too, and that any price reductions would be passed on to the consumer.  In this country neither sanity nor decency prevailed.  Greed took over and every penny of the reduction was devoured by the Coalition Government as a shoal of piranhas would devour its prey with no mercy shown.</P>
    <P>The agricultural industry uses approximately 30 per cent of our total consumption of oil.  This shows the massive dependence of the industry on oil.  Our imports are as follows according to the CSO: 1980, 6,048,342 tons at a value of £722 million; 1981, almost 5,000,000 tons rat a value of £852 million; 1982, January to November, inclusive, 4,000,000 tons at a value of £812 million.  One ton represents approximately 275 Imperial gallons of fuel as we know it.  We are paying far more for less oil, as can be clearly seen.  Had we imported the same amount of oil in 1982 as we did in 1980, with oil at 1982 prices, our bill would have been a massive £1,200 million.  This is the cost of the main part of our energy bill.</P>
    <P>Slightly less than one-third of that amount is withdrawn from farming, £4,000 million.  It is hard to believe.  With this massive withdrawal from agriculture one could have expected that any benefits accuring to us from outside would gladly be passed on, but no.  The Government vultures are hovering ready to pounce, not interested in the wellbeing of their prey.  They need their meat today, for today, and they behave as if tomorrow will never come.</P>
    <P>Any reduction in oil prices would give the sector confidence at this time, and the industry could surely do with a boost. Red diesel, as it is commonly known, is used by farmers in their tractors, combine harvesters, self-propelled silage harvesters, self-propelled beet harvesters, and there are massive numbers of these machines around the country.  In County Wexford alone there are 7,000 tractors, 500 over 80 horse power, 2,800 between 50 and 80 horse power, 2,500 between 35 and 51 horse power, and 900 in the 30 horse power bracket.  Almost all of those <Col N="2297" /> tractors use red diesel.  Very few are still using the old TVO with petrol used as a primer.</P>
    <P>Approximately 50 per cent of the tractors in this great agricultural county are over 50 horse-power and therefore are big users of fuel.  Fuel is now one of the massive inputs into agricultural production. A reduction in the price of that oil would be a much-needed shot in the arm at this stage.  Morale in farming is at an all-time low and needs a lift.  It is at an all-time low because of the fall in the prices of agricultural produce, and other price increases in inputs over the past few years.  Indeed, farmers' incomes, as per an independent survey, dropped by some 70 per cent over the past three years.  I ask the House: what other sector would accept this?  None.  Every sector seeks and gets increases in double figures, and normally can keep pace with inflation.</P>
    <P>The drop in farmers' incomes is now reflected in the unemployment situation. With little development on the farms, a drop in employment in the building trade is caused.  With little interest in the service industries to agriculture, a further increase in unemployment levels is caused.  Less fertiliser is used, which means less production.  A loss of jobs in creameries, co-ops, grain stores, meat factories, and so on, has meant fewer jobs in fertiliser factories, as we saw in Albatros in the past year.  There are no sales of machinery and there are consequent losses in garages around the country, and an encouragement to go into the black economy as was mentioned earlier by my colleague Deputy Connolly.</P>
    <P>Further fuel price increases will exacerbate this situation.  Agricultural machinery is a glutton for oil consumption. In County Wexford &mdash; and these figures are provided by the ACOT offices there &mdash; there are 900 combine harvesters, 300 beet harvesters, 1,600 bailers, 200 single chop forage harvesters, 300 double chop forage harvesters and 100 precision chop forage harvesters.</P>
    <P>Silage harvesting is one of the heavier elements of fuel consumption in farming. Silage making is a great art and has now replaced the traditional art of haymaking. In County Wexford, as an instance, <Col N="2298" /> some 75 per cent of the winter feed is silage.  The advent of silage on farms has brought with it an ease of winter feed with far less labour intensity.  In recent years silage quality has improved.  This very beneficial aspect of farming is now threatened because of input costs, mainly fuel.  To protect the quality of silage we have now achieved, the Government must take cognisance of the price of fuel oil for farmers.</P>
    <P>To acquaint the uninitiated with the value of quality silage and the necessity for it, it is simply a matter of pure economics. The greater the quality of the silage the better the feed, the better the feed the better the product, the better the product the greater the profit, the greater the profit the greater the input into our economy, in which we should all be interested.</P>
    <P>In a survey carried out last year in Wexford of 57 agricultural contractors, with their main emphasis on silage making, the number of acres of silage harvested in the county was 36,000.  This was on 1,100 farms.  The amount of silage made by contractors is 80 per cent and the number of new silage makers each year is on the increase and is now at 150. The situation of the contractors is that 40 per cent of the larger contractors are in serious financial difficulties: some 32 per cent have smaller financial problems but they are behind in their payments. Almost half the silage cut in Wexford is by contractors and I think this would be reflected throughout the country.  It takes nine gallons of red diesel to cut, transport and ensile one acre of grass.  This is an enormous cost to the customer and the contractor and it has almost put the contractor out of business.  If that happens the blame will lie with the Minister and the Government because of their insistence in grabbing the last penny.  If the drop in fuel prices was passed on it would protect the contractor who would, in turn, provide a necessary service to the farmer.  In addition, there would be a massive benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that it takes two and a half gallons of fuel to plough one acre of ground and eight gallons to <Col N="2299" /> service a crop of barley or wheat?  Does he realise it takes 12 gallons to service the growing of an acre of sugar beet? With margins so slim at this time it is vital that the price reduction be passed on to the farmer.  When one considers there are 228,000 acres of pasture, 22,000 acres of beet, 16,000 acre of wheat, 32,000 acres of malting barley and 78,000 acres of feeding barley in Wexford, it is easier to understand the importance of passing on the reduction.</P>
    <P>We can conclude that this Government have no commitment to agriculture. There was the scrapping of the Farm Modernisation Scheme and a decision to tax all farmers irrespective of their incomes, even though figures have been provided independently by An Foras Talúntais to show that two-thirds of the farmers have not a taxable income.  In my opinion this proposal is to accommodate the Labour Party whose members from time to time have called for the full nationalisation of land.  There has been the introduction for the first time of VAT on fuel oil for farmers and the increase in the VAT rate on agricultural contracting at a time when farming is at a low ebb. This is done despite the fact that it is acknowledged that when agriculture is down so too is the economy.  Yet, the Government squeeze and try to drag the soul out of the industry.  With any recognition by the Government agriculture will progress and flourish.  That opportunity is there now.  I ask the Government to pass on the benefit of the drop in oil prices to the consumers.  Agriculture has never let the country down.</P>
    <P>Closely allied to the agricultural section is the horticulture industry where fruit and vegetables are grown under glass.  This industry has a high labour content.  At one stage it was seasonal but now it is an all-year round operation because the operators are using energy sources to heat their greenhouses in winter in order to propagate faster growth. The glasshouse industry has become a specialised industry and it must be encouraged.  When one considers there were imports of horticultural produce to the value of £280 million last year, it is <Col N="2300" /> obvious that something must be done about the matter.  If these imports were halted and if the items in question were produced at home there would be more jobs and our balance of payments would look more respectable.</P>
    <P>In 1970 there were more than 400 acres under glass.  Today that figure has fallen to 200 acres.  The owners of the enterprises are highly qualified, specialised people and they have investigated every avenue to improve the margins which were minimal for this year.  A sale in County Waterford of three acres of glass on a seven acre site will demonstrate the present position and the margins available to the people.  This enterprise was sold for £30,000 even though its replacement value was £300,000.  It must be obvious from that that this industry is not an attractive one at this time.</P>
    <P>The trend is towards a lessening of this great industry which has tremendous potential.  If something is not done to help it there will be a further increase in imports and there will be a further imbalance in our economy.  We must ask ourselves if we are serious about helping the industry.  Do we consider it is vital to our economy?</P>

It was for that reason and so as not to create a precedent that I made the point I did.

The Government can do this by passing on the reduction in oil prices on the world market to the producers. It takes 35,000 gallons of oil to service one acre of glass.  It is easy to understand how a small reduction in the price per gallon would give the necessary boost to an ailing industry and one which is fast diminishing.

      <P>We must deal in a practical way with the problems which are facing the Border constituencies in relation to the enormous increase in the price of petrol.  We now have the highest petrol prices in Europe as a result of the increases announced in January and the further increases announced in the budget.  The effect of these increases on sales of petrol in my constituency, which is a Border county, is catastrophic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have to say in relation to County <Col N="2306" /> Louth pertains to other Border counties as well.</P>
    <P>Some petrol filling stations and garages along the Border have closed down.  Others are on the point of closure and many more are operating on a short-time basis. The already serious unemployment situation in these areas is being exacerbated. It is clear that the Government in introducing enormous increases in petrol prices showed little concern and little understanding for the traumatic effect these increases would have on trade, commerce and tourism in the Border counties.  Perhaps the fact that there is no Minister from the Border counties in the Government is reflected in that decision taken by them.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I wrote to the Minister for Finance outlining the position of the owner of a garage in Dundalk faced with the exorbitant increases in petrol prices introduced by the Government.  I did so to give the Minister some idea as to the manner in which these increases were undermining business in the Border areas and in the hope that he would introduce measures to alleviate the situation.  I regret to say I have not even received an acknowledgement to my letter.</P>
    <P>The young garage owner in question operates a 24-hour petrol service in Dundalk. At the beginning of January 1983 his sales averaged 8,000 gallons per week. The first petrol price increase was introduced by the Government early in January and, by 18 February 1983, sales had fallen to just over 3,000 gallons per week and at that point he was losing £50 per week on wages alone, without taking account of other overheads such as electricity and so on.  Since then, the further increase in petrol prices resulting from increased VAT has further reduced his sales and his position has now become untenable.  After the January increase, most of his petrol sales were made between 12 midnight and 8 a.m., simply because petrol stations in Northern Ireland are closed during the night.</P>
    <P>A few more statistics from the Dundalk area will throw further light on the crisis there.  A garage selling 6,000 gallons of petrol per week is now reduced to selling 1,500 gallons per week.  This garage had <Col N="2307" /> sales of 800 gallons per week of motor diesel but it is now selling 200 gallons per week.  Another garage selling 10,000 gallons of petrol per week is now reduced to selling 2,500 gallons, and sales of 2,000 gallons of motor diesel per week have been reduced to 200 gallons per week.  In respect of the latter two garages, four men have been made redundant.  Sales in a large garage in Dundalk have been halved but when I spoke to the owner, he told me they had been kept going to date by credit customers.  I understand, however, they are now also pulling out. A garage with relatively large sales, situated 20 miles from the Border in my constituency, has had a drop of 25 per cent in sales.  Drogheda is also adversely affected.</P>
    <P>The figures I have given give some idea of the problem in my constituency, and these problems are to be found in every Border county.  Garages in Border counties have, in many instances, stopped retaining people to look after petrol pumps because of the slump in sales.  To appreciate fully the tremendous financial pressures resulting from the situation, one must also take into account the immense amount of money necessary to fill garage petrol tanks.  A quick turnover in sales is necessary for survival.  The pressure has been so great on the young man to whom I referred that he has had to rent out his repair workshop to the mechanic he had working for him, and he now foresees the business he worked so hard to build up crashing around him. Motorists in a large part of County Louth buy £2 worth of petrol to take them over the Border to fill their tanks.</P>
    <P>In the Cooley Peninsula the situation is especially depressing.  There are three filling stations in the Omeath area, two of which are now closed.  On a recent Monday the total intake in petrol sales by the remaining filling station was £23, most of which was sales to official cars, and one other customer bought £2 worth of petrol to take him over the Border.  A major worry in the Cooley Peninsula is that soon there will be neither garages nor filling stations open.  Greenore port will be severly affected because of the <Col N="2308" /> extra transport costs and it will be cheaper to serve the Dublin market from the port across the lough in Northern Ireland.  Hauliers from Liverpool will serve the market in Dublin at less cost than hauliers from the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have always been a strong advocate of buying Irish goods, especially those locally made.  The long-term effects of buying goods outside the State will result in severe damage to our economy, causing unemployment and making jobs more insecure.  When one takes account, however, of the fact that there is a saving of between £9 and £10 when filling a ten-gallon car tank with petrol in Northern Ireland, as compared with buying petrol in County Louth, and when one takes cognisance of the reduction in incomes here resulting from the recent budget, one can at least understand why so many people in Border areas avail of petrol at the cheaper price.</P>
    <P>The need for immediate action by the Minister for Finance, who is responsible for the huge difference in price, must be obvious.  The side effects of the exodus to Northern Ireland from Border counties to buy petrol are also very serious.  The savings on petrol are used to buy goods in Northern Ireland, and the huge VAT increases make many types of goods there more attractive.  As a result, there is a tremendous fall-off in trading in my constituency, especially in Dundalk and surrounding areas.  It is depressing to find shops that were, until recently, hives of industry having few customers.  Cross-Border trading is having a serious effect on employment in Border areas, and, as time goes on, this situation will be exacerbated unless action is taken now.</P>
    <P>The depressing conditions being experienced in my constituency are also being felt in all Border counties.  The <i>Dundalk Democrat</i> said recently that they disliked using such dismal and morbid descriptions as ghost towns but, if things continued as they were, they believed that that adjective would not be too dramatic or exaggerated to describe in a few years' time a group of once thriving and bustling towns stretching along the Border from Dundalk to the top of Donegal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> Those words describe the feelings and the fears of business people in my constituency. I wonder if the Minister and the Government took account, when preparing the budget proposals, of the loss of revenue which is resulting from his tax impositions.  If he did, it is logical to assume that the general level of taxation is higher than it need be.  Would it not have been more sensible to have introduced a lower level of taxation on petrol so as to make it less attractive to buy petrol and other goods in Northern Ireland?  I am in full agreement with this motion but as a representative of a Border constituency, I have to ask for much more.  While the implementation of this motion would help to some extent, there is a strong case to be made for other worthwhile concessions by the Government to help people trading in Border counties.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects of this petrol price problem which lack of time prevents me from dealing with, such as tourism in Border areas.  The cost of living has soared in towns in my constituency because of the recent tax increases <Col N="2310" /> imposed by the Government which are far above the cost of living in Northern Ireland, resulting in trade and business being drained northwards with consequent further job losses.  Because of this, immediate action must be taken by the Minister.  Having read the amendment put forward by the Minister for Finance, I have not got very much hope, but, perhaps, having listened to the statements which have been made by speakers on this side of the House, he might at least reconsider his position.  Increased petrol prices have had a catastrophic effect on business in Border areas, not only because of the increase in the price of petrol but because of the fact that this increase encourages people to cross the Border and to spend their money on a variety of other goods which, if circumstances were different, they might have bought at home.  I, therefore, recommend the motion in the name of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must confess that had I known I had only eight minutes I doubt if I would have proceeded to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  However, I am grateful to you for granting me the opportunity of referring very briefly to the subject matter of Question No. 13 on today's Order Paper.  I would like to direct the attention of the House to the words I used in that question and I suggested that the matter was of importance as a major opportunity for North-South economic co-operation.  For that reason I addressed the question to the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach obviously did not think that North-South economic co-operation was of sufficient importance to engage his attention and he passed it to the Minister for Industry and Energy. The Minister for Industry and Energy apparently had some commitment elsewhere and he did not regard it as of any great importance either, so he passed it to his Minister of State.  Now I understand that the Minister of State who dealt with the question in the House today has taken himself off somewhere and we are left with none other than the Minister for the Public Service, an admirable Minister in many ways but not one who I would imagine is familiar with this matter.</P>
      <P>Apart from the Kinsale gas delivery to Northern Ireland the negotiations with Harland and Wolff over the possible order of a bulk carrier for the ESB's coal trade for the new generating station at Moneypoint represent, in my view, one of the biggest co-operative ventures between North and South that has ever been discussed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter arose originally out of a study by the National Board for Science and Technology into the coal shipping trade which would be created by the new ESB coal-fired power station at Moneypoint. That study was concerned with maximising the benefit to the Irish economy of this lucrative trade, in particular by the use of Irish-manned and Irish-built ships.  The National Board for Science and Technology's Coal Shipping study foresaw the need for a very large carrier of around 120,000 tonnes for the <Col N="2314" /> long-distance trade from North and South possibly get Irish Shipping, the ESB &mdash;</P>
    <P>In Belfast, Harland and Wolff are capable of building large 130,000 tonne bulk carriers that will be needed in 1986 and 1988.  The Belfast yard specialises in very large vessels and they hope to win new orders for the large bulk carriers that will be needed for the forming international coal trade.</P>
    <P>The study pointed out, however, that both Verolme and Harland required very heavy subsidies from their respective national exchequers in order to compete. The study continued:</P>
    <P>We believe, however, that the possibility for arranging through inter-Government negotiations appropriate financial packages for the building of a large bulk carrier in Belfast should be taken into account.</P>
    <P>This study was done by our National Board for Science and Technology attached to the Department of the Taoiseach. Now the trade union leaders in the Belfast shipyard were made aware of the contents and even before I had returned to office on 9 March 1982 I was informed that they wished to see me.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the shipyard of Harland and Wolff have been in difficulties for some time, that they are in receipt of substantial subsidies from the British Government and even then found it almost impossible to get orders.  I need not remind this House that Harland and Wolff is a famous shipyard, symbolising for over 100 years the industrial prowess of the north-east of Ireland.  The agreed communiqué which was issued after my meeting with the trade unionists from Harland and Wolff on 5 April 1982 stated:</P>
    <P>The Taoiséach expressed the view that the Harland and Wolff shipyard should be regarded as an asset with potential value for Ireland as a whole and looked forward to closer and more continuous contact in the future.  In view of the fact that Ireland was developing rapidly from the industrial point of view and demand for heavy engineering <Col N="2315" /> work steadily growing, it was agreed that Harland and Wolff could play an important part in the future development of the Irish economy and the Irish Government have consistently encouraged such a development.</P>
    <P>I mention those facts at the outset as a background to what subsequently happened. Very briefly, the view of my Government was that this was an important economic project and that, if at all possible, we should try to have it contained within this country if we could possibly get Irish Shipping, the ESB &mdash; and the Irish Government, of course &mdash; and the Harland and Wolff shipyard all involved to come together to try to get the maximum benefit for this country out of this coal trade for Moneypoint.  We brought the negotiations along as much as we could.  First of all, unfortunately Irish Shipping, because of their particular situation, could not become involved and then we sought other means of having a bulk carrier built in Belfast which would be used by the ESB to carry this coal to Moneypoint.</P>
    <P>There was much complicated negotiation going on, but all the while the ESB, with that particular outlook that they demonstrate from time to time, were really only concerned with their own narrow viewpoint and getting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case, it is hopeless. I cannot really develop my argument. I must therefore, conclude by making this simple point.  I blame, first of all, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste for not pursuing the negotiations which we had commenced to a successful conclusion, for not pursuing this important North-South economic project.  In fact, as far as I can see, they dismissed it as unimportant and reneged on their duty as national leaders in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also want to criticise the ESB because, as far as one can gather, they unilaterally made no attempt to get this project brought to a successful conclusion. Instead as an Irish monopoly State <Col N="2316" /> company, they placed an order for this trade with a Japanese shipping company &mdash; an order worth about 22 or 23 million US dollars.  They placed that order with a Japanese shipping company, securing no return benefit whatever for this country. I believe that this is typical of the attitude of the ESB in many regards.  We all have to buy our electricity from the ESB.  We have no alternative, they have a monopoly.</P>

      <P>The complaint about the time made by the Leader of the Opposition bears more heavily upon me than it did upon him.  That is the fault of neither of us.  The kernel of this matter is that at the time when the present Government came into office there was really only one live project on the table and that project was not among the ESB's short list of tenders for the coal-carrying project.  It was a tenderer who had, of his own initiative, come back into the picture offering terms <Col N="2317" /> for coal-carrying and terms for building ships.  It was difficult to assess the validity of the shipbuilding terms.  There were significant points still remaining for negotiation and on the coal-carrying contract a clear penalty of some 6 million US dollars over four years, minimum, would have obtained.  The ESB would have been obliged to make that payment. There were also other conditions relating to all subsequent coal-carrying contracts for a period of ten years.  There was no certainty as to whether the one remaining live project might have come to fruition. It would have taken, indeed, some six months of most detailed negotiations.  I mention that in the context of the fact that the ESB had, at the request of the then Government, deferred their decision on the placing of this contract, on at least four occasions over a period from last summer.</P>
      <P>The situation is that they initially were not restricted or qualified in their going to tender to the world shipping companies for the carrying of the remaining volume of coal other than those carried by Irish Shipping, when this matter was initially being pursued by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Had the matter been handled in the normal departmental and interdepartmental manner, following the meeting with the Belfast delegation in April of 1982 it might well have been possible to arrange that the ESB would go to tender on two alternative bases, one without and one with the Belfast building option.  In the event, by the time the matter came before the present Minister for Industry and Energy the expiry of the fourth extension of the tender procedure was at hand, as I have just mentioned.  In discussion in February of this year, the ESB indicated that if they were to pursue the Belfast option&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;any further, they would have to close their tender procedure and initiate a fresh tender based on documentation incorporating the Belfast option.  This was because of tendering <Col N="2318" /> ethics which the board must observe as a regular and major purchaser and it was the only way to get terms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;over which shipping firms would stand.  The ESB indicated that such a fresh procedure could take some months and stressed that further exposure to the risk of a substantial financial cost could arise if freight rates hardened. The simple facts are that for a protracted period in the spring and early summer of 1982 very little developed on this matter which was being handled in the Department of the Taoiseach.  There was no restriction placed on the ESB in the tendering process in which it engaged at that time.  Consequently, when the present Minister for Industry and Energy was asked to take over this matter, on his establishing an interdepartmental grouping that grouping recommended that the one live project on hand would require further substantial investigation.  The ESB indicated, having being deferred on a number of occasions, that they were totally opposed to the Belfast proposal as they claimed that it would make no economic sense.</P>

    <P>More recent trends in employment in manufacturing industries are available from the quarterly inquiry into industrial employment, earnings and hours worked.  This inquiry compiles estimates only in respect of firms with three or more persons engaged and is therefore not comprehensive in coverage.  On the basis of this inquiry the most recent estimates <Col N="2190" /> of employment in manufacturing industries are as follows: March 1982, 202,400; June 1982, 199,900; September 1982, 198,700.</P>

    <P>In the context of an estimated levy <Col N="2196" /> yield of £40 million in 1982, together with expected social fund receipts of £1 million in respect of certain youth programmes administered by the Department of Labour, the Government provided for a sum of £41 million in the Department's 1982 Estimate.  The £41 million was allocated as follows:&mdash; Youth Employment Agency &mdash; £9.02 million; (AnCO and CERT) training for persons under 25 years &mdash; £19.3 million and £0.98 million respectively; Department of Labour: Work Experience Programme &mdash; £5.4 million; Department of the Environment: Environmental Improvement Scheme &mdash; £4 million; Department of Education: Temporary Grants Scheme for Youth Employment &mdash; £2.3 million.</P>

    <P>The Special Border Area Programme Fund, which was established in 1980 for the implementation of the Special Five Year Border Areas Programme, is fed each year by way of a grant-in-aid in the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance.  At the end of 1982 an amount of £2.4 million was undrawn from this <Col N="2203" /> fund.  With the additional allocation of IR £2 million (IR £1.6 million for capital investment and IR £0.35 million for current expenditure) the total amount available for expenditure in 1983 is IR £4.4 million.  This compares favourably with expenditure in previous years.  There is, therefore, no question of shelving any projects.</P>

      <P>I have investigated the circumstances of the case as requested by the Deputy.  The following is the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The patient in question was admitted to St. John of God's Private Psychiatric Hospital, Stillorgan, on 10 August 1982 and was discharged on 22 October 1982 (a period of 73 days).  The charge for her <Col N="2204" /> maintenance and treatment was £329 per week (medicines and tests were extra).  A contribution at the approved rate (£2.25 per day) was made by the Eastern Health Board towards her expenses in accordance with section 54 of the Health Act, 1970.  The patient's nett bill came to £3,547.20 and I understand from the hospital authority that she has arranged with the hospital to pay it off by regular monthly contributions.</P>
    <P>It appears that the patient went into St. John of God's Hospital on the assumption that VHI would cover her expenses but when the hospital authority investigated her position it was learned that VHI would not accept liability as she was already ill when she applied for membership of their insurance scheme.  The patient was, of course, entitled to hospital services free of charge in her local health board psychiatric hospital.  However, as she opted to enter a private psychiatric hospital of her own accord she would be liable for the total expenses involved (less the daily subvention from the health board already referred to above).</P>

Where a candidate who is following an approved course of studies did not qualify for a grant solely on the grounds of means in his or her first year, a grant may be awarded if evidence is produced that, due to a change in family circumstances, the means regulations of the relevant scheme would now be fulfilled in his/her case.  Such grant would be awarded with effect from the beginning of the college term immediately following the occurrence which resulted in the change in family circumstances.</P>
