      <P>At the suggestion of the Leader of the Opposition to which I, on behalf of the Government parties, am more than willing to agree, it is proposed that the House adjourn after passing a vote of sympathy to the relatives of Deputy Clem Coughlan.</P>
      <P>All of us share the sense of shock and loss at the tragic death of Deputy Coughlan. For many of us the first time we met him was during the by-election in Donegal and everyone was impressed then and has remained impressed since by the late Deputy Coughlan and his courtesy.  He was a Deputy who commanded great respect and in his relatively brief time in the House he secured the affection of members of all parties in the House.  The Deputy was very hard working on behalf of his constituents and was concerned for the problems of the country as a whole.  I should like, on my own behalf and on behalf of my party, to convey to his relatives whom I had the honour to meet during that campaign when they received me with great courtesy and kindness, the sympathy of all of us in this House at a tragic loss which the House and all its Members will feel deeply.</P>

      <P>I should like to express <Col N="672" /> my sincere appreciation of the Taoiseach's and Government's kindness in acceding to our suggestion that the House adjourn today.  In political life we are accustomed to the unexpected and the tragic.  Deputy Clement Coughlan's sudden death this morning, however, has saddened and benumbed us all.  He was a sincere, dedicated man.  He worked constantly and unremittingly for the people of his native county of Donegal, never sparing himself in pursuing their best interest and welfare.  I know they will all remember that he died on his way to Dáil Éireann on a day when our Order Paper contains many questions put down by him on their behalf.</P>
      <P>He had a special personal charm which made him one of the best liked Members of the House.  We all feel a deep sense of personal loss in Leinster House today. To his wife, Peggy, his seven children and all his family I offer, on my behalf and on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party and organisation, our deepest sympathy and condolences in their great sorrow.  To his constituents in Donegal I offer our sympathy on the loss of a beloved representative. He served them faithfully and well. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</P>

      <P>I should like, on my own behalf and on behalf of my party, to express our deepest sympathy to Deputy Coughlan's wife and family on his sudden and very sad death which occurred during this very tragic motor accident this morning. I extend my sympathy to the Opposition party on the loss of such a fine colleague and Deputy.  In the relatively short time I knew Deputy Coughlan I found him to be a most honest, upright and hard working Deputy who always did his utmost for his constituents in Donegal South-West.  He was always courteous in his manner, kind in his word and thoughtful of his duties as a public representative and as a member of Donegal County Council for many years prior to entering Dáil Éireann.  I always found his fine qualities evident in any contact I had with him.  He is to be highly commended for these qualities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a sense of loss and sadness in the House today.  I extend our deepest <Col N="673" /> sympathy to his family on their sad personal loss.  This House will justly grieve Deputy Coughlan's passing.</P>

      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I extend my sympathy to the family of Deputy Coughlan.  I did not have an opportunity of getting to know him but it is sad in this House when a Deputy from perhaps the constituency furthest from the House should meet with such an accident on his way here.  On <Col N="674" /> behalf of my party I extend sympathy to his family and also to his party to which he is such a loss.</P>
      <P>
        <i>Members rose in their places.</i>
      </P>
      <P>Motion: &ldquo;That this House do now adjourn&rdquo; put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 2.40 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 2 February 1983.</P>
