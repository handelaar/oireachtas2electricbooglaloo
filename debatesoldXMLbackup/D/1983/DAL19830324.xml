      <P>: It is proposed to take Nos. 1, 4 (resumed) 5, 2 and 6 (resumed). By agreement the following arrangements will apply to business today: (a) the Minister for Justice will be called on to conclude the Second Stage debate on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982, at 11.30 a.m.; (b) all stages of the Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited (Amendment) Bill, 1983, will be concluded by 5 p.m. today; (c) all stages of the Industrial Credit (Amendment) Bill, 1983, which is being initiated today will be concluded by 5 p.m. today; and (d) at the conclusion of business today the House will rise until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 19 April 1983.</P>

      <P>: I would like the Chair to take note of a position that has arisen so far as we are concerned in agreeing to the Order of Business in the morning, <Col N="768" /> that is, the situation that arose yesterday on the Social Welfare Bill.  In a co-operative way we agreed to take the Committee and remaining Stages yesterday and our attempts to deal with the Bill in an adequate way on Committee Stage were completely frustrated by the Minister for Social Welfare who talked out the early sections of the Bill so that we would not get an opportunity of voting on the sections to which we were particularly opposed.  If the Government want to secure our agreement to this type of arrangement &mdash; and on today's Order of Business there are two items where we are facilitating the Government very specifically &mdash; we will have to insist that the agreement be honoured in the spirit as well as in the letter.</P>
      <P>As we will be taking the vote on the Second Stage of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution Bill at 12 o'clock today, would it be possible for the Taoiseach now to give us the wording the Government propose to substitute for our wording?  There are statements in this morning's daily papers to the effect that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: My party held discussions last night and reached a certain conclusion.  We felt it inappropriate to give details of the wording of the amendment to the press because we thought they should be given first in this House. Nonetheless, the press this morning &mdash; it was probably inevitable &mdash; have accounts of the wording which, as I have seen them, are correct.  I would be happy to give the Leader of the Opposition confirmation of the exact wording immediately on the conclusion of the Order of Business <Col N="769" /> to facilitate him.  As I said, it was our wish to give the wording in this House rather than otherwise.</P>

      <P>: Before the Order of Business was agreed I wished to ask that Item No. 4 be not taken.  It is proposed in today's Order of Business that Item No. 4 be taken and that the Minister conclude at 11.30 a.m.  In view of developments I consider that to be entirely inappropriate&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: I am sorry, but I must pursue this matter.  The Order of Business has been arranged without reference to anyone in this House other than the Whips of the two main parties.  I want to make this point: we have an amendment down to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill to which the Leader of <Col N="770" /> The Workers' Party, Deputy Mac Giolla, has been unable to speak up to now.  It is entirely improper that an amendment and debate of this kind should be concluded at 11.30 a.m. today without giving us an opportunity to express our opinions on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>: When I last spoke I welcomed this Bill and also the Taoiseach's statement to the House that the alternative wording would be ready in a couple of weeks' time.  I expressed regret that the back-pedalling of the Taoiseach and the Government on the original agreed wording was causing and had caused distress and concern to very many people interested in this amendment.  I had hoped at the time that the new wording when introduced by the Government would not only show the Government's undiminished commitment to the amendment itself but would also maintain the strong pro-life character of the original draft.  This was not to be and now that the new wording is available we can see that it is negative in character and has lost the strong pro-life commitment of the original.  The Taoiseach himself over <Col N="773" /> the weekend admitted that he was less than happy about the commitment he had given to this amendment in the first place.  This perhaps explains the watering down of the original draft as is evidenced in the new formula and it confirms my worst fears, publicly expressed some weeks ago, that when the crunch came the Taoiseach and the majority of his party would bend with the liberal wing. I find the new wording totally unacceptable and so I understand do many individuals and groups interested in making this amendment to our Constitution.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Order, please. Deputies should not indulge in conversation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are seeking merely to enshrine in the Constitution the protection and right to life of the unborn child, in the recognition that it too from the moment of conception is human life, that the Constitution already gives to the citizen. It is a pity the Government did not adhere to the original formula.  The new wording has only added to the divisions and confusion and regrettably the anti-amendment lobby are already claiming the new wording as a victory for themselves.</P>
      <P>It is difficult to understand the motivation of many people and organisations involved in the anti-amendment campaign. I realise that many so involved are motivated by genuinely felt but nevertheless groundless fears on sectarian and medical grounds, but I fear that there are many involved in the campaign for more sinister and selfish motives.  They see in this amendment a formidable if not insurmountable barrier to the introduction of legalised abortion in this country and such a barrier would not be welcomed by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I totally reject the charge that the Bill is sectarian.  This Bill deals with the most basic and fundamental of rights &mdash; the right to life itself &mdash; from which follow all other rights.  It transcends religion, race, class, boundary, culture and is equally important and valid for members of particular religions and people with no religion whatever.  I fail to see how a charge <Col N="774" /> of sectarian bias can be sustained.  I do not accept that it will in any way interfere with or inhibit current medical practices and procedures in treating any problems, however serious, that may arise in maternity or pregnancy cases.  Many eminent medical experts bear out this view.</P>
    <P>I agree that being anti-amendment is not necessarily being pro-abortion, but I do not think that preoccupation with this aspect of the debate should cloud the need that exists at this time for this amendment in order to protect the life of the unborn child who, not being a citizen, is not so protected in the Constitution as it stands.  People say that existing legislation is sufficient and quote the 1861 Offences Against the Person Act but the experience of other countries shows that this is not so.  Existing legislation could be declared in a future court to be unconstitutional or could be amended and so leave the unborn vulnerable to assault and this would mean virtually abortion on demand.  The wording proposed now would appear to preclude the courts from making such a decision but would still leave the road open to the Legislature to introduce such legislation and so I find it at best a half-hearted measure.  I believe the mass of the people valuing human life and concerned for the protection of that life have a democratic right to seek this amendment to our Constitution and the Government have an obligation to respond positively to that demand.  The referendum that would be involved is one of the most basic and clearest exercises of the democratic process and I regret that the response of the Government to this demand has been half-hearted and that the decision as to whether abortion should or should not be introduced has not been left solely with the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to join with other Deputies who have expressed the opinion that this legislation is vital.  This is constitutional legislation and I cannot understand the haste.  Members of this House should have an opportunity of fully debating every aspect of this vitally important constitutional amendment.  I must refer to the grave responsibility that rests on every Member of this Parliament. <Col N="775" /> Each of us has a conscience and we must bear full responsibility in the area of legislating for public morality.  We must be concerned about the quality of Irish life that we wish to pass on to those who will come after us.  It has been said that we cannot legislate for virtue but that we can legislate for non virtue by way of creating conditions and trends whereby the struggle to be virtuous is rendered very difficult.  That is why a Christian cannot escape from the obligation to strive to influence legislation in a Christian direction.  To say that the State has no responsibility for public morals is to imply that the State has no duty in the areas of justice, honesty, equality and truth.  It is to say that the State is beyond moral judgment.  Surely everyone of us here knows that there is a grave responsibility on the part of the State in regard to the whole question of public morality.  Abortion is nothing less than murder, but it is a practice that is growing steadily in various parts of the world.  We in Ireland have an opportunity to display to the rest of the world our total concern for the protection of the unborn.  There are differing opinions among some of the Protestant churches and within the Roman Catholic Church, too, as to when life begins.  Let there be no doubt about this.  Life begins immediately on conception and it does not end at death.  Life is created for all time and nobody has a right to take it away.</P>
      <P>Any amendment to Article 41 of the Constitution which would deny the right to life of the unborn from the moment of conception would be gravely wrong.  I am only putting forward the teachings of the Church to which I belong.  If I need guidance on matters of public morality I seek if from those who are qualified to give it. Either the present Attorney General or any other holder of that office would be the last person that I would go to if I needed such guidance.  I would reject any law that would permit abortion in cases of rape or of deformity of the unborn or that would deny the equal right to life of both the child and the mother.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was present when discussions were taking place between the Taoiseach and <Col N="776" /> the pro-life people before the last general election.  In the course of those discussions I had grave doubts about a Coalition Government introducing a total ban on abortion.  That may have been because I know the people concerned, because I know their thinking and because I know some of their backgrounds.  For that reason, in the presence of Mr. Brendan Shortall, Dr. Vaughan and the other pro-life people, I asked the Taoiseach, as I held this Bill in my hand, if we could go to the people in the general election in the belief that we were pledging our full support to those who were anxious that this legislation be enacted.  The Taoiseach appeared angry that anyone should cast doubts on his sincerity in regard to implementing in full the terms of the Bill. In the agreed Programme for Government between Fine Gael and Labour it was stated that legislation would be introduced to have adopted by 31 March 1983 the pro-life amendment proposed by the outgoing Government.  The Labour Party reserve the right to a free vote on this issue.  We appreciate their position and we must appreciate also the position of the Minister for Health who, because of the strong feelings he holds in relation to the amendment, refused to handle the Bill with the result that it was passed to the Minister for Justice.  I admire the Minister for Health for the stand he took. He showed a certain amount of principle and made it clear that since he did not believe in the Bill he would not handle it.  I regret to say that what has been happening in Ireland in recent years is the emergence of too many ventriloquist Deputies.  We all know that when the dummy sits on the knee of the ventriloquist he utters only what the ventriloquist wishes him to utter.  There is a ray of hope in that we are not all political ventriloquists because the day the country is ruined by political ventriloquists is the day we are doomed.</P>

      <P>: These people say that they are against abortion.  They raise their nostrils at mention of the word, but yet they do not wish this amendment to be written into our laws.  They are not prepared to advocate abortion publicly but the story is different when they are behind closed doors.  Why not speak one's mind when the country is in need of leadership on the question of public morality.</P>
      <P>I quote from paragraph 23 of <i>Humanae Vitae</i> which addresses rulers of nations:</P>
      <P>And so we would like to speak to Rulers of Nations, because to them most of all is committed the responsibility of safeguarding the common good, and they can contribute so much to the preservation of morals.</P>
      <P>Do not ever allow the morals of your peoples to be undermined.  Do not tolerate any legislation which would introduce into the family practices which are opposed to the natural and divine law &mdash; for the family is the primary unit in the State.</P>
      <P>I accept <i>Humanae Vitae</i> wholeheartedly, as do many others.</P>
      <P>The text of the pro-life Amendment to the Constitution was published in the newspapers of 3 November 1982.</P>
      <P>The State acknowledges the right of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right of the mother, guarantees in its law to respect and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
      <P>The Catholic Episcopal Conference, the Irish Bishops, in a statement on the Bill said:</P>
      <P>In view of the clear teaching of the Catholic Church&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="778" /> That is the Church that I go to to find out where I should go in regard to public morality as a Member of this House: I do not go to the Attorney General because he is the last person in the world I would select to go to for advice or guidance in that direction.  I do not go to Dean Griffin because God knows the North of Ireland has one Paisley and that is enough without another coming down to the South.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Yes.  The Catholic Episcopal Conference, in the course of a statement on 3 November 1982, said:</P>
      <P>In view of the clear teaching of the Catholic Church on the sacredness of human life, the bishops willingly support measures which give to the life of the unborn child, as to every other life, the full protection of the law.  While no constitutional provision can of itself, be a full response to the problem of abortion, the text of the proposed amendment does seem to contribute positively to safeguarding the right to life of the unborn and as such it is welcome.</P>
      <P>In view of that statement, and of my own belief that abortion is wrong, that it is murder and that any country that adopts abortion is adopting degrees of murder I am opposed to abortion.  Any country that is prepared to adopt abortion cannot be far away, no less than between 50 or 80 years away from euthanasia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These matters are before us for our serious reflection.  Any Bill passed here must acknowledge and protect the right to life of the unborn.  I should like to tell the Minister for Justice that if he is going to have the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; mentioned in the Constitution he cannot define it properly.  How will the Constitution define what is or is not abortion?  That is why I believe that the new wording as <Col N="780" /> published in the newspapers is not in accordance with the undertaking given to the pro-life group.  It is not in accordance with the statement of 3 November by the Catholic Episcopal Conference and it is not in accordance with the undertaking given by the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald and his colleagues &mdash; I was one &mdash; to the Pro-Life group before the general election.  Any Bill we pass must prevent the introduction of abortion either through the courts or the Oireachtas. How foolish it would be to have an amendment passed which would prevent the Supreme Court from dealing with the question of abortion but would permit Parliament to introduce abortion legislation? What happens in the case of a hung Dáil or if the majority of the elected representatives believe that the murder of the unborn should be legalised?</P>
    <P>My idea is that only the Irish people, through a referendum, can deal with a problem of this type.  This is a serious matter which deals with the vital and important matter of creation.  An amendment which does not include an acknowledgment and protection of the right to life of the unborn would be inconsistent with the idea of a positively expressed pro-life amendment as advocated by Fine Gael and many others.  Furthermore, no amendment would be proof against a decision of the European Court of Human Rights unless it specified the right to life in positive terms.  Those terms should be clearly set out.</P>
    <P>Fine Gael in their election programme of June 1981 stated:</P>
    <P>Fine Gael is unalterably opposed to the legalisation of abortion and in Government will initiate a referendum to guarantee the right to life of the unborn child.</P>
    <P>That could not be clearer and it is something I conducted an election on.  It is what I promised the people and what every Member of Fine Gael pledged themselves to in that election.  Are they going to welsh on it?  Are they going to go back a bit on that pledge?  Are they going to bury their heads in the sand?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, <Col N="781" /> when he was speaking on &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; on 4 November 1982, said:</P>
    <P>What we have proposed, and I pressed this very strongly in my Ard Fheis speech, was that it should be literally a pro-life amendment, which would strengthen the protection of life, the life of the unborn, and I was very relieved that the amendment took that form.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice stated that the object is to ensure that what is commonly called legalised abortion does not become a feature of our law and our society against the wishes of the people. He also said it is entirely appropriate that such a basic right as the right to life of the unborn should be mentioned in the Constitution.  The reports I read in today's papers contain no mention of the right to life of the unborn.  I am waiting for the Minister to announce the proposed wording, although the Taoiseach has confirmed that the newspaper reports are correct.  There is no way I will vote in this House for the wording mentioned on the radio broadcasts this morning because it is contrary to my conscience, contrary to my religious beliefs and contrary to the beliefs of the church of which I hope I am a member.  That is why I will not vote for this new presentation, the U-turn presentation.</P>
    <P>When the Attorney-General examined this Bill he told the Fine Gael Party that it was right and that there were no problems in it.  What has happened suddenly to change the mind of the Attorney General? He has done a U-turn on this matter. It makes me wonder about the person who can give advice on a subject today and different advice on the same subject another day.  What will the position be on many other grave legal problems?  Most of us have a legal adviser but what do we do when that adviser changes his advice from day to day?  It is a very serious matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>: On a point of order, is it correct within the procedures of this House for a Member to cast doubts on the integrity of the Attorney General, the highest law officer of the State, who <Col N="782" /> does not have an opportunity to defend himself?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is very difficult to know what way I can deal with the advice which has been given to my party, in view of your ruling.  Which advice are we to take?  The Bill has not changed, and if it was right when the Attorney General first advised on it, what has happened to change his mind?  If I had a solicitor who advised me in that way I would fire him.</P>
      <P>This amendment should be put to the people so that they will be given an opportunity to decide in the right way on the proper wording.  We were told that the wording of this amendment could be improved, but I challenge any Member to endeavour to convince me that what has now come forth is an improvement on what was already approved by the churches, including churches other than the Catholic Church.  The new wording is not an improvement.  It leaves it open to a hung Dáil to pass legislation introducing abortion.  How many Members on this side of the House are prepared to take that chance?  I am not.</P>
      <P>I am answerable to the people who elected me whom I promised to safeguard and protect the life of the unborn.  I will not welsh or renege on that promise even if I am to be alone.  I will stand up to defend the life of the unborn.  I do so as a public representative with the grave responsibility of contributing to public morality to the best of my ability as a Member of Parliament.  I want this to go on record so that every member of my party will know where I stand.  There is no way in which I will vote for the right of a Parliament to introduce abortion.  It is all the same to me who brings in the Bill; I am only concerned with the principle of the Bill and with safeguarding the life of the unborn.  To play politics with an issue of this kind is bringing us to very low depths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had been hoping that this issue would <Col N="783" /> have been faced up to in a manner in which anyone in favour of abortion would be on one side and anyone against abortion would be on the other.  It should be left to the people to decide.  Anybody who believes that abortion is a human right should stand on a platform and publicly advocate it.  Such a person should not be like a Lanna Machree's dog which went a little bit of the road with everybody but the whole of the road with nobody.  That is the way to get the worst of all possible results.</P>

      <P>: People must have the courage to come out and advocate what they believe in.  I firmly believe in the teaching of the Catholic Church on the right to life, when life begins and that there is no end to life.  That is the belief I profess every day when I say the creed. I often wonder about the opinions of men in public life who must be disturbed in conscience.  It is outstanding to have a clear conscience in public life.  I have served my constituents for 40 years.  I have never let them down, never betrayed them and never told them untruths.  That is how I have been here for 40 years.  I will not let them down on this issue.  I promised them that I would stand by the right to life of the unborn and I will stand faithful to the end, guided by the Irish Episcopal Conference.  I hope and trust I will not be alone in Fine Gael when the chips are down, because we have a grave responsibility for the quality of life in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not support any form of amendment to Article 41 of Bunreacht na hÉireann which denies the right to life of the unborn from conception.  This new proposal does not contain that feature if it permits abortion in instances of rape, deformity of the unborn or denies the equal right to life of the unborn and the mother.  The life of the unborn in the eyes of the creator is as important as the life of the mother.  We must protect the life of both with no preference either for mother or unborn because one life is the same as the other.  It is the protection of <Col N="784" /> life.  That is why I feel it is very necessary, apart from political considerations, as a matter of principle, that life, which is the greatest God given right, the right to be born and the right to life, be contained in the amendment.

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I must say at the outset that this side of the House are, to say the least of it, astonished at the form of words which the Government have brought forward in substitution for our own.  I will very quickly read the words which are in the Bill, a Bill put before the House by the Government and, therefore, presumably supported by the Government and debated on that basis by us all.  The wording in the Bill states:</P>
      <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
      <P>That is a very clear and positive pro-life amendment.  The wording now being suggested to us by the Government and the Taoiseach is:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion.</P>
      <P>As far as we are concerned that is totally unacceptable because it is entirely negative. It is not pro-life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In effect, all this states is that the 1861 Act shall not be found unconstitutional by the courts.  Everybody in the House should understand that if the amendment proposed by the Government is included in the Constitution, it is no bar to the introduction of legalised abortion into this country.  There will be nothing to prevent the Oireachtas, the day after that constitutional amendment is made, repealing the 1861 Act and leaving the whole situation wide open and having no protection whatever for the life of the unborn, having no law whatsoever <Col N="786" /> against legalised abortion.  Furthermore, if that amendment is passed there will be nothing to prevent any Oireachtas at any time introducing into the country full legalised abortion on demand.  For this simple reason and for many others we find this wording totally inadequate and unacceptable.</P>
    <P>At this stage, as far as we are concerned, as no better wording than ours has been brought forward by anybody, Fianna Fáil propose to stick with the wording we put forward which is included in the Bill before the House.  I must ask the House to consider the position of the Taoiseach in regard to this matter.  I want to quote a letter which he signed on 6 November 1982 and sent to Dr. Vaughan of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign. He stated in that letter:</P>
    <P>I have pleasure in enclosing a copy of the statement which was issued as a result of a unanimous decision of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party following the publication of the draft amendment. As you will see we are committed to introducing this amendment in Government and having it put to the people in a referendum before 31 March next.  This referendum will not be delayed by any other consideration. This is an integral part of our programme and will be undertaken by any Government that I may have the responsibility of leading after the next General Election.</P>
    <P>The statement to which he refers is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Fine Gael Party welcomes the form of the amendment to the Constitution proposed by the Government.</P>
    <P>The amendment as proposed is worded in positive terms, designed to strengthen the constitutional protection of life, as proposed by the leader of Fine Gael in his Ard Fheis speech.</P>
    <P>At its meeting today the Fine Gael Party decided to support the amendment and in Government to initiate legislation with a view to a referendum to be held by the end of March next.</P>
    <P>There are countless quotations I could give which firmly commit the Taoiseach <Col N="787" /> as Leader of the Opposition and as Taoiseach to a pro-life amendment, to including in our Constitution, a positive protection for the unborn.  I want to say very solemnly to the House that the Taoiseach is totally reneging on all those commitments and, by putting this amendment forward in substitution for the Fianna Fáil amendment, he is forever destroying his credibility as a political leader.</P>
    <P>I find it very difficult to understand how the Taoiseach can remain on as leader of Fine Gael and as Taoiseach and at the same time propose this amendment to us as the amendment to be made to the Constitution.  It is completely in contradiction of everything he has said, promised and committed himself to.  Our time is very limited and I am grateful to you for giving me those few moments.  I want to avail of them again to say that Fianna Fáil are totally committed to the pro-life concept, to making an amendment to the Constitution which will positively protect the life of the unborn and ensuring that legalised abortion will not be introduced into this country except at some future date by a decision of the people as a whole by way of referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): We have had a long and thorough debate on this amendment and I would like to thank all the Deputies who have contributed for the high and generally constructive level of the debate.</P>
      <P>When I introduced the Bill in this House I spoke of the difficulties in producing a text that would adequately protect the life of the unborn and at the same time not be open to the reservations that have been expressed about the present text.  I acknowledged the difficulties the previous Government must have had in producing that text.  Everything that has happened since has borne out what I said then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have considered, in consultation with my colleagues in the Government, many <Col N="789" /> different approaches to an alternative text.  At one stage, very recently indeed, I was myself disposed to favour a particular line of approach to the problem, an approach that I thought would be comprehensive while at the same time meeting some at least of the misgivings expressed in relation to the present text. I was authorised to engage in consultations with the various Churches and the Jewish Community on the basis of key words and phrases that would be used in the text and the general structure that might be adopted.  May I say, for the record, that I deliberately did not work out a complete text, not only because of the need for flexibility in the consultations but in recognition of the privileges of this House.  I cannot give details of these consultations because they were carried out on the basis that they would remain confidential but I think I can say, without any breach of confidence, that there was not sufficient support forthcoming for that approach to make it in any way viable.  The outcome was a source of great disappointment to me.  I say this now, not to criticise anybody for I know that everybody concerned has acted in good faith and from the best of motives but, at least in large part, because the fact that I had these consultations is now widely known and it would be both unreal and unfair to the House if I did not formally tell the House that they had taken place.</P>
    <P>It has been said, in support of the existing wording, that it was considered very fully and that consultations had taken place about it with the various Churches. I do not question that.  The problem, though, is these statements have tended to be made in a way that suggests that I knew or should have known about the background and that the reservations that I expressed about the present wording were ill-considered and in some way unfair to the Opposition.  Again, I want the record to be clear about this.  Anybody who listened to or read my opening speech will realise that what I said about the existing wording was very muted. Furthermore it was said, as it had to be, without the benefit of knowing what the former Government had actually done. <Col N="790" /> There were no papers to indicate the nature of the consultations that had taken place before the present text was approved.  Neither was there any record of any analysis of the considerations that had led to the adoption of the particular text.</P>
    <P>May I make it clear that in saying this I am not implying that the previous Government did not have consultations &mdash; I know now that they did &mdash; and I am not criticising the form that these consultations took, for that was a matter for the then Government to decide and, besides, the consultation may have been carried out in the most effective way.  The only point I am making is that I did not have the benefit of any documentation on these issues and that such documentation as was available, while very useful as far as it went, was very limited indeed.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of my Second Reading speech there were accusations that the doubts I expressed about certain aspects of the wording were not genuine.  That kind of accusation was persisted in to the point that we in Government, and especially my party colleagues who had a commitment to a referendum, felt it necessary to publish the relevant parts of a detailed memorandum of advice from the Attorney General.</P>
    <P>I would like it to be clear that I am not suggesting that Members of this House are bound to accept the views of the Attorney General or indeed of any legal adviser.  Lawyers, even at the very highest level, sometimes differ in their legal opinions.  But, to put it at its very lowest, the Attorney General's detailed arguments, both on their own merits and because they came from a lawyer of his standing, must in ordinary prudence be taken very seriously into account by Members of this House, and it goes without saying that they must weigh heavily with members of the Government.  If this House were to disregard them, it should at the very least be clearly aware of what it was doing.</P>
    <P>Having said that much, I do not propose to weary the House with a great amount of detail.  There can be no Member of the House who is not aware of the developments over the last 24 hours.  The <Col N="791" /> difficulties that we have experienced in securing our objectives can be summarised this way.  We felt it necessary to seek an improved wording, something that would meet at least in significant part the criticism made by the Attorney General of the present wording and that would also meet some of the other criticisms that have been made.  I personally believe that that was achieveable.  But, in the context of a Bill for a referendum, that is not enough.  One must also be able to be reasonably satisfied that a particular solution would be likely to command substantial support on Referendum Day.</P>
    <P>The reactions I got were not sufficiently positive to reassure me on that score.  It was against that background that, as is now well known, my parliamentary party colleagues met last evening and discussed a number of options. The decision was that I should indicate to this House that, in view of the difficulties that had arisen, I would propose on Committee Stage a new wording on the following lines:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion.</P>
    <P>The first thing I want to say about this text is that its underlying principle is in accord with that underlying the present text.  It is aimed at confirming that the Supreme Court cannot declare the present law, or any law, prohibiting abortion to be repugnant to the Constitution; and it confirms, by essential implication, that there is not conferred by the Constitution a right to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>This alternative wording would meet what I think is a main object of the constitutional amendment, that is, that the Constitution as it stands would not be interpreted as meaning that it gives what would amount to a right to have an abortion.</P>
    <P>The text would also permit the existing law, which is widely regarded as satisfactory, to be maintained.  I am not saying of course that this text is not open to be criticised.  It does leave open the possibility, however remote that may be, that <Col N="792" /> one day in the distant future the Oireachtas could without reference to the people pass a measure which would permit abortions to be carried out.  One answer to that is that those Members of this House who would vote for such a measure would have to face the people at the following general election.  The text has the great advantage that, apart from that gap, which in reality is I believe a theoretical rather than a real one, a number of other disadvantages associated with other alternatives are surmounted.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from what I have just said that I am well aware of the fact that, in so far as the wording I have now mentioned would deal only with the possibility of an adverse court decision, it does not cover all the ground which the existing wording attempted to cover.  But it certainly covers, very clearly and without any attendant disadvantages that I can see, the risk which was at the heart of the case made at the outset by PLAC and others.  It is, therefore, as I have said, fully in accord with what is proposed in the Bill before the House.  Every Deputy who can support such a wording, as well of course as those Deputies who would prefer the existing wording or some variation of it, can, I suggest, fully support the motion before the House that the Bill be given a Second Reading.  On that point, I repeat what I said in my opening speech, namely, that approval of the Second Reading is not approval of any specific wording.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend the motion to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I am grateful to the Opposition for agreeing to take all Stages of this Bill today.  The circulation of the Bill was, in fact, approved by my predecessor and I am happy to bring it before the House.</P>
      <P>The sole purpose of this short Bill is to raise from £350 million to £600 million the limit on the borrowings and leasing arrangements of Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited which the Minister for Finance may guarantee.</P>
      <P>The present limit was fixed by section 6 of the Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited Act, 1981, and is now nearing exhaustion.  However, the company will have to raise nearly £200 million in 1983 in new borrowings and leasing arrangements to help finance the national telecommunications development programme this year.  Early enactment of the Bill is, therefore, essential to the financing of telecommunications development in 1983.</P>
      <P>Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited &mdash; ITI for short &mdash; is a wholly-owned State company which was set up by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on 1 April 1981 to obtain funds from the private sector, either by borrowing or leasing, to help finance the telecommunications development programme.  This is in furtherance of the policy of encouraging private participation in investment in infrastructural services with a view to reducing the central Government borrowing requirement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The company is statutorily controlled by the Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited Act, 1981, which is broadly on the same lines as legislation governing other State-owned companies. Thus, for example, all borrowing and <Col N="798" /> leasing arrangements by the company require the prior consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs given with the approval of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>The Act also contains an extra provision which requires the company to meet its costs from its operations in order to preclude any Exchequer subvention.</P>
    <P>The limit of £350 million on ministerial guarantees under the 1981 Act was determined on the basis that it would be adequate to meet likely needs to 1982.  It was hoped that by that time a State-sponsored body would have been established to take over the operation of the telecommunications services from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, the intention being that ITI would become a subsidiary of that body, which would be wholly responsible for arranging the financing of telecommunications development.</P>
    <P>In the event, the setting-up of the new statutory body, Board Telecom Éireann, was delayed.  As Deputies will be aware, the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982, which was designed to establish the two new State-sponsored bodies to run the postal and telecommunications services, passed Second Stage last year but its progress was interrupted by the ending of the 23rd Dáil.  The Government are, however, committed to pressing ahead with the reorganisation of the Department into State-sponsored bodies and I will be putting a motion to the House shortly after Easter proposing the restoration of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982, to the Order Paper for its Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Capital expenditure on telecommunications development was roughly £220 million in each of the years 1981 and 1982.  Of this, the amounts raised by ITI were £92 million in 1981 and £141 million in 1982 &mdash; the Exchequer directly financed the balance.  The capital programme for 1983 has been set at £226 million and, of this, £194 million will be financed by means of leasing arrangements with ITI, which will in turn finance the leases by means of borrowings or other arrangements.</P>
    <P>The object of the Bill is, as I have said, to help in financing telecommunications development.  The basic target of the <Col N="799" /> development programme is to provide telecommunications services here of the standard available in our EEC partner countries in terms of quality and availability. To achieve this involves greatly improving the quality of the internal trunk service, giving all users an automatic service and extending the areas to which calls can be dialled.  It also involves eliminating delays in meeting applications for telephone, telex and data facilities.</P>
    <P>The current programme covers the five-year period 1980 to 1984, inclusive. I should say that it was acknowledged when the programme was undertaken, both by independent experts and by the Department itself, that meeting the programme targets in five years would be a remarkable achievement.  I repeat this point, which my predecessors in office also stressed, because of the uninformed, although quite understandable, criticisms made from time to time that, despite the heavy investment that has taken place, the service has not been transformed.  It must be remembered that the first essential has been to build up the infrastructure of the service itself in terms of buildings, exchanges, trunk systems and main cabling and this necessarily takes time. Dramatic breakthroughs over short periods were never, therefore, to be expected, nor were they promised.</P>
    <P>But substantial progress has been made and this will be greatly accelerated this year and next year.  For instance, the major digital trunk exchanges which the Minister opened in Dublin last week will provide greatly increased capacity for switching of trunk calls in Dublin exchanges and will enable many more trunk circuits to be provided to centres throughout the country which are still suffering congestion.  Trunk exchanges will also be opened this year at Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Sligo, Drogheda and Dundalk.  Overall, the expectation is that by the end of the year, the call failure rate on the internal STD system will be of the order of 10 per cent to 15 per cent, down from 40 per cent at the start of the current development programme.  The <Col N="800" /> aim is to reduce this further to about 4 per cent by the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>About 92 per cent of subscribers have automatic service at present and well over 100 of the remaining 400 manual exchanges are scheduled for conversion this year.  Now that the necessary trunk and local exchange capacity for more automatic traffic is coming on stream, the way is also clear to speed up this part of the programme.</P>
    <P>For some years past, Belfast was the only area in Northern Ireland to which calls could be dialled from here, and Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Liverpool, London and Manchester were the only centres in Britain to which subscribers could dial calls.  It is possible now since late last year for subscribers to dial calls to all areas in Northern Ireland.  I would hope that this will make a real contribution to bringing the two parts of Ireland closer together both for business and social purposes.  From the end of this month it will be possible for subscribers on Dublin exchanges and in Cork to dial calls to all parts of Britain, and this facility will be extended to the rest of the country over the next few months.  It is also possible now for up to 70 per cent of our subscribers to dial their international calls to some 70 other countries.  All this is solid progress.</P>
    <P>The other main objective of the programme is to get into a position by the end of next year where applications for telephones, telex and data can be met promptly.  Again, steady progress is being made, though unevenly in different parts of the country.  By the end of this year, we expect that in virtually the entire Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Portlaoise districts, four of the eight engineering districts, waiting lists will have been cleared and all applications will be capable of being met promptly.  Progress will also be made in this direction in the remaining four districts, but it will take up to the end of next year before the target is fully achieved there.  By the end of this year also the waiting list for telex and data will, it is planned, be virtually eliminated.</P>
    <P>It would be very far from my intention, however, to give the impression that the <Col N="801" /> various targets I have mentioned will be reached easily, or that we are or can be complacent.  On the contrary, I wish to dispel any such idea.  I do not have to remind Dublin Deputies in particular of the problems in regard to underground cable repairs and delays in getting telephones.  There is clearly much work still to be done and an all-out effort will be made to meet the objectives of the programme.  I am very conscious of the importance of good communications facilities for all types of businesses and of the need, in terms of solving the unemployment problem, to assist businesses large and small in every way possible.  For this reason my Department are at present concentrating, in the Dublin area on providing telephones for business applicants. Clearly, one essential requirement is that the necessary finance should be provided and that is the purpose of this Bill.</P>
    <P>From a financial point of view, the present is a difficult time.  Substantial investment has been made in the infrastructure of the services and this should largely meet requirements for many years ahead.  The scale of the necessary investment and the attendant high interest charges naturally weigh heavily on a capital-intensive service such as telecommunications. Largely because of this, there have had to be substantial increases in charges in recent years.  With the increases announced in the budget, it is expected that the service should move into modest surplus this year and make some contribution towards past deficits. In the years ahead, when the current programme has been completed, it will be possible to add many more subscribers to the system and to handle a greatly increased volume of traffic with relatively small additional increases in resources. The financial performance of the service should therefore improve steadily and it should be possible to contain increases in charges well below the rate of inflation. I am satisfied, therefore, that the investment in the telecommunications development programme, apart from being essential for the economic and social well-being of the country, will also be financially rewarding.</P>
    <P>Judging by its performance to date, <Col N="802" /> Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited can be expected to continue to play a vital role in financing telecommunications development.  However, as I mentioned earlier, the company will become a subsidiary of the State-sponsored body to be set up under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982.  It will be primarily for the board of the new body, Bord Telecom Éireann, to decide on the precise role of ITI after the change over.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982 would apply to any subsidiaries of Bord Telecom Éireann as well as to the company itself.  For example, borrowing and guarantee limits would apply for the Board and its subsidiaries as a group. Accordingly, the financial activities of Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited will be subject to statutory control whether it is retained as a subsidiary of Bord Telecom Éireann or is wound up.  When the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill is enacted, there will not be any further need for the Irish Telecommunications Investments Ltd. Act, 1981, or for this amending Bill and both will be repealed.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to inhibit the scope of this debate, I would be most grateful if Deputies could agree to leave over until another time discussion of general issues related to the operation of the telecommunications service.</P>
    <P>I commend this short Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: We support this Bill because we were responsible for setting up the original company to finance the advanced telecommunications system and we realise that with the passing of time it will be necessary to increase the amount from £350 million to £600 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to congratulate my friend and colleague from the West of Ireland, Deputy John Donnellan, on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and to wish him every success.  In my eight months there I found it a most interesting and stimulating Department which had, at the time, an interesting and stimulating <Col N="803" /> Minister, Deputy John Wilson.  I recognise the work of this great Department because they have made a major contribution to the development of posts and telecommunications in the country.</P>
    <P>In our document <i>The Way Forward</i> we envisaged the need for further finance for the telecommunications services.  Until 1981 all the capital required for development of the telephone service was advanced by the Exchequer.  In that year a company, Irish Telecommunications Investment Limited, was established to finance capital telephone investment and it has been raising sums of money in the open market for that purpose.  In 1981, for example, it raised over £90 million and in the current year it will raise £160 million.  Next year the amount expected to be raised is £190 million to £200 million. Our economic plan <i>The Way Forward</i> indicated that the capital need over the period of the plan from 1983 to 1987 would be between £970 million and £1,200 million depending on the demand for telephone services whether by way of new connections or extra use being made of the telephone service.  I wonder whether the limit of £600 million is high enough.  I presume he can come before the House at any stage in the future with another Bill if required.</P>
    <P>Our plan envisages sums being made available so that our country and in particular industrialists and business people can be sure of a high quality telephone service.  A good telecommunications service is an essential infrastructural one for business people and industrialists if they are not to be placed at a disadvantage in competing with their counterparts throughout the world.  We were determined that that should not happen. Indeed we gave a great degree of priority to the provision of top quality services for our people.  The situation since we left office has caused a certain degree of concern because of alleged cutbacks and indeed the forecast for connections is much lower than we had proposed.  I hope the Government will continue the programme we initiated which was developing in a very orderly and progressive way.  A first-class telephone service must <Col N="804" /> be kept as a top priority.  We had a major capital programme in relation to the provision of area engineering headquarters, the provision of digital exchanges and the provision of general services to improve the structure of the services.</P>
    <P>The Minister should outline in specific detail the programme for 1983 in view of the fact that the capital programme for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs plays a very important part in the provision of employment, especially in the building industry.  The extent of the investment in this area since 1981 has created a great deal of employment in that industry.  Engineering headquarters have been provided in major areas.  Perhaps the Minister would outline the exact allocations for services and buildings in 1983 and 1984.</P>
    <P>There is a need for finance, too, in the postal side of the Department.  This is a question to which the new boards, when established, must give serious consideration. I should like to hear from the Minister also as to when he expects the Committee Stage of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982, to be taken.  That Bill was at a very advanced stage at the time of our leaving office.  The then Minister had brought it to Committee Stage.  In view of the necessity to establish both the boards concerned &mdash; Bord Telecom and Bord Poist &mdash; the Minister should endeavour to have them established as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Recently I expressed concern regarding some aspects of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I refer to trends in the broadcasting area.  As the public are well aware, there has been a new appointment in that Department.  In my days as Minister of State in that Department, I was the only Minister of State and I was attached also to the Department of Transport.  There was one Minister for both Departments.  We are very concerned about the appointment of a Minister of State with specific responsibility for the area of broadcasting, both radio and television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am asking the Minister to give priority to the introduction of the Bill to set up the two semi-State organisations to which I have referred.  In that way he would be going some way towards giving priority to the introduction of a Bill to set up an independent broadcasting authority which also will require financing.  I should like the Minister to tell us before this debate concludes whether he will be providing funds by way of this Bill to enable the setting up of an independent broadcasting authority. There is a need to regulate what is now an unacceptable situation.  Any such Bill must have provision for licensing and that will require a certain financial input. Apart from the great need for the development of broadcasting here there is the consideration also of the provision of jobs.  The setting up of an independent broadcasting authority would result in the provision of much-needed employment. If the relevant legislation is not brought before the House in the near future there will be serious repercussions. I understand that recently test cards have been placed on television stations for the purpose of testing some form of illegal broadcasting of television signals.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am anxious that the Minister indicate whether he will provide in 1983 the finance necessary to enable an independent broadcasting authority to be established.  We are anxious that the Bill be brought forward in accordance with the general principles enunciated by both Deputies Reynolds and Wilson while in office.</P>
      <P>Another area requiring major capital investment is the area of the provision of telephones and associated services.  The return from such development justifies the investment involved.  There is need of much improvement in the present services to consumers generally.  We need a first-class telephone service.  We had as a basic principle the development of a service that would be second to none and I am sure that the same applies to the present Minister.  For far too long the telephone service was neglected.</P>
      <P>It is regrettable that the charges for telecommunications services have been increased in the past few days.  In these difficult times, both for business people and for the ordinary citizen, increases of the order of 17 per cent are very steep. Again, this is a blow to the creation of employment.  The Minister should have made a clear statement on the background to the need for these increases at this stage.  Apart from all the other increases that have resulted from the budget, the increase in this area is most unwelcome.  I should like the Minister to let us know the amount of revenue that these increases will yield.  I trust that he is not contemplating any increases on the postal side because the law of diminishing returns has been reached in that regard since the increases to 22 pence and 26 pence in the cost of postage stamps.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: It has a relationship to the general financing of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The setting up of the two semi-State boards that I have <Col N="807" /> mentioned is a very important matter in terms of the 30,000 people who are employed directly by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Their future is at stake and they are anxious to know as early as possible what their position will be.  I trust that the Bill will be before the House shortly after the Easter recess.</P>
      <P>In relation to the provision of buildings generally, we had outlined a very detailed programme and I should like the Minister to detail for us the investment in this area in 1983 and the projects earmarked which require the investment.  We had undertaken a detailed programme which has brought about tremendous progress.  In this regard I should like to pay tribute to former Ministers Wilson, Reynolds and Faulkner who played a significant role in the development of the telecommunications services.</P>

I have no doubt that with the expert officials in the Department the programme we outlined will continue.  I support the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to join with Deputy Leyden in welcoming the Bill.  I have already wished the Minister and the Minister of State well.  The Bill increases the powers of the company, Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited, to borrow up to £600 million.  We are indicating support for what was a new departure with regard to financing public enterprise. For that reason one could recommend to the Minister that he suggest to the Government that this method of financing essential infrastructural development could be applied in other Government Departments.  Yesterday we were talking about decentralisation and the question of privatisation of this <Col N="808" /> development.  If privatisation in the sphere of telecommunications is a suitable way for financing then I do not see why it should be turned down in other areas of the public service.  I gather that the intention was that all future telecommunication development would be financed under the auspices of ITI.</P>
      <P>When he is replying I should like the Minister to comment on an apparent lack of logic in his speech.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Judging by its performance to date, Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited can be expected to continue to play a vital role in financing telecommunications development.</P>
      <P>The Minister has said that it was envisaged that the company would become a subsidiary of the State-sponsored body to be set up.  The Minister also said in his speech:</P>
      <P>It will be primarily for the board of the new body ... to decide on the precise role of ITI after the changeover.</P>
      <P>What puzzles me is that the Minister went on to say:</P>
      <P>Accordingly, the financial activities of Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited will be subject to statutory control (and I am sure the House agrees that that is a good thing) whether it is retained as a subsidiary of Bord Telecom Éireann or is wound up.</P>
      <P>I did not know that that was an option. Will the Minister tell the House if it is an option that is under consideration by the Minister or the Government?  Is it envisaged that ITI should be wound up when the new boards take over?  The House is directly interested in ITI as is the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The making of private funds available for development was a success in the telecommunications area and I suggest to the Minister that he spread that gospel among other members of the Government, particularly in the case of the cancelled programme of decentralisation.  It is important to know where ITI will get its money.  I have the greatest confidence that the board will judiciously pick the areas from which they will get their <Col N="809" /> finance because, as recent events in the EMS have shown, it is easy to run into trouble by borrowing in hard currencies which at the stroke of the pen of the Minister for Finance can increase debts overnight.  The Minister for Finance has told us about the extra cost in interest alone which his recent activities will mean to the country.  The investment programme, the principles to be followed by ITI in getting money, is important so that they minimise the dangers of it costing the country much more.</P>
    <P>I am glad that there is a commitment by the Minister to press ahead with the reorganisation of the Department into State-sponsored bodies.  The Minister has promised to put a motion before the House after Easter proposing the restoration of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill to the Order Paper. I have a question down for a long time asking the Minister when he intended to restore that Bill to the Order Paper and our spokesman, Deputy Leyden, has also asked the Minister about that matter.</P>
    <P>I accept that the task of bringing our service up to the standard of our partners in the European Community was a mammoth one.  I do not think anybody who did not have a special interest in this development realised what a great task it was.  I can recall being given figures of the numbers of telephones per caput and I was shocked to find out how far we were down on the list.  I have a question on the Order Paper about the position at the end of 1982.  I know there was an improvement up to December 1979, in 1980 and 1981 and I presume there was an improvement up to 31 December 1982.  As far as I can recall Greece, which is not the most developed country in the EEC, has more telephones per caput than we had when I was last given statistics but our telephones are more used and we can prove that.  This in some way makes up for the fact that we are way behind.</P>
    <P>The Minister made a point about the provision of infrastructure &mdash; I do not like using that word but it is a handy piece of shorthand.  The amount of money spent does not show to the extent that we can see it in actual telephones but it was <Col N="810" /> an absolutely essential part of the development programme.  I take the point the Minister made.  The groundwork has been done in order to achieve improvements up-front where they are visible and I know that within the next 18 months or two years there will be spectacular improvement in the provision of telephones.  The objective was to have telephones on demand by the end of 1984.  In fairness to the engineering section of the Department, the severe snowstorm which enabled Deputy Michael O'Leary to make his reputation and the heavy rains of last June caused considerable delay because skilled people had to be diverted from the work of installation of telephones to deal with the damage to underground cables, particularly in Dublin.  This held up the installation process.</P>
    <P>There is another point the Minister should consider since we are in a difficult economic situation.  Deputy Reynolds, when Minister, had a roadshow of artefacts necessary in the development of the telecommunications system which could be produced in this country.  The idea was to encourage local people to make some of the equipment.  I also held a number of exhibitions and I am sure the present Minister will continue this.  I was very impressed by an exhibit from Waterford. A man saw a simple piece of equipment used on telegraph poles and proceeded to design and manufacture it himself.  His price was competitive and he developed his product in such a way that the Department accepted it and found it to be of excellent quality.  The import substitution aspect of this development is very important and I appeal to the Minister to emphasise it strongly.</P>
    <P>I see that the Minister opened for me the Alcatel factory in Cork.  They will be providing material for the home market and for export, particularly to their mother country, France.  There is a possibility that the French company will make provision for investment in the company by Irish people and I would welcome this development.</P>
    <P>When Minister I had the use of an automatic telephone but when I lost office it was taken from me.  I could have <Col N="811" /> kept it but at a charge of £1,500 per year for an out-of-area telephone.  I gather that some people who work for the Department have out-of-area telephones for which they do not have to pay, although I am not quite sure if that is a fact.  Certainly they do not have to pay the extra fees for being out of area.  Public representatives should receive some consideration in this respect.  I know the Minister is a kindly man and perhaps he would consider this problem.  I do not like blowing my own whistle but it is difficult when one has an automatic telephone and then has to do without it. I asked them to restore the kind of service I had already, namely a night service and a Sunday service, but they did not do that for me.  I suppose I could not mention it in a more influential place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: It might be more appropriate on the Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Possibly, but we are talking about investment and I humbly submit that this is a suitable area for investment even by the ITI.  I have no complaint to make about the efficiency of the engineering staff in the area.</P>
      <P>The Minister stated that by the end of this year he expected that in virtually the entire Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Portlaoise districts, four of the eight engineering districts, waiting lists would have been cleared and all applications would be capable of being met promptly. I would point out that there are other important areas as well.  No doubt this point will not be lost upon the Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned already the difficulty with underground cables and commented on the difficult financial position.  I also stressed how important it is that substantial investment should be available through the ITI.  The Minister says that ITI contributed £92 million in 1981 and £141 million in 1982, while the Exchequer financed the balance, making a total capital expenditure of £220 million in each of the years 1981 and 1982.  I had some notes which indicated that ITI would be making provision for £158.5 million.  Am I wrong in that figure?  Then for 1983 the <Col N="812" /> amount raised by ITI would be £194 million, leaving £32 million for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I should prefer the accounting year to end on 31 December.  This would make more sense because the statistics are compiled to that date.</P>
    <P>The idea of looking for long-term rather than short-term funds is relevant. It is important that we should see the Irish Pound and its relativity to other currencies as an essential factor.  Borrowing will be substantially in foreign currency and that imposes certain obligations. We look forward to the return to the Order Paper of the main Bill.  I should like the Minister to allay my fears regarding his statement on the winding-up of ITI.  I understood that when the two boards were set up it was to become a subsidiary of Bord Telecom.  Is that still the Minister's intention?</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish the Ministers every success in this field.  The fact that this money is available through ITI eases their task to a certain extent at the Cabinet table.  I know the statutory element will guarantee that the public are getting good value in what ITI are borrowing, lending and leasing back.  I recommend that we should explore the possibility of doing this in other areas as well.</P>

Tugaim faoi deara ón méid ata ráite ag mo chara, an Teachta Donnellan, go bhfuil sé ag súil nach mbeidh diospóireacht faoin seirbhís go ginearálta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not often one gets the opportunity of simultaneously saying thanks and congratulations <Col N="813" /> to a former team and a new team.  I refer to my colleagues, Deputies John Wilson and Terry Leyden, both of whom enjoyed the offices now served by the Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, and the Minister of State, Deputy John Donnellan. In saying my thanks to the former team on this side I say welcome and congratulations to Deputy Jim Mitchell and Deputy John Donnellan.</P>
    <P>I note the content of the last paragraph of the statement of the Minister of State in which he appealed that we would not on this occasion stray too widely into the whole area of the telephone service.  It is not my intention to do so.  I propose, in the course of about five minutes, to give my thoughts briefly on the matter.  As a public representative if I am being asked to associate with a request for £200 million to be made available in respect of borrowing for 1983 and another £50 million left aside for borrowing maybe in 1984 and bearing in mind that it is the people who have to pay that money directly or indirectly, it would be remiss of me not to say how I feel in respect of the lack of service being provided for my constituents.</P>
    <P>The telephone is probably one of the greatest inventions of all time because it allows for conversation between people who are far away from each other.  I would remind the House that we have enshrined in our Constitution the importance of the family.  There is no more important unit.  Irish families are very closely knit and they are different from most other European families.  Even though some of us leave the home nest we are anxious when we move away to keep closely in touch with our parents, brothers and sisters.  The telephone ideally should provide the perfect service for that.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that when a request comes for such a large sum as we are being asked to provide today I must advise the House that in regard to that service in my constituency the only word to describe it is hopeless.  It is not possible, even though you have the service, to communicate in a satisfactory manner. Invariably the telephones are out of order when you try to make calls and very often <Col N="814" /> it is not possible to make telephone calls. If you establish contact with your mother or anybody else, interruptions very often occur.  That happens even at a distance of one mile or one-and-a-half miles away. On the other hand, I find I can ring my son in London and I have no difficulty at all.  When I am in Brussels or some other place I can ring home and there is no difficulty at all.  I hope we are not moving into a type of élitism in respect of this service.</P>
    <P>I agree with having the highest ideals and aiming for the highest standards when we are aspiring to the same standards which operate in European countries. I am afraid with regard to the standards here when one is communicating between son and parent, brother and sister, we have a long road to travel.  It would not be fair of me to let this opportunity pass without asking the Minister to ensure that a small amount of that £200 million which is being borrowed is applied to serving the needs of my constituents, who are tax-paying people, working hard and who are not asking for too much out of this life except that they should have this service which would allow them to communicate with each other.</P>
    <P>Under the Fianna Fáil Government there was a waiting period, but there are people in Finglas and Ballymun who are waiting for five years for a telephone. That is not an exaggeration.  It was confirmed to me in the House.  How can anybody come before me and speak of the need to have £200 million so that we can enjoy what seems to me to be the sophistication of a great telecommunications service.  I cannot accept that when I know there are people waiting for five years to have a telephone in my constituency. If we take it again at the level of the family I make no apology for saying that my first interest is in my fellow man. I believe in the old Chinese proverb that if we are continually looking at the stars we will not see what is at our feet.  I believe we are neglecting what is at our feet, our neighbours.  I know I shall not cause any embarrassment to the former team or the new team to whom I referred <Col N="815" /> because none of the four Deputies in question were in office five years ago.</P>
    <P>I will refer to another matter which occurred one-and-a-half years ago when people who had applied were given to understand that the service would be available.  They were invited to lodge a sum of £120 and were assured the service would be provided inside three months.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am afraid I could not agree at all, because the whole <i>raison d'être</i> of what we are discussing is communication and to me there is nothing more vital in respect of the moneys required than that to which I refer.  As my sons and daughters would say to me: &ldquo;If it is not about what I am talking about what, then, is it in aid of?&rdquo;  Is it in aid of this élitism?  Are we guaranteeing that people with businesses here &mdash; and I understand they pay for the service &mdash; will have a perfect system?  Are we guaranteeing professional people will have it? But are we treating the-man-in-the-street, the person who is concerned, the person who pays, differently?  Are we trying to establish that his right is to wait some other occasion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I am concerned, and I am sure if you, a Cheann Comhairle, were standing where I am &mdash; I do not propose to impose on your patience or your audience at any great length &mdash; you would accept that the need of some old age pensioner in Cappagh, who has not got a phone, is as great or greater than the need of any business concern which has got a phone.  An old age pensioner may have a daughter living three or four miles away.  That daughter may have a baby but the old age pensioner cannot go to see the baby.  She is, however, naturally anxious about it and she wants to ring up the daughter to find out how the baby is. That, to me, is a perfect interest, one that is to be satisfied ideally with this service and, if it is not provided, we are entitled here to criticise the absence of it.  If, on the other hand, the daughter is concerned <Col N="816" /> about the wellbeing of either of her parents it is important she should have this service available to her.</P>
    <P>As I said initially, I do not intend to develop this at any great length.  All I am doing is indicating how wrong I thought it was for a Department &mdash; and I remember discussing this with Deputy Harte when he was Minister &mdash; to take £120 from a poor person in my constituency, guaranteeing he or she would have a service within three months, holding on to the £120 for a year and then blandly telling that person from whom the money had been taken that they were sorry they could not supply the service but, if he or she so wished, they would return the money, paying no interest on it.  I do not regard that as a fair or just operation for any Government department.  I do not think there is any need for me to labour that which is my concern in respect of this Bill, a Bill which I welcome.  I am merely asking that a small amount of that money be laid aside so that the people &mdash; I do not like using the term &ldquo;the ordinary people&rdquo;, but the plain people of Ireland, <i>the</i> people of Ireland, the best people of Ireland &mdash; who have service and who pay for the service should have a perfect service and those who are waiting many years for it and are prepared to pay for it should get it.  I think that is a very reasonable request.</P>
    <P>I do not know what the situation is in the constituency so well served by the Minister of State but I am quite sure the Minister will be aware, because he represents a constituency not very different from my own, of such injustice operating in his own constituency and I look forward, when he comes to reply, to getting an assurance that the needs of these people will be met and their rights will not be neglected in respect of the additional moneys being sought.</P>

      <P>: I want to apologise for not being able to introduce this Bill myself but I was detained elsewhere on important Government business.  I am glad of the opportunity of being here to reply to the debate.  First, I want to say a word of <Col N="817" /> sincere appreciation to the Opposition for their help in the enactment of this Bill.  The Bill was, of course, envisaged by Deputy Wilson, my predecessor in the Department.</P>
      <P>In relation to the main Bill, the P &amp; T Services Bill, on which Deputy Leyden and Deputy Wilson raised questions and sought clarification, I would reiterate it is the Government's intention to reintroduce the P &amp; T Services Bill at Committee Stage by motion as soon as possible after the Easter recess.  I cannot be more specific than that.  Deputy Wilson, as Minister responsible for the Bill, undertook in discussions with the trade unions certain amendments which I intend to honour.  They are either drafted or are in course of being drafted.  We have some further amendments in mind following on-going discussions with the trade unions and other Departments.  I am very keen to have the Bill before the House at Committee Stage as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I am a little distressed to hear of Deputy Wilson's telephone experience. I did not know anything about it and I shall certainly make inquiries this afternoon and, if I can help to alleviate the situation, I shall certainly do so.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be dragged off course on this Bill but Deputy Leyden spent a little time on broadcasting before&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: He inquired whether money would be made available from An Bord Telecom or IT Investments Limited for broadcasting.  That, of course, is not envisaged.  As I said earlier on in this House, we hope we will have before the House in the course of the year legislation dealing with broadcasting and wireless telegraphy plus the question of the development of local broadcasting.  It is for that precise reason and because it is an area in regard to which Ministers have not been able to give enough time and attention in order to look after it that we appointed a second Minister to look after it.  That has been the subject of a great deal of criticism by Deputy Leyden. However, I think he will see the wisdom <Col N="818" /> of it when we make the progress we envisage during the course of the year.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson asked about the amount of money provided last year.  Last year the Exchequer provided £80 million and ITI £141 million.  This year the Exchequer proposes to provide £32 million and ITI £194 million.  Deputy Wilson voiced concern about ITI being wound up.  Let me explain the situation.  ITI is a statutory company set up by legislation, legislation this Bill is amending, in order to increase borrowing limits.  It was a purely temporary arrangement until An Bord Telecom was set up.  When this board is statutorily set up the need for maintaining ITI will no longer exist and it will be a matter for An Bord Telecom to decide whether or not they should continue ITI as a subsidiary.</P>
      <P>I must say I wholeheartedly identify with the problems Deputy Tunney raised and he, being a near constituent of mine, will be aware of how aware I am of the problems in the constituency.  He has a neighbouring constituency and I am sure the problems are quite similar there. There is no doubt that there are major telecommunications problems in Dublin. We have an unsatisfactory situation in relation to repairs.  There is a backlog but this has been considerably reduced. Hopefully in another few weeks people will not have to wait very long to have their telephone repaired.  I hope that by the end of the year 90 per cent of all faults will be put right within two days and the balance within five days.  The Minister of State is addressing himself to this.</P>
      <P>Dublin has also a major problem in relation to telephone connections.  By the end of this year much of the country outside of Dublin will be supplied with telephones almost on demand.  We are working very hard to achieve this and I am confident that it will be done.  There are already a number of areas where telephones are available on demand and Kilkenny is one of these.  It will be the end of next year before telephones will be supplied on demand in Dublin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for connections and new exchanges is on target.  If there is anything I or the Minister of State can do to achieve our targets earlier we will do <Col N="819" /> it.  It is only right to admit that there are major problems in Dublin but every effort is being made to alleviate them. There is light at the end of the tunnel. When I tell people that by the end of next year we will have telephones more or less on demand they say to me &ldquo;I heard it before, Joe&rdquo;.  Announcements were made in the past about the number of telephone connections which would be made each year.  I remember a famous intervention by the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, when he was in Opposition and when Deputy Reynolds was Minister.  Deputy Reynolds said that a great number of telephones would be connected and Deputy Donnellan asked how many were working.  We should only install as many telephones as can be properly serviced.</P>
    <P>Money was taken from people on the basis of their having a telephone installed in the near future.  In my constituency I know of a few cases where people were left waiting for telephone installations for over a year.  I regret that this ever happened. I will ensure, as far as I can, that this will not happen in future and that money will not be sought unless we are confident that we can supply and install telephones.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to my pre decessors &mdash; Deputies Wilson, Cooney, Reynolds, Faulkner and to Dr. Conor Cruise O'Brien.  They in their time were the butt of much criticism because of faults in the telephone system.  They are the people who conceived the plans for the development of the service, and they worked hard.  Hopefully I will be the Minister who will deliver a first-class telephone service but it is only fair that those who took much of the criticism in the past should take much of the credit for the first-class service which is now on the horizon.  Such a service will be important for our economic development as well as for personal and social reasons.  It is vitally important for industrial development.</P>
    <P>In the next few weeks all automatic exchanges will be able to dial direct to the whole of the UK as well as to 70 other countries.  That is a very big step forward. <Col N="820" /> Areas of the country which up to now were considered isolated will be more attractive for industrial development. The telephone system which is developing now is a digital one and gives us a great advantage over all other European countries.  We are at least three years ahead of any other country and will have the most advanced system in Europe.  As the system is digitalised it gives us a great opportunity for attracting information based industries.  This together with developments in satellite broadcasting offers great scope for the country.  If we can attract additional industries because of the new telephone system those who have held the office as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and were in the hot seat will deserve their share of the credit.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can the Minister give any indication of the effects of the devaluation of the punt on the original loans by the ITI?  The bulk of the financing for this development came from the European Investment Bank and the new EEC Community instrument for borrowing and lending NIC.  Has the Minister any indication of the effect it will have on the repayments?  I fear it will mean there will be less money for investing in buildings and infrastructure in 1983.  Can the Minister say what the projects are that the money will be spent on in 1983?  This will be of great interest to Deputies and also to subscribers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even though our ambition was to have telephones on demand there is still a waiting list which, at the end of September 1982, was around 80,000 people.  I understand &mdash; perhaps the Minister will refute <Col N="821" /> this &mdash; that proposals for installations in 1983 have been reduced by about 10 per cent.  If there is a reduction in the number of connections proposed for 1983, it could result in a reduction in employment in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I know the Minister would not be in a position to give that information in detail but perhaps he could indicate the effects of the devaluation of the punt in relation to repayments on the original loans and also indicate where this money will be raised, whether on the Irish or European market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not have any information to hand on the effects of devaluation.  The punt has been strengthening for the last couple of months on foreign exchanges so there will have been advantages in that regard.  I do not have any information on how devaluation will offset those earlier advantages, but if the Deputy so wishes, I will communicate with him on the subject.</P>
      <P>I can only give a general indication of how the money will be spent this year in the telecommunications field because, as the list is so long, I could not possibly specify everything.  The main uses for expenditure will be expansion of the local telephone network, expansion and modernisation of the trunk network, new buildings for exchanges, area engineering headquarters and training schools, conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working, extension of subscriber trunk dialling and international subscriber dialling, expansion of telex and data networks and new services.  I can let the Deputy have more details if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the number of connections, it is projected that this year we will have between 70,000 and 80,000 new connections.  That is a little less than was anticipated a couple of months ago but it is 11,000 to 21,000 greater than was achieved in 1982.  In 1980, the waiting list was 92,000, at the end of 1981 it was 86,000, in 1982 it was 78,000 and, by the end end of this year, it could be as low as 50,000.  By the end of next year we hope to have hardly any waiting list.  There are a couple of reasons for the estimated reduction in the number of connections <Col N="822" /> this year.  One is that a number of staff have been diverted to repairs because there has been a serious problem in this regard, especially in Dublin.  The recession is also affecting the demand for telephones.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has the following objectives. Firstly, to raise the ceiling on the maximum amount which the Industrial Credit Company &mdash; the ICC &mdash; may borrow. Secondly, to raise the limit on the maximum amount of ICC borrowings which may be guaranteed by the Minister for <Col N="823" /> Finance.  Thirdly, to give the Minister for Finance power to waive the repayment by the ICC of certain Exchequer advances in respect of schemes operated by the ICC at the credit risk of the Exchequer.  Fourthly, to increase from seven to nine the maximum number of directors on the ICC board, primarily in order to allow direct State representation on the board.</P>
    <P>The ICC was established in 1933 mainly to provide long-term industrial credit.  During the ensuing 50 years, the company, both directly and through their subsidiary company, ICC Corporate Finance Limited, have provided an ever-expanding range of services &mdash; including loans, venture capital, hire purchase and leasing facilities, financial capital underwriting, issuing house services, advice on mergers and management buy-outs and general financial advice.  As a result, in this their Golden Jubilee Year, the ICC may fairly claim to be making an important contribution to industrial development and their respected position in financial and industrial circles reflects great credit on their board, management and staff over the years.  I might add also that the ICC have shown a profit in every year since their establishment and have paid the Exchequer dividends in most years, including every year since 1969.  I would also like to think that the practical support and encouragement which both sides of this House have given to the ICC since their establishment has made no small contribution to its success.</P>
    <P>Since the enactment of the last Industrial Credit Act in 1979, the ICC have increased their level of annual advances from £66 million in 1979 to £140 million in 1982.  Most of this increased activity has been for the benefit of smaller enterprises. Indeed, last year, over 90 per cent of all transactions approved by ICC were accounted for by firms employing less than 100 persons.  The single most significant contributory factor to this increase has been the extension of exchange risk guarantee schemes which are concentrated on small and medium-sized enterprises. As a result, there are now European <Col N="824" /> Investment Bank schemes administered by the ICC for fixed-asset investment in both the manufacturing and tourism sectors.  There are also working capital schemes, financed by direct foreign borrowings by the ICC, for manufacturers, exporters and tourism enterprises.</P>
    <P>The exchange risk for all of these foreign borrowings by the ICC &mdash; which stood at £229 million at end-October 1982 &mdash; is borne by the Exchequer.  This is not a costless commitment as the recent EMS currency alignment has underscored.  At a time when we are experiencing difficult budgetary problems, I must be sensitive to the actual and potential burden on the Exchequer arising from the provision of exchange risk cover on this scale.  It is appropriate, therefore, that the cost-effectiveness, as an industrial incentive, of such cover should be reviewed from time to time.  However, I am fully aware of the value to the productive sectors of low-interest rate loan finance during the present recession.  This value is clearly shown by the fact that in 1982, the ICC increased their total advances by almost 40 per cent despite the difficulties experienced by industry.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions of this Bill, there has always been a statutory limit on the extent to which the ICC may borrow for their operations and this limit has been amended from time to time, as required, by legislation.  The existing statutory limit on borrowings is £400 million which was fixed in 1979.  At the end of their last financial year on 31 October 1982, the company's borrowings were £364 million.  Thus, the ICC will be reaching their borrowing limit shortly and an increase in this limit is now required to enable the company to continue their operations.  The new limit proposed in section 2 of this Bill is £800 million.  This doubling of the existing limit is intended to meet the ICC's anticipated requirements over the next three to four years, in accordance with established practice for legislation of this type.  Accordingly, I expect that Deputies will recognise that this apparently large increase is not unreasonable.</P>
    <P>Also, in accordance with the now usual <Col N="825" /> practice for ICC legislation, it is proposed, in section 3, to increase the limit on the amount of the ICC's borrowings which the Minister for Finance may guarantee. Except for advances from the Exchequer, virtually all of the ICC's borrowings, whether by way of taking deposits or otherwise, must be guaranteed.  As the Exchequer has not made any advances to the company since 1980 because of the ICC's increasing institutional strength, Exchequer funds have become a sharply declining share of the ICC's sources of funds.  Accordingly, there is now more than ever a need to raise the guarantee limit in line with the borrowing limit.</P>
    <P>Section 4 of the Bill proposes to give the Minister for Finance power to waive repayments of principal due from the ICC on Exchequer advances.  While this is a general provision, it will apply only to certain Exchequer advances which were on-lent by the ICC at the credit risk of the Exchequer under certain schemes either to help small- and medium-sized under-capitalised industrial companies or for ship-building purposes.  The special loans scheme for under-capitalised enterprises was introduced in the late 1960s. As the loans under this scheme were intended to be specifically above and beyond those warranted by normal banking criteria in order to help the enterprises involved to start up or expand, the risk of business failure was correspondingly higher.  Unfortunately, some business failures have already taken place and the companies in question have been unable to meet their commitments to the ICC.  Advances for shipbuilding were provided to the ICC for their subsidiary shipping finance corporation for on-lending also at the credit risk of the Exchequer. The Minister for Finance already has authority to waive repayments of interest but he has no such power in relation to repayment of principal.  Hence the need to make provision for this in the present Bill.  Section 4 also provides that amounts so waived will be repaid to the Minister for funds to be provided by the Oireachtas. In order to avoid any possible misunderstanding of this section, I would like to emphasise that there is absolutely <Col N="826" /> no question of the Exchequer &mdash; either now or in the future &mdash; having to waive any of the repayments of advances due from the ICC on their normal commercial activities.</P>
    <P>The final substantive section in the Bill &mdash; section 5 &mdash; proposes an increase from seven to nine in the maximum number of directors on the board of the ICC.  The primary purpose of this increase in numbers is to enable direct representation of the company's owner &mdash; that is, the State &mdash; on the board of directors.  Recent experience in the State-sponsored body sector has pointed to the need for developing a closer understanding on broad policy issues between Government and the boards of State companies, and the proposed increase in the size of the ICC board is designed to facilitate this process. I could of course have accommodated direct representation of the State within the existing board structure.  However, as the ICC board is relatively small and as one of its members is the managing director, I consider that it would be preferable to increase the size of the board rather than reduce the number of experienced and well-qualified directors on the board whose contribution is so vital and is much appreciated in view of the many other calls on their time.  I should make it absolutely clear that the proposed increase in the size of the board implies no criticism whatsoever of the existing board, whose performance has been admirable and is reflected in the strong position of the company.</P>
    <P>In summary, this legislation is intended to enable the ICC, in this their golden jubilee year, to continue their valuable contribution to industrial development. I know that Deputies on all sides of the House will join with me in congratulating the board, management and staff of ICC on fifty years of devoted service in the development of Irish industry.  We acknowledge also the performance of their predecessors whose endeavours have proved so fruitful.  Finally, I would like to pay special tribute to former Deputy Seán MacEntee, happily still with us, who as Minister for Finance 50 years ago piloted the Industrial Credit Act, 1933 through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="827" /> I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: This Bill has come before the House as a matter of urgency, such urgency that I got a copy of it only this morning.  Included with the copy of the Bill was a copy of the Minister's Second Stage speech.  In view of the urgency which was signposted in getting this Bill through I would have thought that the Minister himself&mdash;I say this with all due respect to the Minister of State&mdash;would have been able to come into the House to deal with a Bill which on his own indication was a matter of very considerable urgency and importance.  There are some very important issues to be discussed on this Bill which normally we on this side of the House and I in particular, as a former Minister for Finance knowing the role of the ICC, would wish to promote and support in every way possible. For that reason it is strange that the Minister who signposted the urgency and importance is not here himself to deal with what is undoubtedly an urgent and important Bill.  Also, as we shall see later, not only does it create a precedent in respect of the board structure of the ICC but very likely creates a precedent for other semi-State bodies at which the Members of the House, were they aware of it fully and had they the time to consider it, would look with a certain degree of apprehension and some with a degree of total opposition, not least of them the party represented by the Minister of State in this House at this moment.  I do not even know if his own party have had an opportunity of considering the full implications of section 5 &mdash; we will come to it on Committees Stage &mdash; which were not clear until the Minister's speech today, a copy of which I got this morning, indicated the purpose of, namely the extension from seven to nine members of the board, the additional two of whom it now seems will be representative of the main shareholder, namely the State.  By that one can only assume that we are talking about direct civil service representation on the board of ICC.  I will come back to that in a moment.  It is one of the matters that makes this Bill of particular importance <Col N="828" /> not just for the ICC but for other semi-State bodies also.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill as far as the first three aims stated by the Minister are concerned.  The fourth is the one on which I have the reservation.  It is appropriate that we should welcome the Bill because this is the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the ICC, whose role in this year of developmental needs in our economy of the need to support and promote the efforts of entrepreneurial activity, marketing, management, and development of our small companies, is clearly more evident than it has been at any time since it was established by Seán MacEntee, who is still, happily, very active.  I join the Minister in his generous tribute to Mr. MacEntee and men of that generation who saw the need for the development of this kind of State support to help entrepreneurs who lacked technical know-how and management and accounting experience which the infant industries of that period were bound to face.</P>
      <P>The success of the company is attributable to those pioneers and to those who have been associated with it over the past 50 years.  That reflects particularly on the management and board of the ICC who have had, and still enjoy, considerable achievements.  The ICC gave support to many major employers throughout the country.  One example is Cement/Roadstone.  Without the essential support given in the early days to such companies, which now play a very important role in our economy, we would not have seen the growth which has developed.  There is a new turn in our economy &mdash; the national and international recession and our growing population which requires that we will be able to accommodate not just their needs but their potential&mdash;and the role of the ICC and like bodies is of more importance now than at any time since they were established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of the management of ICC will become even more important not least because of the advice, assistance and liaison they give companies seeking loan finance.  From my experience as Minister for Finance, to whom this board <Col N="829" /> were responsible, I know that this board, in the person of its chief executive, chairman and members, discharged in the best possible way the responsibilities which had been thrust on them.  I had the opportunity of meeting them both as Minister for Finance and as commissioner and had consultations with them in relation to activities of the European Investment Bank.  It will be noted from this year's annual report that they have developed a considerable loan base.  I have full confidence in the management, executive and the board of this company as they now operate.  That is why I have considerable reservations about the proposals to change the composition of the board in what I regard as a significant and, frankly, unhelpful way.  I do not want to be critical of the civil service, but I will come back to that later.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that this company have shown a profit in every year of operation.  That is a headline which needs to be brought home to many State companies which do not seem to be able to demonstrate their capacity to qualify for what the Americans call the bottom line criteria.  The role of semi-State companies is to take on responsibilities by way of support, promotion, or, as in this case, loan finance, or advice for small companies in particular.  They also have a responsibility to taxpayers.  There has been evidence in recent times of a number of companies which have been unable to discharge satisfactorily their second line of responsibility, that is, to the taxpayer, and the degree of subsidy and support required is a matter of some concern.  Fortunately this company is an exception to that regrettable trend.  For that reason we should hasten slowly before making any radical proposals to change the structure of the board.</P>
    <P>This company have paid dividends to the Exchequer every year since 1969. That, too, is a matter of very considerable importance.  I note that 90 per cent of all the transactions of this company were with firms employing fewer than 100 persons. At this stage of our development we see a greater need for the development of our native based industries, and <Col N="830" /> concepts of self-reliance which were characteristic of the thirties will have to be promoted as a central concept in our economic development from now on.  We cannot continue to look to an outside world which is in recession to solve our problems.  I would not take from the contribution of foreign industries here, but it is clear the major target for development in the future will have to be ourselves for ourselves, with the support of companies like the ICC.  At present the development of resources in areas such as forestry, fishery and so on are outside the scope of the ICC.  These areas indicate a new avenue for development.</P>
    <P>The ICC have extended their range of activities into the hotel and tourist industries &mdash; apart altogether from the traditional manufacturing sector &mdash; and there is precedent for further extension in that area.  I am very aware of the need to provide low interest rate finance for companies at the starting point, at the early stages of development or when they get into difficulties, which has happened to so many companies recently because of market conditions.  When I was Minister for Finance the Government adopted my proposal to give exchange risk guarantees to the ICC to enable them not only to borrow at low interest rates but so that they could transfer the benefits to their customers &mdash; namely, our industrial promoters &mdash; and to give them that degree of security in relation to the borrowings they undertake and the advances they make.</P>
    <P>It is clear that a sizeable proportion of their borrowing is in foreign currencies. Last year, as is evident from the statement issued by the chairman and chief executive when their annual report for 1982 was published, the losses arising out of the exchange fluctuations in which much of the borrowing was conducted was of the order of £1.6 million.  I understand that a considerable proportion of the borrowing of the banks is in foreign currencies apart from the fact that the deposit base has increased at home.  One of the reasons why I regret the absence of the Minister is that he recently told us in this House on the issue of devaluation that <Col N="831" /> the actual net addition to the current budget this year, which is already three months through, would be £17 million. He did not, significantly, take account of the losses, as a consequence of his devaluation decision, on the borrowings undertaken by companies such as the Industrial Credit Company.</P>
    <P>The Minister conveniently that evening ignored the cost of such exchange risk cover.  If last year the bill for that loss was £1.6 million it is very clear that, as a consequence of the Government's decision to devalue our currency within the EMS &mdash; though it appears now it was not with the EMS currencies their preoccupation was at all but the change in the relationship with sterling which is not in the EMS &mdash;the bill for 1983 will be considerably more than that.</P>
    <P>I presume that many of the borrowings will be in Deutschemarks.  The Minister in coming to his calculation of £17 million was referring to the current market rate of the Deutschemark <i>vis-à-vis</i> EMS currencies, our own in particular.  Virtually everyone agrees that the Deutschemark will appreciate in value <i>vis-à-vis</i> other currencies and already we have seen that trend develop.  This will mean that the repayment cost of the borrowings we have undertaken will be affected very much more by the devaluation decision than the Minister has so far been prepared to indicate.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that that accounts for the Minister's absence from the House at this stage, but I wonder what does account for his absence.  I see our own Chief Whip is in the House.  This matter was presented to us as being of extreme urgency and importance that had to get through all Stages today.  It was of such urgency and importance that I could only have a copy of the Bill this morning. Naturally I am obliged to be here to debate this issue but I wonder why the man who is promoting the urgency and importance cannot be here to deal with it as well.</P>
    <P>Of course it is clear that because the total borrowings for last year were of the order of £364 million the ICC is coming very close to its limit of £400 million <Col N="832" /> under existing legislation.  Nobody, least of all this side of the House &mdash; I presume we are all agreed on this &mdash; would want to leave any doubt as to the capacity of the ICC to extend its range of borrowing so we are prepared to support this Bill which extends the range of the borrowing capacity from £400 million to £800 million, which is an appropriate figure having regard to the developmental role of the company and the likelihood that we will not need to come back to the Oireachtas for three or four years to extend the borrowing rate again.</P>
    <P>Virtually all of these borrowings must be guaranteed, and that means that the ICC is, like any State-sponsored company, in a privileged position.  It is guaranteed by the State.  This gives it a sense of security that merchant banks do not have.  Because it has that it must be careful that it does not see itself just as a merchant bank, though I do commend its sense of responsibility to the Exchequer. It must take account always of its developmental role and the fact that it is basically to provide low interest finance over long terms to the promoters of this country. I have to mark at this stage more than an impression that this developmental role, as distinct from the role of merchant bank, is at risk of being overshadowed not least by this proposal to have representation from the civil service on the board.  The ICC when it was launched 50 years ago was not seen as being a merchant bank.  I hope it does not see itself as being that now.  It must show a degree of involvement which, by and large, it is doing with its customers, a degree of advice, a degree of co-ordination and a degree of tolerance.  I know the write-off of losses this last year have been considerable, but the write-off of losses in the associated banks and merchant banks has also been considerable. For that reason the ICC should not feel inhibited in maintaining what has been their fundamental role in this economy &mdash; that of service to our industry and to the small employment sector in particular.</P>
    <P>It has in recent times too filled another role &mdash; that of rescuer of companies which were experiencing considerable <Col N="833" /> difficulty.  It was through the ICC that Fóir Teoranta was launched to deal with companies experiencing acute problems as distinct from those that would be drawing loan facilities and other assistance from the ICC.</P>
    <P>For that reason I should like to refer to the liaison between Fóir Teoranta and the Industrial Credit Corporation.  I am not saying that Fóir Teoranta feed only bad news.  They have been doing a magnificent job but there is a risk that the ICC will be fed continuously with the bad news that comes through because of their association with Fóir Teoranta.  Consequently, there may be a case for considering whether the close liaison that exists between the two bodies should be looked at again in the light of current circumstances. There may be a need for a greater degree of co-ordination with Fóir Teoranta by way of the rescue agency of the IDA.  It is only in terms of managerial attitude that the ICC should be informed. I would prefer that they be free from the depression that might preoccupy them by their being too closely associated with the role of Fóir Teoranta who have a specific role and a role that they are discharging very satisfactorily.  I suggest that the Minister keep that in mind.  I am not saying this on the basis of any specific case of which I am aware, but I am aware of a number of small industries who find that the response they receive from the ICC is not as encouraging as it might be.  However, I expect that in the nature of things that will be the case always.  I should like to see the ICC maintaining a positive and indeed pioneering role and not in any way to be at risk of reacting to the depression in which we find ourselves or to the difficulties that might arise in any bank.</P>
    <P>Before referring to what I regard as the unwelcome aspect of the Bill, there are a couple of other matters that I should like to put before the Minister.  It is clear that the base of the financing of the ICC has changed considerably in recent times. I understand that 30 per cent of the loan facility available to them comes from the European Investment Bank.  That is a very important dimension of the development of the ICC and it is of very considerable importance and potential so far <Col N="834" /> as the country is concerned.  The European Investment Bank has a particular role in promoting the activities of companies such as the ICC who play an important role in the economy.  I am aware of that both from my experience as Minister for Finance and from my experience as Commissioner in Europe for 12 months.  One can only encourage the development of co-operation and support from the bank to companies such as the ICC.  I am confident that the potential for the further channelling of support from the bank is considerable.  The ICC are very conscious of that and will exploit the opportunity in a responsible way to the maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>As an indication of the role of the ICC I would point out that there was an increase of the order of 101 per cent in their deposits in 1982.  That is a tribute to the aggressive marketing of the company in relation to their own role and in terms of the security they offer depositors. Most people would regard an increase of 101 per cent in deposits as being a considerable achievement but in this case there was the advantage of a State guarantee, something which the company's competitors do not enjoy.  For that reason I underline that there is scope for extending further the opportunity for attracting small deposits into the funds of the ICC as has been done by their sister company, the ACC.</P>
    <P>Having said that I hope that the general trend we have witnessed on the part of the Government and particularly on the part of the Minister for Finance in relation to small deposits, in relation to building societies and in relation to anything that might encourage thrift, responsibility and saving, will not have the result of discouraging the ICC from going out into the market place, especially to attract small deposits.  If the ICC play an essential role for small industries, equally they should play a role for small depositors who have a sense of commitment and patriotism.  But such depositors would need an assurance that their money values would not be undermined by such factors as devaluation.  This is an important element.</P>
    <P>Another aspect that concerns small <Col N="835" /> depositors &mdash; and this is one about which I have had many communications since the budget &mdash; is what appears to be the preoccupation not only of the Minister but perhaps of the Department of Finance with Exchequer protection, with tax revenue in particular, without having regard to the other side of the coin, that is, the opportunity to provide at home a base of investment support from funds at home.  I mention that in the context of the ICC being in a position to encourage broader-based deposits than has been the case up to now.  Last year the full target for the ICC of £150 million was not reached.  Perhaps that is understandable having regard to the general climate of recession in which this economy, as the most open economy in Europe, has found itself.  But the ICC should be encouraged to reach in so far as possible the targets for new advances as set out in the Public Capital Programme.</P>
    <P>However, when one considers what the situation was last year, when to say the least we had a public capital programme in which there was greater commitment to development in employment than is the case this year, one wonders what the experience will be this year in the light of a cut-back in this programme of £220 million.  The various infrastructures, house building, roads and so on, will be affected by this cutback.  One wonders, then what role the ICC will have this year.  May we expect the Government to acknowledge that on every front development or support for development are not to be priorities?  Should the potential of the ICC for development be frustrated rather than encouraged?  The trend of Government policy as enunicated in the budget is not in any sense pointing to development but rather to a fiscal concentration which in present conditions may undermine the role of the development arm of our economy.  For groups such as the ICC it is important that there should be some degree of security in the trends that will be promoted in the economy.  The chief executive of the ICC, as reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 February 1983, was cautious about giving <Col N="836" /> a forecast for interest rates.  He said:</P>
    <P>We are not expecting a dramatic rise and there is a possibility of a slight fall.</P>
    <P>I am afraid that his lack of expectation of a dramatic rise has been seriously undermined in the meantime.  We were told that the dramatic rise was necessary because of currency movements out of Ireland and now that we have had a devaluation I should like to know if we can expect a dramatic fall to ease the burden on industry who must pay a very high price as a result of the recent increase.  The Taoiseach over the weekend said that if we do not see a dramatic fall in interest rates he would have to be told the reasons why, the implication being that if it is not going to happen through the associated banks in consultation with the Central Bank, the Taoiseach would ensure that it would.  Some dealers this morning dismissed that saying: &ldquo;With all due respect if this was Reagan who was talking maybe he could achieve what he said but we think Garret FitzGerald is in a different position&rdquo;.  We saw enough in the House this morning to indicate that the words of the Taoiseach are not always followed by actions consistent with those words.  At this stage I will not say any more; charity alone would oblige me to give him the benefit of my silence in respect of that.  The industrial sector waits with bated breath for the implementation of the commitment by the Taoiseach on Sunday so that concerns such as the ICC who operate in this area get some breathing space from the suffocating high interest rates that exist.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with the one element of the Bill that we intend to oppose strongly.  It was not until today that we were made aware of the terms of section 5.  Subsection 1 of that section states:</P>
    <P>(1) The Schedule to the Principal Act, is hereby amended by the substitution in paragraph 3 of that Schedule of &ldquo;nine&rdquo; for &ldquo;seven&rdquo;, and the said paragraph, as so amended, is set out in the Table to this subsection.</P>
    <P>Effectively, that means that it is the intention <Col N="837" /> to increase the number of directors of the company.  We did not get the full story of why that is being done until the Minister introduced the Bill.  We must give credit for honesty, if nothing else, because the Minister said that the primary purpose of the increase in numbers was to enable direct representation of the company's owner on the board of directors. That is a sharp reminder to the company.  The Minister said that recent experiences in the State-sponsored bodies sector had pointed to the need for developing a closer understanding on broad policy issues between the Government and the boards of State companies and the proposed increase in the size of the ICC board was designed to facilitate that process.</P>
    <P>I recognise the need to remind State-sponsored bodies of the need for closer understanding of board policy issues but I cannot under any circumstances accept that recent experiences have pointed to the need for the development of this closer understanding.  The experiences of the ICC and the Minister for Finance would not come under that heading.  That is clear from the Minister's speech this morning because he commended the activities of the company, its board and management.  He commended the responsible role the company is playing and he drew attention to the fact that it has shown a profit each year since it was established and has paid a dividend since 1969.  In spite of all that, but apparently because of general trends which exist in State companies, the Minister has decided to have big brother in the form of civil service representation on this board to keep him informed.</P>
    <P>As a former Minister for Finance I am conscious of the need for a disciplined approach by State bodies but that does not mean that their management developmental role should be undermined in any way by the presence of big brother listening, watching and cautioning, as inevitably they will be doing, against any development of their role.  This serious step will change the role of our semi-State structure.  It is significant that the bridgehead is being created in respect of one of <Col N="838" /> our most successful semi-State organisations.</P>
    <P>Is that an indictment of the management and board of the ICC?  Whatever mistakes Governments have made about appointments to State boards it can be reasonably claimed that special consideration was given to the calibre of those asked to serve on the board of ICC.  Their calibre has been proved by their contribution down the years.  The chief executive is recognised as being a man of the highest standing and commitment and so are the members of the board.  Vacancies exist on the board and I am sure that the filling of them will not give rise to any political priority by the Minister.  I would much prefer to see the representation on this board strengthened by the appointment of people of proven experience in the business, banking and related sectors even if they represent Fine Gael or Labour.  Labour may not claim to have many such people but I believe they have such people lurking somewhere.  Should Labour not say: &ldquo;Should the appointments not be in line with what we have been saying about State boards &mdash; worker representation on them&rdquo;.  Would that not mean something more than having big brother from the Department?</P>
    <P>This backward step is being proposed at short notice and while we support the Second Reading of the Bill we will be opposed to section 5.  Not only is it contrary to the ICC and the employment programme the company support but, more significantly, it is an indication of Government thinking.  As a former Minister I know how the officials of the Department of Finance feel.  In fact this notion was suggested to me when I was Minister and I believe it was suggested to my successor, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald but it is significant that it never got beyond being a suggestion until Deputy Dukes was appointed.  For the first time the role of the semi-State bodies is to be changed and I do not think we will see a great beauty being born.  The Minister for Finance should be told that he is moving into uncharted and dangerous territory which will change the whole nature of semi-State activity, particularly of those who up to this time have proven <Col N="839" /> by their record and the record of those who depend upon them, the small industrialists, that they have been a considerable success.  I do not want to see that success undermined by shortsighted approaches from the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>An Exchequer grant of £1,451,250, representing 75 per cent of the estimated cost, was approved in 1981 towards the cost of a major development scheme for Greencastle harbour which includes the dredging of the harbour.  A revised estimate of cost has recently been received from the Office of Public Works and is being examined in my Department.  Subject to the approval of a grant based on the revised figure of cost and the availability of the necessary finance tenders will be invited as early as possible for the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>: When is the Minister prepared to sanction the works on this pier?  Is money available for it this year? In view of the costs involved in the development of this very important fishing port not only for Donegal but for the north west generally, would the Minister consider that a full grant should be given by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry towards the cost of this development rather than expecting the local authority to make a contribution of 25 per cent, which will cost them in the region of £60,000 per year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: The latter part of the question covers an area which it is not within my competence to deal with.  The practice has been that the local authority should be involved to the extent of a 25 per cent local contribution.  Changing that practice would not be a matter for my Department.  The question of when the work will start depends on the availability of the necessary finance and the approval of the Department of Finance for the expenditure.  The estimate has been revised upwards and we are talking about a very substantial sum of money. <Col N="841" /> The commencement of the work will depend on when the money is available. An allocation of £0.5 million has been provided in the 1983 Estimates to meet the anticipated expenditure on the scheme this year.  However, this sum is subject to a review of the published financial allocations which is at present being undertaken by the Government.  In that case also a contribution would be expected from the local authority.</P>

      <P>: Would the Minister agree that a fisherman who commissioned a boat some time ago may now find it impossible to use the harbour due to the development's not having taken place?  I appreciate that there has been some movement in relation to dredging of the harbour and making the port accessible to boats of a larger size.  Will the Minister assure the House that there will be ongoing expenditure to ensure that fishermen will be able to use the harbour so that their efforts to obtain a livelihood will not be frustrated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: As the Deputy is probably aware, dredging works were being undertaken at Purteen harbour in the Autumn of 1981 when it was discovered that the pier was badly undermined. Work on the dredging scheme was suspended in order that the position might be reviewed in the light of the damage to the pier and the fact that additional improvement works were being sought by the local fishermen.</P>
      <P>An estimate of the cost of repairs to the pier and of the additional improvement works has recently been received from the Office of Public Works and the matter is under consideration by my Department at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he has any policy on the protection of inshore fisheries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: The main feature of policy concerning inshore fisheries is that enshrined in the access arrangements of the common fisheries policy of the EEC which was agreed recently.  Under those arrangements fishing by member states within six miles seawards from baselines is prohibited and fishing by member states within the six to 12 band is restricted to five states for certain limited areas and for certain species of fish.  Irish boats over 75 feet in length require a fishing licence from my Department and a condition of the licence is that such boats must fish outside three miles from baselines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: My question relates more to inshore fishermen.  Small half-deckers are restricted to a certain extent by bigger boats fishing inside the three or <Col N="849" /> four mile limit.  Would the Minister consider their position in view of the fact they feel their livelihood is threatened? They are seasonal fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the past various attempts have been made to reach amicable agreements or arrangements between the different categories of boats but so far nobody has been capable of sorting out the problem.  The only conditions imposed are, as I said, in relation to those boats in excess of 75 feet which require a licence.  There are further restrictions in relation to boats over 90 feet.  As I said, nobody so far has been able to sort out the problem, and the imposition of a third category of restrictive regulations would be impracticable.</P>

There we conform to the common fisheries policy.  I know it is difficult, but would it be possible to have a policy to protect the half-deckers and trawlers under 75 feet?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: Perhaps I could clarify the position.  Fishing gear used within the fishery limits is checked by naval personnel when the vessels are boarded.  The type of gear which may be legally used is specified in regulations.  New regulations are pending in relation to the common fisheries policy and furthermore, as the Deputy is aware, there are fines of up to £10,000 on conviction for the use of illegal gear.  With that goes the automatic forfeiture of the catch.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: The control of fishing by foreign trawlers other than those of members States of the EEC inside the exclusive fishery limits of the State is exercised by means of licences issued by the EEC. Under the recently agreed Common Fisheries Policy the vessels of member States may fish in the area outside 12 miles with limited access between six and 12 miles but each member State is subject to quota restrictions for certain species. Fishing operations within the exclusive fishery limits of the State are monitored by the Naval Service working in close co-operation with the Air Corps.  The surveillance service will be augmented by the addition of a helicopter-bearing vessel next year, and I am satisfied that the addition of this further facility will provide adequate resources for the fishery surveillance service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

In the case of third countries what is the <Col N="853" /> method of checking the quantity of fish taken out?  Is it at the port of landing in the third country?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: The question refers to the control of fishing.  There are ways and means of checking the amount of fish on board a vessel if it is boarded.  There are regulations in force under the common fisheries policy for dealing with checks at home ports to ascertain whether boats are staying within EEC regulations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he has <Col N="854" /> examined the present position in relation to the damage being caused to salmon stocks by commercial fishing of our rivers; if he has any plans to deal with the situation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: As commercial salmon fishing is in general prohibited in the freshwater portions of rivers, I assume that the question refers to commercial fishing for salmon in tidal waters of rivers and their estuaries.  While I am concerned about the overall level of commercial salmon fishing I am not convinced that such fishing in tidal and estuarine waters is in itself a serious threat to our salmon stocks.  I am, however, examining at present the various statutory salmon conservation measures in operation and will decide shortly whether changes are necessary so as to ensure the conservation and rational exploitation of our valuable salmon fishery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: The question relates to fishing in our rivers.  Would the Minister agree that a lot of damage is done to stocks by commercial fishing?  For example, in the Minister's own town, Ballina, there is the Moy fishing company.  We constantly hear of the damage done by drift net fishermen but such companies have a free hand and are not restricted in any way by regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is not true.  They are restricted by law to a maximum catch. Various laws and by-laws have been made by Ministers under the fishery Acts and these impose stringent measures to conserve salmon stocks.  If the Deputy wishes I will outline a long list of these restrictions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Minister accept that with the sophisticated gear used in hauling in salmon in rivers such as the Moy there is no escape for the fish? Will he look at the question of this kind of fishing in our rivers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is being looked into at present.  The current policy in the Department is to allow reasonable fishing <Col N="855" /> consistent with arrangements for adequate conservation measures.  If this two pronged approach is applied the fisheries will benefit.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

As Deputy Wilson said, unless we take measures quickly these fisheries will disappear.  I am making every effort to provide measures which will ensure the survival of our salmon fisheries, including looking at the question of water keepers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: One of the principal objectives of the new marketing regulation is the strengthening of producer organisations by providing for increased levels of compensation for withdrawn fish, by granting a premium for processing and storage of certain categories of fish which are withdrawn from the market, and by allowing a margin of tolerance extending 10 per cent below and 5 per cent above the withdrawal price to take account of seasonal fluctuations in market prices.

If 85 per cent of fish is sold on the market and 5 per cent is dumped, will the fisherman receive 85 per cent of the withdrawal price?  If 40 per cent of the withdrawal price goes to fishermen when 20 per cent is dumped, does the Minister feel that that is better protection and that the financial protection available to the fisherman is better than heretofore?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry the checks at present operated by him on fishing boats from other EEC member states in the six-12 mile zone around the coast and in areas where non-Irish boats are entitled to fish; if catch logs, showing methods, catches (species) etc. are recorded; if he will give specific details of catches since 1 January 1983; if he has satisfied himself with the checking arrangements; and if he has any plans to improve the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: The enforcement of fishery protection measures at sea is carried out by the Naval Service.  Vessels from other EEC states are subjected to regular checks and boardings which apply to all foreign vessels operating in our waters to ensure their compliance with fishery limits regulations as well as regulations governing technical measures for the conservation of fish stocks for example, minimum mesh sizes, minimum fish sizes and restrictions on the use of specific gear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Catches of fish are not recorded by reference to national fishery limits but by ICES &mdash; International Council for the Exploration of the Sea &mdash; zones which <Col N="860" /> are the internationally accepted statistical areas for compilation of catch data.</P>
    <P>The EEC regulation establishing control measures for fishing activities by vessels of the member states which came into operation on 1 January 1983 provides that (a) in respect of catches by EEC vessels member states must notify the Commission by the 15th of each month the quantities landed in their ports or transhipped during the previous month of those species which are subject to TAC &mdash; total allowable catch &mdash; and (b) skippers of vessels over 17 metres in length must keep a log book relating to catches.  When compiled by the Commission the recorded catches will be notified to member states and I am awaiting details of the catches for the month of January 1983.</P>
    <P>The format of the log-book has yet to be settled, but it is expected to be in use shortly.  Log-books of vessels fishing within our exclusive fishery limits will also be subject to inspection by the Naval Service.  The Commission will also be recruiting inspectors to supervise the monitoring of catches by member states. I am satisfied that these measures when fully operational will provide satisfactory checking arrangements.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome this very necessary Bill and would like to congratulate <Col N="903" /> the ICC on their golden jubilee and all they have achieved in the last 50 years. Their progress has been very satisfactory and our people can look on them with a certain amount of pride.  It was pleasing to see from their 1982 annual report that they financed over 2,000 projects and made available advances of over £140 million.  They managed to show a profit which, before taxation, was £4.7 million.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will be able to give me some information about one matter. There seems to be a considerable overlap between the working of the ICC, the rescue section of the IDA and Fóir Teoranta.  What is the exact relationship between these three bodies?  I realise that the ICC and Fóir Teoranta are different in many ways, but the rescue section of the IDA and Fóir Teoranta appear to be doing the same work.  If so, there is a considerable overlap.  Fóir Teoranta are a rescue agency; the IDA have a separate rescue section and the ICC advance funds to Irish firms.  I would like to have some information about the day-to-day workings of these companies.  The ICC are a commercial enterprise and I am happy about the way they work, especially as State finance is involved.  The ICC could be said to be the first cousin to Fóir Teoranta.</P>
      <P>The Fóir Teoranta annual report for 1981 showed that loan interest and other income for the year was £945,000 and there was an operating deficit of £319,000 as compared with a surplus of £35,000 the previous year.  This is what intrigues me: after provisions, an amount of £1.86 million was written off and the net deficiency for the year was £2.18 million.  That is a very considerable amount of money.  I realise that Fóir Teoranta are a rescue agency, the people of last resort and on occasion the only people those in difficulties can come to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently I was looking at a television programme, &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo;.  After watching it I had serious doubts about some of the workings of Fóir Teoranta. I am concerned because this body disburse taxpayers' money and there does not appear to be any way the taxpayer can find out how his money is being spent. <Col N="904" /> A person makes an application to this company which is processed and then the money is disbursed.  That programme showed instances of Fóir Teoranta paying money to companies which later went into liquidation or receivership and in some instances the money was directed to other companies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>: One is a wealthy relation and the other is not in the same league. As these agencies are so closely related I would like an explanation from the Minister.</P>
      <P>I am quite happy about the normal business relationship of the ICC, but where vast sums of money are involved &mdash; and very large sums of money are being lost by Fóir Teoranta &mdash; there should be some public accountability and criteria established so that if money is invested it will be thoroughly investigated to ensure that it is being used for a specific purpose, the purpose of restoring the company rather than having it directed into other areas.  I have reservations about it and I think the public interest would be better served in this instance by allowing Fóir Teoranta, as I understand was the case in the past, to publish the names of firms.  There has been a change and a change I do not like and I think it should be rectified.  That is something the public have been discussing.</P>

When I was Opposition spokesperson this was something <Col N="905" /> I called for and I was pleased to see it being adopted by the ICC.  Many of our firms need some kind of exchange risk guarantee.</P>
      <P>The ICC have a very broad range of financial investments.  I should say in passing that we should encourage people to invest in firms like the ICC and we should be magnanimous with people who are making an effort to save.  We should provide encouragement for people to save.  I am sad to have to say that we are not at present making sufficient efforts to encourage savings.</P>

      <P>: The ICC have had fantastic increases in their investments over the past number of years.  Their deposits more than doubled in one year to £202 million.  They are a State guaranteed company and it is highly desirable that Irish people should invest in firms like the ICC because the work they are doing is for the betterment of Irish industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to thank the two Deputies who have contributed to this debate.  I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy in what he said about the headline set by the ICC for other State bodies.  I want to acknowledge the contribution of the ICC to the economy over the past 50 years.  They have provided more than £600 million for the country's industrial and commercial base.  The ICC operated with particular emphasis on small businesses.  Last year 91 per cent of approvals were for firms employing up to 100 persons and the average loan was £92,000.  The ICC are also giving special attention to the provision of long-term loans, with a repayment period of five to 12 years, often at fixed rates of interest, and they are also active in supporting new business start-ups, particularly small businesses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fóir Teoranta have been mentioned by Deputy Enright.  They are an independent State body with their own board. They have up to this availed of the management <Col N="906" /> services of the ICC but they are now in the process of developing their own management structures.  They cooperate very closely with the IDA on rescue cases.  The ICC and Fóir Teoranta are different in that respect.  The ICC provide finance on commercial terms and also funds for business start-ups.  Fóir Teoranta take cases which are in difficulty. The decisions of the board of Fóir Teoranta must be based on the criteria laid down in the Fóir Teoranta Act, 1972. Companies being assisted must have reasonable prospects of returning to profitability. The IDA and Fóir Teoranta co-operate closely and have regular meetings.  Overlap is minimised.  Some IDA aids are available to companies in difficulty &mdash; for example, training grants. The television programme to which the Deputy referred is out of date.  Meetings have since taken place between the chairman and chief executives of both agencies. The role of the State in these services will be looked at in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Can the Minister tell us what co-ordination there is between the ICC, the IDA and Fóir Teoranta? Both Deputy Enright and I raised that question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy O'Kennedy also referred to the European Investment Bank.  On 31 October 1982 the ICC had received 1,400 loan applications involving £100 million and 1,300 cases have been approved by the European Investment Bank involving £96 million.  The projects supported will create or safeguard 23,000 jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy also raised the question of the effect of devaluation on various aspects of risk guarantees.  It is very difficult at this point to evaluate what the effect might be but the Exchequer was providing exchange risk guarantees of £229 million of ICC's foreign borrowings at the end of their last financial <Col N="907" /> year.  The bulk of the borrowings were in hard currencies such as Deutschemarks and Dutch guilders which can be borrowed at low interest rates.  It is crucial to the success of the exchange risk cover schemes, operated by the ICC for small and medium sized industrial and tourism enterprises, that the funds be borrowed in low interest rate hard currencies so that they can be on-lent to the enterprises at the lowest possible rates, as low as 9 or 10 per cent at present in some cases. These hard currencies are the currencies that have appreciated most against the Irish pound following the recent realignment. This underlines the large burden being borne by the Exchequer on exchange risk schemes, a burden that must be set against the undoubted benefits which industry and tourism secure from the operation of the schemes.  The Government are keeping under constant review the relative costs and benefits of these schemes.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of relationship between ICC and Fóir raised by Deputy O'Kennedy, it may be interesting to note that it is proposed in this Bill to appoint two Government directors.  This is the principal point on which the Deputy objects to the Bill but the move is designed to make for closer integration of ICC's activities with those of bodies such as the IDA and the Department of Industry and Energy.  Deputy O'Kennedy suggested that it was open to the Minister to appoint directors in the normal way if he so wished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is what the Minister said in his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: That is fair comment, but it is important that we do not remove any of the people who have given so much down through the years.  The ICC have done a very good job but it is reasonable to expect that there should be a direct input into the company from the State and that the Government directors would act as a co-ordinating force between the Government Departments and the ICC board.  All speakers have paid tribute to the board.  If the new <Col N="908" /> directors were to be appointed in substitution for any of the existing members, this might have created the impression that the board were not doing their job, but that is not the case.  It is our hope to have better co-ordination by way of direct intervention.  I am talking of co-ordination between the bodies mentioned, Fóir Teoranta, the IDA and the ICC.</P>
      <P>The existing board is not very large.  It consists of only seven people, one of whom is the managing director.  The outside directors have contributed a great deal.  It would be unfortunate in any attempt at co-ordination if we were in any way to lessen the impact of those industrial-minded people, people who are prepared to give of their time in the service of this wonderful company, a company that is an example to others. Nine members is not an excessive number to have on a board of a State company when one considers the extent of the work of the company in question.  It is important that there be direct State intervention.</P>
      <P>The Bill is necessary.  There is a case for having the various sections of Government represented.  Accordingly, I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>: Can the Minister give a breakdown in relation to the profile of borrowings, especially foreign borrowings, of the ICC?  First, can he say how much the current borrowing represents in Deutschemarks, and following from that what is the exchange risk cover cost anticipated this year?  We have the figure <Col N="909" /> for last year.  It is in the chairman's address.  I am sure the Minister for Finance has some idea as to what the cost, consequent on devaluation, is likely to be this year.  I hope that in calculating the figure the Minister will take into account the fact that the Deutschemark came into realignment at the bottom of the band so that obviously there is scope before it reaches the ceiling of the band for an appreciation of 4½ per cent.  The answer does not seem to be available readily, but I would have thought that the question would have been easily anticipated and that the Minister's advisors would have had the information on record.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree.  The Minister for Finance seemed to have no difficulty in telling us that the cost of the devaluation this year would be £17 million.  I have questioned that since, and that is why I cannot understand the Minister of State saying now that the estimated cost in respect of the ICC will be of the order of £20 million.  I should be appalled to think that it would be anything like that, but if it is it underlines further the case we have been making since the decision to devalue was made.  Will the Minister clarify that matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is estimated that the total foreign exchange losses since these loans were negotiated is roughly £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am not sure if we will be able to clarify this properly, but I must pursue the matter on the basis of what the Minister has said.  He has told the House that the figure is of the order of £30 million on the exchange losses and that really underlines the impact last week's decision will have on companies such as the ICC, and the Exchequer, in general this year.  We are likely to have an appreciation of the DM in the EMS and that will mean a major impact on the repayment obligations this year and in subsequent years.  Somewhere along the line the Minister for Finance, and his Minister of State, are not singing the same tune.  Nobody is going to be reassured by what we have heard today and, even if it conveys news, it will be considered to be of the utmost gravity.  We are concerned because of that but we have underlined that this recent decision which was apparently directed towards achieving a readjustment with sterling failed to take into account the consequences of the disparities with other currencies within the EMS, particularly the DM in which we have significant borrowings for this and other companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: The estimated <Col N="911" /> cost of realised exchange losses this year is £1.6 million.  The total foreign exchange losses since the loans were negotiated is roughly between £20 million and £30 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister for Finance did not have any problem in making a statement to the House and I would like if we could have the same accouning procedure from both.  Having regard to the spread of our foreign borrowings, particularly in DM I am anxious to know the estimated increase in our loan repayment obligations this year as a consequence of the recent realignment of our currency within the EMS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am informed that the estimated extra cost will be between £5 million and £8 million but I am anxious to point out that that will not arise until the loan is being repaid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: At last we are getting some information that the Minister for Finance could not give.  I appreciate that the Minister of State has put a range of £5 million to £8 million on it and told us that it will not arise until the loans are being repaid.  The Minister for Finance told us recently that the total figure was £17 million.  I do not think anybody could have accepted that figure.</P>
      <P>The chairman, in the course of his statement in the annual report of the company, stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Continued support from the State by way of exchange risk cover will of course by necessary to ensure future <Col N="912" /> availability to industry of these valuable facilities.  We are satisfied that the provision of exchange risk cover [as Minister for Finance I had the privilege of initiating that] in respect of loans under these facilities, which are interest bearing and repayable, is a very cost-effective method of supporting industrial development.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the consequences of the decision to realign within the EMS which does not affect sterling, although it appears to be the main preoccupation, is going to have damaging consequences for companies such as the ICC and others in respect of which exchange risk cover has been provided.  It will also have damaging effects for the customers of the ICC.  I am appalled, though not greatly surprised, to hear the extent of the cost.  I might add that by the end of 1983 the Minister will have to revise that figure up because trends so far indicate that the DM and the dollar &mdash; we borrowed in that currency also &mdash; are strengthening <i>vis-á-vis</i> EMS currencies.  We will find that the decision which seemed to be so neat and tidy to adjust our relationship with sterling will have severe consequences through out the economy.  We have just heard one of the most significant examples of the consequences of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I must take issue with <Col N="913" /> the vague reasons the Minister gave for the representation from the State, the civil service, on the board.  In reply to my query he mentioned co-ordination between the IDA, Foir Teoranta and the ICC, but he must know that if that is what he is concerned about there are easier and more effective ways of achieving it than to have representatives from the Department of Finance or some other Department on the board of the ICC. One easy way is to have dual representation on the boards of the IDA, the ICC, Foir Teoranta and others by people of proven ability.  That would ensure co-ordination.</P>
      <P>The final responsibility lies with the Government.  We set the general terms of reference for the operations of these bodies.  The concept has always been that within those terms of reference they should be autonomous and independent in the discharge of their functions.  This decision is in the wrong direction.</P>
      <P>In view of what the Minister has said, can we now anticipate that when legislation dealing with any other semi-State bodies comes before the House there will be similar proposals for extra representatives on the boards or is this meant to apply only to the ICC, if by chance this House foolishly agrees to section 5?</P>

      <P>: Government representation on boards is not confined to the ICC.  There are several cases of it. The purpose of increasing the size of the board is to enable the State, as the owner of the company, to be directly represented on the board.  Because of the small size of the board and the fact that one of the directors is the managing director, it is considered preferable to accommodate the direct State representation by an additional director rather than by reducing the number of external directors.  It is important that the external directors should be retained and it is also important that there should be direct State representation on the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: With your permission, a Cheann Comhairle, I propose to make a statement on the meeting of the European Council which I attended, with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Brussels on 21 and 22 March.  I have had the Presidency's Conclusions on the Proceedings of the meeting laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The principal Irish concerns in Brussels related to the currency re-alignments within the European Monetary System; ensuring that as far as possible the agricultural price fixing is not too closely caught up with the larger questions of the enlargement of the Community and the &ldquo;Mediterranean package&rdquo;; the advancement of our position on the Community proposals for new revenues now that the &ldquo;own resources&rdquo; system as at present constituted is nearing exhaustion; the co-ordination of the Community approach to the Williamsburg meeting in May of the Heads of State or of Government of the industrialised countries; the prevention of a deterioration in EEC/US relations particularly where agricultural trade is concerned; the advancement of the work begun at the Copenhagen Council on the internal market, as an aid to internal trade and greater Community cohesion generally; a number of items on the political co-operation area to which I shall refer later.</P>
      <P>In all this our overriding concern was the maintenance and development of measures to aid economic recovery and, therefore, employment, particularly among the young who have been so greviously affected by the current recession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Brussels meeting immediately followed the meeting of the Finance Ministers <Col N="918" /> of the Community which ended last Monday with agreement on the realignment of exchange rates in the European Monetary System.  As the Minister for Finance made a statement to the House last Tuesday on this subject, I do not propose to comment on the outcome in any detail.  I wish simply to express the satisfaction of the Government, first, that in the face of considerable difficulties the Ministers were able, once again, to reach an agreement that maintains the EMS as a zone of monetary stability in a world where there is a pressing need for greater stability in exchange relationships as an aid to increasing world trade and therefore economic growth.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I want to reiterate in the House that for Ireland and the Irish pound the outcome was precisely what was sought by the Government.  Our objective had been, as the Minister has indicated, to obtain a correction of the unwarranted and unsought appreciation of the exchange rate of the pound, particularly against sterling.  We sought to reestablish as far as possible the relationship with sterling in particular that had existed on average last year before the rise that took place and thus to remove a barrier to maintaining or increasing employment which would have existed if the exchange rate for the pound had been held at a level not justified by the economic facts.</P>
    <P>It may take some time for the degree of adjustment to emerge clearly, and naturally a lot will depend on the autonomous movements in sterling.  However, the initial evidence from the markets suggests that our objective has been broadly achieved.  I believe that the Minister for Finance deserves great credit for the competent manner in which he discharged his responsibility on the country's behalf.</P>
    <P>We also discussed the proposed enlargement of the Community, with conclusions which Deputies will be able to study in the texts laid before the House.  The Agriculture Council had not been able, as they had been asked to do at Copenhagen, to reach agreement on the necessary adaptation of the <i>acquis <Col N="919" /> communautaire</i> in regard to olive oil and Mediterranean fruits and vegetables.</P>
    <P>The European Council considered the issues, gave certain guidelines and asked the Agriculture Ministers to settle the issues as quickly as possible.  A speedy solution is in Irish interests in order to ensure that decisions on agricultural prices are not delayed through links with the outstanding questions on Mediterranean products.</P>
    <P>Apart from this aspect, Irish interests in these matters are general rather than specific.  We are committed to the accession of Spain and Portugal and are prepared to play our part in reaching agreement on the matters before the Agriculture Council.  We adhere, however, to our view that the interests of both the present member states and the applicants require that enlargement take place on the basis of necessary decisions in such areas as Community resources and improvements in decision-making procedures.</P>
    <P>I now come to the European Council's discussion of the future financing of the Community and of the associated problem of the balance of benefits among member states.  Deputies will be aware that the Commission published, not too long ago, a Green Paper on future financing. The House will also know that for some years past the British Government has put forward the view that the share of Community own resources collected in the UK greatly exceeds the budget receipts which accrue in the UK.  At Brussels, the British Prime Minister stressed the importance, from the standpoint of the British Government, of having arrangements agreed as early as possible on the way in which the budgetary imbalance on which they focus would be corrected for the future.  Together with a number of other Heads of State or Government, I considered that primary importance attached to ensuring that the Community's overall development was not prejudiced by the inadequacy of its financial resources.</P>
    <P>I said that it was increasingly clear that we are near the limit of existing own <Col N="920" /> resources.  The 1 per cent VAT ceiling could be reached in 1984: the Commission has very little confidence that it will not be breached at the latest in 1985.  This is quite apart from the anticipated increased demands arising from enlargement or any further adjustments in favour of the UK.  I urged that the Commission submit firm proposals on future financing as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The Commission's recent Green Paper on future financing placed emphasis on the continuing role of VAT as the centre of the Community's financing system.  I welcomed this and said that I trusted this emphasis would be reflected in a clear proposal by the Commisison for a raising of the 1 per cent VAT ceiling which is now very urgent.  I also asked that further and detailed consideration be given to the introduction of greater progressivity into the system, as well as a form of financial equalisation &mdash; both of them options aired in the Green Paper.  Deputies are probably aware that a further option canvassed in that paper was a tax to be paid by national Exchequers but based on agricultural indicators.  I made it clear when I met President Thorn in Dublin, and again at the meeting in Brussels, that this proposal is unacceptable to this Government.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear to the House that Ireland, together with Denmark and Greece, entered a reserve regarding the reference to budgetary imbalances in the Statement by the Presidency after the meeting.  This term reflects, in our view, an incorrect and narrow view of the balance of advantages and disadvantages among member states, many of which are not reflected at all in the Community budget.  In addition, this wording could suggest that the problem was simply one of adjustments within the existing budgetary framework rather than, as we contend, one of an imminent inadequacy of own resources.</P>
    <P>As I indicated earlier, the economic situation and action to improve it were high among my priorities going to the meeting.  This, of course, reflected the magnitude of the economic difficulties and challenges facing us in Ireland and <Col N="921" /> the reality that while we can do a great deal to help ourselves we are, as an extremely open economy, greatly affected by developments in the economies of the Community and indeed of the world at large.</P>
    <P>In the Community, growth in 1982 was only 0.2 per cent in volume terms, with the Federal Republic of Germany recording a decline of 1 per cent.  This experience was common to all the industrialised countries, their combined output falling last year for the first time since 1975.  Much of the deterioration was due to the combined impact of: a worsening in the recession in the US, where real GDP declined in 1982; and an actual contraction, in world trade, which in the three years up to 1979 had expanded at an average annual rate of 6.9 per cent.</P>
    <P>The number out of work in the Community continued to climb last year, to reach 9.6 per cent of the labour force on average, a level 75 per cent higher than in 1979.</P>
    <P>There are some positive aspects.  Inflation has eased in all member states, and most notably in the US and Japan, and for the Community as a whole progress in bringing the current account of the balance of payments back into equilibrium has been faster than expected.</P>
    <P>As assessed by the Commission, before the meeting the outlook for 1983, while subject to some major uncertainties, was somewhat better than the 1982 outturn in a number of respects, but unemployment seemed set for a further rise to a total of more than 12 million or over 10 per cent of the labour force.</P>
    <P>Recent indicators point to some incipient recovery in a number of member states and in the US where the economy has shown a more favourable trend since the beginning of this year.  There has been a downward movement in interest rates internationally and we have had the recent OPEC decision to reduce oil prices, confirming a trend that has been evident for some time.</P>
    <P>This does not, however, mean that an end to the recession is assured.  We have had a number of false dawns in recent <Col N="922" /> years.  The favourable developments still need to be confirmed as to their scale and duration.  There are problems and uncertainties in the international financial situation.</P>
    <P>Nevertheless, there is a chance of a positive turnaround.  My concern, leading up to the Brussels meeting, was that the Community should focus on the action required to realise this possibility of recovery and to make it durable and cumulative.  What I wanted &mdash; and what I urged upon my fellow Heads of State or Government &mdash; was that arrangements be made for careful preparation of a Community position for the Williamsburg meeting of seven major industrialised countries and other forthcoming meetings at international level.</P>
    <P>Different countries have now become so interdependent economically that no one country can promote or sustain economic growth on its own.  Even the European Community, with its large population and enormous resources is, in today's conditions, insufficiently powerful to achieve autonomous growth &mdash; assuming that all its member states could be got to act in concert.  That is why the Williamsburg Summit, involving also the United States, Canada and Japan as well as the four leading states of the Community is of such importance.  There could be co-ordination there on a world scale which would aid and secure the persistence of the incipient recovery. This, if it happened, could start to roll back the tide of unemployment which is becoming such a serious threat to western democracies as a whole.</P>
    <P>When I met Mr. Gaston Thorn, President of the Commission, here in Dublin towards the end of last month, I pressed that the Commission should give a bold lead along the lines I have mentioned. I am, therefore, happy to acknowledge that the paper which the Commission submitted to the European Council was one of the most forthright and positive documents on economic policy to emerge from the Commission for a long time.  It proposed priorities and guidelines relating to the security of the international financial system, the restoration of international <Col N="923" /> monetary stability, the handling of monetary policies, including interest rates, the management of public finances and lastly, the handling of developments in regard to the price of oil.</P>
    <P>My views on the need to prepare a Community position for Williamsburg &mdash; for which the Commission paper will now provide a first-class point of reference &mdash; were, if not universally, very widely shared.  This emerged in a full and lively discussion of this matter on Monday afternoon and is, I am glad to say, fully reflected in the very satisfactory section of this subject in the Presidency's conclusions.</P>
    <P>The section of the Presidency's conclusions is followed by a section on Community-US relations.  This relates to another concern of mine before and at the Brussels meeting &mdash; the threat posed to important Irish and Community interests by strains in Community-US relations in regard to trade in agricultural products.  In the Tokyo round of agreements within the GATT, the US accepted that the system of export refunds operated as part of the Common Agricultural Policy was compatible with GATT rules so long as the Community did not take an undue share of world markets.  There is, of course, in the US a strong and vocal farm lobby which has been pressing for a more aggressive US policy on trade in agricultural products.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the feelings aroused recently when the US concluded a contract for a subsidised sale of one million tonnes of wheat flour to Egypt, undercutting the Community in a market traditionally supplied from Europe, primarily from France.  This happened during a pause in discussions between the two sides which had been designed to resolve the problems and was in breach of an understanding for a &ldquo;truce&rdquo; reached in those talks.  The US also appeared to be preparing to enter into further subsidised deals and it was reported that negotiations were in train for the sale of some 20,000 tonnes of butter, again at very low prices, to Egypt, which could have major repercussions on international market prices and outlets to the detriment of <Col N="924" /> Irish and Community exports of dairy products.  This was naturally a matter of considerable concern to the Government, especially as it would follow the losses, running into tens of millions of pounds, that we already stand to suffer as a result of an agreement that provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for the subsidised sale by the US of skimmed milk powder to Mexico, where Ireland had built up a large market for this product, although in this case the US was also a traditional supplier.</P>
    <P>There have in recent weeks been intensive contacts at high level, including an exchange of correspondence between the Presidents of the Council and of the Commission and Secretary of State Schultz and a visit to Washington last week by Vice-President Haferkamp and Commissioner Dalsager, designed to prevent the outbreak of a trade war in the agricultural products area.  Irish concerns in the matter were expressed to Mr. Schultz by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at their meeting last week.  The situation remains delicately balanced, however, especially in the light of the intended visits by the United States Secretary for Agriculture, Mr. Block, over the next few days to Tunisia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. US export packages are reported to be ready for signature in all four countries and some might involve dairy sales.</P>
    <P>Thus we are faced with dangers of price undercutting in important markets which could have dramatic effects on Community finances.  I am, however, satisfied, as a result of the discussions in Brussels, that there is an appreciation of the seriousness of the situation and an intention on the Community's part to engage in constructive discussion which could lead to a <i>modus vivendi</i> if there is a reasonable response from the Americans.</P>
    <P>We must hope that there will be an appreciation at the highest level in Washington of the possibly far-reaching consequences of repeating in 1983 the disputes that strained US-European relations last year and that no action will be taken in coming days that would prejudice the further discussions envisaged.</P>
    <P>The European Council held in Copenhagen on 3-4 December 1982 drew up a programme of work to be undertaken in <Col N="925" /> the economic and social field and in regard to enlargement.  In Brussels we reviewed progress in these areas and further work to be undertaken on the basis of a report by the Commission.  The work under way in the economic and social field is broadly in what I might perhaps call the micro-economic category as distinct from macro-economic policy measures to stimulate economic recovery.  The programme includes action on opening up the Community's internal market, on the external trade policy of the Community, on research, energy policy, innovation and industrial policy, expansion of the Ortoli borrowing facility and supplementary measures to relieve unemployment, especially among young people.</P>
    <P>Reasonably satisfactory progress had been made since Copenhagen in a number of these areas as a result of efforts made by the Presidency, but work is still under way in most of the individual areas and as it is therefore somewhat premature to assess the outcome I do not propose to review this programme further today.  I must say, however, that it was disappointing that we were not in a position to tackle the unemployment problem, particularly among the young or to take special measures to deal with it in a more meaningful way.</P>
    <P>The Heads of State and Government issued an important statement in the situation in the Middle East.  In relation to the Arab-Israeli conflict, we identified the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon and a resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive settlement in the Middle East as the two most urgent objectives.  We expressed support for the efforts of the United States to achieve these aims and for the peacekeeping role of UNIFIL and the multinational force in Lebanon.  We reiterated the principles of our approach to peace negotiations, as established in the Venice declaration and other statements: a lasting peace can be built only on the right to a secure existence for all states in the region, including Israel, and justice for all the peoples, including the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination with all that this implies.  These rights must be mutually recognised by the parties themselves. <Col N="926" /> Negotiations will have to embrace all the parties concerned including the Palestinian people; and the PLO will have to be associated with them.</P>
    <P>We recognised that President Reagan's initiative of 1 September last indicated a way to peace, that the Arab summit meeting at Fez demonstrated a readiness for it and that the recent meeting of the Palestine National Council can and should contribute to the peace process. We welcomed the discussions between Jordan and the PLO and urged the Palestinian people and the PLO to seize the present opportunity by declaring themselves in favour of peace negotiations. Above all, we affirmed that the time has come for Israel to show its readiness for genuine negotiations on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, in the first place by halting the settlement process in the occupied territories.</P>
    <P>This statement was very much directed at the present position.  It reflected the assessment of the Ten that an opportunity for a peaceful settlement now exists but may not be there for much longer. We aimed to encourage all the parties to avail of this chance while it is there.</P>
    <P>We also expressed our growing concern at the continued conflict between Iran and Iraq and called for a ceasefire and the withdrawal of forces to internationally recognised frontiers.</P>
    <P>Finally, we received a report from Mr. Genscher on progress in finalising the proposed Solemn Declaration on European Union on which work has been proceeding for the last 18 months or so, following the initiative taken by Mr. Genscher and the Italian Foreign Minister, Mr. Colombo.  The text has evolved very considerably in the interval.  Most points of disagreement have now been resolved but a few remain and there is to be contact with the European Parliament on some of these and on the draft Declaration generally.  It is possible that final decisions on the matter will be taken before the end of the German Presidency.</P>
    <P>On the proposal of the British Prime Minister, there was a general informal agreement that the Community should <Col N="927" /> make a special effort to relieve the famine that is affecting or threatening great numbers of people in Ethiopia and Somalia.</P>
    <P>On the morning of 22 March, before the resumption of the European Council meeting, I had informal talks with Mrs. Thatcher.  These covered a number of matters of mutual concern and common interest.  In a brief press statement issued after the meeting, it was indicated that we expect to meet again at the next meeting of the European Council.  This is to take place in Stuttgart on 6/7 June next.</P>
    <P>This was a cordial and constructive meeting and I am satisfied that it represented a worth while start in the process of restoring relations between the two countries to the condition they were in when I was previously in office.  We are now moving in the right direction.</P>
    <P>I would sum up the Brussels Council as somewhat uneven in quality, much of its work being effectively in preparation for the June Stuttgart Council.  I want nevertheless to pay a tribute to the way in which our deliberations in Brussels were led and steered by Chancellor Kohl.  This gives me confidence as regards the follow-up areas, such as preparation of a Community position for Williamsburg and US/ Community trade relations, where the European Council discussions were useful and led to satisfactory conclusions.</P>
    <P>The House may be assured that for their part, the Government will ensure that Ireland makes its own constructive and distinctive contribution to this follow-up and that we will continue to promote and to safeguard Irish interests within the framework of a broad and forward-looking concept of Community development.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: The European Council this week appears to have been a singularly unproductive one.  The whole issue of youth unemployment, and what measures could be taken at a European level to tackle the problem, were deflected without any decisions being taken to the Social Affairs Committee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="928" /> In his statement the Taoiseach said, and I quote:</P>
    <P>I must say, however, that it was disappointing that we were not in a position to tackle the unemployment problem particularly among the young, or to take special measures to deal with it in a more meaningful way.</P>
    <P>In that sentence the Taoiseach writes off the whole European Council as being largely a waste of time.</P>
    <P>On the question of concerted action to stimulate economic recovery nothing was really decided, other than to press the United States to play a more active role at the economic summit in Williamsburg next May.</P>
    <P>There again, I find the Taoiseach's emphasis on the Williamsburg Conference very disappointing.  It seems to amount to the European Community throwing in the towel and hoping that someone else will achieve its economic salvation.  The Taoiseach also said:</P>
    <P>Different countries have now become so interdependent economically that no one country can promote or sustain economic growth, on its own.  Even the European Community, with its large population and enormous resources is, in today's conditions, insufficiently powerful to achieve autonomous growth &mdash; assuming that all its member states could be got to act in concert.</P>
    <P>Then he proceeds to hand over responsibility to the Williamsburg Summit at which we will not be represented.  If the Taoiseach made an attempt to get the larger countries to stimulate their economies, as he promised he would, he failed totally.</P>
    <P>Unemployment in the European Community is considerably higher than in the rest of the Western World.  This constitutes an indictment of the Community's lack of will to take action and the ineffectiveness of its decision-making procedures. The Taoiseach acknowledges in his statement that unemployment is going to continue rising in 1983 in the Community. It will rise to 12,000,000 or 10 <Col N="929" /> per cent of the total working population. Many of the larger countries of the Community want to circumscribe its role and to deprive it of the funds it requires to take effective action.</P>
    <P>The whole meeting was of course overshadowed by the weekend drama over the EMS realignment.  Before coming to Ireland's role in that realignment, I would like to say that the overall agreement, particularly between France and Germany, while satisfactory to the extent that it allowed the EMS to remain operational, really only papered over fairly fundamental disagreements over economic policy.  The French demanded and obtained a general realignment of all the member currencies, so that the brunt of the adjustment was borne by the countries revaluing, with French devaluation largely hidden amongst the movement of other currencies including our own.</P>
    <P>The devaluation of the Irish pound is unfortunately probably the most significant fiscal decision taken by this Government since coming into office.  It is quite clear to us that it was a forced devaluation. The policy of the Central Bank and the Department of Finance has been to resist devaluation.  It was our decision too.  Members of the Government have said that a devaluation was &ldquo;unnecessary&rdquo; and that it would set off &ldquo;a wave of devaluation&rdquo;.  It is entirely unconvincing to claim that this was planned two months ago, or that we had been actively seeking a devaluation.  The fact is that the Minister for Finance went along to the meeting in Brussels without an adequate response to demands from the French and maybe others for a devaluation of our currency.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to see how the Government could have actively desired a devaluation, for it directly contradicts the whole basis of their budgetary strategy, which is to reduce the aggregate level of borrowing.  The devaluation will add in our estimation, and it is based on tables provided by the Central Bank, up to £400 million to our cumulative foreign debt, and this will wipe out the reductions in borrowing that the Government had hoped to effect by its budget.  The figure of £250 million quoted by the Minister <Col N="930" /> for Finance appears to relate only to EMS currencies and to ignore the devaluation that has also taken place against the dollar, the yen, sterling and the Swiss franc. In terms of reducing the overall burden of foreign debt, the devaluation has effectively cancelled out the work of the budget.  It is possible to speculate that if the indirect taxes in the budget had not been imposed, giving us the possibility of a rate of inflation of at or under 10 per cent, a devaluation might have been unnecessary and in that case not only would our foreign debt have been lighter, but there would have been more money to spend in the economy.  We devalued by 3½ per cent, about the same amount as the budget put up our cost of living.</P>
    <P>The Government have indulged in an extraordinary series of pretences, first of all that this devaluation, not only against the EMS central rate but against all other currencies, was not really properly speaking a devaluation at all, that a measure which will clearly add to the inflation is not really inflationary, that exports will be immediately cheaper and more competitive, but that our imports will be no dearer at least for some months.  Let us recognise this for what it is &mdash; special pleading to cover the Government's embarrassment and humiliation at being the first ever Irish Government to devalue our currency.</P>
    <P>Key elements of the Government's alleged economic strategy have been defeated by this move.  The cumulative foreign debt will increase at an alarming rate in spite of and perhaps because of the budget this year.  The Taoiseach repeatedly claimed last year that he could reduce the rate of inflation faster than Fianna Fáil.  Let me quote from the Fine Gael election document <i>Priorities</i> November 1982: &ldquo;Fine Gael aims to secure a more rapid fall in inflation than that projected by Fianna Fáil&rdquo;.  In <i>The Way Forward</i> we envisaged that the rate of inflation would be of the order of 10-13 per cent.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance now agree that the rate of inflation will be at least 12 per cent.  So let them honestly and straightforwardly admit that they have failed, that they pretended to the electorate that they <Col N="931" /> could achieve something more than Fianna Fáil, which they could not achieve.</P>
    <P>Let me further say that I do not believe the Taoiseach's figure for inflation of 12 per cent.  Having devalued by 5½ per cent against the US dollar, and the Minister for Industry and Energy Deputy Bruton has confirmed this, we are going to derive very little benefit from the fall in world oil prices, so that one of the factors that would have helped to bring down inflation will not in fact operate.</P>
    <P>The principal defence put forward for the devaluation of the Irish pound in the EMS is that it will restore some of our competitiveness with Britain.  This claim is frankly spurious and is in the process of being disproved in the markets.  Both the Central Bank and other banks are already expressing concern that the devaluation has not had the desired effect.  The Taoiseach claimed when he was going out to Europe that it would go a long way to restoring the position <i>vis-á vis</i> sterling that obtained in 1981 and 1982.  He obviously had no clear picture of what the situation then was, or else was badly briefed.  The average rate against sterling was 80p in 1981 and 81¼p in 1982; 89p goes nowhere near this.</P>
    <P>Our lunch time rate for dealing today was 89.6p.  In fact this Government will be left with the worst of all possible worlds.  They will have to carry the detrimental effects of devaluation against the European currencies, particularly the Deutschemark, and at the same time will not gain anything in regard to our comparative rate with sterling.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Taoiseach is aware that the chief executive of CTT, for instance, is reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 13 January as being opposed to devaluation. He says that the massive devaluation of the IR£ against sterling after Irish entry to the EMS had produced exactly the opposite effect to what the opponents of devaluation were now claiming.  He said that Britain had been a much slower growing market for Irish exports than the EEC and conversely British exports to Ireland had increased at a faster rate than <Col N="932" /> those from the EEC.  I am afraid that the excuses for devaluation simply do not hold up to critical examination.</P>
    <P>Most disturbing of all is that Mr. Joe Durkin of the ESRI argued in December that devatuation did not make sense when the country's balance of payments was improving, and that it would make speculation against the Irish economy profitable every time a rumour was put about that a realignment was likely.  What would worry me is that our currency has now entered the endangered species list. It has joined the vulnerable currency league as a result of the action of this Government.</P>
    <P>The whole episode is not likely to improve our standard in Europe.  I am afraid that devaluation has been a fiasco. It was pathetically mismanaged.  The Taoiseach's performance on the radio last Sunday, when he disclosed the Government's hand in advance in that interview only to be interrupted by the interviewer and told that the meeting in Brussels had terminated without a decision, will go down in history as the greatest gaffe of all time.  Even the farmers, the only group likely to benefit &mdash; if they do benefit directly &mdash; will lose a great deal of that benefit through increased inflation.</P>
    <P>Let me now turn to the Taoiseach's meeting with the British Prime Minister. Neither I nor the country at large are very impressed by either the fact that a meeting has taken place or the fact that its content is to remain a closely guarded secret.  I must say I could not help but be amused by the Taoiseach's insistence on confidentiality and discretion.  If I recall correctly, one of his most insistent criticisms of the talks I had with the British Prime Minister was the secrecy and confidentiality surrounding them.  It now appears that he has done a complete U-turn on this as on so many other subjects. The probability is that despite all his protestations and the Dimbleby lecture the Taoiseach would have very little to tell, that is if he was going to tell anything. The short communique emphasises that it was an introductory meeting, and the British Prime Minister clearly ruled out any summit despite the agreement to <Col N="933" /> hold such summits twice a year announced by both himself and the British Prime Minister after their meeting in November 1981.  The British Prime Minister also emphasised that no new initiative of any kind was discussed.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Taoiseach availed of the opportunity to express resentment &mdash; which I would feel &mdash; that the British Government are cynically taking the attitude that nothing is to be done about the North of Ireland, that all the violence and bloodshed will continue there until the next British general election takes place.  Does that not prove that Northern Ireland today is what it started out to be, simply a plaything of the British political process?  I am afraid I must remind the House about what the present Taoiseach told the electorate in his notorious speech on Northern Ireland during the November election.  He said on 18 November at a Dublin South-East constituency meeting, &ldquo;A complete and radical rethinking of British policy is now needed, and needed quickly, if the situation is to be retrieved from the drift towards chaos.  It must be the purpose and prime purpose of the Government elected to office on 14 December next to secure from the British Government a recognition of the need for such a radical revision of its policy while there is yet time to save the situation&rdquo;.  How does the Taoiseach square that with his little, short, confidential communique after his meeting with the British Prime Minister?  There is nothing in that communique about calling for a complete and radical rethink of British policies now and quickly.</P>
    <P>It is quite obvious that the Taoiseach did not make any such demands of the British Prime Minister.  On the contrary according to <i>The Guardian</i> of yesterday, 23 March, he explained to the British Prime Minister &ldquo;the reason for the more nationalist pronouncements recently of the Irish Foreign Minister, Mr. Peter Barry.  These essentially focus on the Irish Government's almost desperate concern to prop up the political fortunes of the mainly Catholic SDLP&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>: I would like to say more about the summit but in deference to the protocol of the House I will end my remarks at this stage to allow in Deputy Mac Giolla.  I will conclude by saying that, having read this communique by the Taoiseach on the outcome of the summit, I wonder if these European Council meetings are worth while any more.  I raised that question in my mind because of some of them that I attended.  When they were started up by President Giscard d'Estaing of France the idea was that European heads of government would meet in an informal atmosphere and talk about matters of fundamental importance confidentially.  The European Council as it has developed is rather a waste of time and really nothing is achieved there.  The purpose of bringing the heads of government together for an informal confidential discussion on important matters could be achieved much more simply than by going to all this elaborate pretence of a European <Col N="935" /> Council attended by the heads of government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: I agree entirely with the latter remarks of Deputy Haughey. The statement that has been given to us is probably one of the most useless and meaningless statements that ever came to the House.  It is full of the usual waffle and gobbledegook that you get from hand-outs from the EEC and various European sources that come in our post regularly.  It says nothing whatever.  It is obvious that they talked a great deal and decided nothing and the Council meeting had no meaning.  Indeed, the Taoiseach's statement says that what they were talking about was the next meeting in Stuttgart in June.  I suppose there they will talk about when the other one will be, and of course about Williamsburg which is the big league stuff where you will have the US and Japan.  That was really something to talk about.  The major decision that affects all of us had already been taken.  The Taoiseach in his statement merely said that that had already been decided by the Ministers for Finance. Obviously the heads of state did not even discuss what was happening in the EMS, in the whole international monetary system and in each individual country as a result of the big shake-up that has taken place and whether we should look again at the whole question of the EMS.  They merely said that the Ministers for Finance had made that decision and we will just move on now to something else.  Yet there is a major upheaval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no indication that they asked Britain to have a further discussion as to whether she would come into the EMS. One would expect that the Taoiseach would at least have raised this matter at the heads of state meeting when we had been forced to devalue our currency.  He said, of course, that the outcome was precisely what was sought by the Government. The Government only weeks before precisely did not want any such thing.  They did not want to obtain a correction of the unwarranted and unsought appreciation of the exchange rate of the IR£ particularly against sterling. <Col N="936" /> As Deputy Haughey has pointed out a few days later, it has not had any such effect.  One would expect that heads of state when they meet would discuss how things are going generally in an overall fashion and the whole strategy of whether the EMS is working, how it effects different countries etc. and that the discussion would have some relevance to the individual countries.  Nothing in this statement has any relevance to anybody. In fact, most Deputies in this House could not understand most of it, and quite a lot of it I could not understand myself. Certainly the vast majority of people outside would not know from the Taoiseach's statement what we are talking about.  There was only one short reference to unemployment in the statement. There is no indication that the Taoiseach raised the question of flour imports a s a result of which Ranks had to close down, nor did he raise the question of the car assembly industry which will be shutting down next year.  It does not appear that he raised any of the issues which affect jobs here.</P>
    <P>The EEC has been of great relevance to the farming community.  They know all about it because it affects their daily lives, and they have a great interest in it, but it does not have any relevance to the workers.  They see it as pushing them down, preventing them from doing something to protect their jobs.  they see it as something to oppose.  The question of the EEC should be debated here because it has not been debated since we joined.  As far as the farmers are concerned the good days are over, as the Minister made clear. The Americans do not want it any longer. They can do what they like, which the statement also made clear, because even when there was a truce they exported flour to Egypt, and now they are going to take a great deal of butter too.  There will not be very much gain for the Irish farmers so far as the EEC is concerned and since nobody else gained from our entry into the EEC&mdash;certainly not the workers &mdash; it is time this House had a full discussion on the EEC and its effects on our economy.</P>
    <P>The only part of the Taoiseach's statement which was very clear was his reference <Col N="937" /> to international affairs.  That was grand, because heads of state could talk about something outside the EEC, such as the Middle East.  The statement on the Middle East is outstanding and for that I commend the heads of state but there is no indication that they raised the major international question in Europe at the moment, the question about which Europeans are marching in their thousands, the question which is splitting countries down the middle and dividing parties, that is, the question of the United States military policy in Europe and their intention to locate Cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe to protect America.  A nuclear war could occur and America would survive.  That issue does not seem to have been discussed.</P>
    <P>The meeting with Mrs. Thatcher was obviously a brief hello, a handshake and a smile.  They did not hit each other and that is all that happened.  If that is so, why bother to mention it?  If something did happen why not let us know?  We should know what was said because it could be of value, but from what the Taoiseach told us today, nothing happened.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Haughey said these Council meetings of heads of state obviously have no purpose except to show cordiality, that we get on well together, that we are lucky we have Ministers for Finance to look after the EMS, Ministers for Agriculture looking after farming and so on, and the heads of state can have tea &mdash; or something stronger &mdash; and a chat and look forward to meetings in different cities.  That is what the Taoiseach's statement was all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>: Our concern refers to section 13 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, and the courts interpretation.  The Bill clearly <Col N="938" /> says that there must be a just and proper rent.  There is a feeling abroad among tenants who have been subjected to this court procedure that this is not being carried out in accordance with the Act.</P>
      <P>What is taken into account is the valuer's recommendation of what would be a market rent &mdash; and this is usually detrimental to the tenants &mdash; and as a result the court awards astronomical rents to landlords.  I want to ask the Minister if it would be possible for him at this stage to examine this section and issue a directive to the courts &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the assessment of the rent the court is totally dependent on the value put on the house by the valuers. In some cases the tenants employ valuers but in most cases it is the landlords who employ the valuers.  In the court they hear the rent suggested by the valuers and then split the difference.  That is a very haphazard way of assessing a rent, which in most cases is to the detriment of the tenants.  I ask the Minister if it would be possible to re-examine this section as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>: In speaking to this debate on behalf of my fellow Cork Deputies &mdash; Deputy Lyons, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and Deputy Wyse who, unfortunately, because of time will not be able to make their own contributions&mdash;I urge the Minister to bring before the House as a matter of urgency legislation to set up rent tribunals to deal with the unsatisfactory situation that prevails in Cork and throughout the country.  If the tribunals are not set up soon there will be no cases left for them to deal with because they are going through the courts very fast. We were told it would take years before these cases would be heard in court but they are going through very quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People, especially old people, are being brought into court, some of them are helped into court, to have their rents assessed by the judge.  For many of them <Col N="939" /> this is a traumatic experience.  It is the first time they have ever been in a courthouse. The Minister will agree that it is a sad state of affairs when such people have to go to court to have their rents assessed.</P>
    <P>When the rent restrictions legislation was introduced we welcomed it because previously there was no protection for the tenants.  The previous Government brought in the legislation with the best of intentions, but it has not worked out that way.  Valuers for the landlords and the tenants go into court but their figures do not agree and the judge fixes a figure in between.  This has not worked to the advantage of the tenant; it appears to favour the landlord.</P>
    <P>I would also ask the Minister when he is setting up his tribunals to appoint people who would be familiar with the set-up, such as architects and engineers. They could go out and look at the houses and be fair to all sides concerned.  There are cases of people who were paying £1 and £2 a week and suddenly it has gone up to £25 or £30.  This is causing great hardship to old people and people with young families.  I would appeal to the Minister to deal with this as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Another point is that the tribunal should not be located in a courthouse.  If possible it should be in local authority buildings or community buildings.  Would the Minister give consideration to the subsidy?  With the social welfare cuts there is great hardship being experienced.</P>

      <P>: I have been asked to represent my Fine Gael colleagues &mdash; Deputy Liam Burke, Deputy Coveney and Deputy Peter Barry.  Like my colleagues in the Labour Party and in Fianna Fáil I am appalled at what is happening in Cork city and I agree that if moves are not made quickly to bring in the rent tribunals as promised every case that is due for consideration in Cork will have been heard.  Elderly people are being brought into court.  They are being terrorised and intimidated by the legal system and I would ask the Minister, when <Col N="940" /> setting up the tribunal to locate it out of the court system and have it under the control of either the local authority officers or perhaps social welfare.</P>
      <P>The alarming thing is the application of the law as it stands.  Deputy O'Sullivan has mentioned section 13 which is not being applied as the Act sets out at all.  It is a question of the landlord's valuer and the tenant's valuer putting values on the property and the judge splitting the difference. The valuers are familiar with what is happening so the landlord's valuer is inflating the value and we are getting very unjust decisions.</P>

      <P>: I welcome the initiative taken by the Deputies from Cork who have represented all the representatives of the Cork region.  I am aware of the problems.  They are not particular to Cork but they are acute in the Cork area because of some of the points made by Deputy Wallace.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the rents tribunal I want to repeat the commitment made by the <Col N="941" /> Taoiseach here on the Order of Business some weeks ago to the effect that legislation to establish these tribunals will be introduced between April 20 and when we rise for the summer recess.  The outline of that legislation has already been signalled by me in a public statement and we are now in the process of having it finalised.  I recognise fully, as everybody else in this Chamber recognises, that it was the clear intention of the legislators in the making of the legislation the second time around that section 13 of the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982 should be interpreted in such a manner as to ensure that market rent described in the way that Deputy O'Sullivan described it is not applied. I am aware of the delicate and independent relationship between the Oireachtas and the courts, but I am also aware that perhaps section 13 is not being interpreted in the way that the legislators wanted it to be interpreted.  If that is the case we should look at that and see if clarity can be obtained on both sides.  I will take very seriously the request by Deputy Allen to see in what manner, and without in any way interfering with the due process of the courts, the interpretation of section 13 can be properly applied.  That interpretation, mind you, extends as much to the solicitors acting on behalf of the defendent tenants as it does to anybody else within the process.</P>
    <P>The desire to decriminalise the process of the fixing of rents is one to which we are very committed.  For that reason, I accept the request of Deputy Wallace to locate the rents tribunals in a non-legal environment.  I want to emphasise what I mean by the word &ldquo;decriminalise&rdquo;.  I am aware in my own constituency of an 87 year old woman who had to get in to the witness box and be cross examined under oath about the house in which she had lived practically all her life.  For a person like that to find herself in court at all is a presumption of some kind of guilt. Therefore, it is better to establish rent tribunals in an informal and non-threatening manner so that the kind of terrorism to which Deputy Allen refers does not exist.</P>
    <P>I should like to tell Deputy Wallace <Col N="942" /> that there is a commitment to review the relationship of social welfare payments to the rent subsidies.  This commitment I repeat again.  Increases in social welfare payments will not prevent people, in cases where they would otherwise have qualified for rent subsidies, from qualifying for those subsidies after the increases in social welfare payments take effect.</P>
    <P>I want to put on record, as the Minister of State responsible for introducing this legislation, that I am aware of the concern that has been expressed.  I would hope that the courts in the general manner would take note of what we have said today, and of what has been said during the passage of the Bill last July so that the proper relationship between what the legislators want, on the one hand, and what the courts have to administer on the other is clearly seen and that our intentions are clearly seen.  I will take the representations that have been made and bring them to the notice of the Minister for Justice to enable him to handle it in the manner that is appropriate for his jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>I will make my own personal commitment to introduce the legislation here as quickly as possible and to establish the tribunals as quickly as possible throughout the country.  It is envisaged that each local housing authority will have a rents officer who, in the first instance, will be the person who will fix the rent and in the event of either party not being satisfied with the proposed rent they will then have the right to appeal to the rents tribunal and the rents tribunal will be a panel modelled on the Employment Appeals Tribunal under the aegis of the Department of Labour and will be mobile and capable of locating itself in different venues throughout the country so as to bring justice and equity on the question of rents to the people rather than as at present bringing people into the District Court when in many cases the courts are not the correct venue for this.</P>
    <P>During the passing of the legislation the Minister of the day, Deputy Burke, accepted the argument in principle for rents tribunals, but due to pressure of time was unable to introduce it at that <Col N="943" /> stage.  This is a matter where there is all-party agreement.  That gives me confidence to believe we can get the legislation enacted before the end of the summer session.</P>

      <P>: The total amount of tax outstanding in respect of all years up to and including 1980-81 as shown in the Appropriation Accounts, 1981, published in July 1982, was £1,218.5 million.  The amount outstanding for those years at the end of 1982 was £961.7 million, a reduction of £256.8 million. (Of this reduction, over 90 per cent was discharged as not being properly due and some 10 per cent was brought into the Exchequer.)  The break-down of the £961.7 million under the various headings is as follows:</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="873" /> The figures relating to tax outstanding for all years up to and including 1981-82 will be included in the Appropriation Accounts, 1982, which will be published later this year.</P>
    <P>In considering the figures of outstanding tax, regard should be had to the fact that the assessment of liability to tax and the collecting of the amounts due fall broadly into (i) a system of direct assessment, such as income tax and corporation tax, and (ii) a system of periodic self-assessment and payment, as in the case of PAYE and value-added tax.</P>
    <P>In the case of direct assessments, because of delay in obtaining accounts and returns, and frequently because of difficulties in making up the accounts of traders and companies, many assessments are estimated.  The sums, so estimated, then come into the processes of appeal and negotiation and there is often a long lapse of time before the final liability can be ascertained and settled.  In the system of self-assessment, there are also provisions for estimating liability when traders or employers fail to make the prescribed returns and payments.</P>
    <P>With regard to the second part of the question, the Deputy will, of course, appreciate that the tax paid in any year comes partly from liabilities first incurred in that year and partly from arrears, which either become established through the processes of estimation and appeal or which are collected through legal proceedings. The tax yield for 1983 is expected to be £4,730 million, which will include some part of the amounts which I have mentioned, but, at this stage, it would not be possible to identify among the figures, which cover all amounts apparently outstanding at 31 December last, those which will be paid in 1983.</P>
    <P>The amounts now shown as outstanding will to a substantial degree be discharged as being in excess of the true liability in the ordinary course of the administration of the taxes.</P>

It is the practice for the banks to pay cash against these orders even in the case of staff members who have not got bank accounts.

When my Department was asked by a nearby branch to circulate leaflets aimed at informing those staff members who have not got bank accounts of the advantages of opening an account <Col N="880" /> it agreed to co-operate in view of the high degree of co-operation forthcoming from the branch in making payments of wages and salaries.

It is essential to provide such a service in a general hospital, which has available in it a comprehensive range of back up consultant services including X-ray and pathology.  The Deputy will be aware that such service is available in Tralee General Hospital which is only about 20 miles from Killarney.  Furthermore the new General Hospital, which will be equipped to the highest standards, will be available in January 1984 and to duplicate all or any of the facilities being provided there at this time would be an unwarranted use of resource.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 232 and 233 together.</P>
      <P>The control of the price of drugs is the statutory responsibility of the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism. However, the agreement recently concluded between my Department and the drugs industry concerning the cost of drugs supplied to the health services will also affect private retail sales of drugs. The agreement provides that the trade price of drugs sold on the Irish market will not, on average, exceed 7½ per cent of UK trade prices.  This will result in a significant reduction in the price of drugs supplied to retail pharmacies.  The benefits of this reduction will be felt by all patients, including those whose expenditure is recouped through the drugs refund scheme.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The period of time which must elapse between the date of desertion and the acceptance of a claim for a deserted wife's allowance is three months.</P>
      <P>The time taken to process an allowance claim to the payment stage varies considerably depending on the circumstances of each individual case.  The wife must first be interviewed and is required to show that she has made reasonable efforts to locate her husband and prevail on him to support her.  This can take some time.  In addition, where the husband's whereabouts are known it is then necessary for an officer to call on him in order to obtain his version of the events leading up to desertion and this can prolong the matter further.</P>
      <P>It is very difficult therefore to put an average on the length of time it takes to decide a claim but a random sampling of decisions given over the past few weeks shows that the period can be upwards of two months.</P>
      <P>Most claimants, however, receive supplementary welfare allowance through the local community welfare officer of the health board from the time they are deserted and this is continued whilst they are awaiting a decision on their claim to a deserted wife's payment.</P>

      <P>: As a departure from the situation that existed since 1977, I have decided to restore freedom to local authorities to determine their rate poundages for 1983.  A total of £163.5 million, which includes an additional £25.5 million made available in the budget, is being provided by the Exchequer for the grant in relief of rates on domestic and certain other properties.  The question of how this provision compares with the rate reliefs local authorities themselves will give on domestic property will depend on the level of rate increases local authorities decide to adopt for 1983, taking account of income from other sources such as charges for services.</P>
      <P>I am confident that my approach to this matter will enhance the discretion of local authorities in regard to their finances and will therefore considerably strengthen local democracy.</P>

      <P>: The reason for the delay in deciding on the claim of the person concerned to deserted wife's allowance/benefit is that it proved difficult to trace and then arrange an interview with her husband.  At present a copy of a separation agreement is awaited from her solicitor in relation to the requirement in the regulations that she has made and continues to make reasonable efforts within the means available to her to prevail on her husband to contribute to the support and maintenance of herself and any dependent child.  It is expected that the receipt of this document will enable the claim to be decided without further delay.</P>
      <P>In the meantime it is understood that the person concerned is in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned has been paid disability benefit from 9 March 1982.  According to the records of my Department, as she had less than 156 contributions paid at the appropriate rate since her entry into insurance her title to benefit was limited to 52 weeks.  This period was completed on 7 March 1983.</P>
      <P>With a view to determining if she was entitled to further payment of benefit an inspector of my Department called on her employer.  As a result of that visit the question of the rate of employment contribution properly payable in respect of her employment has been raised.  It appears that instead of contributions at the full rate giving title to all benefits, only reduced rate contributions giving cover for occupational injuries benefit should have been paid.  Inquiries in this regard are continuing and her entitlement to any further benefit will be determined in the light of these inquiries.  She will be advised of the position as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>: One of the persons concerned is in receipt of old age contributory pension at the rate appropriate to his yearly average of 47 contributions over the period from 5 January 1953 to 31 December 1976.  He would require a yearly average of 48 contributions over this period to qualify for an old age contributory pension at the full rate.  His current weekly rate of £69.75 includes an increase of £30.05 in respect of his wife.  This is the full amount payable in respect of an adult dependant aged 66 years or over.</P>

He subsequently furnished the required information and after a further investigation of his case he was assessed with means of £5.25 derived from self employment as a plumber.  He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £58.50 being the maximum rate payable to him £63.75 less £5.25 means.
