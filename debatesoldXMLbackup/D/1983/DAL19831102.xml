    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give details of new Government policy decisions which were announced by him during his address to the Fine Gael Ard Fheis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have arranged for copies of my Ard Fheis speech to be placed in the Library of the House and, if the Deputy is concerned with any specific aspect of Government policy mentioned in my speech, either I, or the responsible Minister, will be glad to deal with any parliamentary questions he might put down in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Was the Taoiseach correctly reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 24 October as saying:</P>
      <P>To make quite clear our firm commitment in this area, I want to announce that the youth development officer scheme, .... will be continued and placed on a permanent basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that on the Thursday before he made that statement &mdash; if that statement is correct &mdash; Deputy De Rossa raised that issue on the Adjournment? <Col N="1122" /> Is the Taoiseach aware that in the course of his reply, the Minister of State at the Department of Labour said, as reported at column 456 of the Official Report of 20 October 1983:</P>
    <P>I have made it quite clear that the only decision taken was to continue the employment of any officer whose employment would otherwise terminate until the end of this year, ....</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is not in relation to the youth development officers scheme.  It is in relation to a reply to an Adjournment Debate and an announcement by the Taoiseach at the Ard Fheis, not announced to this House. I am asking if false information was given by Deputy G. Birmingham, junior Minister for Labour, or was the decision already taken and withheld until&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the matter came before the Government on Friday, a decision was taken on it and an announcement made on Friday.  I was merely reminding the Ard Fheis what had already been decided and the wording, therefore, was fractionally different from but substantially similar to what the Deputy said.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey's <Col N="1123" /> recollection of the Cabinet meeting might be a little vague but my recollection of it is quite clear.  We took a decision at our meeting on Friday, an announcement was made on Friday and I took the opportunity on Saturday night of reminding people of it.  For some reason it had not received publicity in the newspapers on Saturday.  It had not been published in Saturday's papers as I had wanted it to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the point I wanted to make, that the Taoiseach upbraided the newspapers for not reporting it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will give an indication as to the likelihood of the State acquiring Carton House and estate in Maynooth, County Kildare; and if he will make a statement on the possibility of such an acquisition in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated in response to a question from the Deputy on this subject, on 26 April 1983, the preservation of Carton House and demesne is of great artistic and cultural importance.  I have been in contact with representatives of the owners about proposals for the future of Carton.  I understand that Kildare County Council are considering the draft development plan which will be so important for the future of Carton.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister of State indicate the response from the owners? Could he say as well if he has examined the possible uses to which Carton House and Estate could be put; also whether he has examined their employment potential should an acquisition take place?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The overriding position as <Col N="1124" /> far as Carton House and Demesne are concerned is that they are in private ownership.  That is the reality of the situation at present.  I did meet representatives of the owners and I requested that the future of Carton House and Demesne be secured and continued for many years. Generally the response of the owners was very interesting &mdash; if I may put it that way.  They also seemed to have very much the same ideas, as outlined to me at any rate.  There are various prospects for the possible use of Carton if it ever came into public ownership.  All of these must be fully explored and the employment content would be very significant in many of these.  But the overriding situation is that they are now in private ownership.  I can assure the Deputy that all possible ways will be explored to ensure its continuance and preservation.  Then, in any such review, the state of public finances would have to be borne very much in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is satisfied with the performance of the Youth Employment Agency since its inauguration; and if he will state (1) the total number of personnel employed by the agency and in which capacities; (2) the total number of key personnel recruited to the agency from outside the civil service; and (3) the total cost of the agency to the Exchequer to date and over a twelve month period.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of staff employed by the Youth Employment Agency; and the method of recruitment of the staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The progress made since the establishment of the Youth Employment Agency can be seen from the significant increase which has taken place in the number of places available to young unemployed people on youth employment and training schemes.  In 1981 some 22,500 young people participated in the youth employment <Col N="1125" /> and training schemes then in operation against 32,500 in 1982 and an estimated 45,000 in 1983, which is double the number participating in 1981.  The scale of the expansion is such that the number of places available on programme is of the same order as the number leaving school in any one year.</P>
    <P>In addition to expanding existing programmes, the agency have developed a number of new schemes in the employment field aimed at the development of enterprise and a commitment to self-help among young people and community groups.  These schemes are the community and youth enterprise programme and the youth self-employment programme. Major programmes in which the agency is involved include the ACOT certificate in farming programme and the placement of specialist personnel under the NBST &ldquo;Young Scientists and Technologists Scheme&rdquo; and the Irish Goods Council &ldquo;Marketplace Programme&rdquo;.  The agency are continuing to examine job creation proposals from individuals and groups on a case basis and grant assistance has been provided in a number of cases.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt but that the input of the agency, as the body with overall national responsibility for furthering the employment, work experience and training of young persons, will be a key factor in tackling the problem of youth unemployment.</P>
    <P>As regards the staffing of the agency the following is the information sought: (i)  Twenty-eight persons are currently employed by the agency in the following categories: (a) Chief Executive, 1; (b) Secretary, 1; (c) Directors looking after projects, finance, research and planning, 3; (d) Programme Managers, 3; (e) Project Officers, 6; (f) Research Assistants, 3; (g) Consultants, 2; (h) Administrative/Clerical and Support Persons, 9.  Of the 28 employees, 13 are permanent, 3 are on short-term contracts and 12 are on secondment from other organisations.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Twelve of the 13 permanent employees of the agency were recruited from outside the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>With regard to the method of recruitment of the agency staff, the chief executive was appointed by me in my capacity <Col N="1126" /> as Minister for Labour.  Of the remaining 27 persons, 6 were recruited following the advertising of posts in the national Press; 11 were recruited through the National Manpower Service, and 10 are on secondment to the Youth Employment Agency from a number of different organisations including State and semi-State organisations.  Two of the six who were recruited following the advertising of posts in the national Press, are also on secondment.</P>
    <P>The total cost of the agency to the Exchequer to date is £646,301.  The cost over a twelve month period (September, 1982 to August, 1983) was £480,700.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>How many personnel originally recruited are at present serving in the Minister's office or in the office of the Minister of State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell the House if the Youth Employment Agency have been successfully creating jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Youth Employment Agency were established in March 1982 under the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981.  The principle objectives are laid down in section 4 of that Act.  They are mainly to encourage employment schemes for people over the age of 15 years and under the age of 25 years.  The Youth Employment Agency created 500 jobs.  The other agencies have <Col N="1127" /> been expanded to create employment and work experience to the extent that 45,000 people are receiving training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>If 500 jobs have been created can the Minister say why placement officers in the Manpower service have been instructed not to leave their offices in search of employment for young people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that instruction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister explain the difference between the Community and Youth Enterprise Programme and the programme as operated by AnCO and why both organisations are needed?  With regard to the ten people who are on secondment to the Youth Employment Agency from a number of different organisations, can the Minister say why they are seconded in a time of high unemployment?  Is he satisfied with the progress of the agency and the increase in training places?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not desirable to ask a number of questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community Youth Enterprise Programme and the link programmes have a similarity and it is the job of the Youth Employment Agency to see that there is co-operation to ensure that their projects do not overlap or conflict with one another.  The Deputy mentioned that the Youth Employment Agency had created 500 jobs.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that when the Youth Employment Agency were created there was a staff of six. When I came back into office the same six people were still working in the agency and no effort had been made to give them the numbers of people necessary to run it properly.  There is now a larger number of people employed, in the region of 28, and the agency are able to work much more speedily.  The Deputy must be aware that the progress of the <Col N="1128" /> agency had been hampered by the lack of staff and the work which they were given to do could have been accelerated if they had had the proper staff when it was set up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Why was there need for secondment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is to ensure that people with knowledge and experience of the type of work being done by the agency were supplied to them.  As soon as it can be established that there are people from other sources who are able to do this work efficiently, we will recruit them.  We could not take away from the agency that flexibility which they need for the type of work they are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree in the interests of accuracy that, in fact&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;nobody had taken up employment with the Youth Employment Agency &mdash; nobody?  One had been appointed the previous day but took up duty some months later.  Nobody had taken up duty.  Could I ask him of the original six seconded from the Department of Labour how many are still working with the agency?  A final question: if, as he says, the agency have a co-ordinating role in order to avoid overlapping of functions, what was the need for such a role and, if the agency has this role, why did the Government recently see fit to appoint outside consultants to examine the whole area of co-operation between the various agencies?  Surely that is a Government overlapping of function?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Two from the Department. <Col N="1129" /> From my knowledge of the people I would say yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. J. Fahey Mr. J. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House that the agency has his confidence as Minister in view of the fact that, as Deputy Fitzgerald says, he found it necessary to appoint a firm of consultants?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JackieFahey" hpid="Mr. J. Fahey Mr. J. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say why he found it necessary to appoint a firm of consultants and why he found it necessary to give the agency the staff they require?  Could he comment on the assumption that the whole area of youth employment is now generally in a mess because of the fact that the Government have no policy in relation to this crucial issue and we have various people such as AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and the Minister for Education trying to spend the money that is there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I could ask the Deputy what firm of consultants he is talking about.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no consultants appointed to oversee the agency.  I am quite satisfied with the progress that is taking place in the agency.  As I described in the beginning, the figures bear out that the work the agency have been set up to do is being carried out as fast as possible.  It is a little disappointing that the staff they needed were not given when they needed them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the Manpower Service is a most important and integral part of the Department of Labour and is certainly not being phased out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole question of the youth development officers was, as Deputy Mac Giolla reminded us, the subject of an Adjournment Debate in the House recently.  At that time I stated accurately &mdash; and I resent any suggestion to the contrary from Deputy Mac Giolla &mdash; that only two decisions had been made by the Government in respect of the development officer scheme: first, to increase the level of support for it officially from the £5,000, at which it stood for four years, to a sum of £7,000; and secondly, to continue the <i>status quo</i> until the end of this year, thus continuing in employment 11 officers who otherwise would have lost their jobs had the original scheme been adhered to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From the time I took office I was approached by a number of youth organisations and asked what our intentions were and at all stages it was made clear to them that no final decision could be taken until the Government came to consider the Estimates for next year.  The House is aware that the Government are engaged in that process and I am happy to say that, arising from that process, this <Col N="1136" /> scheme, which up to now has been of a temporary and <i>ad hoc</i> nature, will in future be permanent.</P>

      <P>This scheme was a temporary one.  The concern among youth organisations was that what had previously been temporary should be put on a permanent footing and I am glad that the Government took a decision to that effect.

      <P>The Government took such a decision in relation to the development officer scheme since taking office, firstly, to increase the level of support from £5,000 to £7,000.  The existing level of support had remained unchanged for four years and this was proving a millstone around the necks of many of those voluntary organisations who employed those officers.  Secondly, as I <Col N="1137" /> said earlier, we took a decision to keep in employment those whose employment would otherwise be terminated.  Lastly, I am glad to say that we were in the position to respond and to make what had up to now been a temporary scheme permanent.</P>

      <P>Following enlistment recruits undergo a period of 12 weeks intensive training in the course of which their progress and reactions under pressure are constantly monitored.  Recruits who display undesirable characteristics are discharged in accordance with Defence Force Regulations.  After recruit training, personnel are subjected to regular assessment by superior officers.</P>
      <P>There is a psychologist in the Permanent Defence Force whose duties include advising the military authorities on selection and assessment of personnel.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied with the procedures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> Is this not an appropriate time to extend recruiting, or to resume recruiting, in view of the big number of people, male and female, who are very anxious to join the Defence Forces?  As an example, in the original recruitment to the ranks for the Women's Corps there were over 3,000 applications and all were interviewed.  In view of the present situation, it is a most appropriate time to recruit further people and give them an opportunity to be trained as apprentices or otherwise within the Defence Forces.  Very many of them probably would like a military career.  It is the ideal moment to get really good class people into the Defence Forces, as are already there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As Minister for Defence I sympathise with what the Deputy suggests, but as one of a Government with collective responsibility for the economic situation I would have to be careful about going down the road that was travelled some distance previously of ending the unemployment situation by increasing the number in the public service. Obviously there are constraints, financial constraints, on rapidly or widely expanding recruiting.  I sympathise with the point of view raised by the Deputy, in particular with regard to the expansion of the apprenticeship training scheme which I am having examined at the moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give any indication at the moment at to when recruiting will commence.  As the Deputy knows, in this current year recruiting did not commence until August-September when we recruited to fill wastage which had occurred during the year, I am not in a position to say what exactly will take place in the current year.</P>

      <P>What is the Government's reason for keeping the Army 4,000 under strength?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will recall from his time as Minister for Defence, the establishment figure is the lawful numbers that can be recruited up to.  To my knowledge that establishment is never actually maintained.  It is the legal limit to which one can go.  Over the years the strength has been below the establishment &mdash; for instance, in 1972 the strength was 14,200 and since then it was 10,600.  In 1981 there was a reduction to 14,184.  Therefore the actual strength at the moment is in line with the actual strength for the last decade or so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept, in view of the United Nations service in the Lebanon and other parts of the Middle East, that continuously approximately 800 members of the Defence Forces are away on UN service and that for that reason the strength of the Army here is well below the figure which the Minister now quotes?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The actual numbers were increased following that commitment.  In fact, in 1980 the actual strength decreased, but nevertheless the actual strength bears to the establishment the same ratio as it has always borne and this <Col N="1143" /> is adequate to enable us to fulfil our United Nations obligations.</P>

If we are really intent on putting out the hand of friendship and reconciliation to those in the middle, was any thought given to inviting a representation of the German people?  If we are so ecumenical in our approach to praying for the dead of World Wars I and II, surely this should have been considered?  Why does it happen to be just something between ourselves and Great Britain when we are commemorating, basically, the dead of World Wars I and II?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see nothing wrong in other nationalities being represented, but that is a matter for those who organise the services.  The Deputy may have forgotten that there has been representation over the years at the services which were specifically stated to be in commemoration for the dead of the two World Wars. This year it is not merely for those but for all who died for peace.  At the earlier commemorations there was a military presence, with the consent and approval of the various Ministers for Defence, including Deputies Barrett and Molloy. In 1980, Deputy Barrett was represented by his Minister of State, Deputy Moore, <Col N="1146" /> who officially participated on his behalf in the service of commemoration.</P>

If a ceremony is to be held to commemorate all those who died in the cause of peace, would the Minister not consider it much more appropriate to have a ceremony organised by the Irish Defence Forces with representations from other nations who wish to participate rather than having the Irish Army formally participating in a parade?  The Minister knows the military distinction which is very clearly made.  Nobody understands it better than the British authorities who have succeeded in inveigling this Government into participating in a formal military parade organised by units or ex-units of the British army.  It was very insensitive of the Minister to acquiesce so easily without giving proper and due consideration to what he was walking people into. I would ask him even at this late stage to indicate that in future a more appropriate ceremony will be organised by his own Department in which British, Russians, Germans and anyone else can participate.</P>

      <P>The committee to which I referred examined this matter as far back as 1937.  That committee was composed of Members of the House and non-Members.  The recommendations were based on a number of criteria including an examination as to whether or not those who continued to be Members of the House and ex-office holders should qualify for a pension.  It was considered important that those who had experience of office but were not then office holders should continue to serve as Members of the House whether in Opposition, and probably on the Opposition Front Bench, or members of the party in Government but not office holders.  It was considered that their experience in the framing of legislation would be an advantage in the course of the enactment of legislation.  In addition all elected Members of this House receive the same rate of remuneration.  Nowadays politics is more of a full-time career than perhaps it was when this committee reported in 1937.  There is no element of incremental payment in the salaries of Deputies such as there is in most other career structures. The payment of an allowance to former Ministers might be regarded as a form of incremental payment to Members of the House who are ex-office holders.</P>

I should mention that when the Devlin Review Body were conducting an investigation into the appropriate salary levels applicable to the Members of the House and office holders, they stated in their 1979 report that they had set the levels applicable on the basis of the conditions of office and they had made a reduction in the amount of salaries payable to office holders generally because they qualified for this payment after a period in office.  Consequently, it should be taken into account that the levels payable to office holders take account, on the basis of the review body's report, of the benefits of the allowances paid after a number of years.</P>

    <Col N="1249" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I move &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is the outcome of a comprehensive review of our criminal law and procedure.  Its purpose is to give certain new powers to the Garda Síochána to enable them to investigate crime more effectively and to amend and update certain aspects of criminal law and procedure for the better administration of justice.</P>
      <P>I think it can fairly be said that a review of this kind was timely and necessary.  It has not been hastily carried out.  As is well known, it has, in fact, been going on for quite some time.  I am naturally pleased, however, that the Government, pursuant to the commitment in the Programme for Government, have been able to bring the review to a conclusion and to have the Bill drafted and presented to this House.</P>
      <P>Before I proceed to deal with the detailed contents of the Bill, I think it would be appropriate for me to say something about the general background to the measure and about the particular circumstances that have led to its being brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crime and its consequences, in one form or another, cast a shadow over much of our social life today and force us to reassess many of our traditional values and attitudes.  If we are among the more fortunate members of society, crime may not have had too intrusive an effect on our lives to date &mdash; it may not have cost us much more than inconvenience or annoyance.  There are many, however, who have not been so fortunate and who have had to pay a far higher price.  Without wishing in any sense to introduce an emotive note into the debate, I think it is appropriate that I should make the point that violent crime, in particular, far too often has consequences that are nothing less than tragic.  Indeed on an occasion like this it is only right that I should express sympathy with those people who have over the years &mdash; and especially in recent times &mdash; suffered as victims of <Col N="1250" /> crime.  We should, I think, remember especially the members of the Garda Síochána who have lost their lives or been injured at the hands of criminals.</P>
    <P>The problem of crime has been and continues to be studied world-wide. Questions about the causes of crime remain unresolved and there are even difficulties in defining what one means by &ldquo;cause&rdquo;.  For instance, in what sense can poverty be said to be a cause of crime when in fact the great majority of poor people are never in trouble with the law? Yet it is clear that poverty, unemployment and poor social conditions generally are factors that play an important part. A formidable challenge faces our society to work for solutions to these and other social problems so that people cannot say &mdash; at least with any sense of justification &mdash; that those who commit crime are forced to do so because of poverty and social conditions generally.</P>
    <P>The Government have a major role to play in solving the economic and social problems of our society &mdash; in creating wealth, in minimising unemployment and in achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth.  Pending the achievement of these aims, however, we have to live together as members of society and the only tolerable way in which we can do that, and continue to work to find solutions to the problems that face us, lies in ensuring that we succeed in maintaining a well-ordered society in which there is an acceptance of the rule of law.  Increasing crime, more particularly serious crime but basically all criminal activity, disrupts the social order creating unrest, frustration and disharmony and it deflects our energy and our resources from matters that should be the principal focus of our attention.</P>
    <P>Crime is, therefore, a serious social evil and it must be dealt with.  Any suggestion that we should in any sense surrender to it, or postpone action to combat it, until such time as we have solved our economic and social problems would not, I am sure, be accepted by the great majority of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>I have referred before &mdash; though not in this House &mdash; to the enormous economic burden that we have to bear directly as a <Col N="1251" /> result of crime.  The figure of £250 million that I quoted on a previous occasion as being spent on crime-related services in the Votes under the control of my Department for this year is, if anything, on the conservative side.  It does not include the cost of services being provided by, for example, the Department of Health on the drugs problem or the Department of Defence on security and assistance to the civil power arising out of the activities of subversive criminals.</P>
    <P>There are other non-quantifiable but substantial costs such as loss of revenue from tourism.  If, through the measures contained in this Bill and other measures, we can reduce the cost of crime, or even help to halt the increasing cost of it, we will be making an important contribution to our economic wellbeing as a nation and helping, in a very real sense, to provide more money for the creation of jobs.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that I do not for a moment suggest that social conditions and factors such as drug addiction do not have a major bearing on the growth of crime.  But here today our task is to concentrate on just one facet of society's response to crime, namely, deterrence and detection.  I believe that perhaps the single most important deterrent to criminal activity is the creation of conditions in which criminals will feel that there is a strong likelihood that they will be apprehended and punished for their crimes.  Penalties by themselves, even stiff penalties, are not, I believe, likely to provide any significant deterrent unless there is a real prospect that that punishment will be imposed.  Detection is vital.  That is where the Garda come in. Naturally I am not implying that the Garda have no role in crime prevention as distinct from detection, but that too is not at issue just now.  Detection, if it is to mean anything useful, must mean more than that the Garda should discover who committed the crime.  Our legal procedures must be such as to ensure that as far as possible those who are guilty are convicted.  I say &ldquo;as far as possible&rdquo; because the objective of ensuring that the guilty are convicted should not be <Col N="1252" /> achieved at the cost of putting the innocent at risk.</P>
    <P>This Bill will, I believe, make an important contribution towards providing a more effective deterrent in the sense I have mentioned.  It addresses itself to the principal areas that are causing concern in our existing law relating to the investigation of crime and the trial and conviction of offenders.  But it does so in such a way that is, I am convinced, balanced and fair and poses no threat to our fundamental rights and liberties.  That is an aspect that I will be referring to again in the course of my review of the contents of the Bill.  First, I propose to deal with what is one of its major aims &mdash; to give the Garda increased powers to investigate serious crime.</P>
    <P>For very many years&mdash;I think in fact until quite recent times &mdash; the Garda did not experience any real difficulties in securing the co-operation of people reasonably suspected of having committed serious offences to go to Garda stations. It was not that the Garda had any legal power to detain suspected persons while they investigated the offence, by questioning or otherwise &mdash; in fact, they had not and that was decided in a case in 1930 &mdash; but, by and large, they operated on the basis that, when suspected persons were in the station they were there &ldquo;helping the police with their inquiries&rdquo;.  Precisely what the legal position was about &ldquo;invitations&rdquo; to come to the station was clouded and might have differed from case to case depending on the circumstances. The suspect himself might in many cases have believed that he was there on a voluntary basis and that would not have been put to the test at all unless and until he attempted to leave.</P>
    <P>And from the Garda viewpoint the practice seems to have been so widespread and to have continued over such a long period of time that many gardaí may well have believed that they had a legal power to detain persons.  It was not until about 1977 that the principle that had been decided in the 1930 case I have already mentioned again came to the fore.  However, real damage began to be caused to criminal investigation when the courts, in a number of subsequent decisions, <Col N="1253" /> rejected as inadmissible evidence such as confessions or incriminating statements obtained during periods when it was adjudged that the accused person had been unlawfully detained.  These decisions were based on a principle laid down in a 1965 decision which was to the effect that evidence obtained in breach of an accused person's constitutional rights was inadmissible except, to use the Supreme Court's own words, in &ldquo;extraordinary excusing circumstances&rdquo;.  When I speak of damage being caused I am not to be taken as reflecting in any way on the courts, which were upholding the constitutional rights of accused persons not to be deprived of their liberty except where allowed by law.</P>
    <P>The problem was, if anything, exacerbated, however, by subsequent decisions to the effect that where a person went to a Garda station voluntarily and the stage was reached where he came under suspicion for the offence, then he had to be told by the Garda that he was free to leave the station unless and until he was arrested.  The House will appreciate the position of the Garda when it is considered that this new requirement could, in a particular case, involve interrupting a suspect who was freely making a statement containing an admission of guilt. From a Garda viewpoint it virtually destroyed the practical value of being able to invite persons to the station.</P>
    <P>That is a brief history of the background to section 3 of the Bill which illustrates the problem that the Garda face today.  While in most cases of serious crime they have power to arrest without warrant a person whom they suspect, with reasonable cause, of having committed the offence, the rule is that once he has been arrested he must be charged with an offence and brought before a court.  He cannot be held in the station while the matter is being investigated though, of course, there is nothing in law which prevents the gardaí from questioning him between arrest and charge.  The only exception to this rule is in the case of arrests late at night where there is a sitting of the court the next morning.  In those cases, the courts have held that it is permissible to hold a person until the <Col N="1254" /> sitting of the court.  If the gardaí contravene the law in this matter the effect is that the detention of the suspect becomes unlawful and any evidence obtained during or as a result of the illegality becomes inadmissible, as I have already said.</P>
    <P>The inadequacies of the law in this whole area have had a serious effect on criminal investigation.  Prosecutions have failed because evidence was not admissible. This has occured not just in relatively minor cases but even in cases involving murder in which there was evidence of the guilt of the accused resulting from confessions or other incriminating statements which nobody had ever suggested were other than completely voluntary.</P>
    <P>We have to ask ourselves one simple question as a result of all this.  Is it right that the police force of this country should be restricted in this way?  Put another way, is it right that we, as a community, should force ourselves to take on the criminals with &ldquo;one hand tied behind our backs&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>We might also ask whether, as a community, we are acting reasonably and giving adequate support to the Garda, in the very difficult circumstances that face them if we give the criminals such an advantage.  We must, in this context, be mindful that the problem cannot be portrayed as simply a question of the Garda versus the criminals with the rest of society in the role of disinterested observers. It is we &mdash; the law-abiding citizens of the community &mdash; who are under attack and it is on our behalf that the Garda act.</P>
    <P>It is my view that we must give the Garda the powers it is reasonable for them to have in a democratic society &mdash; no more and no less.  Otherwise, we fail in our duty as legislators.  And when you look closely at the position, as I have outlined it, and compare the powers that our police have with those available to police forces in most other democratic countries, I think that only one conclusion is possible.</P>
    <P>The Constitution provides that no person can be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law.  What section 3 of the Bill proposes is that the <Col N="1255" /> law should allow persons suspected, on reasonable cause, of serious crimes to be detained but only where certain conditions are satisfied and then only for a limited period.</P>
    <P>The Bill, therefore, gives no sweeping powers of detention to the police and, in relation to the powers it does give, there are reasonable safeguards built in to minimise the possibility of abuse.  As I have said, the arresting garda must suspect, with reasonable cause, that the person concerned has committed a serious offence. But that is not all.  Before detention can take place the member in charge of the station must have reasonable grounds for believing that the person's detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.  That is the double check.</P>
    <P>The period of detention is limited to six hours and, even within that time, the person must be charged, if there is enough evidence, or released unless the detention conditions are applicable in relation to another offence.  But the upper limit of six hours applies no matter how many offences are being investigated concurrently and let me say that, if there is any doubt about that being 100 per cent watertight, I will amend the Bill on Committee Stage.  An extension for a further six hours at most can be authorised only by a chief superintendent or, in his absence, by the superintendent acting for him.</P>
    <P>Because we have decided to limit the period of detention to six hours &mdash; or at most 12 if an extension is granted &mdash; special problems arise in relation to detention between the hours of midnight and 8 a.m.  Under existing instructions, issued following the O Briain Report, which recommended additional safeguards, the Garda are obliged not to question a suspect in detention during these hours except in special circumstances. The general desirability of maintaining that position is obvious and has been accepted by successive Governments. But, in the context of a detention period as short as 6 or 12 hours, the position of the Garda would be impossible if they were to be prohibited from questioning a suspect in detention during this period <Col N="1256" /> notwithstanding that the time was running against them.  Some solution had to be found that would preserve, as far as possible, the existing position but would recognise the reality that in special circumstances questioning of suspects would have to be allowed.  These special circumstances would include cases where a suspect was arrested in the &lsquo;small hours&rsquo; at the scene of a crime or where a suspect genuinely wished to volunteer a statement during this period.  The solution we adopted is to be found in subsection (6) of section 3 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>What is proposed is that the member in charge of the station will give the detained person a written notice when he wishes to suspend questioning in order to afford the person reasonable time to rest. When giving the notice the Garda must at the same time explain its meaning and ask the person to sign it as an acknowledgment that he has received it.  Certain other procedural safeguards are required relating principally to the recording in station records of particulars of the giving of the notice, the time it was given and so on.  If it became necessary subsequently to resume questioning the person during the period between midnight and 8 a.m., the Garda could do so but only on serving a further notice on the person suspending the first notice, after which time would begin to count again as part of the permitted period of detention.</P>
    <P>It is provided that only one notice suspending questioning may be served on a person during this particular period so that there is no possibility of the Garda adopting &lsquo;stop-go&rsquo; tactics or playing &lsquo;cat and mouse&rsquo; with a detained person.</P>
    <P>Subsection (7) of section 3 proposes to deal with one other exception where, after an arrest, time will not count towards reckoning the permitted period of detention.  Any time needed to obtain proper medical attention for a detained person &mdash; whether this arises before he is taken to the station in the first instance or whether it comes to notice while he is in the station &mdash; will not count.  Difficulties have been experienced in a number of cases where suspects had gunshot wounds at the time of arrest and had to be hospitalised.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1257" /> Section 4 is a very important section because it sets out in clear terms the rights that a detained person has in relation to having notification of his whereabouts sent to third parties.  It deals also with his right of access to a solicitor.  As far as access to a solicitor is concerned, the Bill is not conferring any new right on the suspect.  The courts have already confirmed the existence of a right of &ldquo;reasonable access&rdquo; to a solicitor and the section recognises that.  It does, however, provide the additional safeguard that the member of the Garda in charge of the station must ensure that the detained person is informed without delay of this right and, if requested to do so, must notify the solicitor as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>Indeed I envisage that the document now handed to an arrested person on his arrival at a Garda station will be revised to include a reference to his rights under this Bill and that, moreover, the contents of the document will be explained by the member in charge where this is necessary.</P>
    <P>We are also recognising the right of the detained person to have one other person informed of his whereabouts and the same rule will apply in relation to notifying that person as applies in relation to notifying the solicitor.  We have used, in relation to that other person, the term &ldquo;reasonably named&rdquo;, so as to avoid imposing an obligation where the person names someone for purely frivolous reasons.</P>
    <P>Special provision is being made for persons under 17 years of age, as will be apparent from subsection (2) of section 4.  It is not that we anticipate very many persons of tender years being detained in Garda stations but the reality is that persons of 16 or 17 are frequently involved in crime, particularly car stealing and burglary.  It is also true that a lot of the vandalism in residential areas is the work of young people.</P>
    <P>Section 5 sets out the powers it is proposed that the Garda will have in relation to detained persons.  They will be able to do most of the things that a police force needs to be able to do in order to investigate serious crime properly, such as to search, photograph and fingerprint suspects <Col N="1258" /> and make forensic tests for firearms and so on.  However, we think it right that photographing and fingerprinting should not be done except on the authority of a superintendent and also that strip-searching should be prohibited except in two cases &mdash; where there is reasonable cause for suspicion that drugs or explosives may be concealed on the suspect's person &mdash; and then only on the authority of a superintendent.  There is, in fact, no prohibition on strip-searching in existing law.</P>
    <P>Not long after the Bill was published some criticism was expressed in one of the national newspapers of the proposal to allow the Garda to fingerprint detained persons.  While I can readily appreciate the sensitivity some law-abiding people can feel about allowing matters of personal identification to become the subject of police records, we must recognise that if the Garda are to have any reasonable prospect of success in dealing with serious crime they must have these powers.  We should remember too that fingerprints, as well as helping to convict the guilty, can clear the innocent.  I am satisfied that we are doing all that it is possible to do by way of safeguards in providing &mdash; in quite explicit terms &mdash; that the Garda must destroy these records and every copy that exists if the person is not prosecuted or is acquitted.  And, of course, the person concerned, his solicitor or other representative will have the right to witness the destruction.  That is, I believe, as far as we could reasonably be expected to go, but if anyone has any further suggestions as to how we might improve the safeguards, I am willing to listen to them.  In the circumstances it is quite unacceptable to suggest, as the newspaper did, that there will be no guarantee the Garda will not retain a set of fingerprints or a photograph on a &ldquo;black file&rdquo;.  It is easy to be critical where the absence of a power to fingerprint is not seen to have defeated the ends of justice in a particular case.  However, if a case arose tomorrow in which a person who was believed to be a murderer was walking the streets a free man, and if it could be shown that this was essentially due to the fact that there was no lawful way of <Col N="1259" /> detaining him so that his fingerprints could be taken and compared with those found on the murder weapon.  I have no doubt there would be a public outcry, and I venture to suggest, the newspaper would be among the first to criticise the Government for allowing such a situation to continue.</P>
    <P>The only exception to the rule about destruction of photographs and fingerprints following an acquittal is that contained in subsection (5) of section 6.  This provides that the Director of Public Prosecutions can apply to the District Court for an order for preservation of the records where they may be required for further criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the question of Garda powers, let me mention one or two other important provisions.  Section 8 prohibits the re-arrest of a person for the same offence except in two cases: the first is where it is proposed to charge the person immediately with the offence.  In that case, of course, there would be no period of detention permitted.  The second is where new information comes to hand about the involvement of the person in the offence.  In this case, however, a Garda superintendent must satisfy a district justice on oath and obtain a warrant for the arrest.</P>
    <P>Detention is then permissible under the provisions of the Bill.  Of course, if the Garda get information connecting a released person with an offence entirely different from that for which he was originally arrested, they will be free to make an arrest for that offence assuming that they have reasonable cause for suspecting that he has committed it.</P>
    <P>Let me mention also at this juncture the provisions in section 25 dealing with proceedings after arrest.  This section is to a large extent a re-enactment, with some desirable clarification, of an existing statutory provision &mdash; section 15 of the Criminal Justice Act, 1951.  In case there should be any misunderstanding about what is involved here, I would like to point out that section 25 applies only to persons arrested on a warrant or arrested without warrant and then <Col N="1260" /> charged with an offence.  It provides that in either case such a person must be brought before a district justice or, if a district justice is not immediately available, before a peace commissioner as soon as practicable.</P>
    <P>We are also taking the opportunity of putting in statutory form what is the present law about bringing before a court persons arrested without warrant and charged late at night.  The present rule is that persons arrested and charged late at night do not have to be brought before a court until the following morning, provided of course a court is due to sit that morning.  We are simply maintaining this as part of the law and applying it to arrests on a warrant.  We are not, I should stress, giving the Garda an additional detention period by a backdoor method, as one commentator has suggested.  Since the persons concerned will have been charged with an offence, the criminal investigation, so far as concerns questioning them, will be finished as once they are charged they cannot be questioned further.</P>
    <P>The final matter I should mention on this part of the Bill is that section 7 provides for the application of certain provisions of the Bill to persons detained in custody under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act.  These are the provision relating to not counting any period during which medical treatment is necessary, the provision relating to access to a solicitor and notification to relatives of a suspect's detention, the requirement that the authority of a superintendent is necessary for the taking of photographs and fingerprints and the prohibition on stripsearching except in the circumstances I have already mentioned.</P>
    <P>A period of detention after arrest is a necessary part of any police force's armoury in modern conditions.  That is now recognised in most countries in the world.  For example, the position in England in this regard was stated in 1981 by the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure in paragraph 3.66 of its report to be as follows:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;..... The period of detention (upon arrest) may be used to dispel or conimis <Col N="1261" /> firm ..... reasonable suspicion by questioning the suspect or seeking further material evidence with his assistance. This has not always been the law or practice but now seems to be well established as one of the primary purposes of detention upon arrest.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That extract from the commission's report was quoted with approval by the English Court of Appeal in a judgment given in July last.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain recognised the importance of such detention and in his report recommended a period of six hours detention with provision for extension. We are giving effect to that recommendation.  It would be a mistake to think that this in any sense amounts to sanctioning a method of police investigation which is solely concerned with obtaining confessions or incriminating statements.  It simply recognises the commonsense view that an essential part of any criminal investigation is talking to the principal suspect with a view to establishing what, if anything, he knows.</P>
    <P>Mr. Justice Ó Briain said the following in his report:</P>
    <P>It is both logic and common sense that a person investigating a matter should question those concerned in the subject under investigation, check their answers and if there are apparent discrepancies, come back to the person questioned for an explanation.  The police work on suspicion and hearsay and on many other factors which are not legal evidence.  The Courts, on the other hand, proceed entirely upon legal evidence.  The &ldquo;detention&rdquo; period would give the Gardai an interval during which to do what is strictly police work.</P>
    <P>It should also be borne in mind that, as well as providing a basis for confirming suspicion leading ultimately to the bringing of charges, a period of detention for questioning can result in an innocent person being cleared.</P>
    <P>Many people have been looking to this Bill to do something positive about the very serious problem of offences committed by persons on bail.  There is, I <Col N="1262" /> think, a widespread feeling that bail is too readily granted and that, where there is evidence that a person is likely to commit further offences while on bail, this is a factor that the court should be able to take into account in deciding whether to grant it.  That is in fact the law in Britain at present.</P>
    <P>There is, however, at least one important difference between this country and Britain in legal matters.  We have a written Constitution to which our laws must conform.  In Britain Parliament is supreme.  In relation to the granting of bail, the position here is that there was a Supreme Court decision in 1966 to the effect that a court could not refuse bail on the grounds that the person concerned was likely to commit further offences if granted bail.  The Supreme Court held that that would amount to a form of preventive detention and would be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>It seems therefore that, short of amending the Constitution, we must accept the present law in relation to the granting of bail and work within it.  There is, however, nothing to prevent us from introducing measures which would act as a real deterrent to those who commit offences while on bail and this is the aim of sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 9 will require the courts to impose consecutive sentences for offences committed on bail.  The intention here is that a sentence for a bail offence will be consecutive on any sentence passed or about to be passed on a person for a previous offence.  The previous offence can be any other offence and not necessarily the offence in respect of which bail was originally granted.</P>
    <P>To make the provision effective so far as sentences passed in the District Court are concerned, we are increasing from 12 months to two years the aggregate term that a district justice can impose when passing two or more consecutive sentences. That is contained in section 10.  In the higher courts, of course, there is no limit and a person could, therefore, be sentenced to two terms of five or even ten years in those courts to run consecutively.</P>
    <P>The third provision relating to bail is <Col N="1263" /> the creation of a new offence of failing to surrender to bail &mdash; in other words, absconding.  That is contained in section 11.  It will be a summary offence carrying a sentence of up to 12 months imprisonment. However, any sentence imposed for this offence will have to be consecutive on any sentence passed for a prior offence in the same way as a sentence for an offence committed on bail.</P>
    <P>These three provisions represent a very necessary tightening up in the bail area. Their aim is simple &mdash; to get the message across loud and clear to bail offenders that from now on they can expect much harsher punishment.  I believe there will be a general welcome for these provisions which most people will regard as long overdue.</P>
    <P>The Bill singles out certain aspects of the crime problem for special treatment and the reason for this is, quite simply, that the level of these activities is particularly high at present and, consequently, special steps need to be taken to deal with them.  The areas in question relate to the stealing of cars &mdash; technically unauthorised taking &mdash; firearms offences, especially the growing trade in the supply of firearms, such as sawn-off shotguns, for criminal activity and the problem of dealing with possession of stolen property where theft or receiving cannot be proved.</P>
    <P>Taking first the problem relating to the taking of cars, as I have said before, this is now a major social problem that is causing deaths, serious injuries and damage to property.  There are frequent reports of people being terrorised by high-powered cars being driven at reckless speeds through the streets, or police cars being rammed and so on.  Cars are not just taken by youngsters for so-called &ldquo;joy-riding&rdquo;.  Car-taking is a vital part in the organisation of armed robberies and other serious crimes.  This offence has got to be stamped out.  Section 12 of the Bill proposes to make the offence indictable and to increase the penalties.  On conviction on indictment the penalty will be a maximum of five years imprisonment and a fine of up to £2,000.  On summary conviction we are increasing the sentence <Col N="1264" /> from six months to 12 months and the fine from £50 to £800.</P>
    <P>The fact that there is already a power of arrest without warrant for the offence and that it will henceforth carry a five year sentence means that the Garda will be able to detain suspects under the powers given by section 3.  The Garda are confident that these measures will substantially improve the detection rate for this offence.</P>
    <P>Section 13 increases the penalties for certain firearms offences.  These are the most serious firearms offences known to our law.  The penalty for possessing a firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property is going up from 14 years to life imprisonment, as is also the penalty for using a firearm to resist arrest or aid an escape.  We are increasing from seven years to 14 years the penalty for possessing a firearm while taking a vehicle without authority and from ten years to 14 years the penalty for carrying a firearm with criminal intent.  I should point out that these are all maximum sentences and not mandatory ones and that, in those cases where the maximum sentence is a life sentence, it will be open to the courts to impose a sentence of 20 or 25 years if it sees fit in an appropriate case.</P>
    <P>We are making it an offence, under section 14, to withhold information regarding the source of supply of firearms or ammunition.  The effect of it will be that a person found in illegal possession of a firearm or ammunition will be required to give a garda information as to how he came by it and as to any previous dealings with it.  It will be an offence to fail, or refuse to give the information, punishable, on indictment, with up to five years' imprisonment.  The garda will be obliged to warn the person in ordinary language of the consequences of failing or refusing to do so, and any information given will not be admissible against the person or his spouse in any civil or criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>It should be clear, therefore, from this provision that the principal objective is to enable the Garda to get at the source of supply of firearms and not to cause the person found in possession to incriminate <Col N="1265" /> himself or his spouse in relation to his possession of the firearm.  Like the preceding provision this section is justified by the need to reduce the use of firearms in criminal activities but it endeavours to strike at those people who supply or hire guns for particular crimes.</P>
    <P>Section 15 contains a provision on similar lines in relation to property reasonably believed to have been stolen.  There is a lacuna in the law since about the early 1960s when a provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, which sought to deal with the problem of unlawful possession of stolen property, was found to be unworkable.  The Garda have been concerned of late that this gap should be closed off and we are now doing that.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the sections in the Bill allowing the court of trial to draw inferences from the behaviour of an accused person in certain circumstances.  These are sections 16, 17 and 18.</P>
    <P>Section 16 will allow the court or jury to draw an inference &mdash; in practice it means an adverse inference &mdash; where the accused puts forward, as part of his defence at the trial, an explanation for some matter that he could reasonably have been expected to have mentioned to the Garda when being questioned or charged.</P>
    <P>Some important qualifications must be mentioned.  First, the jury will only be able to draw an inference where it would be proper for them to do so and the question of whether it would or would not be proper, in all the circumstances, is a matter upon which the trial judge will direct the jury.</P>
    <P>Second, the accused must have been told at the time he was questioned or charged what the consequences of failing or refusing to mention some important fact might be.  Third, the court or jury will not be able to convict an accused on the basis of an inference taken alone. Finally, if the accused remains silent, both at the pre-trial stage and at the trial itself, no inference can be drawn.</P>
    <P>I think these are very important and sensible safeguards and that they remove any possible basis for suggesting that this provision could in any way operate unfairly against an accused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1266" /> The practical effect of this provision, so far as the conduct of a trial is concerned, is that the judge will be able to tell the jury that they may draw an adverse inference if it would be appropriate. At present the judge is not allowed to do so although he may tell the jury that the failure of the accused to mention some fact is something which they are entitled to take into account in determining the weight to be attached to his evidence. Most eminent lawyers, in particular the members of the English Criminal Law Revision Committee who first recommended the change, are on record as saying that the distinction between what the judge may say and what he may not is highly artificial and illogical.  It has also been said that the difference would not, in all probability, be intelligible to the members of any ordinary jury.  I fully share those views.</P>
    <P>The change we are proposing accords fully with what most people would regard as common sense.  Indeed, it has been recognised by the English Court of Appeal that juries probably do, as a matter of common sense, draw adverse inferences from the belated nature of an accused's defence or from his total failure to put forward any explanation, especially in circumstances where the evidence against him is &ldquo;crying out&rdquo; for some explanation.  As a matter of strict logic, therefore, the implication of the present rules about what the judge may say would seem to be that, whenever he thinks the common sense of the jury might lead them to draw an adverse inference, he should warn them not to follow their common sense.</P>
    <P>In allowing inferences to be drawn in the circumstances mentioned, we are not, of course, introducing any new or radical principle into the law.  Already the law allows a court or jury to draw an inference from the silence or other reaction of the accused in the face of something said in his presence about the conduct in respect of which he is charged.</P>
    <P>Some criticism has already been levelled at this provision on the ground that it represents a discarded British proposal. It is true that the proposal was not implemented in England and that a majority of <Col N="1267" /> the members of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure recommended against it.  As against that, a minority of that commission supported it as did the full Criminal Law Revision Committee that I have referred to earlier.  Indeed, we owe the draft of the provision in section 16 in large measure to the Criminal Law Revision Committee and I think it is only right that I should publicly acknowledge that.  In our own country, the proposed change had the support of Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain in his report. Very often Government Ministers &mdash; especially those putting forward proposals for law reform &mdash; find themselves criticised if the proposals happen to follow provisions already enacted in Britain. The charge is usually to the effect that we ought to be capable of making up our own minds on things and acting independently and not, as it is sometimes put, &ldquo;slavishly following the British&rdquo;.  Indeed, the charge is sometimes expressed in much more emotive terms.  It seems to me to be ironic that, when we do show independence of thought, as in this case, the very opposite sort of criticism is made.  Now we are told, in effect, that if the provision was not found to be good enough for London it ought not to be good enough for us.  My answer to that sort of criticism is this: I am prepared to rest my case on the intrinsic merit of what I am putting forward to this House and to defend it on that basis and not on whether it has been accepted or rejected elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Sections 17 and 18 relate to the drawing of inferences in particular situations, that is, where it would be reasonable to expect a suspect to account for objects or marks or for his presence in a particular place. The idea is that the suspect could be asked to account for a mark or stain on his clothing or for some object in his possession which the member of the Garda Síochána who arrested him reasonably believed might be attributable to his participation in the offence for which he was arrested.  Likewise, he could be asked to account for his presence in a particular place at or about the time the offence was committed.  The suspect <Col N="1268" /> would be under no obligation to give an account but, if he were subsequently charged, his failure or refusal to do so could give rise to the drawing of an adverse inference.  In the particular situations covered by these sections an inference can be drawn even where the accused elects not to give evidence.</P>
    <P>As regards trial procedures, sections 19 to 24 of the Bill propose to make certain important changes.</P>
    <P>For some time now, many people have been convinced that some of our court procedures need to be revised in the light of the changes that have taken place since the procedures were introduced.  There is a feeling that the balance has swung too far in favour of the accused and needs to be restored without in any way prejudicing his right to a fair trial.  Some of the procedures were developed at a time when trials were conducted in a very different way and when the concept of what was fair to an accused was also vastly different.  For example, before 1836 the right of an accused to legal representation in very serious cases was greatly restricted and he was not allowed any representation at all in minor cases.  And even long after the changes made in that year, accused persons were often unrepresented even in serious cases.  Today an accused is rarely unrepresented even in minor cases and he enjoys a constitutional right to legal aid at the taxpayer's expense if he cannot afford to pay for it himself.</P>
    <P>Dealing first with those provisions that affect the position of an accused, section 19 will oblige an accused at a trial on indictment to give notice of his intention to put forward an alibi and, if he does not give the notice, he will not be allowed to put forward an alibi at his trial except with the leave of the court.  In general ten days' notice will be required.  The purpose of this provision is to ensure that an accused will not be able to &ldquo;spring&rdquo; on the prosecution at the last minute an alibi which the prosecution have not had time to check out.  When it is borne in mind that under present law the prosecution is required to serve on the accused well in advance a copy of what is known as the book of evidence containing a list of the <Col N="1269" /> names and addresses of witnesses and statements of the evidence each of them posposes to give, I think that it will be generally accepted as right that we should make this change.</P>
    <P>Section 22 abolishes the right of an accused to make an unsworn statement. The intention is that if the accused wishes to give evidence he will have to be sworn and be subject to cross-examination like other witnesses.  Few people are likely to regard this change as other than wholly desirable.  The right to make an unsworn statement dates from a time when an accused was, generally speaking, not allowed to give evidence on oath.  That was changed in England in 1898 and here in 1924 but, curiously, the right to make an unsworn statement was maintained.  It has already been abolished in England and we now intend to do likewise.</P>
    <P>We propose also to introduce majority jury verdicts at criminal trials.  There has been an increasing number of jury disagreements in recent times with more than a suspicion in some cases that there was an element of intimidation present. This particular reform will avoid the need for a retrial in a case in which not more than two of the 12 jurors disagree.</P>
    <P>Section 24 contains the details of the provision.  It proposes that a jury will have to have at least two hours for deliberation before a majority verdict can be accepted.  Majority verdicts are being allowed both to convict and to acquit, but we think it is only fair that if a verdict of acquittal is by majority that fact should not be disclosed.  Majority verdicts have long been the law in England and Scotland.</P>
    <P>Finally, as regards the position of the accused, the rules relating to the order of closing speeches are being altered so that the speech for the defence will always come after any speech made for the prosecution. That provision is in section 23.</P>
    <P>Two provisions that ought not to be in any way controversial are those contained in sections 20 and 21.  Under section 20 it is proposed to allow both sides at a criminal trial to prove by written statements matters that up to now can only be proved by calling witnesses to give oral evidence. Certain conditions must, of course, be <Col N="1270" /> satisfied, the most important of which is that the other parties to the proceedings would have the opportunity to object to the written evidence and to this end it must be served on them beforehand. Section 21 will allow matters of a purely formal kind that up to now have to be proved by oral evidence to be formally admitted by the parties to the proceedings. There are, I believe, adequate procedural safeguards to protect an accused person.  I believe that these two provisions will save valuable court time that is wasted at present in formally proving matters that are not really in dispute.  I would hope that they will lead to some reduction in the cost of criminal trials.</P>
    <P>As regards the final provisions of the Bill, the only ones requiring any special comment are perhaps those in sections 26 and 27.</P>
    <P>Section 26 deals with the proposed tape recording of the questioning of suspects. What is being proposed is that the Minister will make regulations under the Act providing for tape recording, the details of which will be set out in the regulations. The Government have accepted in principle that tape recording of the questioning of persons in Garda custody should be introduced and the only thing to be decided now is how best this should be accomplished.  Certain matters still have to be examined before it can be brought into operation, such as the type of equipment used, the modifications to Garda stations that need to be carried out, how it will operate in practice in the stations and what arrangements will be necessary to meet the requirements of the defence and the prosecution.  I have set up a committee representing the Garda authorities and my Department and including a specialist in electronics to work out all the detailed requirements under these and other relevant headings and I expect that the committee will at an early date be in a position to organise a pilot scheme or schemes so as to enable all the practical implications to be fully evaluated.  I envisage that these pilot schemes will be introduced in advance of the making of regulations. The committee will, I expect, examine what has been and is being done in other jurisdictions and in this way we <Col N="1271" /> will have the benefit of their practical experience.  When the committee have reported we will lose no time in introducing a suitable system of tape recording.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the powers to be given to the Garda in the Bill should be deferred until tape recording of questioning is introduced.  I cannot agree with that.  It would be ideal if it were possible to introduce tape recording simultaneously with the coming into force of the new powers in the Bill, but it simply is not possible.  We know from the experience of other countries that a lot of work needs to be done before we reach that stage.  As I have said, field trials or pilot schemes need to be carried out and there are technical, procedural and legal or quasi-legal questions to be considered. No country, so far as I am aware, has been able to introduce tape recording overnight.  In Britain, for example, they have been considering it on and off for over 12 years and only last week the Home Secretary said, when the amended Police and Criminal Evidence Bill was published, that he thought it would take about four more years before it could be accomplished there.  Indeed, the six pilot schemes that are to be undertaken there are not to commence until next year.  I wish again to emphasise, however, that the Government are committed to introducing an appropriate system of tape recording and will do so without any avoidable delay.</P>
    <P>We have thought it desirable to introduce a general power in the Bill to fingerprint persons convicted of indictable offences or those dealt with under the Probation Act and this is to be found in section 27.  Many people will, perhaps, be surprised to learn that, notwithstanding that the use of fingerprints for forensic purposes has been with us since the turn of the century at least, the Garda still have no general power to fingerprint those convicted of serious offences.  They rely on other provisions in the law which relates to persons undergoing imprisonment. The power in the Bill will apply only to those convicted of indictable offences or dealt with under the Probation Act for those offences.  Indictable offences <Col N="1272" /> are intrinsically serious and, in my view, it is reasonable that persons convicted of them should be liable to be fingerprinted.  Persons dealt with under the Probation Act are persons against whom the facts have been proved in court and I think it is right that they should also be included.  Many persons, first dealt with in this way, reappear again and again in our criminal statistics.  This provision will enable the Garda to build up their fingerprint records and in this way improve crime detection.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the main comments that I want to offer on the substantive provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I want to say something about a matter that is not in the Bill, an omission, which I think, caused surprise to many people and disappointment to some.  The Garda have no general power to obtain a warrant to search premises for evidence of serious crime. There are specific provisions in the law entitling them to obtain warrants to search premises, for example, for stolen goods or for drugs.  If the Garda suspect that a stolen pot of jam is likely to be found in a person's house, they can obtain a warrant to search the house but, if they suspect that bloodstained clothing that would help to convict a murderer is there, they are powerless to go in without the consent of the owner or occupier. That is, I think, a position that people in general might find disturbing and difficult to defend.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a wide power of search and the intrusion on the privacy it involves could give rise to genuine fears. Groups that are, perhaps, most likely to see it this way are those who in the course of the practice of their professions develop special relationships of confidence with clients and who maintain records containing confidential material. The Government are not unmindful, in this context, of recent British experience in relation to a proposal to give a general power of search for a wide category of serious offences.  Considerable controversy was engendered about the alleged lack of adequate safeguards to protect information held in confidence.  The resultant amendments to the proposal <Col N="1273" />&mdash; no doubt to assauge fears &mdash; may have greatly limited its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The Government are not in favour of having a general search provision but left for further consideration the possibility of having some kind of provision which would be a compromise between the rights of those anxious to ensure protection of confidential relationships and the interests of society in seeing that the Garda get adequate powers to secure evidence of serious crime.</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, to suggest for consideration by the House a provision that would be very restrictive in its scope. What I have in mind is one that would allow a Garda superintendent to obtain a warrant, on a sworn information before a district justice, to search premises but only where the justice was satisfied that there was evidence of or relating to specified serious offences, namely, murder, an offence involving grievous bodily harm &mdash; this would cover only two or three offences &mdash; kidnapping or rape.  A search for evidence of these particular offences would, I think, be unlikely to involve confidential records.  If it did, that would be unavoidable; but I think it would not be unreasonable to suggest that in any such case &mdash; which would be bound to be rare &mdash; the rights of the community in having those very serious crimes detected and punished should prevail over any other rights.</P>
    <P>That is my suggestion.  I would welcome reaction to it from inside and outside the House.  It is a matter that we can return to on Committee Stage.  Before I leave it though, I would like to mention one other relevant matter.  Under existing enactments authorising the searching of premises there are no provisions of any kind protecting confidential information or records and, so far as I am aware, their absence has not generated any controversy up to now nor have they been thought to present any special threat to confidential relationships.  Moreover, some of those enactments are of recent origin &mdash; for example, the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977.  Hopefully, the same commonsense approach that must have characterised acceptance of that provision will prevail here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1274" /> When this Bill was published it was accompanied by a statement relating to the Government's intention to set up a new procedure for dealing with complaints against the Garda.  The statement said that the Government had decided, on my recommendation, that the provisions in the Bill giving increased powers to the Garda should not be brought into operation until a complaints procedure involving an assessment by an independent person or tribunal had been established.</P>
    <P>At the time an attempt was made to read something sinister into the issuing of a separate statement about the complaints procedure and, in case there should be any bona fide confusion about that, or about the Government's intentions, I would like to set out the position fully for the record of this House.</P>
    <P>There is a clear Government commitment to bring forward a new scheme for handling complaints against the Garda. There is also a promise not to bring into operation the new Garda powers until the complaints scheme has been set up. Nothing could be clearer or more binding on the Government than that.  Precisely how the complaints scheme will operate has not yet been worked out in detail, but it will involve some form of independent assessment, either by one person or by a tribunal, of the way complaints against the Garda are investigated and dealt with.  In a context where the bringing into force of new Garda powers is inextricably linked to a new complaints system, it would have been ideal if the complaints scheme could have formed part of the Bill.  That was not possible, for a number of reasons.</P>
    <P>First, the Bill is a Criminal Justice Bill dealing exclusively with criminal matters and it would not have been appropriate to have put into it matters, such as a complaints scheme, of a non-criminal kind.  Second, some work still remains to be done on the detailed working out of the complaints procedure and there has yet to be consultation with the Garda authorities and their representative organisations.  There is also another reason that was mentioned in the statement issued with the Bill.  It may be possible <Col N="1275" /> to introduce the new complaints procedure on an administrative basis &mdash; that is, without the need for legislation &mdash; in the first instance at any rate.  That has not yet been decided.  But in any event both Houses will be given an opportunity of discussing the new procedure before it is brought into effect.</P>
    <P>It should be apparent from what I have said that the Government are quite resolute in their approach to this matter and that there is no question of new powers being given to the Garda without the added safeguard of a proper complaints procedure.  The Garda themselves recognise the validity of this approach and will, I am sure, be anxious to see the complaints procedure brought forward at an early date.  I expect that it will be brought before the House before the Bill becomes law.</P>
    <P>While there may be scope for argument over individual provisions, I am confident that the vast majority of Deputies will see the Bill as broadly the right response to the difficult circumstances of today.  It is, I think, a measured and reasoned response.  Its aim is to restore the balance as between the community and the criminal, while at the same time preserving everything that is of fundamental importance to our liberties.  It maintains intact the cornerstones of our common law system of justice.  I think the Bill is generally right in substance and in drafting, but I have already made it clear elsewhere &mdash; and I repeat it now for the record of the House &mdash; that I am prepared to listen to constructive suggestions and to consider reasonable amendments on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It was recently suggested by a professor of law in one of our universities that this Bill will introduce the most repressive pre-trial system of criminal procedure of any democratic country that he knows of. That is not my information.  The fact is that virtually all of what we are now proposing is already common practice in other democratic countries.  In England, for example, the police can detain without charge for 48 hours, or even longer in the case of serious arrestable offences, and in Northern Ireland they can detain <Col N="1276" /> for up to 48 hours for all ordinary arrestable offences.  In France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands &mdash; to mention just a few of our European partners &mdash; the police can detain without judicial intervention for at least 24 hours.</P>
    <P>As regards fingerprinting, the proposals in the Bill are fully in accord with the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure in England which are now included in the Police and Criminal Evidence Bill there.  That Bill will shortly be re-introduced.  Fingerprinting without the consent of the suspect and without judicial approval is also allowed in some European countries.</P>
    <P>It was also alleged that the Bill abolishes the Judges' Rules, the caution and the right of silence in the police station. These allegations are incorrect.  The Judges' Rules and the caution remain exactly the same, that is to say, the Garda will continue to caution a person to the effect that he is not obliged to say anything. However, they are also being required under sections 16, 17 and 18 to inform the person in ordinary language of what the effect of failing or refusing to mention certain facts or account for certain objects or marks might be.</P>
    <P>The proposals to allow inferences to be drawn cannot fairly be described as an abrogation of the right of silence during questioning, since the suspect is not obliged to answer any questions and, in relation to section 16, no inference can arise if he remains silent both during questioning and at the trial.  People sometimes forget in this regard that in most of the civil law countries of Europe &mdash; France, Belgium, Germany, etc. &mdash; the system involves compulsory pre-trial questioning of accused persons by an examining magistrate.  This can go on for very long periods &mdash; even amounting to 12 or 18 months in some countries &mdash; and often the suspect is detained in custody throughout.  While technically the accused has the right to remain silent, the reality is that very few accused persons do, because it can have a prejudicial effect on their case.  That is the accusatorial system.  Our system, which is adversarial in nature, seems to me to offer a better deal to the accused.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1277" /> Once he is formally charged with an offence &mdash; which under the Bill must happen within 12, or at most 20 hours, of arrest &mdash; he cannot be further questioned; bail can be denied, even in cases of murder, only in very limited circumstances; he enjoys a right to free legal aid if he cannot afford a lawyer; and there is a presumption of innocence in his favour.</P>
    <P>Objection was also taken to the provisions relating to withholding of information regarding firearms and stolen property contained in sections 14 and 15 on the ground that they required &ldquo;compulsory submission to questioning for intelligence gathering purposes&rdquo;.  I think this is an understandable reaction, though in my opinion an exaggerated one.  However, it fails to take account of the seriousness of the situation confronting us as regards the illegal supply of firearms for criminal activities and the traffic in stolen goods.  Moreover, there are already analogous provisions in the law, both here and in England, where a person is required to answer questions under penalty and where, as in this Bill, incriminating admissions cannot be used against him in any subsequent proceedings.</P>
    <P>The approach to the Bill exemplified by this sort of criticism will not, I think, be widely shared.  Ordinary law-abiding citizens are now totally fed up with the activities of criminals &mdash; and especially with the &ldquo;godfathers&rdquo; and &ldquo;barons&rdquo;&mdash; who appear to have been able up to now to flout the law and accumulate wealth regardless of the hardship and misery they have caused.  Thankfully, the Garda in recent times have had remarkable success, especially with drug racketeers, and I am sure it is the wish of every member of this House that this will continue.  The people are fully behind the Garda in their efforts.</P>
    <P>But it would be wrong to see this Bill solely in terms of its &ldquo;crime-curbing&rdquo; dimension.  It is also, I believe, a worthwhile measure of criminal law reform. All the substantive provisions deal with the kind of reforms that would, I think, suggest themselves for adoption in the course of any major review.  They are justified on their own merits.  I would not <Col N="1278" /> bring the Bill before this House if I were not convinced of that.</P>
    <P>Laws on their own, of course, will not solve crime, the causes of which are deep-rooted in our society.  But, as I said at the beginning, we cannot sit around doing nothing until our social problems are solved.  Utopia is not around the corner. The Garda, for their part, are also realistic in their attitude to law reform and recognise that it is by no means a complete answer.  Nothing will ever supplant good local knowledge coupled with painstaking detective work.  Improved detection is, therefore, essential and in this regard the Garda need the support of the public to come forward with information about the criminals and not to be tempted to resort to taking the law into their own hands.</P>
    <P>It would be idealistic, not to say unrealistic, to think that our work in combating crime would ever be so successful that we would again have one of the lowest crime rates, one of the smallest prison populations and one of the smallest police forces of any developed country in the world. That is unlikely to happen, at any rate in the near future, and certainly one could not say that it would be likely to result from any one measure.  At the same time every constructive effort is bound to be of assistance and this Bill certainly fits that description.  I believe that, in conjunction with the other practical measures the Government are taking, it will have a major impact in stemming the increase in crime.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House on this basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>We support this Bill in principle and in its general terms.  We welcome its introduction to the House and also the Minister's commitment to an open mind on any worthwhile improvements which may be suggested on Committee Stage.  On Committee Stage we will be interested in examining some of the proposals in detail to try to introduce any refinements which are necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are confronted with a very serious rise in crime in our society.  The last decade has seen a dramatic rise in crime in Ireland and especially in our cities.  The <Col N="1279" /> total number of indictable crimes recorded has risen from 38,000 in 1973 to 97,600 in 1982.  This is an enormous increase in the level of crime in our society and obviously calls for a variety of actions from the Oireachtas.  From once being what was regarded as a haven of peace and personal security, we are fast degenerating to levels of crime and lawlessness which match the worst of those in the other developed countries.</P>
    <P>Nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in the Dublin metropolitan area. With only 30 per cent of the population, the Dublin metropolitan area accounts for almost 60 per cent of our recorded crime.  Limerick with 33 crimes per 1,000 of the population and Cork east with 30 crimes per 1,000 of the population join with Dublin to form the big three centres of crime in the State.  It is important to identify the way in which crime is distributed. We have had an alarming increase in crime all over the country, and a particularly severe problem in certain areas. Dublin, Limerick and Cork are the big three in this respect.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago it was possible to park a car in Dublin without having it broken into or stolen.  Now it is not.  This reality is reflected in these figures.  It was possible to carry money or a handbag without being mugged or having the bag snatched.  Now it is not.  Fear has taken over.  The fear of crime, of the extent of crime, of the likelihood of being attacked or robbed is much wider than crime itself, because the number of offences is so great that the fear has spread.  There is a certain concern that the Oireachtas and the Garda may not be able to contain the situation.  I do not share this concern.  I believe if we take specific action we can contain crime.  For this reason we will be supporting the action proposed here today.</P>
    <P>Fear of robbery, larceny, housebreaking, car stealing and personal attacks has become widespread.  Meetings have been held at which people have stated that they are highly alarmed about the reality of larceny and robbery.  The fear of joyriding, often with tragic consequences which are well known to Deputies, is <Col N="1280" /> widespread.  The taking of cars for use in robberies has become commonplace. Too often it is the innocent and the defenceless who suffer most at the hands of the vandal and the criminal, the innocent driver or pedestrian who is struck down by the fun-seeking joy-rider, the old age pensioner or unsuspecting housewife who is mugged or robbed of meagre savings or housekeeping money. No crime is too petty or mean for our modern breed of vandals.</P>
    <P>Two other features are important when we come to examine the incidence and the extent of present-day crime and look for solutions.  One is the incidence of juvenile crime committed by youths under 17 years of age.  These account for 33 per cent of all crime.  In Dublin north inner city it has been found that some 50 youths are responsible for over 50 per cent of all juvenile crime.  Some of them have been arrested up to 17 times over the past three months.  In the view of the Garda, the principal problem is the lack of (a) parental control and responsibility and (b) any suitable place to put them following the granting of a fit person's order.  Because of this, they develop and graduate into a life of big-time crime.  We have a very specific problem with juveniles.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there is the influence of drug abuse and the abuse of other substances on the volume of crime particularly in the cities, and especially in Dublin city.  The Medico-Social Research Board in a recent study begun in September 1982 showed that the majority of heroin abusers end up in prison.  They estimated that the daily requirement of heroin for a full blown abuser costs £100 to £200.  To meet this cost abusers stole from cars, shops, houses, and banks and snatched handbags.  These are the findings of the survey carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board.  Many abusers were responsible for multiple thefts.</P>
    <P>If we add to this the fact that glue sniffers were found to be responsible for 1,000 crimes in the Dublin north inner city in 1982, we get some idea of the influence of drugs on crime.  If we accept the latest figure from the Minister for Health of 1,500 heroin abusers, we must <Col N="1281" /> conclude that, in the Dublin metropolitan area, drugs are now one of the largest single contributors to the present higher incidence of crime.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it must be made clear in our society &mdash; and people have expressed great doubts about this &mdash; that crime will be detected and offenders punished. There is a lack of confidence in the community in this simple statement.  Ten years ago we could accept that by and large crime was likely to be detected, and prosecutions and punishment were likely to follow.  It must also be made clear to the criminal that crime will be detected and punished and that the punishment will fit the crime, and be seen by the community to do so.</P>
    <P>We are witnessing today something of a crisis of confidence within the community about the ability of the forces of law and order to handle the rise in crime. Numerous meetings and discussions have been held and this crisis of confidence is coming from the representatives on the ground.  This arises particularly from a sense of frustration about the operation of the legal system and the obvious ease with which the criminal can circumvent the law and continue his life of crime.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that only one crime in three is reported and that, of those reported, only one in three is detected. On these figures it is clear that at best one crime in three is detected, and at worst one in nine is detected.  There is, therefore, a great need to create a situation in which, first the community will report a higher proportion of crimes committed; and, secondly, the Garda will apprehend the perpetrators of a higher proportion of the crimes reported.  This, of course, will call for a number of measures and not alone those we are considering here today.  Even when a person has been charged with an offence the road to a conviction and suitable punishment is a long, arduous and often frustrating one for the Garda.  For example, of the 32,141 burglaries reported to the Garda in 1982, criminal proceedings were initiated in 9,752 cases.  By the end of the year 3,128 convictions had been obtained and 6,296 were still before the courts. Consequently, while the detection rate <Col N="1282" /> was just under one-in-three, convictions had been obtained and finalised in only one crime in ten reported.  That is the real significance of those figures.  When one sees this situation one is no longer surprised that the people on the street are frustrated, concerned, upset and afraid.  This is the problem we have before us and this position is clearly unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>It has also contributed to considerable unease among the Garda and in the community. The Garda feel very frustrated in this area because of the time it takes for them to have a prosecution brought to a conclusion under our legal system. Even the relatively few who are convicted may not receive sentences which fit the crime, or they may not serve these sentences because of the lack of suitable custodial facilities.  The Minister said more than 1,200 prisoners will have to be let go early next year.  That indicates yet a further problem for those already convicted and sent to prison.  When we look at the reality of the situation it is not surprising that the ordinary member of the community is alarmed and concerned about the present position or that he is looking to this House for remedies and measures which will solve the situation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>The causes of the recent growth in crime are complex and are rooted in the community.  I recognise that in the longer term they will not be resolved without attention to the very nature of our society. Idleness and unemployment, lack of opportunity and involvement, lack of facilities for games and recreation, the abuse of drugs and other substances, broken marriages which can result in a lack of parental control and many other factors contribute to the high level of crime in some areas.  There are studies which show this very clearly.  The study on drugs carried out by the Medico-Social Research Board brings out most of those points.</P>
    <P>These root causes must be tackled if we are to reduce the incidence of crime in the longer term.  In the short-term, however, there are specific steps which can be taken.  Already we have been highly successful in tackling the spate of <Col N="1283" /> bank robberies, which racked the country over the last few years, by creating and equipping a special task force.  I mention this particularly because we must give the people hope and if we take specific direct action and do our best to confine and control crime, we can be successful.  The problem of bank robberies is now under control and the runaway situation of a few years ago was stopped by the direct action of setting up a special task force throughout the country and co-ordinating efforts to stamp out this widespread crime.  Success in this area shows the effectiveness of specific measures taken to tackle a major area of crime.</P>
    <P>Another specific measure was the strengthening of the drug squad in 1982. This has already led to the greatly increased seizures of heroin and subsequent convictions of some of Dublin's major drug pushers.  Again direct action was taken to deal specifically with this problem.  As the Minister recognised, the Garda have been having considerable success dealing with drug racketeers because they were given support in a particular area and authorisation to use whatever methods were needed to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>Yet another specific measure approved by the Oireachtas was the increase of 2,000 in the number of gardaí.  This placed more men on the beat and opened the way for better community policing and improved community relations.  This is particularly important when we consider the fears in the community which, in my view, are greater than necessary. With better community relations and more gardaí on the beat, people would have a better appreciation of what the gardaí can do for them and they will see how effective they can be.  Once these gardaí have been properly deployed, they will contribute to a greater sense of security in the community.  I read in <i>The Irish Times,</i> 6 August, 1983, referring to the Garda Commissioner's report on crime for 1982 that the Garda sources attributed the reduction in the increase in crime &mdash; this was the lowest level, 9 per cent, for some years &mdash; to the increase in Garda numbers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1284" /> The article went on to say that about 1,000 extra gardaí were recruited during the year and that by the end of the year a further 1,000 will have taken up duty and many of those will have been posted to Dublin where the majority of crimes are committed.  We see from this that action taken with the support of the Oireachtas can obtain good results.</P>
    <P>The Community Service Orders Act recently passed by the Oireachtas, and yet to be implemented, will no doubt contribute some what to the easing of the chronic overcrowding in our prisons.</P>
    <P>Other measures which would bring positive results in terms of reduced crime include, first, the provision immediately of a suitable detention centre for youths under 17 who are committed under fit person orders because of lack of parental control.  From what I have discovered from looking into the situation, particularly in the high crime areas, the lack of this facility is very specific and I refer particularly to the relatively small number of juveniles who are responsible for a very large number of crimes.  I understand the provision of a suitable detention centre is one of the greatest needs at the present time and would have a very beneficial effect.  Secondly, we should provide compulsory residential care for juvenile drug abusers who come into conflict with the law.  When these juveniles come into conflict with the law they should be sent for treatment rather than into our prison system, because if this happens there is a danger they will take to a life of crime.  Thirdly, we should make parents responsible for juvenile offenders.  That is something which could have been included within the ambit of this Bill and I would ask the Minister to consider that aspect.  Judging by reports this is a major problem.  There is a very high volume of such crime.  We are informed that one-third of all crimes are committed by juveniles.  The half-way houses for juvenile offenders are proving very successful but our ultimate objective must surely be to prevent these young people entering upon a life of crime.</P>
    <P>Fourth, provide adequate forensic <Col N="1285" /> equipment in order to increase the detection rate.  At the moment it is one in three.  In some areas it is much lower than that.  There simply are not adequate forensic resources to deal with the problems. Quite often constituents come to me whose houses have been broken into and they tell me no one came to take fingerprints or anything else.  We must increase the detection rate.</P>
    <P>Fifth, restore the present capital building programme to provide prison space; and, sixth, speed up court procedures to wipe out the backlog and delays which are frustrating the system.</P>
    <P>I believe we need a new administrative approach.  The Minister referred to the reality of the situation in referring to overnight waiting for a court sitting the following morning and so on.  Courts could dispose of many of the petty criminals at night.  That is something we should look at.  It is the practice in other countries.  If that system were adopted the Garda would be freer.  It might mean members of the Judiciary sitting late in the evening or even at night but I am sure that could be arranged on a rota basis. Only one in ten of all crimes reported is actually cleared up within a year.  Drastic remedial measures are also required in that area.</P>
    <P>It is in this context we look at the Bill. It is against the background of rising crime and in an analysis of the causes of that crime and the remedies which might prove effective that we must consider these provisions.  We support the Bill in principle but we shall be seeking a number of amendments on Committee Stage. We would also urge the Minister to bring the proposed complaints procedure before the House before Committee Stage.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister will not do this.  He refers to the procedure in his opening statement and he says he expects this will be brought before the House prior to the Bill becoming law.  In fairness to Members and in deference to their intelligence, to their interest in the Bill and the support they are prepared to give the Bill, the Minister should bring the complaints procedure before the House before we reach Committee Stage so that we may have an <Col N="1286" /> opportunity of considering it.  Remember, this is an extraordinary measure.  It is not the usual type of measure.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said the procedure may be either administrative or legal.  He does not yet know which it will be but he is committed to having it.  We, on this side, would like to know what we are going to have.  Will it be adequate or inadequate?  Will it be satisfactory?  Are we being asked now to accept a pig in a poke &mdash; first the Bill and later the complaints procedure?  Surely there is nothing so extraordinary about the procedure that it cannot be brought before the House before we pass this Bill.  We should be given an opportunity in the context of the Bill to examine what the complaints procedure will be.  All we ask for are reasonable safeguards.  These safeguards should be spelled out in the context of the Bill.  We believe the procedures should be statutory.  That is something we shall have to discuss.  We believe administrative procedures would not fit properly into the context of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Surely it is only reasonable that the Bill should contain the complaints procedures and the safeguards necessary. These are matters that relate directly to the Bill and the Minister owes it to the House to inform the House.  Ultimately reason and logic must win the day.  If one does not understand something then one has a duty to show there is something wrong, that it is not logical and should be done in a certain way.  The fact this has not been done would suggest there are difficulties between Members of the Government in regard to the arrest and detention of people arrested on suspicion. First of all, we had the Bill.  Then we had the Explanatory Memorandum and then this unique supplement giving power to the Garda Síochána, a power which will come into operation only when a ministerial order to that effect has been made and will not be brought into force until a complaints procedure involving assessment by an independent person or tribunal has been established.</P>
    <P>That undertaking was given after the publication of the Bill.  The Minister has said here also that he has not yet discussed <Col N="1287" /> it with the members of the Garda Síochána, which again seems to indicate that there was an intention to bring it in without any safeguards and then some Members of the Cabinet said,&ldquo;Look, we are not buying that unless you have safeguards&rdquo; and the Minister said, &ldquo;all right, we will put in safeguards and will give you an undertaking and a supernumerary piece of paper, which is the supplement, and that supplement will give you a firm undertaking that these measures will not become law and will not go into operation until a procedure has been worked out and agreed, perhaps to the satisfaction of the Cabinet&rdquo;.  The reasonable thing to do is to have this agreed to the satisfaction of the House in the context of the Bill.  I would very earnestly ask the Minister to consider that and to put forward the complaints procedure, which is a very important aspect of these extra powers, before we go into Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>It is our contention overall that (a) the extra powers should be made available to the Garda without delay because this process also means delay in the introduction of the additional powers, if they are coming into effect.  It is our view that the extra powers should be made available to the Garda without delay and should not be held over; (b) that adequate statutory safeguards should be provided in the present Bill; and (c) that such statutory complaints procedure should now be agreed by the Government and be placed before the House for inclusion in the Bill. I would ask the Minister to consider that proposal very seriously on our behalf.</P>
    <P>Again, I do not think we can have very great difficulty in arriving at a reasonable method for providing for an independent statutory tribunal and we certainly will give our full support and very open discussion to any measure the Minister will bring forward in the context of the Bill and I would ask him to do that in deference to the House.</P>
    <P>A notable omission from the Bill is in reference to the abuse and peddling of controlled drugs.  The Minister has referred to it in his speech.  In our view the pushing and distribution of drugs should be declared scheduled of offences <Col N="1288" /> under the Offences Against the State Act and should be mentioned in this Bill as coming within that Act.  I am prepared to accept that the Minister sees these measures being applied in cases like the drugs case.  As to some of the other powers that go with it, we still believe that for a time very harsh measures should be used in relation to drugs to get that situation cleaned up as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Coming then to the specific provisions within the Bill, they come under the following headings: the detention of arrested persons in Garda custody; offences committed while on bail, other offences, inferences, trial procedure, electronic recordings and fingerprinting of persons dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act.</P>
    <P>Powers of detention represent a major increase of Garda powers.  None of us is entirely happy about having to introduce such extra powers but the levels of crime demand that we take action.  Therefore, the Minister will appreciate that quite naturally there is a certain feeling of unease at having to do the kind of thing we believe has to be done.  Nevertheless we are prepared to go ahead and to take these measures.  Fianna Fáil is committed in principle to the six-hour detention period followed by a further six hours if that is justified.  Nevertheless we believe safeguards must exist to ensure that no abuse of these increased powers occur.</P>
    <P>The statement issued by the Minister is a quite unusual one and we are told the powers will not be brought into force until a complaints procedure is available. We are also told that it has not yet been decided whether legislation will be necessary to establish such a procedure.  This failure on the part of the Government to decide such an important matter as this is in our view inexcusable.  We believe that statutory procedures are necessary and that no excuse can be forthcoming for failure to provide such statutory powers in this Bill.  We believe that powers established on a mere administrative basis as is postulated in the supplementary memorandum as one of the possibilities would be inadequate and that the delay in introducing statutory powers in this Bill to establish a proper complaints <Col N="1289" /> procedure will result in unnecessary delay in the coming into operation of the powers of detention.</P>
    <P>It is our view that the powers of detention, although necessary, must be carefully examined and we will be proposing amendments to provide greater clarification of these powers and thereby to ensure that no abuse can occur.  In particular, we on this side of the House will be examining the powers in so far as they may give rise to detention for periods much in excess of the six-hour basic period and as to the operation of these powers alongside the considerable period of detention permitted by the Offences Against the State Act.  The Minister has given certain undertakings here to the effect that he does not wish to see them operated in that way and does not believe they will be operated in that way; they will operate exclusively as six/six and a maximum of 12 or 20 if the night period comes in between.  From the detailed, technical drafting point of view we certainly would like to be assured of that and we will be looking at the Bill from that point of view particularly.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, other aspects of the six hours and six hours that we would like to consider on Committee Stage.  For instance, if a person is detained at, say, 8 p.m. and four hours brings him up to 12, he might be happier if the six hours were completed and he was allowed to go home if he was going to be allowed to go home.  On the other hand there is a question as to whether after the first six hours some break should occur if it is during the daytime.  For instance, take the case where a person has been taken in in the morning and detained for six hours and a second period of six hours is sanctioned. Should there be a break in between?  The report by Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain, to which the Minister referred, mentioned a number of these areas and recommended that where the questioning was taking place in a Garda station regulations should provide that at most there should be four hours questioning at any one time followed by a break of one hour. On that basis, the basic figure here, of course, is six hours but it would certainly seem to indicate that if there is a continuation <Col N="1290" /> into 12 hours, there should be a break of some sort provided for there. These are matters that we can look at in detail on Committee Stage and we will be looking at them from a positive point of view, to try to ensure that the Bill works in the way in which it is intended to work and that the periods of questioning are in that respect reasonable.</P>
    <P>Because of the increased powers being given to the Garda we believe that notification of detention should be given immediately instead of as soon as practicable, to safeguard the ordinary citizen. This is the kind of thing that we would like to tease out on Committee Stage, whether there should be an onus to proceed immediately to give this notice. Obviously, in proceeding immediately there may be practical difficulties but at least there is an onus to proceed immediately, whereas if it is to be &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; the period might in some circumstances be stretched and the matter might not end up exactly as the Minister had in mind in the first instance.  We will be looking at some of these aspects on Committee Stage and will be concerned to put forward amendments.  We hope the Minister will look at them and consider what amendments may be appropriate.</P>
    <P>On the second point &mdash; offences committed on bail &mdash; Fianna Fáil, while recognising the importance of bail as a right of accused persons, shares the general concern, often expressed publicly, that many persons remanded on bail use the liberty accorded them on bail to further their criminal activity and commit other offences.  We are all aware of the extent of its occurrence in society today. This morning I heard of another case in which I was involved earlier.  The individual concerned is on bail and in that period has committed yet another crime. This is something with which all Members will be familiar.  It happens much too often and there is a need&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the individual to whom the Deputy referred is not identified, is suspected&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1291" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, suspected.  I do not think the person concerned could be identified from what I have said.  I have been involved in a lot of such cases which are so common nowadays.  I am not sure if it is so common in Cavan.  In fact, the records in Cavan are fairly good, the figures being very low.  They must all be law-abiding citizens there with a very good way of life, which perhaps we should be following here in the metropolitan area.  We are all very much aware that there is need for some action in this respect.  For that reason we welcome the provisions of the Bill on bail in so far as they will prevent or discourage the commission of offences by persons remanded on bail.  The Minister has spelled out fairly well the implications of this section. These include, of course, consecutive sentences and the creation of a new offence, failure to surrender to bail, which will also be consecutive.</P>
      <P>Concerning the third point, that is other offences, we welcome the provision in the Bill for increased penalties for firearms offences and unauthorised taking of motor vehicles.  The motor vehicle offence is one of which I have been very conscious in recent times because of the vast number of unauthorised takings of motor vehicles and the way in which the position there can be abused so readily. This is something for which we had been calling, particularly in recent times, because of the circumstances we find all about us.  We welcome the provisions for extra penalties in relation to unauthorised taking of motor vehicles.  These provisions will operate as a deterrent to the commission of offences particularly prevalent today, especially by persons involved in organised crime.  Even in that respect there would seem to be some questions which could be considered on Committee Stage in relation to the application of such sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the provisions of the Bill dealing with possession of stolen property, we believe the Bill is capable of improvement, in particular when one considers the laws on larceny and, in the absence of a comprehensive review and codification of all the laws in that area, <Col N="1292" /> there is particular need in the area of receiving stolen property where there is difficulty encountered in proving that the receiver knew the goods to be stolen when he received them.  For that reason we believe it appropriate to amend the law to provide for an offence of dishonest handling akin to that in England.  We intend to bring forward an amendment to that effect.</P>
    <P>The fourth item I mentioned in the list was inferences.  This area of the Bill represents a change in what is commonly referred to as the right to silence.  In our view the proposals may be reasonable when aimed at the professional criminal. The right to silence was developed at a time when the rules of evidence precluded an accused person from giving any evidence himself in defence of a charge against him.  Fianna Fáil believe that the right to silence may be anachronistic in some respects.  At the same time we believe steadfastly that any change in the law must not be such as to transfer the basic onus of proof in criminal matters from the prosecution to the accused.  It is in this context that we will be supporting the measures the Minister proposes.  We consider that the restrictions imposed in the Bill on founding convictions, based on the various inferences, may be unnecessary and could operate so as to afford greater protection to accused persons than exists at present, where convictions may be secured on the basis of circumstantial evidence.  Therefore it may be necessary to tighten up the drafting of this section.</P>
    <P>Concerning the fifth item, the trial procedures, there are a number of measures under this heading.  The first of these is alibis.  Possibly this is the most important change required in trial procedures at present.  We recognise the need for prior notice to be given in circumstances in which for too long abuses have occurred to frustrate successful court proceedings by enabling an accused to give evidence of an alleged alibi for the first time at his trial.  However, with regard to the prescribed period in the Bill, we believe it would not be unreasonable for a court of trial to admit evidence of alibis in circumstances where it sees fit and where the <Col N="1293" /> accused has failed to comply with the prescribed period; that in these circumstances the court itself &mdash; if it sees fit &mdash; should be in a position to consider the admission of evidence of an alibi.  However, this should be subject to some limitation by reference to a minimum period of time before the commencement of the trial.  We shall be examining that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Concerning written statements, we are concerned particularly with the implications of this section and shall be examining them thoroughly before agreeing to the proposals in this area.  In any event, if accepted, these provisions will have to be amended to provide better safeguards. The other element relevant to that is admissions.  Having said what is our concern about the admission in evidence of certain written statements, these powers might best be dealt with under the provisions relating to admissions.  It appears to us there may be a case for dealing with these powers under the heading of admissions. We accept that there is a need to enable matters to be admitted in criminal prosecutions rather than retain the present requirement of proving every item in all cases, which results in wastage of time and vast expense, especially where the present requirements may be against the interests of accused persons and involve unnecessary delay and expense in trials. Therefore we welcome the proposed changes relating to admissions.  They should increase efficiency and generally are welcome.</P>
    <P>The next item is the abolition of the right of an accused to make an unsworn statement.  The present position in which an accused may elect to give an unsworn statement at his trial &mdash; and thereby avoid being cross-examined &mdash; in our view is an unnecessary aspect of the law relating to the right to silence, to which I have already referred.  If an accused has something to say at his trial it should be by way of a statement under oath, or affirmation, and should be subject to cross-examination. We welcome the proposed changes in this area.  In regard to the right to make a statement in answer to a charge before a justice on preliminary examination, the Bill proposes to remove the requirement <Col N="1294" /> of a justice of a District Court asking the accused if he has anything to say in answer to a charge after caution.  In the course of a preliminary examination of an indictable offence, having regard to what has already been stated, it might be appropriate to restrict this right to making a statement, under oath or affirmation, and subject to cross-examination. Consequently we shall need to examine this section further before agreeing to these proposals.</P>
    <P>With regard to majority verdicts, we do not see any objection to their introduction in criminal trials, subject to certain safeguards.  Consequently, we welcome the proposals advanced in this area. As the Minister is aware, we have stated publicly in the past our intention to introduce many of the measures now contained in this Bill.  We welcome the fact that the Government have seen fit to introduce them.</P>
    <P>In regard to the changes in the law concerning the requirement to bring an accused before the District Court or a peace commissioner as soon as practicable, we note the proposed changes contained in section 25 of the Bill and cannot see any clear need to change the law. Therefore, we reserve our position on these proposals pending clarification of the changes.</P>
    <P>On electronic recording, we believe a case exists for requiring the Minister to introduce regulations in this area rather than merely giving him a discretion to do so.  I should like the Minister to note &ldquo;electronic&rdquo; recording rather than taping because the Minister may well find that video recording may be preferable for a number of reasons.  For instance, I understand that quite often information is conveyed which a person might not like to give if he was being tape recorded.  In any event, the Minister has given an undertaking that he will bring in such a measure as quickly as possible but he has given many warnings as to how long that will be &mdash; seemingly it will be years before it is done.</P>
    <P>It should not be too difficult to bring before the House a complaints procedure. It may technically be more difficult to arrive at a satisfactory method of electronic <Col N="1295" /> recording but it does operate in some countries and in various states in America.  Therefore, it should be possible to have this procedure brought in much more quickly than has apparently been the case in some of the other countries to which the Minister referred.  Perhaps on Committee Stage the Minister will spell that out more clearly, because we should like to see a requirement in the Bill for some method of electronic recording.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions in the Bill governing the fingerprinting of those dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act, we believe that the proposals go against the spirit of the 1907 Act.  In some cases I believe footprinting has been particularly important in solving crime, so perhaps the Minister may wish to consider a more broadly based term there and include some of the other measures that may be necessary.  With regard to the destruction of fingerprints and other records, there should be a clear onus on those responsible to destroy all matter and copies of records.  The Minister has spelt out quite clearly in his speach that records should be destroyed at a certain point when proceedings are not going to be taken against the accused, but it would be desirable to have a clear onus on those responsible to destroy these records and copies of records.  That could be ensured by bringing this requirement under the complaints and disciplinary procedure and, if necessary, under oath.  Then people would feel happy that the Minister's intention would, in fact, be carried out.</P>
    <P>The new powers and measures in the Bill will be of little avail if there is not a clear commitment by the Government to provide the resources urgently needed to make them effective.  The evidence so far indicates that the Government have not been prepared to spend the necessary money.  I refer specifically to the cutback in the capital provision for prisons this year of £6 million, which suggests that the Government are more concerned with the bookkeeping than in tackling practical needs.  The Minister will have our full support if he restores the capital <Col N="1296" /> building programme and provides resources which are necessary.  Prison places should be provided so that the measures which we are talking about here can be applied in practice.</P>
    <P>Before leaving office Fianna Fáil had prepared a broadly similar Criminal Justice Bill and it has been worked on for quite some time.  We are, therefore, happy to see it coming before the House at this stage.  More importantly, we were making provision for the necessary capital to accelerate the prison building programme 12 months ago.  We provided the £17.6 million for prison capital and this was cut by approximately one-third in the last budget.  The Minister will have our full support in the forthcoming Estimates in restoring a programme which will be effective in this respect.</P>
    <P>Although it is not contained in the Bill the Minister mentioned the question of searches and searching.  He said:</P>
    <P>I would like, therefore, to suggest, for consideration by the House, a provision that would be very restrictive in its scope.</P>
    <P>I hope any provisions which the Minister is considering will be restrictive in the way he is suggesting and we will look at the measures he is planning to put forward on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general provisions of detention under this Bill, I was a little concerned that the five-year sentence is introduced as an across-the-board measure for detention procedures.  Logically one would like to be able to think that these special detention powers and powers of arrest would be related specifically to particular kinds of crimes because under the old Acts, probably for stealing a turnip, and certainly for stealing a sheep, you could be hanged.  There are anomalies in the old Acts.  However, I accept that it is not practicable to do other than introduce a five-year sentence across the board, but when the Minister comes to considering the search area he becomes more specific in relation to the crimes for which he wants to give these powers.  In general terms the Minister should look at this area in relation to the numbers and kinds of crimes which are <Col N="1297" /> included in the five-year sentence and whether any exclusions should apply.  If a youth steals one penny under the law it is a serious offence but one which it is not intended to pursue with this kind of action.</P>
    <P>I mention this in a general way as something that the Minister might look at to see if any exclusions should obviously be made.  The Minister has reminded me of it in this section in relation to search and I can see his anxiety to confine any of these special powers to the special areas where they would have most support from the community.  In relation to search we can only wait to see what the Minister proposes.  The Minister has raised the question and we will consider that between this and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope that any amendments that might be forthcoming will come out in good time to allow them to be well considered before Committee Stage itself is taken. In this respect we will be watching the Government's sincerity of purpose generally in regard to the forthcoming Estimates for the Department of Justice to ensure that the money and resources so necessary in this area now are applied to support the measures which this Bill will bring in and to ensure that the prison places are there and that other actions which are necessary and can be taken alongside this legislation are taken in relation to the treatment of juveniles and the provision of places for them, the juvenile liaison officers and so on.</P>
    <P>We support the Bill at this stage and we support the Government's introduction of it on the grounds that we have a major problem which we can overcome by taking the actions and measures necessary. On that basis we support this Second Stage of this Bill.  As I have said, we will consider what amendments we regard generally to be of value to the Bill in relation to Committee Stage and we will have those as early as possible before Committee Stage is taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the Bill before the House, Second Stage of which has just commenced, I compliment the present Minister and Government in bringing forward this legislation.  They <Col N="1298" /> are adhering to the commitment given in the <i>Programme for Government</i> just under a year ago, and it should be noted that it is the present Minister and the present Government who have delivered this commitment within months of coming into office by bringing in a substantial Criminal Justice Bill.  Despite talk from various quarters, it is this Government who have brought in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to looking at the various sections of the Bill we should for a moment consider the escalation in the crime rate which, unfortunately, has taken place over the years.  Over the past ten years it has increased from a reported 38,000 cases in 1973 into the middle or high 90 thousands in 1982.  This is very alarming, and we should look at the reasons why there have been so many pocket pickings, muggings, assaults, bag snatchings and robberies of a minor or major nature with greater or smaller amounts of property or money involved.  From reports on crime last year it appears that the vast majority of cases relate to smaller amounts of money but in these cases it is the ordinary individual, the little old woman, whose handbag has been snatched or who has been knocked down and attacked.  This must be deplored. Attacks on people at any level must be recognised as such by society and not tolerated.  Unfortunately, with this escalation in the number of crimes has come a greater toleration of a certain amount of crime, robberies, assaults and terrorising of people, and at times lip service only is paid to the problems that have arisen in the past number of years.  We must examine the situation where serious attacks on the individual occur and attacks on property result in losses of a greater or lesser degree.  It appears that about two-thirds of the country's crime is committed in Dublin.  We must make sure that the increase in the crime rate is reduced.  We must look at every angle and make sure that the ordinary individual, the person going about his normal honest day's business, trying to lead his life as best he can, is protected.  Any legislation, anything we can do in this House and anything that can be done at various levels must be considered.  No <Col N="1299" /> single item that the Minister, the Government or anyone else can do will bring about a sure reduction but we must look at this question as an overall policy and the bringing forward of this Criminal Justice Bill is one aspect of that.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the spokesman for the Opposition have mentioned many causes of various problems.  Unemployment has been mentioned and people have been affected for one reason or another, but it is only to a certain degree a cause of crime.  Unfortunately, there is a certain awareness that crime may pay to some extent.  The message should go out from this House that the Government and all the parties here want a reduction in crime and that we will do everything in our power to bring that about.</P>
    <P>Many people are affected by crimes committed.  I am thinking here of the drug problem which affects so many people directly or indirectly.  The drug addict himself is affected as are people whose houses are burgled in order to get money to pay for the drugs that addicts need.  People may be beaten up in their homes.  In Dublin we all know of people whose houses have been broken into and whose goods were taken, pockets picked and bags snatched.  I hope that the Bill before the House will go some way towards ensuring a greater detection rate, that the message to criminals is that their crime must stop.  It is hoped that thus the Bill will be a deterrent to crime and that the crime rate will eventually be reduced.  That will not happen overnight or merely by the passing of this Bill.  It will take quite a long time, but it is important that we make a start with the needed legislation.  We must look at the whole process regarding detention centres and the operation of the Community Services Act passed earlier this year, to ensure that we bring home to the criminal that this cannot go on.  It should be remembered that the prime objective of criminal law is the enabling of criminals to be apprehended and tried for crimes committed against individuals or against society.  This Bill is one step along that road.</P>
    <P>There are aspects in relation to detention <Col N="1300" /> of arrested persons, bail, firearms offences and trial procedures.  Each of these should be examined and I am glad that the Minister is open to further suggestions and to possible amendments, additions or discussions on Committee Stage.  It is only by examining in detail the implications of the various sections that we will arrive at legislation which will be a deterrent to criminals and will lead to their detection.</P>
    <P>This Bill deals with serious crime, for which there are severe sentences, not with mere petty crimes.  It should be made clear to various scribes who write from time to time, at times freely and at times most inaccurately, on legislation.  It is up to the Government and the Minister to bring in legislation which will have, and be seen to have, the effect of enabling criminals to be brought to trial on evidence and ensuring that there are sufficient penalties.  It is to be hoped that this legislation will deter them from further crimes.</P>
    <P>With regard to the additional powers of detention being given to the Garda, section 3 gives reasonable powers concerning those who have been arrested on possible suspicion of a crime and I quote:</P>
    <P>Where a member of the Garda Síochána arrests without warrant a person whom he, with reasonable cause, suspects of having committed an offence to which this section applies, that person may be taken to a Garda Síochána station and there detained for such period as is authorised by this section if the member of the Garda Síochána in charge of the station at the time of that person's arrival at the station has reasonable grounds for believing that his detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>It provides, firstly, that he can be held for six hours.  In this day of the more educated criminal with great access to legal aid, it is justifiable that a person can be detained for a certain time.  When necessary, if an officer not below the rank of Chief Superintendent directs, a person can be detained for a further six hours. Obviously, the public are concerned about any powers of detention at any <Col N="1301" /> time; there always being the possibility that a person while in detention may suffer some injustice.  People are rightly concerned, but I would hope that with the complaints procedure which the Minister has indicated will come before the passing of this legislation, the ordinary, innocent person &mdash; or even the person who is subsequently found guilty &mdash; will have nothing to fear from any of the new powers contained in this Bill which are reasonable under the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Section 4 provides for a certain amount of notice of access and that notice that a person detained is entitled to a solicitor must be given to the detainee, who must be informed specifically of this right. Where there is a request for another person to be brought to the station on behalf of the detainee, as soon as practicable the person so requested must be informed.  People will thus have adequate access to their solicitors or other people such as their spouses.  It is only right that there should be such access at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>Section 5 deals with the powers of the Garda Síochána in relation to detaining persons.  Most of these are powers which one would commonly expect &mdash; powers of searching, photographing, fingerprinting and forensic testing.  These are necessary powers in the case of people who are suspected of crimes in which there is evidence of fingerprints.  The fingerprints of the suspected person could be compared with fingerprints at the scene of the crime, on a car and so forth.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable that people should be asked for their names and addresses and in the case of an ordinary, basic search, allow themselves to be photographed and fingerprinted.  It is clear from the following section that if the matter does not proceed to trial and does not go ahead all such records will be destroyed, which is most important.  It is also important that the person involved, or his representative, can witness the destroying of these records.  No one would like a file being built up on various people involving photographs, fingerprints and so on.  It is important that people in detention be made aware that they can witness the destruction of such records and it should <Col N="1302" /> be ensured that all the records are destroyed and that there is no possible retention of copies of various records.</P>
    <P>Sections 7 and 8 deal with re-arrest and the extension of the powers in relation to persons in custody under section 30 of the Act of 1939.  It is desirable that people do not walk out of the station and be re-arrested except in the cases provided for, namely, where a person is to be charged immediately, or where an application is made to a district justice. Obviously it is important that after a period of detention a person should not be re-arrested and held for an indefinite period.</P>
    <P>One aspect which is relevant and important today is the question of bail. Reference has been made to crimes which are committed while a person is on bail.  This must be totally deplored.  I am glad that consecutive sentences will be imposed for crimes committed while on bail.  Whether a person is accused of one or ten robberies he tends to end up with the same sentence.  It must be hammered home to would-be criminals that an extra sentence will be imposed for a crime committed while on bail.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the doubling of the District Court sentence from one to two years.  It is relatively easy to get bail and therefore it is important that an extra fine or an extra sentence should be imposed. Obviously a person who is out on bail is awaiting trial.  It is essential that people should turn up for their trials, and cannot buy their way out of facing their trial or a prison sentence on conviction.  Section 11 deals with the failure to surrender to bail or to abscond while on bail.  This will be treated as a separate offence.  If they do not turn up they should have to face the consequences.  Because it is relatively easy to get bail even for quite serious offences, people must be made aware that they cannot get away with absconding or committing another crime while on bail.</P>
    <P>The taking of vehicles without authority is very prevalent.  There have been many instances in Dublin of parked cars being damaged, or interfered with, or stolen for the purpose of robbery or joy-riding. <Col N="1303" /> This offence must be treated very seriously.  People who take cars for unlawful purposes such as robbery or so-called joy-riding are uninsured.  They are a danger to themselves, as we have seen all too often, and to other road users, motorists and pedestrians.  There is little redress for the victims who are injured. We should think of the rights and privileges of victims of various types of crimes. I am glad there are increased penalties for the taking of vehicles without authority. There have been far too many crashes caused by joy-riding.</P>
    <P>Section 13 increases the penalties for certain firearms offences.  Penalties for the unlawful use of firearms are essential. Far too many people are going around with guns for one purpose or another. Most people carrying guns unlawfully have unlawful purposes in mind.  There is a great risk of loss of life if a person is carrying a loaded gun.</P>
    <P>I wonder should this section or another be extended to cover other types of offensive weapons such as flick knives, hatchets, crowbars, hacksaws, and so on. People who carry such offensive weapons are not intent on doing good.  The fact that they are carrying these offensive weapons adds to the possibility of somebody being injured and the possibility of damage to persons or property.  The Minister might consider this between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Sections 14 and 15 deal with withholding information regarding firearms or ammunition and stolen property.  People who have information which could lead to a conviction for serious burglaries or even murders have a duty to give that information to the Garda.  If that information is withheld, a murderer or a robber may go free, or a person who has committed an assault or an attack on somebody else may remain at large.  People who withhold such information should be made aware that they are committing an offence.</P>
    <P>I will move on now to the new trial procedures.  Sections 16, 17 and 18 deal with inferences which may be drawn from what a person has failed to say or has said.  Section 16 provides:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1304" /> (1)  Where in any proceedings against a person for an offence evidence is given that the accused&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  at any time before he was charged with the offence, on being questioned by a member of the Garda Síochána endeavouring to ascertain whether an offence had been committed, or by whom, or</P>
    <P>(b)  when being charged with the offence or informed by a member of the Garda Síochána that he might be prosecuted for it,</P>
    <P>failed to mention any fact relied on in his defence in those proceedings, being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention when so questioned.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Garda have to inform the person in detention of this fact, but if at a later stage the defendant mentions a new fact the jury may draw an inference. Certain conditions will have to be fulfilled before an inference may be drawn by a jury before convicting a person. The most basic point is that a jury will not be convicting on inference alone. There will have to be a proper case made and the accused will be informed of the consequences of not mentioning a certain fact when he was detained.  Mere silence alone will not be a substantial inference in itself.  This is fair in relation to modern day trials.  An inference can be drawn from refusal to account for certain objects or for being present at a specific place at a particular time.</P>
    <P>In relation to trial procedures, there is one measure which I hope will save expense and others which are quite sensible dealing with alibis and majority verdicts. Under sections 20 and 21 proof by way of formal written approval of formal statements may be admitted.  If both sides are agreed it is not necessary to go over every point in oral evidence.  Four or five experts need not be called if they give evidence of the same nature in order to prove a point.  Hopefully, this will ensure that trials will be over more quickly because at present they drag on week in and week out, although there is no disagreement <Col N="1305" /> but every scrap of evidence must be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The prosecution have to serve the book of evidence on the defence at an early date, but at present very little information is given by the defence to the prosecution. Now, provided certain conditions are complied with, notice of an alibi has to be communicated to the prosecution. At present a defendant can introduce an alibi at a moment's notice and this does not give the prosecution any time to produce evidence of a contrary nature.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with majority verdicts. If a juror is taken ill a new trial should not have to be held at further expense. Therefore, if ten out of 12 agree, that should be acceptable.</P>
    <P>The Bill deals with taping and electronic equipment.  The Minister will be making proposals in this area at a later stage.  The taping or videoing of people in detention is a desirable procedure and I hope after a trial period this will be phased in all over the country. Obviously, there will be administrative difficulties and there will be a certain amount of delay.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the complaints procedure to be brought forward shortly.  I hope the Minister will bring this before the House so that it can be discussed.  It is important that people with reservations about the extra powers being granted to the Garda under this Bill should realise that these powers will not come into effect until the complaints procedure has been approved, adopted and examined by this House.  Everybody will be glad of that. That is very desirable because the Minister will want to make sure that additional powers are complemented by additional rights and safeguards.  It is important that part of this complaints procedure be independent.  The people must be able to avail of this procedure when they want to make complaints.  It is important that there is an adequate complaints procedure available where the public can go to have their complaints thoroughly investigated.  The public should not be worried that their rights might be affected.  Therefore, I hope the <Col N="1306" /> Minister will lay the complaints procedure before the House as soon as possible; but, as I said, the powers in the Bill will not take effect until the complaints procedure has been laid before the House, discussed and approved.</P>
    <P>Like the previous speaker, I welcome this Bill, which has been introduced at the time when our crime rates are escalating. Every effort should be made by all members of society to back up the Garda and bring about a reduction in our crime rate.  I would like to pay a tribute to the assistance given by the Garda in my constituency in dealing with people's complaints sympathetically and thoroughly or in relation to various matters not directly related to individuals but more community type problems.  Problems in relation to the escalating crime rate can only be dealt with on a community basis.  There will be no sudden improvement as a result of action by the Minister for Justice, the Government or a group of individuals. Not all the powers of one group will be effective.  The solution lies in the coming together of every group.</P>
    <P>One aspect requiring thorough examination in the area of juvenile crime, now one-third of the total crime rate, is the fact that young people must be given worthwhile opportunities.  We must provide more jobs.  In certain areas work by juvenile liason officers would help.  An extension of such schemes in different areas would be salutary.  Where they operate they have been very effective. Only a limited number of youngsters may be causing the problems.  The same people commit the same crimes and every effort should be made to weed these out and get them to channel their energies in other directions.  Their time should be occupied.  Young people who are not attending school or who have left school should be streamed into the proper channels as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is overdue.  It should act as a deterrent to would-be criminals.  Greater powers of detection may help to reduce the growing crime rate.  That is something we all hope to achieve.  There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to examine the Bill more thoroughly.  I stress again the possibility <Col N="1307" /> of creating special offences in relation to the carrying of flick knives, hatchets, iron bars and so on.  Generally speaking, I welcome the Bill.  It should result in a reduction of crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It does seem this Bill has the support of both sides of the House and it is more than likely it will go through very quickly.  We are all aware of the enormous increase in crime in recent years particularly in local communities and all the problems which arise therefrom, the problem of fear, increased deprivation, lack of services in the area, including police services, stealing cars and burning out shops, community halls, <i>et cetera</i>.  We all realise that something must be done.  Local communities need protection.  Anti-social behaviour has to be ended.  We do not believe this Bill will do that.  We do not believe it is even designed to do that.  It will not solve the major problem.  It has not addressed itself to the problem of juvenile crime.  Vandalism is a major scourge of local communities. The last speaker mentioned juvenile crime in the last few sentences. It was more or less a passing reference. We will be opposing many sections of this Bill, sections which we regard as a deprivation of civil liberties with no real effect on the major upsurge in crime over the last six years or so.</P>
      <P>Many other things must be done.  Many things need to be dealt with before a Bill like this can be effective in regard to crimes like lawlessness and vandalism. The great danger is that the new powers of the Garda could be used to save time, to save trouble, to save the use of other normal police detection methods.  It could, in other words, be a charter for the lazy policeman.  We shall be tabling some amendments therefore in regard to detection, the right to silence, fingerprinting, the drawing of inferences and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We welcome some of the provisions in the Bill.  We welcome the promise of a complaints procedure, which the Minister intends to introduce before the Bill becomes law.  That is very welcome not only from the point of view of the general <Col N="1308" /> public but even from the point of view of the Garda themselves.  Such a procedure is essential if they are to become part of the general public in trying to combat this upsurge in crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>The social background to the major increase in juvenile crime is, first of all, a very rapidly rising young population and an outdated and totally inadequate education system.  Apart from the Department of Justice, the Department of Education is the most backward Department in Government.  Studies have shown that the most aggressive young vandals are the youths who are illiterate.  The fact that they cannot express themselves in an articulate way leads to greater aggression within them. There is also overcrowded housing, which has been increasing in recent years rather than diminishing, the total lack of job opportunities, not just a lack of jobs now, but the total lack of hope of jobs in the future, which makes young people less likely to feel that education is of benefit to them.  Therefore they are more unlikely to advance their education when they see a total lack of hope of jobs in the future.</P>
    <P>Additionally we have in this State an almost total lack of leisure facilities for young people who are deprived of work and who are also deprived of many other facilities in their areas.  There is much talk about the need for education for leisure and so on, talk about what must be done for young people.  There is absolute lack of any facilities for 54,000 people in Blanchardstown, or for 75,000 to 80,000 people in Tallaght, and many other areas which could be named, where such facilities do not exist.  Added to that there is the huge burden of taxation on workers, the enormous increase in prices in recent years in food and clothing.  This in turn leads to a general increase in poverty widespread in the areas in which there is vandalism, lawlessness, car stealing, burnings and so on and where such crimes are increasing fastest.</P>
    <P>One might well contrast such conditions in working class estates all over our cities with the accumulation of enormous wealth by a small, powerful, greedy class in other areas; displaying their riches, <Col N="1309" /> their luxury homes, possibly costing as much as a whole terrace of houses in working class estates.  These will be people who do not encounter any problems of overcrowding at home, whose children can study at home, receive the very best education up to third level. They will have no problem placing their children in jobs because, if they do not run an industry, factory or a big shop or business themselves, possibly their friend with whom they play golf will own a factory, business, be engaged in a profession or whatever.  Therefore they can very easily place their children in jobs either in their own or their friend's business or profession.  Neither have they any problem in providing the best leisure and sport facilities for their children, in their own swimming pools, tennis courts or in their neighbours'.  This great contrast between the deprivation in working class areas and the great wealth in others generates anti-social attitudes amongst those who are deprived.</P>
    <P>There is very little prospect of radical social change taking place to alter the balance between the rich and the poor without a major political upheaval. Therefore, in the immediate short-term, some measures must be taken to reduce the level of vandalism, juvenile crime, call it what you may.  If we are to await some ideas to emanate from the Department of Justice then we shall be grievously disappointed.  That Department is the most backward, outdated, conservative and inept Department in Government. They still operate the old methods, old systems within the Department, maintaining the utmost secrecy amongst one another and those outside.  They have maintained the same legal system, courts system, prisons system, Garda system since the foundation of the State, the result being that the courts, the Garda and the prisons all operate on structures 60 years old and are grinding to a halt. One can see this for oneself.  If one goes down to the courts one will see people wandering around in their wigs and gowns to no purpose whatever, all of the courts clogged up with work, unable to deal with the business of the day.  They all go around like people in a Gilbert and <Col N="1310" /> Sullivan opera chorus, and this in 1983. The Garda are going around chasing young and old, packing the courts with cases; the courts hand out sentences indiscriminately, with no relation between one and the other, totally disregarding the fact that all of the prisons are overcrowded anyway.  Criminals are pushed there but are allowed out in a couple of days.  The Department continues in its old ways, without any new ideas for dealing with the enormous problems encountered.  They produce this Bill for the Minister supposed to deal with all of those problems but it does not deal with any of them.</P>
    <P>However, there have been some signs of new thinking from the Garda &mdash; but not from the Department of Justice.  In the last year or so the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors came up with the idea of community policing and a system under which the Garda could work better with local communities. They put forward some excellent ideas which should have received the widest possible discussion and development. One would have thought that the Minister for Justice would have welcomed such ideas, would have done everything possible to assist the Garda in promoting them within their ranks, through the Department of Justice and so on.  They received no such encouragement from the top; in fact they were knocked from the top.  Properly developed, these ideas could restore the confidence of local communities in the Garda.  It would also give the Garda a new pride in their job.  There would be greater participation, less confrontation, thus improving the quality of life for all.</P>
    <P>There is a clear distinction to be made between two types of crime each of which has grown enormously in the last decade. There are two general types.  I am not a legal person.  I know there are all sorts of distinctions drawn between indictable, non-indictable, and all sorts of things in the courts which I do not understand at all, because some of the non-indictable seem to be far more serious than some of the indictable crimes.  I have never really understood what all that means.  But, in discussing crime, we must take a different <Col N="1311" /> view between, on the one hand, violent, organised crime, sometimes armed crime &mdash; and that would include particularly the large drug rings, drug pushers and so on &mdash; and, on the other hand, anti-social behaviour.  I know that is usually perpetrated against people, against property, both private and public property and so on.  It can be seen generally as anti-social crime or behaviour, mostly on the part of juveniles, which has increased rapidly. That seems to me to be all included in the term &ldquo;crime&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill is designed to deal with the petty, minor crime as well as the major ones.  It appears that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael here today are of the opinion that if one gives the Garda more powers of arrest, detention, detaining people, questioning them more and so on, one will make an impact on both of those types of crime.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It is a measure of Fine Gael's lack of social policy that they are saying that an attack on violent crime will automatically lead to a decrease in anti-social behaviour.  It will not do any such thing but will have the reverse result.  It will lead to an increase in anti-social behaviour.</P>
    <P>I believe that two separate policies are needed, one to defeat armed crime or major, violent crime and the other to contain anti-social behaviour.  To lump the gunman and teenage vandal together is not only a farce but a dangerous policy. It is a short-cut which we in this House should not let any Minister for Justice take.  Some Dublin Garda districts had a 60 per cent or more increase in crime over the past year.  Most of the districts which had this huge increase are newly developing suburbs, many of them without basic transport, recreational facilities and, most importantly, jobs.  Most of the crime reported on the increase by the Garda falls into the category of petty crime.  House-breaking and car stealing are at the top of the list.  Disillusionment amongst adolescents, particularly in so-called better off neighbourhoods, has been growing rapidly with the recession. Schools and homes cannot cope with this and the Garda are left to pick up the <Col N="1312" /> pieces for society.  It is a job which they do not like doing, it is very unrewarding to act as social binmen on streets which are never clean.  Public authority housing estates get more notoriety in this regard than the better off estates.  Social amenities are scarcer there, unemployment is higher, there is overcrowding and, if an estate gets a bad name for crime or bad social conditions, the corporation or county council concerned will put more and more problem families into that area. This escalates the problem and the Garda finish up caught in a trap.  The public are looking for security and the Garda are, therefore, in constant confrontation with teenagers.  As this confrontation develops, you eventually end up with complete polarisation.  The end result is no-go areas which are all over our cities.</P>
    <P>Giving more power to the Garda is not going to help the situation.  Longer questioning or advance notice in relation to alibis or the taking away of the right to remain silent will only aid polarisation in these circumstances, especially if the Garda, even in one case, are seen to abuse their new powers.  Defenceless teenagers, with little leverage in the legal system, could become easy targets for an over-stretched, under-equipped and under-manned police force which we have at present.  The answer lies instead in winding down the state of confrontation between the Garda and teenagers. This can only be done by a youth policy by the central Government implemented locally, giving the Garda a new community relations role.  They already have this role in theory, and new State initiative, showing their interest in these youngsters, would boost morale and give gardaí involved in community relations a credibility which they now lack.  The voluntary agencies with which they now work have been stretched beyond their limits trying to keep up with the growing youth population in urban areas.  Setting up a State youth service, involving among others the Garda, would go a long way towards policing with consent.</P>
    <P>A sudden increase in powers, an urge to get convictions with these powers, would cast the Garda in the worst possible role.  I believe such a course would <Col N="1313" /> be disastrous and I oppose it.  Increased powers could lead to the developments which occurred in the United States. There they have increased powers, arms etc., and they end up with a Hill Street Blues situation where they are fighting with the people outside day and night. We do not want the Garda to end up like that.  Therefore, the Government must face up to their responsibility for economic policies as well as their obligation to launch an immediate youth policy. Strong arm tactics from the Minister for Justice are no substitute for good Government.  Of course strong arm tactics cost nothing whereas proper social and economic policies do.  Money has to be raised but there are areas in which this could be done.  Decisions have to be made to implement such a policy costing so much money.  The Criminal Justice Bill does not cost anything and this is the key to the Minister's thinking.  Instead of tackling major problems which are the cause of the most of this crime the Government simply bring in this Bill to keep us thinking and talking and diverting us from the real problems which exist.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael are determined to solve anti-social behavioural type of crime with the very same Criminal Justice Bill as they would use to solve major and violent crime.  They are deliberately, therefore, confusing these two areas for some reasons of their own.  We insist on a separate analysis of these problems and we call for better policing in urban areas, encompassing a new community relations role for the Garda. However, we believe this role would only be effective in the context of a fully financed youth policy and policing with consensus which is in the interests of the working class.  A strong argument can be made that an unarmed police force needs greater powers to deal with serious, violent armed criminals but that should not include minor offences or juvenile crime. We insist on making this distinction in relation to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The criminal justice system and our laws are predominantly an inheritance from British rule.  Very little changes have been made since the foundation of the State.  The bulk of new criminal law <Col N="1314" /> legislation has been of a repressive character &mdash; for instance, the Offences Against the State Act, 1939, and its various amendments, the Prohibition of Forcible Entry and Occupation Acts, the Emergency Powers Act, the Criminal Law Act, the Criminal Law Jurisdiction Act, etc.  The only notable exception to that general repressive type of legislation was the Criminal Justice Act, 1964, which abolished capital punishment in the majority of cases.  The bulk of criminal prosecutions in the State are still taken under pre-1922 legislation.  The Larceny Act, 1916, the Forgery Act, 1913, the Malicious Damage Act, 1861, the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, the Vagrancy Act 1824, the Dublin Police Act, 1842, the Children Act, 1908 &mdash; all are in everyday use in our courts.  The Legislature, therefore, has abrogated its responsibility to modernise these laws. Of course, they must intervene to strike down some unconstitutional provisions of these Acts.  For instance, in the Vagrancy Act it was found that the loitering with intent clause was unconstitutional.</P>

      <P>I would like to draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that a Second Reading speech is confined to what is in the Bill or to what the Deputy thinks might appropriately be in the Bill.  I must confess that I am not clear which of those categories, if either, the Deputy is dealing with at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am attempting to show the areas of Dáil reform which should have been brought in before such a Bill as this could be effective because of the defects in the present criminal legal system which leads to clogging up of courts, difficulties in interpretation, bringing up to date, etc.  Therefore we believe this Bill now being brought forward will not have any effect in dealing with crime because of the long years of refusal to face up to the need to update all these various property and personal injury criminal Acts.  This Bill is the response of the present Coalition <Col N="1315" /> Government to criminal law and it is pretty obvious that it is aimed primarily at facilitating the interrogation of suspected persons who are held in Garda custody and also at abolishing effectively the right to silence of the accused person. It also increases the jurisdiction of the District Court in sentencing matters.  I believe that this will ensure that our courts will be further overcrowded and our prisons will be further overcrowded with petty criminals.</P>
      <P>The Bill has been described by Professor Kevin Boyle of UCG as &ldquo;creating a most oppressive pre-trial criminal procedure of any democratic country that I now know of&rdquo;.  The Minister disputed this and referred to various other countries where he said they have even worse systems.  He pointed out in his speech that we have an adversarial system, as it is called legally, and continental countries have an accusatorial system.  The Minister seems to be taking sections and pieces from the accusatorial system &mdash; which is very carefully protected and has a very careful system of interrogation under the direction of a magistrate &mdash; bringing it into our adversarial system without any of the protective areas under the jurisdiction of a magistrate and giving the powers which magistrates have in continental countries to the police force here.  That is very dangerous.  The Minister said that you can detain for up to only six hours here, but when he continued his explanatory speech we found that the total detention period could be 20 hours.  A person could be detained at 6 o'clock in the evening, interrogated up to 12 midnight, interrogation stops but he can be held overnight from midnight to 8 o'clock in the morning, a further six-hour period can commence at 8 o'clock in the morning and he can be held in custody until 2 o'clock in the afternoon. He can be held from 6 o'clock one morning to 2 o'clock the following afternoon. Therefore, the period of detention is 20 hours under this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contents of the Bill are for the <Col N="1316" /> most part the demands of the Garda Síochána made on numerous occasions over recent years for more powers.  They have every right to demand more powers and they see the need for more powers in very many areas, but to legislate on such important issues in the absence of a White Paper or any study, statistical or otherwise, as to the effect this Bill will have is dangerously unobjective.  It certainly is not the way in which a Minister should have gone about introducing such a Bill.  There has been much discussion of this during the term of this Government and the previous Government.  We were to have this Bill from Fianna Fáil over a year ago.  During all that discussion why could the Government not have produced a White Paper to put before us so that Deputies in the House and people outside, the general public, the media, everybody, could discuss the ideas before bringing the legislation forward?  Would it not also have been appropriate to ask the Law Reform Commission &mdash; who, we understood, were there for this purpose &mdash; to make proposals to the Government and to take detailed proposals from other interested bodies such as local community groups, tenants' associations and residents' associations, all of whom are very much affected by crime and vandalism, and also from the legal profession, trade unions and any other bodies with either a professional or citizens' interest in the question of criminal justice?  What about the new Joint Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism set up with such a great hurrah about six weeks ago? Where is the credibility of that committee now?  They have only just got started, they have held only two meetings, although it is just two or three months since they were set up.  Can Deputy Gay Mitchell go to that committee now shouting about crime, lawlessness and vandalism when his Minister has totally ignored his committee and what they are doing and brings in a Criminal Justice Bill without any reference to them at all?</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1317" /> The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Malley on Tuesday, 25 October 1983:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann rejects the proposal to close in whole or in part fourteen power stations and calls on the Government to give priority to indigenous fuel in its national energy policy and in particular because of the employment they provide in the midlands and the west, to ensure that the ESB's peat fuel stations are kept fully operative.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the action of the Government in setting up the inquiry to investigate systematically the reasons for the high cost of electricity, notes that the ESB has submitted to Government a five-year Strategic Plan and calls on the Government to have due regard to the social, regional and strategic implications of the use of indigenous fuel in national energy policy when considering this plan.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to have this opportunity to speak to this motion. It is a very definite motion proposing that we reject this call to close the power stations. We have good reasons for doing this.  The Government amendment is very milk and watery.  It rejects our proposals and talks about what might happen if negotiations are entered into.  I listened <Col N="1318" /> to the Minister's speech but he made no case, nor did he give any encouragement whatsoever to the workers about their future.</P>
      <P>I realise why this motion is before us. We all know that the ESB have become the trend setters with regard to salary increases and, in particular, with regard to huge capital expansion.  Possibly the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Energy have told them that they will have to pull up their socks.  It appears that in many cases the powers that be in the ESB have one cure for every ailment and that is to increase the unit cost of electricity.  This, of course, reflects on the Government of the day and on the cost of living.  Apparently, when the ESB were brought to task and told to do something about changing their attitude, their reaction was to make this proposal with regard to these closures. They probably made it in the knowledge that it was a very politically sensitive area.  To my mind it is economic madness and I cannot understand how any board could seriously put forward these proposals. They must be devoid of any national feeling and must have no interest whatsoever in the country's future.  We talk about buying Irish but they must not even have heard about it.</P>
      <P>The Minister was embarrassed and had every reason to be.  He had no case to make, relying very much on the economic aspects.  This shows that the bookkeeping mentality of which we accuse the opposite benches is here very much in evidence. This is a case of balance your books at all costs.  The Minister should not have swallowed the ESB arguments, hook, line and sinker and relied solely on the price per unit.  We were asked to devote ourselves entirely to the economic line.  I am quite prepared to speak about the financial aspects, but must refer also to social and national aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The peat-fired station to which I refer is the one about which I know most &mdash; Allenwood.  It employs 132 people and is not overstaffed, is highly efficient and upstream 300 more people are employed by Bord na Móna.  The ESB and Bord na Móna have proved to be a lifeline for our area and the closure envisaged in two <Col N="1319" /> years' time would have a very frightening effect on that area which is completely dependent on the ESB and Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>In 1950, when this project was first mooted, it gave the depressed area hope and the cooling tower standing out on the flatlands of Kildare was a symbol to many of the new Ireland.  It was a symbol of Irish workers using a national resource and making a success of it.  Recently, private turf production in that area has been revolutionised using new machinery and what is locally referred to as sausage turf is now being used in the ESB station there.  It offers great hopes for the future. This year alone 6.6 kilotonnes, representing 4.7 per cent of the total fuel consumption, has been put into Allenwood by private suppliers.  The closure mentioned would mean 400 or 500 people becoming unemployed and £8 million now circulating in the area would no longer be in circulation.</P>
    <P>This is a very depressed area.  Some years ago Bord na Móna made a film called <i>Inné agus Inniu</i>, showing what they had done years ago in bringing our turf production up to date and giving a future to our bogs.  I want to see this carried through to its natural conclusion so that there will be a future for our cutaway bogs in the next century.  I have high hopes that the work being carried out in agriculture, horticulture and nursery work at Allenwood and Lullymore will come to fruition and that there will also be an amárach for our bogs.  Fears for the future of our bogs and for that industry have been heightened by the closure last year of Irish Sika Limited, which firm used a native fuel.  There are also fears that local firms now employed in engineering and maintenance and the supply of spare parts will lose out if this proposal is accepted.</P>
    <P>It is essential that I dispel one misconception which has been mooted abroad &mdash; that Allenwood is in poor condition, having a limited life.  If it had, this economic euthanasia might have been justified, but this is not so.  Allenwood station is in tip-top condition.  It had a mid-life renewal: it was started in 1974 when the <Col N="1320" /> boilers were refurbished and there was a major overhaul of both turbines in 1981 and 1982.  It is now satisfactory in every way and an independent report confirms that the station is in good condition.  Mr. P.J. Moriarty, the Chief Executive of Bord na Móna told a general meeting there in 1981 that it was good for another 20 years.  The ESB figures show that it is operating efficiently and its general output is 13 per cent above target.  I am confident that if every Government Department were as efficient and in as good condition as Allenwood, there would be no need for this cutback at all.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the supply of turf for the future of this station.  In Ballydermot and Timahoe there is a workforce of 430 people geared specifically to supplying sod peat to our ESB stations.  There is no other domestic outlet for sod peat.  No other area of expansion is open to Bord na Móna, with the exception of a very limited moss peat expansion in that area. Bord na Móna have made the following delivery projections: In 1983 they are prepared to put 135,000 tonnes into Allenwood and will meet that target.  In 1984, 1985 and 1986 the figure will be 120,000 tonnes and in 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1990, 100,000 tonnes.  These are realistic figures projected seven years hence &mdash; much more realistic than the four years that Fine Gael were projecting at their Ard Fheis, I can tell the House. In 1991 the quantities which will be delivered there are yet to be determined.  I believe that by that time supplies from private suppliers will have increased.  The revenue to Bord na Móna from these 135,000 tonnes this year was £3.85 million.</P>
    <P>I come to a subject which is dear to the Minister's heart &mdash; the cost of producing electricity from sod peat.  He asked us to apply ourselves to that matter.  When we speak about the cost of producing electricity from sod peat we must consider three factors &mdash; firstly, the balance of payments at national level; secondly, the cost to the ESB of running the peat stations; and thirdly, the savings to this country if we changed over from sod peat to oil, as probably the board would expect us to do.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1321" /> Regarding the balance of payments, Allenwood and Portarlington stations use 300,000 tonnes of sod peat every year.  If that were replaced by the equivalent amount in oil it would be 91,000 tonnes of oil at £147 a tonne, giving a total of £13.4 million.  The net result would be 600 job losses and £13.4 extra on our balance of payments.  Again we would lose out on both counts nationally. The cost of running Allenwood as a peat burning station where they use 150,000 tonnes of turf at a going rate of £28.50 a tonne amounts to £4.2 million.  If we add in an extra £3 million for wages and maintenance, the cost to the board is £7.2 million a year.  The value of the electricity produced, at 125,000 MW hours at 7.3 pence per unit is £9.1 million, so the profit on running Allenwood station at the point of generation is £2 million a year.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Minister should realise &mdash; and he made no reference to this &mdash; that when we speak about the production of electricity from oil, coal or gas, we must take into account the huge capital cost involved.  The Minister admitted that out of every £1 income the ESB receive, 25p goes towards paying capital costs.  There is no capital cost in Allenwood or Portarlington because the capital cost was paid for many times over. It is written off and there is no capital cost involved.  What would it cost the country if Allenwood were closed and we moved on to generate electricity by oil, or what would it save us?  We use £7.3 million in generating with turf.  An equivalent amount of oil to generate the same amount of electricity would cost £6 million. I am using a unit factor of 59 for turf and 48 for oil.  The saving would be £1.3 million to our economy.  I reckon that the ESB have 1.1 million subscribers.  The saving on the closure of Allenwood would mean every household would be saved approximately £1 in the course of a year.</P>
    <P>I realise that the price of turf increased last year by 32 per cent.  This increase which was granted was sought for many years by Bord na Móna.  Had we been using the old price for turf it would still be cheaper than oil today.  Even as it <Col N="1322" /> stands, the going rate for turf gives us value for money.  I have seen figures quoted that the thermal value of turf for heating the home makes it still the cheapest way of doing it.</P>
    <P>Who could project the likely cost of oil in 1990?  Allenwood and other small stations like it represent only 1.5 per cent of the electricity demand at present and only .7 per cent of ESB capacity.  The impact on our economy would be minimal, but the impact of the closure of these stations colossal.</P>
    <P>The ESB and Bord na Móna should get together and devise a 20 year plan so that we can utilise our bogs properly and be able to diversify and not, as our spokesman said, have all our eggs in one basket.  Small stations enable the ESB to get a balance.  That is why they are called into action more often than the bigger stations.  This will also ensure that there will be a natural end for our bogs in agriculture and horticulture and even in amenity areas.</P>
    <P>The only possible conclusion anyone can come to is that this proposal by the ESB is anti-national.  It is an outrage.  It is devoid of any iota of patriotism, or an awareness of the national difficulties.  We are constantly told from the opposite benches that our priorities should be employment and our balance of payments situation.  This proposal strikes at the very heart of that, and would only add to our difficulties.</P>
    <P>We have control over the price of our peat, whether it be sod or milled.  We have a certain control over the supply and a certain control over the price.  We cannot say the same for coal, whether it comes from Poland or America.  We cannot say the same for oil, because we are at the mercy of what might happen in the Persian Gulf in the morning.  We have not got our own oil yet, although the Minister saw the light at the end of the tunnel recently when he looked out from the Metalman.</P>
    <P>Our motion is needed to bring the ESB and the Government to their senses.  The Government amendment says something about national considerations.  They are paramount in this case.  Allenwood was described by a former Minister for <Col N="1323" /> Finance as a white elephant, but that white elephant has given employment for 33 years.  It would be ironic if another Fine Gael Minister for Finance were to be responsible for its closure.</P>
    <P>The ESB and Bord na Móna should work in tandem on this and continue to do so to the natural end of our bogs.  If a proposal came before us giving employment to 500 people, with a profit of £2 million a year, utilising our national resources, we would all jump at it.  This motion must be accepted to ensure that our peat generating stations and other stations mentioned for closure remain open.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Last week I listened to the contributions from every side of the House. We all seem to agree that, if the ESB's strategic plan is implemented, large areas of the country will be economically devastated. I glanced through the plan during the weekend and there seemed to be two or three themes in it.</P>
      <P>The first is the importance of reducing or maintaining the price of energy or electricity at present levels.  If the only method of doing that is to phase out 15 turf burning stations, the ESB are taking a very narrow view of our problems and difficulties.  If we bring that argument to its logical conclusion, it would be the same as saying we should import all the butter we need from New Zealand or some place else because it is cheaper.</P>
      <P>I want to put it on record that I am opposed to the recommendations in this plan.  The station I am really interested in is in my own constituency, in fact, in my own parish of Gweedore in north-west Donegal.  In 1955 that station was opened.  It is a five megawatt station.  It was not opened because of its massive contribution to the national grid, but because of the social commitment of the Government to putting the station in an economically deprived area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year since the station was opened in 1958 the people of Gweedore have produced between 20,000 and 30,000 tons of hand cut turf.  That has been going <Col N="1324" /> on for 25 years and is a record in itself. They did not depend on machines or modern equipment.  They went out and cut the turf in the traditional way.  So far this year between 15,000 and 20,000 tons of turf have been sent in to the turf burning station in Gweedore.</P>
    <P>Before the station was erected in the middle fifties there was absolutely nothing for the people.  All they could do was take the emigrant ship to Scotland, or England, or other countries.  That was the first major economic input into the area when the ESB built the generating station in Gweedore.  I know 15 stations are mentioned in the strategic plan.  The Gweedore station is unique in a number of ways.  In the first place it is in the heart of an Irish speaking area.  I have attended a number of meetings there.  The turf producers have regular meetings.  I am sure Deputy Gallagher on the other side of the House will bear me out when I say that all discussions and all debates are through the medium of Irish.  I wonder how many of the other stations in various parts of the country could say that.</P>
    <P>Secondly, in the Gweedore station the turf is not provided by Bord na Móna or any other State or semi-State body.  It is provided by over 300 small families.  Husbands, wives and children go out for six months of the year and provide this fuel for the generating station in Gweedore. If the unthinkable were to happen, and if the Government were to implement these recommendations by the ESB &mdash; and I am confident that at the end of the day they will not &mdash; the repercussions in the Gweedore area would be even greater than those in any other part of the country.</P>
    <P>In the other stations the producers are employed by Bord na Móna and the workers in the stations are employed by the ESB.  If the unthinkable were to happen, at least the blow would be cushioned by redundancy payments, pay related payments and so on &mdash; not that we want that to happen.  If the Gweedore station were to close down there would be no redundancy or pay related payments. The income of the 320 Gaeltacht families would be cut off, and they would be <Col N="1325" /> catapulted back to the mid-fifties.  We do not want to go back to those times again.</P>
    <P>The third reason I believe Gweedore is unique is that, unless the people use the land for turf production, there is nothing else they can produce.  It is probably some of the poorest land in this country or in Europe.  If they do not cut turf and send it to the station, there is nothing they can do because the land is not arable.  The people cannot produce crops and I do not think it is good enough to rear stock.  The only other thing they might be able to do would be to rear goats, and we all know the income they would get from that.</P>
    <P>In the mid-fifties the Government at that time, the second Coalition Government, 1954-1957, decided to build this station.  One of the members of that Government, a man from the Rosses like Deputy Gallagher, the late Pa O'Donnell, gave his support and backing for this project and that was sufficient to have this station established there.  Now we have another Coalition Government in power.  If a decision has to be made at the Cabinet table on the turf burning station in Gweedore, I hope this Government will have the same commitment as was seen 25 years ago.</P>
    <P>In our parish there is a hydro-electric generating station which generated in the region of 15 million to 16 million units last year and the peat station in Gweedore generated eight million units.  If we add them I believe the average cost per unit from that area would compare very favourably with the average unit cost of any other station in this country.</P>
    <P>Were this station to close it would be a body blow for the Irish language.  This is the strongest Irish speaking area in this country, but economically it is the weakest area.  Therefore I appeal to the Minister and the Government to throw out these proposals and to tell the ESB that if they want to reduce the cost of energy they must find some other way to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I could do with more <Col N="1326" /> than ten minutes but because of the tremendous interest expressed, particularly by Fianna Fáil Deputies, I will have to make do with ten minutes.</P>
      <P>It is important that we look at this motion which calls on the Government to give priority to indigenous fuels in their national energy policy and in particular because of the employment provided in the Midlands and the West, to ensure that the ESB peat fuel stations are kept fully operative.  This is a very important motion because it refers to a national energy policy and asks for priority for indigenous fuels.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley listed the stations the ESB strategy plan proposes to close and other Deputies have spoken of the damage closures would do to their respective areas.  I will confine most of my remarks to the catastrophic effect the closure of Bellacorick would have on the North Mayo region.  What this semi-State body propose to do flies in the face of various Government Departments, plans and objectives.  What the ESB propose will make a mockery of the import substitution plans of the IDA.  It will make a laughing stock of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. It will make a charade of the &ldquo;Guaranteed Irish&rdquo; symbol with which Irish goods are marked.</P>
      <P>What justification would any Irish Government have in asking the people to buy Irish if a semi-State body could put hundreds and thousands of Irish men out of work and at the same time create employment for American and Australian coal miners?  What benefits would accrue to Ireland from such actions?  If the Government do not heed the pleas from these benches, I hope they will listen to what their own Deputies say about this motion.  How could any Irish Government which agreed to this plan face the Irish people and ask them to buy Irish?  How can this House justify an action that creates wealth in other countries and puts thousands of our people out of work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One thing this move has done is to unite all parties in Mayo.  There have been bitter exchanges in Mayo County Council, but on this one issue the council are fully united.  The headline from <i>The <Col N="1327" /> Western People</i> of 26 October 1983, was &ldquo;Council unites to oppose Bellacorick closure threat&rdquo;.  As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, it is suggested that Bellacorick would be phased out completely.  This is different from most other stations.</P>
    <P>Page 12 of the ESB strategy plan sent shivers through thousands of homes in Ireland.  When one considers the amount of space taken by the ESB's strategy plan which would put thousands of people out of work &mdash; one page &mdash; one wonders how much thought was put into that page. What does this report say of the subsequent results of its suggestions?  What it says is short and sweet, and again I quote: &ldquo;Like the sod peat stations, there will have to be prior discussions with Bord na Móna and the Department of Industry and Energy&rdquo;.  Short and sweet; like the peat stations there will be prior discussions.</P>
    <P>On page 9 of their policy section the ESB strategy plan states: &ldquo;It is their due that the ESB should give the best possible consideration to all human implications...&rdquo; They are talking about their staff.  What consideration have they given to the hundreds of others?  What consideration have they given to the over 500 employed by Bord na Móna in Bellacorick? Where are they going to be reemployed? As Deputy O'Malley pointed out, Bellacorick will be decommissioned completely.  Where then will they redeploy and re-employ the 115 they have there?  They say there will be a policy of no forced redundancy.  So far as Bellacorick is concerned there is no place for the men and women to go.  It is very easy for them to offer them work in another part of the country, but who will buy the houses they will be leaving when the whole north Mayo region will be decimated?</P>
    <P>Bellacorick is a comparatively new station, approximately 20 years old with a minimum of 20 years life left in it.  It is situated in an area away from the rest of the midland region.  In that area Bord na Móna have 20,000 acres of bog in their possession.  If this station is decommissioned the whole network in that area will have to be changed.  Expensive <Col N="1328" /> cabling will have to be provided.  The effect of decommissioning Bellacorick in the north Mayo region will be catastrophic. It will take approximately £3.4 million out of the region, approximately £800,000 of which is paid back to the Government in PAYE and social welfare.</P>
    <P>Prior to 1957 this was a wasteland. There was nothing but high emigration. Now, thanks to Bellacorick and Bord na Móna, it is a thriving prosperous area with industries based on its indigenous fuel, namely, turf.  The towns of Bangor, Ballina, Belmullet, Killala and the area in between will be devastated.  Crossmolina will be devastated because many of the streets in that town are known as the ESB or the Bord na Móna houses.  Where would the people who are employed there get re-employment?  This is a hard working, thrifty, industrious community. The schools in the area are expanding. There are very good community facilities based on community co-operation.  It is a thriving, vibrant community which will become depressed and return again to the wasteland it was in 1957.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Power pointed out, Bellacorick is a valuable section of the midwestern region.  This station is making a profit.  It is about time we nailed the lie that quite a number of these stations are not making a profit.  Bellacorick guarantees a continuous supply to Asahi and when Asahi was being located in this area one of the factors that helped was the fact that Bellacorick was there.  It guarantees 11 megawatts to Asahi of which approximately eight are being used.  Since Asahi came into commission it has also on a number of occasions been the station which, when other stations tripped, supplied power to Asahi.  Asahi power is guaranteed by Bellacorick.</P>
    <P>The people in the area are united as never before.  We will use very means in our power to prevent the closure of what is a viable station, one paying its way and one which for a number of years, including this year, because of the demands on it still cannot get off-load so that its annual overhaul can be done.  This should have been done about three weeks ago. My information is that it will be another <Col N="1329" /> three to four weeks before the annual overhaul can be carried out.  This year Bellacorick will exceed its quota of the 300,000 tons allocated to it.  I understand that up to now over 200,000 tons of turf have been used and in the balance of the year, which is the period when most fuel is used, they will easily use the other 100,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Now it has been suggested that the cost per megawatt from Bellacorick is £32. That is not so.  This is from the peat burning stations.  I think the cost in Bellacorick is less.  That can be proved and I question the validity of the ESB costs when they quote Moneypoint as £18 per megawatt.  My information is that that does not include the interest costs on the various money borrowed for Moneypoint. It only includes the fuel, the wages and the general maintenance.  It does not include any interest costs on the capital sum borrowed.  The cost to Bellacorick has been repaid many, many times over.</P>
    <P>I repeat just one statement I made.  It is made only as a statement, not as a threat.  Mayo will fight to the last breath the closure of Bellacorick.  The council and the community are united in that. That is not a threat.  It is only a statement.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to state to the Minister and to the Government that this Government and this Minister must take a political decision and not accept the proposals in regard to these ESB stations using indigenous fuel.  Failure to take such decision will show, as Deputy O'Malley said, a lack of realisation on the part of the Government of local, regional and national economic levels.  This lack of realisation and insensitivity is synonymous with this Government's lack of interest in rural areas, particularly in the west of Ireland and in my constituency in the north-west.  My colleagues have referred to most of the other stations, so I shall confine my remarks to the station in my constituency, the Gweedore turf burning station built in the early 1950s and commissioned some 25 years ago, against the express wishes and advice of the ESB.  Today the ESB are advising the closure of this same station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1330" /> I am asking the Minister to take the same courageous decision that the late Seán Lemass, the Minister responsible at the time, took when he told the ESB he would not accept their advice when they advised him against the opening of Gweedore. He, as Minister, took the decisions and he took them for sound, social and economic reasons.  He knew the serious unemployment problems of west Donegal and he took this courageous decision and ensured the Gweedore turf burning station was given the go ahead and commissioned some 25 years ago. Prior to that west Donegal was a totally deprived area with no industry whatsoever and the emigrant ships were continuing to carry away the people to Britain and the United States to find employment there in order to provide for their wives and children at home.  Seán Lemass slowed down this emigration in Donegal, particularly in Gweedore and townlands like Bloodyforeland and Meenacladdy, where most of the 28,000 tons of handwon turf came from.  Year after year the people in these areas have won this turf by hand and ensured they never let down the Gweedore turf burning station.  They shall continue to do that for the next 25 years or for as long as it is necessary to ensure that at all times there is available to Gweedore the necessary 28,000 tonnes or more if that should be necessary.</P>
    <P>The Government that were presided over by the late Mr. Seán Lemass, as well as successive Governments, accepted the sound social and economic reasons for the commissioning of the Gweedore station. We may well ask whether this Coalition Government who have no interest in the West have abandoned that policy.  The Gweedore turf-burning station which has a capacity of 5 megawatts supplements the Clady hydro-electric station which has a capacity of four megawatts. It is important to stress that the staff at Gweedore are common to both stations.  In other words if Gweedore is closed, Clady station will be affected also.  Together with the output at Ballyshannon, the nine-megawatts capacity at these two other stations would provide sufficient power for the needs of West Donegal or for the whole of the county <Col N="1331" /> at a time of crisis.  This would mean that there would be sufficient power for the industrial activities of Gweedore and of other parts of West Donegal as well as for the fishing ports of Burtonport and Killybegs.  The Gweedore and Clady schemes connect with the Ballyshannon hydro-electric scheme along the 100-mile KV line thus ensuring maximum voltage in west Donegal.  There are 45 people working in the station and there are 320 contractors involved, making a total of 365 families being provided for as a result of the decision of the late Mr. Lemass in the fifties to commission the project.  Taking an average of four per family we can see that the lives and livelihoods of about 1,500 people in west Donegal are involved.  The contractors are prepared to make available an additional 28,000 tonnes if that should be necessary.  If the Government decide to close these stations they will be taking a decision to close houses in the area because there is no alternative employment there and neither is there emigration so that what the Government would be doing by such a move would be pushing us back into the last century.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that those Members from Donegal who happen to be in the Government party are taking exactly the same line as we are taking in this matter. We will not accept any decision to close the Gweedore station.  As I wish to share my time with Deputy Brennan &mdash; I think there is an arrangement in this regard &mdash; I shall not delay further except to warn the Minister that we in Donegal will oppose vehemently any attempt to close these stations and that every action necessary will be taken by us to prevent their being closed.  I am stating personally that I shall give unequivocally every assistance not only to the workers at the station but to the turf cutters concerned in this matter.  Apart from the people either directly or indirectly involved, we must have regard also to the various ancillary services concerned.  I was very pleased to hear Deputy McGinley's contribution. While I am confining my remarks to Donegal I am hoping that the Minister will take the sensible step of withdrawing <Col N="1332" /> the amendment tabled in his name and not embarrass members of his own party. We in Donegal are totally united on this issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Governments have chosen deliberately to operate a policy of high energy charges.</P>
      <P>The merit of this policy is that it is supposed to yield high revenue to the Exchequer but the serious defect in it is that it costs jobs.  It is pointed out frequently that unemployment is at a high level throughout the EEC.  That is true but why must we be at the top of the unemployment league?  There are many contributing factors to this situation but one of the most crucial arises from the fact that in the past, too many of our industries have failed, as they are failing now and will continue to fail, so long as this policy continues.</P>
      <P>If we are content with the present employment situation, no change is necessary. Likewise if we are content to accept the ridiculous situation whereby in the first instance we spend millions of pounds building electricity generators and then proceed to close them because the energy is too expensive, no action is necessary.  If we are content to see existing energy-intensive industries disappear and potential new ones being frightened away, no action is necessary either. Government Ministers have been saying <i>ad nauseam</i> of late that the Clondalkin Paper Mills cannot be reopened because they would not be viable.  It is not that papermaking of itself is necessarily nonviable. It is an operation that is perfectly viable in Norway, Germany, Canada, and in many other locations but apparently it is only in Ireland that it is nonviable. What brings about this situation? It is the deliberate policy of successive Governments, including the present Government, in maintaining for this country a disastrous policy whereby our energy is the most expensive in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech to the Fine Gael Ard Fheis the Taoiseach said that we must examine our costs with a view to making our goods and services more competitive than is the case in other countries.  It is all very well to say that but it is not what the Government are doing.  In January 1983 our industrial electricity prices were 25 per cent higher than the average in our competitor countries.  Since then our <Col N="1334" /> electricity prices have been increased by a further 10 per cent solely because of charges imposed on the ESB by the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Energy has initiated an inquiry into the high cost of electricity, referred to in his amendment, no doubt a worthwhile exercise but clearly we have 10 per cent of the answer already.  I agree with the Taoiseach when he said that we must make our goods more competitive.  However, as the National Prices Commission pointed out in a recent report, the price of electricity has a significant influence on the competitiveness of Irish industry.  Again, in the same report, it is maintained that the Government now have a powerful influence on Irish energy prices.</P>
    <P>I should like to pose this one question to the Minister and shall await his reply with interest.  When the Government decide, as they did in July last, to increase industrial electricity by a further 10 per cent over and above its already unacceptable level, does anybody in the Minister's Department, or indeed in any Department, do any calculation, carry out any projection, or give any consideration at all to the number of jobs which will be lost in firms which are exposed and utterly sensitive to that very competition referred to by the Taoiseach?  The Government's intention in imposing the increased charges is to raise additional taxation.  What is the real result?  As a direct result of the Government's action yet more firms lose their competitiveness, are forced into liquidation, more workers become unemployed, the import bill goes up and exports are lost.  The firms put into liquidation pay no tax, the workers, instead of paying tax, have to be paid social welfare and the taxable base of the country is reduced.  The ultimate result is less revenue instead of more and maintenance of our position at the top of the European unemployment league.</P>
    <P>There seems to be no integration of policy as between planning for the creation of new jobs and the maintenance of existing jobs and energy-pricing policy. I wonder has anyone ever estimated the number of new jobs that would be created here if our energy prices were competitive? <Col N="1335" /> Has anybody estimated how much better our employment position would have been had our energy prices been competitive?  Has anybody estimated how much additional taxation would have been received by the State from new employment attracted and existing employment preserved, to say nothing of social welfare payments saved?  Is there nobody in the vastness of the public service to carry out that examination and projection?  The policy seems to be to soldier on as before, same policies, no change.  As long as we do that we will continue to head the unemployment league in Europe.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the proposal to close some of the peat-burning stations. I feel such a proposal could not possibly be right.  It could be right perhaps if we did not have peat and had to import it in ships from other countries.  It could perhaps be right if we did not have Irish workers who are ready, willing and able to produce the peat by their labour and supply it to the generating stations.  It could perhaps be right if we did not already have generating stations, built at great expense and capable of turning peat into energy.  We already have the generating stations; they are built and paid for &mdash; well, they are built anyway.  We have the workers to produce the peat and we have the peat in abundance in the ground.  What then is this proposal to make redundant the power workers, the peat workers, and instead pay out foreign currency for oil or coal giving employment in other lands; and coal, let it be said, from outside our shores instead of exploiting our resources at Arigna?</P>
    <P>A key part of the problem arises from the present position in which our capacity to produce energy is massively beyond the actual energy being used.  On existing policies that could not be otherwise.  I made inquiries recently as to how much approximately the ESB bill would be for the Clondalkin Paper Mills if it was in operation.  I was told that the value of the energy they would be using would be approximately £2 million per annum, and that is just one industry.</P>
    <P>Therefore, what have we done here? <Col N="1336" /> If our energy prices were moderate, the Clondalkin Paper Mills and very many firms like it would today be open and viable, they would be using many millions of pounds worth of energy which the ESB has the capacity to produce and people would be working instead of drawing social welfare.  Our competitors in Europe and elsewhere see it differently. They moderate, or even subsidise, their energy costs, with the result that their industries are competitive.  They supply us with things we could make ourselves. Their populations are busily employed making things for us while our population, in increasing numbers, goes on the dole.</P>
    <P>I do not say that our energy prices have to be the cheapest in Europe but I do say this: they do not have to be the most expensive either.  The Minister in his speech referred to the financial problems of the ESB.  They have a financial problem because they are not selling sufficient of their product.  They are not selling sufficient of their product because its price was and is so high that many of the firms that should be using it have gone out of business.  In my view it is time for a radical change of policy on this issue.  It is time we showed some backbone and confidence in our abilities by bringing down our energy prices to competitive levels.</P>
    <P>I want to end on the subject of the tragedy of the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I would leave the Minister with this question: is it not remarkable that hard-nosed Canadian businessmen had confidence enough in the prospects for paper manufacturing in Ireland as to be prepared to sink £1 million of their money in it, yet we ourselves apparently do not have the confidence to take them up on that offer?</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies on both sides of the House who contributed to this debate.  They have demonstrated the very keen interest aroused by the ESB's proposals.  I must emphasise again that these are proposals made by the board and management of ESB on their own initiative and responsibility to deal with a situation of high electricity charges and aimed principally as a part of the overall Strategic Plan &ldquo;to achieve substantial improvement in the price of electricity&rdquo;. It has been the theme of the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Bruton, and of the present Government, that State boards should carry out their responsibilities to the full and manage the organisations entrusted to them by the Oireachtas with competence and effectiveness.  This must be done, it should not need saying, within the ambit of Government policy and where areas of Government policy are impinged on by changes proposed, it is right that Government should decide on such matters.  In this instance, this House has had a good opportunity to make its views known in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The document was sent to the Minister for Industry and Energy with that status, and on that basis.  While it is almost natural to expect that much of the debate and much of the interest of Deputies has focused on that section of the plan which proposes the closure of peat-fired generating stations or indeed stations within their constituencies, I would have to emphasise again that the plan deals with a variety of measures to achieve cost reductions and the much desired reduction in electricity charges.  It needs no reminding from me to the House that there has been widespread adverse comment <Col N="1338" /> by representatives of Irish industry about the competitive impact of these charges relative to the charges for electricity to their competitors abroad.  Of course this must be taken seriously by any Government and indeed by any Minister for Industry and Energy.  I do not have to emphasise, either, that each and every cost where we in Ireland get out of line, is of critical importance to Irish industry, struggling as it now is for its survival, for its competitiveness, and for its long-awaited expansion so as to create employment to absorb not only the queues already unemployed but the young workforce coming to the market. The strategic plan by the ESB deals with voluntary severance for excess manpower which the ESB acknowledge is in the system; with closures of oil and gas-fired generating units as well as of peat-fired units; they deal with improvements in administration, in accounting procedures, in greater control over overheads generally.  The plan also proposes strict limitation on premises development and greater efficiency in a wide variety of operations within the organisation.  All of these, I submit to this House, are praiseworthy objectives, indeed the least that is to be expected from a board charged with handling a difficult situation of reduced electricity demand, electricity charges which are acknowledged to be higher than they should be, and generally bringing their organisation into line with the very great financial and economic difficulties which both they and every other industry in the country face.  What would be the surprise would be not that the ESB have faced these issues and have set out a plan to tackle them, but what would be the surprise and indeed not acceptable to anyone in this House or in this country, in my opinion, would be if they were to fail to do this.</P>
    <P>If there is any message which the Irish economy, which management and labour must grasp above all else, is that each and every cost in the structure of production must be examined, must be slimmed down, and must not be allowed to become endemic or to creep upwards unnecessarily.  As an economy, we have <Col N="1339" /> had more than enough of that.  The ESB have a very extensive and far-reaching organisation in this country, have served the Irish economy well, and in this regard a tribute is due to their boards in the past, to their management and to their staff and workers.  The quality of supply, the availability of supply, the readiness with which supply is brought to the sources where it is needed, and the ability of the ESB's organisation in coping with breakdowns, interruptions, storms and so on, exemplify that the ESB are a very good organisation indeed.  There are few in this country who would dissent from that.  It is equally true, however, that the ESB are now facing a unique situation in their experience; that is, that the demand has for a few years turned down and that the organisation must respond to that, must contain costs, must plan on a different basis than a rising boat on a rising tide for some time, and must keep their head above the financial waters while doing that.  Any view other than that is simply sticking one's head in the sand.  If difficult decisions have to be taken, and changes and adjustments have to be made, then it will be the measure of the ESB's and all other organisations in the country, their efficiency and effectiveness to achieve these changes with the minimum dislocation and the greatest sensitivity to the human factors involved.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the debate in this House focused on the closure of the peat-fired generating stations and indeed very rightly on the consequences for the social and economic life of the areas involved, if this plan, which touches on settled Government policy for the use of peat as an indigenous fuel resource for the generation of electricity were to be implemented in full.  The Minister and the Government must have regard to this Government policy in relation to the use of the valuable indigenous fuel resource which is peat, and to all the factors appertaining to this which I have mentioned. The Government, the Minister for Industry and Energy and myself recognise our responsibilities in regard to these aspects. I am conscious of the role and value of peat as an indigenous fuel source of very <Col N="1340" /> great value to this country, not only in terms of import saving in respect of expensive oil or coal, but in the safety and security of it within our own country, of the 30 years of employment and of considerable underpinning to the regions of this country affected and indeed the degree of prosperity that it brought to these regions and nationally.  The work of Bord na Móna in the decades since the mid-thirties is one of the success stories of this country.  It is more than that, more than a success story; it has been a pioneer, and it has been emulated in other places where peat resources are available.  In more recent years, the Government showed their faith by approving the third programme on which Bord na Móna are now engaged.  And this was done in the face of rising costs, of scarce capital resources, of increasing interest rates at times virtually to crippling proportions, and of very great risks that these ever-increasing costs, fuelled also by a very adverse inflation rate, could push these Bord na Móna projects well beyond budgeted costs.</P>
    <P>That, too, is a problem which this House cannot be unmindful about.  It would be reckless in the extreme not to pay full regard to the need for viability and effectiveness in investment decisions. Economic development, the growth in the national product, the affording of new opportunities for employment, these are one side of the equation with which Government must be concerned; the other side is to achieve this effectively, within economic viability and by not depriving other areas of Government investment or activity by cost overruns, by unviable projects or by non-competitive enterprises.  Very many spokesmen devote much of their comments to the first half of this equation; not as many are equally realistic or pressuring in relation to the second.  I think the times we are in demand that they should be.  The link between Bord na Móna and the ESB very easily illustrates how essential full regard to costs and viability on both sides is.  Bord na Móna have been a major supplier of milled peat and other sod peat into the ESB for many years.  The end <Col N="1341" /> result of this product is electricity produced and sent out from the ESB's stations. The fuel unit cost of that electricity has to be as competitive as possible. Without the revenue provided over the years from its sales to the ESB, it is doubtful if Bord na Móna could have developed and provided the level of employment and the level of development in three national programmes which they have done and which have brought to extensive areas of this country the opportunities for the prosperity which have been afforded, and which will continue to be afforded.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley in this House on 25 October urged that the heads of these boards should be knocked together in order to impress on them the mutual interest they have in effective achievement; I do not think that hard treatment will be necessary; I think the Minister had made the position clear to both boards; neither can be allowed to cannibalise the other.  There is no room either for a soft ride for the one, or for excessive retrenchment by the other save as is justified on hard economic fact and financial analysis, and after that, save in accordance with those areas of Government policy which Government have or will have decreed.  The ESB have a statutory obligation at least to break-even while Bord na Móna are charged by Government with repaying their capital development loans.  Both must be able to fulfil their tasks and both must complement each other in the achievement of their objectives which, in the main, is to produce turf from which will be produced competitive electricity.</P>
    <P>I will touch briefly on the surplus by Bord na Móna in 1982-83.  I understand this is approximately £15.5 million.  I would refer the House to the board's published accounts for the year 1981-82 showing a loss of £5.7 million.  For a considerable period prior to that time, Bord na Móna's prices had fallen substantially out of line with rising energy prices and the board were finding it extremely difficult to make any contribution towards their development programme. I need hardly tell the House that this is a situation, with the rising <Col N="1342" /> costs and high capital servicing costs to which I adverted earlier, it would be very foolhardy to allow to continue.  It may well be the case that Bord na Móna's prices could profit from an in-depth review so that equity as between the prices for one, and the costs, relative to other fuel unit costs for the other, can be redetermined.  The Minister has set this in train by way of letters to both boards.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, the Minister and myself have continued the private bog development scheme which has produced over 300,000 tonnes of good quality turf each year.  This is a simple scheme, administered progressively by Bord na Móna themselves on behalf of the Minister for Industry and Energy, and with the minimum of red tape.  The scheme has had a favourable response and results are encouraging.  This, too, is a valuable addition to local and regional income and a valuable contribution to the energy resources, blocking off, as it must, other mainly imported fuels.</P>
    <P>Specific stations have been mentioned by several Deputies in the course of the debate.  For instance, Deputy Power tonight was concerned about Allenwood; Deputy Calleary was concerned about Bellacorick.  Deputies McGinley and Gallagher were worried about Gweedore. All I can do in the context of their concern is to assure the House that the case pleaded for the various peat-burning stations will be examined under a number of criteria with the greatest care and consideration.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy looks at the first paragraph of my speech he might be enlightened.  Deputies will have seen <Col N="1343" /> the details of the ESB's proposals in their strategic plan which has been placed in the Library of the House for information. That report had, of course, come to the Minister for Industry and Energy as a submission from the ESB and found its way, not by the Minister's devices, at a very early stage, into the hands of the public, well before departmental consideration or indeed consideration of it had been completed.  Deputy Kenny in his contribution suggested that the price of milled peat by Bord na Móna to the ESB should be reduced.  As I said, a full analysis must be made and then decisions can be taken.  In the case of the very small sod peat stations, there are very many local factors which the Minister for Industry and Energy will have looked at and will take into account.  Deputy John O'Leary went far to impress many of these on this House and it is a useful reminder to have such local concerns so ably put before the House.  Deputy Enright rightly asked that due regard be had to the national bill for imported alternative fuels.  I can assure the Deputy that that too will be a consideration for the Minister.</P>
      <P>I was impressed tonight with Deputy Taylor's intervention.  He had one major point.  I noticed his criticism of the ESB plan but the criteria which the Deputy has adopted, that of cost-competitiveness, is correct.</P>

Before decisions are taken, the Government will have regard to and take account of the full implications, not only for the two semi-State companies concerned but for the wider social, regional and strategic implications.  The amendment to the motion as moved by the Minister commits <Col N="1344" /> the Government to this line of action and I would strongly urge the House to support it.  I want to thank Deputies for their very constructive contributions to this debate.</P>

      <P>In the almost 16 years that I am in this House I never saw so much interest in a Private Members' Motion.  There are 12 more Fianna Fáil Deputies who wish to speak and, in spite of this being taken into a second week, there is no opportunity.  I requested some weeks ago that this be taken in Government time and it is a great pity that it was not.  We have heard 15 speeches in the course of this debate and, apart from the Minister and Minister of State who were somewhat inconclusive about the attitude they took and also Deputy Taylor who seemed to be backing both sides, Deputies from every side of the House were unanimous in their view that the proposals in this strategic plan of the ESB are totally unacceptable on innumerable grounds and not just local or parochial grounds.  It has been made clear by virtually every speaker that from a national point of view this whole set of proposals is absolutely unacceptable and ridiculous. For example, I made points on the second last night about the attitudes taken by other countries to their indigenous sources of energy, the degree of support they give them and how they would look on us as crazy even to contemplate what we are doing now.</P>
      <P>The ESB have made a very serious error in putting forward this plan.  I have read it carefully and I have not time in the less than 15 minutes at my disposal to go through it all.  It should be debated here in the House in full in Government time.  It is a plan about which one would wish to say a great deal.  All I am in a position to say about it now is that its proposals in relation to generating capacity and the closure of 14 power stations are&mdash;as I think Deputy Calleary mentioned tonight&mdash;contained in one page out of 33 and the remainder of it is couched in a way that makes it appear that the good name etc. of the ESB are paramount.  The one page which does all the damage has virtually no commentary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1345" /> Everything else in it is argued at some length and in some detail.  No justification is given in the plan for the widespread closures that were talked about, whereas several pages are given to saying, for example, that we will not build offices as elaborate as we did in the past. I would jolly well think that they ought not to.  In my own city they had a prime office in the very centre of the city and they went off and spent something between £1 million and £2 million on the purchase and rebuilding of an office in a far less suitable place from any point of view.  That kind of thing has been repeated throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I went through the Minister's speech in the Official Report for last week in order that when replying to it I could deal with matters where I disagreed with him.  I find that he said on no less than seven occasions that he agreed with me.  Therefore, unhappily, I have not very much that I can reply to in that respect because he and I are very much <i>ad idem</i> on this matter and therefore, I suggest that he and his followers support the motion that we put down in order to ensure that these stations will not be closed and not to echo the Minister's own words when he said, finishing up rather lamely;</P>
    <P>I believe the proposal put forward by the Opposition would clearly restrict the freedom of the Government, the ESB and the other boards to do their job.</P>
    <P>Certainly if it is passed it would restrict their freedom to carry on in the lunatic fashion which they propose in this plan to do.  I invite Deputies on all sides of this House to ensure that that freedom is restricted, to copperfasten that, and they can do that here tonight by supporting the motion.  Every Deputy who has spoken has spoken in favour of it.  That again must be unique in this House.</P>
    <P>I would like to make one point in relation to the Minister's speech of Tuesday, 25 October 1983, as recorded in the Official Report, Volume 345, column 684. Referring to Moneypoint he said:</P>
    <P>As far as phase three, which Deputy O'Malley said the ESB have started, is <Col N="1346" /> concerned, the Deputy might have mentioned that on 28 March 1980 the late Mr. George Colley, who was then Minister for Energy, gave full approval for the third coal-fired 300 megawatt generating unit at Moneypoint, subject to the condition that it would be dual-firing and would be capable, like the other two units, of operating on oil if circumstances so required.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on that because the implication in that to people who do not know the situation might be that the late Deputy Colley as Minister for Energy gave an irrevocable direction to the ESB to go ahead and build that third unit of that power station, the one that in effect was causing the 14 closures that we are debating here tonight.  That is not the case.  He simply indicated to them, as I did many times in respect of many projects in the four years prior to that, that he had no objection to their building it if they thought it appropriate and economic to do it.  I recall in 1979 giving the go-ahead on the same basis to the ESB to build another power station at Arigna in Counties Leitrim-Roscommon, a new 45 MW station to come on stream in the mid-eighties to replace the 15 MW stations which would close, it was anticipated, about 1987.  However, the ESB have chosen not to do that.  I could not compel them to do it and the present Minister does not seem willing to compel them to do it.  The situation is a great deal worse than that.  Not alone is the new 45 MW station at Arigna to burn the crow coal not to come on stream but the existing 15 MW station is to be closed down within the next 12 months, and four years of reasonably good quality coal at the existing mine at Arigna is to be left there and nobody is ever going to re-open that mine for the sake of four years' production. It is crazy to contemplate not burning that coal and the truth is that that coal will have to be burned and the station will have to be kept open for as long as that mine has coal in it.</P>
    <P>In the same way we must ensure by our vote on the motion tonight that the various other stations&mdash;turf-fired and some oil-fired also which may well be burning <Col N="1347" /> indigenous fuel in the very near future&mdash; will be left open also.  Therefore, it is misleading to say that Deputy Colley gave such a direction or that the ESB had no option in the matter.  They had every option and they have chosen not to go on with another coal station.  I also approved various small hydro schemes in my time and they went ahead and built one at O'Brien's Bridge between Tipperary and Clare.  I approved their erecting and operating wind generators and I do not think they bothered to go on with any of those because they did not consider it appropriate.  However, in spite of the very arguments that are made successively in this document of theirs, they have gone on with the building of the third unit at Moneypoint.  They started to build it in 1982 when it was clear that there was an enormous downturn in demand but have ploughed ahead regardless ever since and the cost of that decision, that policy which they have insisted on implementing, is the 14 stations that we are talking about here, the many people involved in that, the many people involved in Bord na Móna and the many non-Bord na Móna turf producers along the west coast who will be equally affected.</P>
    <P>One of the interesting points in the Minister's speech on the first night of the debate was that capital and interest repayments are now costing the ESB 25 per cent of their revenue, which is a startlingly high figure and has shown a big increase in recent years because of the very heavy capital development which they have gone into and the fact that they have borrowed nearly all the money abroad.  The devaluation of the Irish currency over the last year or so has also added enormously to their costs.  Still they plough ahead, in spite of statements of their own, as on page 7 of their document:</P>
    <P>Foreign borrowings will continue to be expensive and will expose ESB to high currency risk, particularly as there is a large capital programme to be financed up to 1988 and major refinancing operations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1348" /> Unless ESB succeeds in getting the price of electricity more in line with European levels and perceived as better value for money than at present, there will be an increasing tendency for industry to use natural gas or to develop combined heat and power systems. The unfavourable price situation of electricity will expose it to tougher competition from other energies in the commercial and domestic markets also.</P>
    <P>They make there the very points which I made the last night&mdash;although, of course, I had not seen this document then because it had not been published&mdash;that by continuing with huge capital expenditure they are driving their own costs up. It is not going to cost them anything to keep Allenwood, Rhode, Ferbane, Portarlington, Arigna, Gweedore, Cahirciveen, Miltown Malbay, and all the rest open.  That is not costing anything.  They are not alone paid for, but are written off in the accounts of the ESB.  However, the programme of construction of a third unit of a very large station which is going to use imported fuel is driving up the costs enormously.  That is because it is being paid for with foreign money and will burn foreign fuel when we are leaving hundreds of square miles of bog unutilised. That is something which this House cannot tolerate as representatives of the Irish people, because the people will not tolerate such foolishness.</P>
    <P>It is bad enough that in these circumstances phase 3 of the Moneypoint project should be going ahead.  It is perfectly feasible for the ESB to put a stop to it now, if they so choose.  They put out the usual story that semi-State bodies do in these circumstances, that they have gone beyond the point of no return.  One of the biggest mistakes I made in my life was not to tell a semi-State body that it might have gone beyond the point of no return but that it had better stop.  Had I done so, I would have saved this country almost £100 million.  The situation is not at all as advanced as the ESB give people reason to believe, in respect of phase 3. What is more disturbing and what the House will not be aware of&mdash;and perhaps <Col N="1349" /> the Minister also because these matters tend to be concealed&mdash;is that as well as phase 3 going ahead the ESB have already built the foundations for phase 4 of Moneypoint, which is the part that will bring it up to 1,200 MW.</P>
    <P>There is little future for the smaller generating stations scattered around Ireland using Irish natural resources and indigenous fuel if the ESB are allowed to get away with both of these phases.  The whole point of phasing Moneypoint in four phases was that if there was an economic downturn, then we could stop.  We did not have to commit £300 million extra for each of these phases.  They need not go ahead.  As we all know, there was a serious economic downturn in 1980 and it has continued ever since, but apparently the ESB choose totally to ignore that and do at a great cost.</P>
    <P>When economists and financial correspondents have had the opportunity of analysing this document, they certainly will have no great difficulty in tearing it apart and showing that it cannot and does not stand up.  It is a very weak production. I would like to express my thanks to the Minister for deciding finally to publish it officially after the debate here last week, because it strengthens very greatly, in the eyes of anybody who has read it, the case that I and many Members of this House have made over the last three nights: that this programme of closures should not be proceeded with and that we should give priority to the sources of energy which we ourselves have.</P>
    <P>The ESB have been fundamentally <Col N="1350" /> wrong in the past.  Deputy Gallagher reminded us tonight that it was the late Deputy Seán Lemass, when Minister for Industry and Commerce, who told the ESB in 1958 &ldquo;You go ahead with the use of turf in this country to generate electricity&rdquo;. They told him that they would not and he said to them &ldquo;All right, I will fire the lot of you&rdquo;.  They went ahead in those circumstances and can anyone say that Seán Lemass was wrong in that? Remember, it was only four years ago that we thanked God for the fact that 22 per cent of our electricity at that time was generated from peat, because if we had not had that source of energy this country would not have had power cuts every few days as we had, we would have had power cuts which would have lasted for a few days at the time all over the country, and the country would have come totally to its knees.  I am sure that the ESB are equally wrong on this occasion, and the House has an opportunity now to show that.  I know the whole House feels this. Let us go through the lobbies now and demonstrate it and put an end to this lunacy by the ESB for all time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already indicated to the House a number of the reform measures to be introduced or already under way. The House recently had the opportunity of debating one of the most important of those reforms when it approved the motion to recommend Michael Mills for appointment as Ombudsman.  I hope to introduce legislation in due course to give the reforms a statutory basis where this is necessary.  Meanwhile, I am considering the publication of a White Paper on the subject.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose to make a lengthy statement.  The following are, in brief, some of the main changes to be made.</P>
      <P>(1)  A system of management which will make individuals at middle and senior level more accountable for the results they are to acheive and the costs they incur in acheiving them is being introduced in my own Department as a prelude to its more widespread introduction.</P>
      <P>(2)  The programme of major restructuring of Departments to make separate organisational provision for the distinct roles of assisting the Minister in policy development and overall management, on the one hand, and managing and delivering services to the citizen on a day-to-day basis, on the other hand, will be brought to completion quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(3)  The use of information technology will be extended to become an <Col N="1171" /> integral part of management in all areas.</P>
    <P>(4)  The method of selection of top managers in the civil service is under review.</P>
    <P>(5)  Hand-in-hand with those improvements will be an intensified programme of management training, with emphasis on training in accountable management and information technology.</P>
    <P>(6)  Contacts of individual citizens with the administration will be made easier, more pleasant and more effective. In particular, public offices will be changed to get rid of the &ldquo;hatch&rdquo; system as far as possible.  Staff dealing with the public will be specially trained and will wear identification badges. Officials signing letters to the public will have their name typed below their signature.</P>
    <P>(7)  The reduction of the size of the public service, which has already started, will continue as a result of improvements in efficiency and effectiveness. To date, a restriction on the filling of vacancies has been the main weapon in achieving this reduction but this will soon be underpinned by a systematic and comprehensive programme of reviews.</P>

      <P>The arrangements introduced on 30 June 1983 in relation to CIE still apply. They include a requirement for the board to reduce CIE's annual expenditure in real terms by 12 per cent over a five year period commencing in 1984 and with the 1983 outturn as the base.  This will call for a reduction of about 2½ per cent in expenditure over each of the five years.</P>
      <P>The board have assured me that the projected deficit for 1983 will not be greater than £104 million which, if achieved, will be £5 million less than last year.  This will be the first time in 15 years that the deficit will have reduced.</P>
      <P>I have told the board that this trend must continue in 1984 and beyond and that money outside the June formula will not be forthcoming.</P>

      <P>An extensive range of inpatient and outpatient treatment facilities is available through the psychiatric services for persons, including young people, suffering from alcoholism.  Increasingly, services are being provided on an outpatient basis within the community thus reducing the demand and need for inpatient services. It would be my intention that the treatment services, which would involve preventive strategies, should continue to develop along these lines.  In addition, the Health Education Bureau have recently launched a special alcohol education programme for second level schools.  The aim of the programme is to develop a responsible attitude in young people to the use of alcohol.  The programme is designed to be used in the first four years of second level education and the bureau, with the co-operation of the Department of Education, has trained a core group of teachers to implement it in their schools.  These teachers are also available to train other teachers in the use of the programme.</P>
      <P>The bureau have also devised an integrated programme of health education materials for use up to intermediate certificate level in second level schools. Substance abuse, which includes alcohol, is one of the subjects in this programme.</P>

      <P>When the means of a fisherman are being assessed for unemployment assistance purposes his profits from fishing are assessed on a yearly basis after allowance has been made for expenses and for good and bad periods.  In addition it is provided in section 146(1) (b) (xi) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 that where the fishing is seasonal half of the first £120 annual profit and one-third of any profits between £120 and £300 can be disregarded in the assessment of his means.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the social welfare system where equal treatment for men and women in accordance with the terms of the EEC Directive is not yet observed relate particularly to the entitlements of married women.  A lower rate of unemployment benefit, disability benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefit is payable to married women, other than married women who are supporting invalided husbands or who are living apart from and not being supported by their husbands.  Further inequalities in the case of such married women are that the duration of payment of unemployment benefit is limited to 312 days as against 390 days generally and the conditions under which they can qualify for unemployment assistance are more restrictive than those applied to other claimants.</P>

      <P>The insurability position under the Social Welfare Acts of the employment of a number of part-time employees of the firm mentioned is at present being examined by the Department.</P>
      <P>Prior to 6 April 1979, part-time employees such as those to whom the Deputy's question refers, who were employed for the purposes of an employer's trade or business, were insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, irrespective of the duration of the employment or of the amount of the remuneration.</P>
      <P>As from 6 April 1979, the date of the introduction of the PRSI contribution scheme, employees who</P>
      <P>(i)  work for 18 hours a week or more, or</P>
      <P>(ii)  work for less than 18 hours but are mainly dependent for their livelihood on the earnings from the employment</P>
      <P>are insurable for all benefits (Class A rate).  An employee who works for less than 18 hours a week and who is not so dependent is insurable for occupational injury benefit only (Class J rate).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The current examination by the Department has found that Class A rates of contributions were being paid in error in respect of a number of part-time employees who worked for less than 18 hours a week and who were not mainly dependent for their livelihoods on the earnings from this employment.  The correct contribution rate in these cases is Class J and arrangements are in progress to have the necessary adjustments made on the records and the appropriate refunds made to the employer and the employees concerned.  If the employer or employee disagrees with the decision in <Col N="1234" /> any specific case he/she may appeal against it.</P>
    <P>There are no circumstance in which contributions incorrectly paid at Class A rate of contribution may remain to an employee's credit and be reckoned for payment of benefits.</P>
    <P>Any employee who has previously been compulsorily insured for benefits which include contributory old age, retirement and widow's pensions and deserted wife's benefit, may, subject to prescribed conditions, preserve their rights to these pensions and benefit by payment of contributions on a voluntary basis.</P>
