      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That, in the case of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1983, and notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  the proceedings on the motion for the second reading and on the amendment thereto and on the motion naming the day for Committee Stage, if not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 5 p.m. on Thursday, 30 June 1983, by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively the Questions necessary to bring them to a conclusion; and that the Minister for the Environment shall be called on not later than 4.30 p.m. to conclude the debate; and</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(ii)  the proceedings on the Committee, Fourth and Fifth Stages, if <Col N="977" /> not previously concluded, shall be brought to a conclusion at 10.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 July 1983, by one Question, which shall be put from the Chair, and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>I move this motion with great reluctance. I do not like to have to resort to this procedure because it is not the ideal way of doing business.  However, it was necessary because we failed to reach agreement and the Government decided the Bill must go through because it is urgent.  I tried during the course of the week to allocate sufficient time for the Second Stage debate and I am allocating all next Tuesday for the Committee and remaining Stages.  It has been long established practice that the Whips meet and agree business.  Since I became Whip I found this practice extremely useful and I got nothing but the greatest co-operation from the Opposition Whip.  Unfortunately we had to depart from that arrangement on this occasion but I hope we can return to fruitful discussions on the conclusion of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is this agreed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The Ceann Comhairle asked if this was agreed but he knows the answer.  It is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The point I made on Tuesday was that, unfortunately, a last minute decision was made by the Government to force this Bill through this House.  There was no real need for the Minister and his Minister of State to put this Bill through before the summer recess.  We had indicated in informal discussions on legislation, which always take place, that perhaps we would agree to the Second Stage being taken, but the Government were not interested in our agreement last Tuesday and proceeded to debate the Bill.  We made our arguments on that day and our spokesman, Deputy Molloy, clearly outlined our objections, as did the speakers who followed him.  Obviously, even less attention was paid to their objections than <Col N="978" /> there was to our reasons for not wanting the Bill to be discussed this session.</P>
      <P>The Government have now decided to guillotine the Second Stage today and, unbelievably, to put the Committee and remaining Stages through in six hours next Tuesday.  This is a major Bill to which the Opposition have listed their objections over a number of weeks.  We have gone to the Minister and his Minister of State and repeatedly to the Whip's office to make our objections in advance of the Bill being brought into the House, and all that has been ignored.  It is obvious that we are being treated unfairly and shabbily.  We have more than 40 speakers remaining.  We cannot be accused of filibustering because the longest speech on this Bill so far was by Deputy Skelly who filibustered for two-and-a-half hours.  We called for quorums on the first day to object to the way this Bill was pushed through, but we did not continue that tactic yesterday.</P>
      <P>May I say to the Government Chief Whip, who is a co-operative person, that I have no option but to continue a policy of non-co-operation for the remainder of the session.  Like him, I do not like that. We have not yet seen the other legislation the Government mentioned.  I assume they are speaking of the Fisheries Bill and the Turf Bill but they have not been circulated.  We are told the Government wish to go into recess tomorrow week. We wish to have an Adjournment Debate, which has been threatened if we do not agree to this motion.  This is totally unreasonable and goes against the precedents established in this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last guillotine motion in this House was moved by the last Coalition Government in December 1981.  At no time in recent years have Fianna Fáil used this tactic.  Last year we continued business for two weeks when the then Opposition, the present Government, were in Galway wasting their time, to allow adequate time for debate and ended up putting in Government speaker after Government speaker.  We did this to avoid using the guillotine.  This Government would not even do that.  As I said, we have more than 40 people who genuinely want to contribute to this debate and they are <Col N="979" /> being denied that opportunity.  We are being denied the opportunity to deal with legislation in a proper way on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The committees, which the Government accused us for so long of not taking part in, now cannot proceed because there will be no agreement from us.  All-party committees cannot be set up in this session without the agreement of the Opposition.  The fault lies solely with the Taoiseach because he tried to put through a guillotine motion.  He can answer to the marital groups and to all the other groups with whom we have co-operated to bring in all-party committees. If guillotine motions are used to bring forward legislation and unfairly treat the Opposition then the Opposition have no alternative but to treat the Government in the same way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This guillotine motion makes another massive dent in this Government's credibility, in their general credibility as a Government but particularly their bona fides on the issue of Dáil reform.  We are dealing here with one of the most spiteful pieces of legislation this Dáil has even seen.  Not alone do the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste want to bring forward a mean, debasing piece of legislation but they now want to railroad it through the Oireachtas.  In order to do that they are prepared to set at risk all the work that has been done so far on the establishment of committees and everything that has so far been agreed in regard to Dáil reform.</P>
      <P>I have never, in my time in this House, seen political animus brought to such an extent.  I do not think anybody in the country believes that this piece of legislation is being brought forward for the benefit and the improvement of the planning process.  It is a dirty piece of legislation. It is a mean, debasing piece of legislation.  It has no motivation except party political vindictiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleagues on this side of the House have outlined the various defficiencies there are in the measure &mdash; the fact that it will not improve the planning process in any way, the fact that it is grossly unfair <Col N="980" /> to a large number of decent honourable people.  All these criticisms have been made from this side of the House.  Nevertheless the Government persist and we are totally convinced that they are persisting with this simply on the basis of the lowest party, partisan, political objectives.</P>
    <P>We on this side of the House are very worried about the attitude of the Government in this regard from a number of points of view.  I will mention one of them.  In discussions with the Minister for Industry and Energy we agreed to the setting up of a new committee to deal with legislation.  We are not totally convinced of the merits of that committee or that it is any way a very valuable initiative or departure.  Nevertheless, we, being reasonable parliamentarians, felt that if the Minister concerned was very keen on it and thought there was some merit in it, we would at least give it a trial.  We were very concerned about one aspect of it and I mentioned this to the Minister for Industry and Energy on a number of occasions.  That was that the legislation coming before this House, which, in the normal course of events, would be fully debated here in open forum with the press and the public present, can be referred to this new committee by a motion of a member of the Government. We were prepared to agree to that on condition that that would be done by agreement.  Finally, we came to an informal arrangement or understanding that that agreement would be on the basis of the sort of agreement which normally prevails in regard to the ordering of business here in the House.  In view of this development today, the fact that the Government in order to pursue their own base political objectives are prepared to throw out the normal procedures of agreement, I am not prepared to participate in that particular committee at any rate until this question of whether or not legislation can be referred to it by agreement is straightened out.  That is the sort of thing that has been put in jeopardy by the Government in bringing forward this guillotine motion.</P>
    <P>Our Chief Whip has pointed out that we are not filibustering this piece of legislation. <Col N="981" /> I want to remind the House that on the last occasion we had a major piece of planning legislation before the House we spent I think 11 days on the Committee Stage and Deputy Jim Tully, who was Minister for Local Government at the time, went through that Bill line by line, section by section, in Committee and on Report Stage.  He dealt with every argument we put up.  He listened to our arguments and accepted some of them, made changes and so on.  Eventually we got a Planning Act.  This Government and this Labour Minister want to put through a Bill on Committee Stage in four or five hours.  I want to attack the Tánaiste's bona fides in doing that.  I cannot accept that he has the planning process and its improvement genuinely at heart if he wants to put a major Planning Bill through this House in a five hour Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>That is one of the reasons we are opposing this guillotine motion.  We cannot see that any useful public purpose will be met by proceeding with what is now proposed.  Our Whip has pointed that we have 40 speakers anxious to contribute. I can think of very few things that we talk about in this House, apart from taxation, which more basically affects the ordinary everyday lives of our people than physical planning and the environment. It affects practically every aspect of the daily life of a citizen &mdash; the type of house he lives in, the type of estates we are going to build, where our schools are situated, the traffic system.  These are all clearly bound up in the question of physical planning.</P>
    <P>This business of physical planning and our environment is essentially a social matter.  Because it is a social matter it must be a political matter.  We totally reject this idea of depoliticising the planning process.  The attempt in this Bill is apparently to hand over this fundamentally important social matter to unknown, unrepresentative, self-appointed groups and to take it away from us, the representatives of the people, whether in this House or at local level.  The whole process is a fraud and we are totally opposed to the Bill.  We are certainly opposed to this undemocratic jackboot attempt to <Col N="982" /> railroad it through this House in this manner. I find it very hypocritical on the part of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste to be prating and preaching about Dáil reform and making this House more relevant and involving Dáil Deputies more closely in the whole parliamentary process, in the Government and the executive function, when they do this sort of thing.  I ask them, even at this late stage to understand, realise, acknowledge and admit that they have made a major mistake in the matter, that they have done it out of a fit of pique.  The story around this House is that the procedures were generally agreed between the Tánaiste, his Minister of State, the Whips and others that this matter could be left over and dealt with more fully and comprehensively when we resumed.  However, in some fit of pique the Taoiseach personally intervened and decided that this Bill must be railroaded through before we rise for the summer.</P>
    <P>While I am on that subject, I would like to make some comments on something which a political commentator stated in one of our national dailies this morning.  He said that the Government are going to drop the axe, the guillotine on this Bill and that they are prepared to keep on dropping it until such time as they get all their legislation through before the summer recess.  Perhaps we should make the situation clearer in that regard.  This really is the only legislation which the Government have on hands. The rest are of importance, but are not going to cause anybody any difficulty.  We are prepared to let them through this House in an hour.  There are only two other pieces of legislation on hands.  One is the Bill dealing with the flags of convenience &mdash; the fisheries Bill and the other is a turf Bill to increase the amount of capital available to Bord na Móna. They are two important measures, admittedly, but two measures which we are going to give the Government without any hesitation.  Wherever that story came from, the impression conveyed that the Government are anxious to get some whole legislative programme through before the summer recess is absolute rubbish. It is a long time since any Government <Col N="983" /> of this House approached the summer recess with less legislation on hands. In fact, the only legislation on hands is this loathsome piece of politically motivated legislation to try to assert some mean, vindictive party political policy.</P>
    <P>We are totally opposed to this guillotine motion, just as we are opposed to the unworthy legislation which it hopes to implement.  We propose to oppose both to the greatest extent possible which the Rules of Order and the Chair will permit, because we see them as unworthy of any Government.</P>

We will press this motion to a division now because it is there and we must get it through and be in a position to ensure that the legislation goes through the House.  When it has been passed, I shall ask our Chief Whip to talk with the Chief Whip on the other side.  If the Opposition feel that the two Bills in question, the turf and the fisheries Bills, can be put through in a relatively short space of time on Wednesday and <Col N="984" /> still leave time for the Adjournment Debate, which the Opposition wish to have, we could put down a further motion to allow more time for Committee Stage on Wednesday.  That is something which we can only deal with when this motion has gone through and the position is clear.  Within the limits of what is possible, we wish to accommodate the Opposition in that respect.</P>

      <P>I am reluctant to intervene in this temporary fall-out over the cosy arrangement which has been proceeding in this House since I came into it.  This is a guillotine motion.  I had not witnessed such a motion before, but it does not seem to be much different, from our viewpoint, from what has occurred on various Bills over the past number of months when, by agreement of the Whips, a guillotine was put on the debate either on Second Stage or on Committee Stage, or both.  On the Postal and Telecommunications Bill, which is very major legislation, only two-and-a-half days were afforded on Committee Stage.  However, while I believe that ample time has been given for discussion on Second Stage of this Bill, the time allowed on Committee and other Stages is quite unreasonable.</P>

      <P>It has the appearance <Col N="985" /> of being a day but, in fact, on Tuesday the House does not sit until 2.30 p.m. and Question Time continues until 3.30 p.m.  Then there is Private Members' Time for an hour-and-a-half, which leaves about five- or five-and-a-half hours.</P>
      <P>I am very disappointed to hear the Leader of the Opposition say that his party may withdraw from the all-party committees as a result of what is occurring here.  I appeal to him to reconsider that.  It would be most unfortunate, because of the number of committees which are beginning and which could do very useful work but which would be affected if there were no agreement on these at this time.</P>
      <P>What has occurred is quite understandable because it has been pointed out that the Government have very little legislation to bring before us and it has been decided &mdash; I do not know whether by agreement or not &mdash; that we adjourn tomorrow week.  There is no reason in the world why we should.  If time is required to discuss a Bill, I am against that.  We have consistently pointed out that more time should be given for debates on various Bills.  If more time is required for this legislation, there is no reason why it should not be given.  There is no reason why we cannot sit for another week.  It has been mentioned on a number of occasions since the Taoiseach came into office that changes would be made, that we would work longer hours, sit longer, that more work would be done, more legislation brought forward and that the adjournment period would not be as long and so forth.  I do not see why all this row has occurred, or the need for guillotines or cutting of the time at all on this Bill, Even if the Taoiseach wants to adjourn on Friday, he still has ample time to give at least up to 2.30 p.m. on Wednesday for Committee Stage of this Bill.</P>

      <P>The guillotine mechanism is one that is used in parliaments only very seldom and very sparingly.  This is because it runs counter to the whole idea of parliamentary debate.  It is a mechanism to be used only in the last analysis and when there has been an obvious filibuster in progress for weeks. We have not used the guillotine motion for a long number of years.  If one goes through the records one finds that this sort of motion has been introduced only <Col N="987" /> by parliaments that did not need reform, parliaments that had common sense and sensitivity.  That has been the record of good parliaments since the formation of the State but here we have a sanctimonious Government who, within months of setting up a whole panopoly of committees and of talk and advice on the need for Dáil reform, introduce a guillotine motion in the middle of a normal Second Reading debate on a measure for which no reason has been put forward in terms of urgency or in terms of national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to bulldozing Parliament, the Government are bulldozing the Constitution. In the course of doing that they are removing from office and without stated reason a former High Court Judge. Therefore by implication they are bulldozing also the judicial system.  This is the Government of reform that we hear so much about.  According to the leader in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning, the Minister for the Environment has received a letter from a firm of solicitors pointing out the many constitutional implications of this Bill.  During the course of my speech on Tuesday I warned the Minister of the serious legal and constitutional deficiencies in this measure.  The draconian guillotine nature of section 10 of the Bill would not stand up in any court of law.  If the Government persist in bulldozing the Bill through, they will face massive compensation claims from the chairman and members of the board on the basis of their being dismissed without any stated reason.  The Government have the temerity not even to suggest in the Bill that there should be stated reasons for the dismissal of the board.  There is merely the suggestion that on the commencement of this legislation the chairman and other members of the board shall cease to hold office.  The reason for this is obvious.  There is no cause for the board being dismissed.  In the many offthe-cuff remarks on this matter that the Minister has made since assuming office he has not cast aspersions on any member of the board, a board presided over by one of the leading and most respected judicial personages in the country.  Neither <Col N="988" /> did the Minister cast aspersions on these people in introducing the Second Stage of the Bill.  The only reason for the removal of the board is vindictiveness on the part of the Government and because the board were appointed by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>I was a member of the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977.  That was shortly after the establishment of the first planning appeal board by the then Minister, Mr. Tully, and the Government of the day.  We did not interfere so far as any member of that board was concerned. We dismissed allegations that were made against some of the appointees.  I believe in the basic principle that unless we are to degenerate into a banana-republic type situation, once an Irish Government make appointments of this kind, they should be backed by the succeeding Government except in circumstances of some grave wrong so far as the appointees are concerned.  If we failed to act in this way we would be bringing about a lack of confidence in our institutions and in the boards we establish.  Sometimes we appoint people of our political persuasion to these boards but they are always people of integrity.  I would respect the right of the Coalition to do that also but what they are doing now in dismissing an entire board is very dangerous.  It is the first time that this has been done in the history of the State.  The Government in this instance are engaging in a highly damaging procedure so far as the fabric of society is concerned.  I warn them that by this type of vindictive deed they may be doing enormous damage in terms of the respect people have for the political system.  It is very important that people of standing and of integrity in the community are encouraged to work on such bodies as the planning appeals board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the former Deputy Tully as Minister in a decent Coalition Government wrote into the legislation the specific requirement that the chairman of the board should be a High Court judge or a person who had held that office and that the emoluments <Col N="989" /> would be of the same order as those of a High Court judge.  The legislation contained the provision that the chairman would have the same services and the same standing as a High Court judge would have.  We are not talking about some small board but about a quasi-judicial board who are concerned with very serious and complex decisions.  The board must deal with matters that are more important than are 90 per cent of the matters coming before the ordinary courts.  In every sense the board are as important an institution as is any of the courts.  That is why the previous Coalition to which I have referred, in their wisdom and supported by us, included in the governing legislation the necessity to appoint a person of High Court judicial status.</P>
      <P>We support fully the thinking and the intention behind that provision.  Since the formation of the board the three chairmen to have been appointed were of such judicial status &mdash; Mr. Justice Pringle, Mr. Justice Walsh and Judge Murnaghan. Apart from the public odium that will result from what the Government are doing, the Bill will have the effect of bringing the Government into the courts and it will result in severe and serious constitutional difficulties.  I am convinced that section 10 of the Bill is totally at variance with the Constitution.  One cannot just dismiss people like that.  That kind of draconian, jack-boot treatment is the kind of thinking behind the Government's attitude in moving this guillotine motion.  We are only being given five hours for Committee Stage next Tuesday to discuss this measure which is a minefield of Committee Stage problems both in regard to its legal and constitutional implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If this Government want to proceed along these lines they will do enormous damage to themselves, which I welcome, because the more damage they do to themselves the better.  What I do not like is that in the course of doing that damage they will damage the institution of Dáil Éireann, the profession of politics or the political institutions of the State and the boards on which honourable people serve.  However, honourable people will not serve on these boards again if they <Col N="990" /> have to face the prospect of being treated in the manner in which the honourable judge who is chairman of this board and the other members of the board are being treated.  Nobody will serve on boards anymore.</P>
    <P>With all the Dáil reform and all the committees, the Government will soon be going around in circles and will get nothing done if they behave like this. They will rapidly disappear down the tubes of disrespect.  They will have only themselves to blame.  I do not mind them going down but it is the damage that will be done to the whole fabric of society and politics that I care about.</P>
    <P>I suppose there is no point in asking this vindictive Government to stay their hand at this stage.  They are leading us down a path which we in Fianna Fáil absolutely reject.  No amount of talk about fancy committees will paper over that big gaping hole of disrespect they are creating.  No amount of cosmetic politics at which they are specialists will help to powder over the damage they will cause.</P>

      <P>In all my 18 years as a Deputy there are few issues which come before the House for decision which have upset me as much as this one.  The more I think about what the Government are attempting to do, the harder I find it to believe that they are actually attempting to make this move.  It is extraordinary that a Government would seek to abolish the membership of a board established under legislation passed in the House without giving as much as one valid reason why they are dismissing the chairman and the appointed members.  This is an extraordinary move.  I do not understand how the Government thought they would get away with this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach is doing great damage to his reputation by continuing to press ahead with this Bill.  All the other members of the Coalition will have to carry the odium of this repressive legislation and the exceptional step of abolishing a board without valid reason.  Where is the Taoiseach's sense of fair play or the Minister's sense of justice?  Where do they think this legislation will lead us?  Right into the banana republic.  It is leading us <Col N="991" /> away from respect for the House and the legislation passed here.  How can we expect people to respect the legislation we pass if we have no respect for it ourselves and seek to cast it aside without valid argument in favour of doing so?</P>
    <P>The Minister sought to denigrate the members of the board.  We know why.  It is for political reasons.  It was because they were appointed by the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government.  The Taoiseach is seeking to introduce a dangerous principle. It would mean that people appointed to boards by an outgoing Government could be legitimately thrown out of office by an incoming Government.  When we won the election in 1977 we never questioned the many appointments the Coalition made when they had been defeated at the polls but before they went out of office.  We never sought to bring in legislation or fire those people.  We did not raise a hullabaloo or bring in legislation to dismiss the former Deputy, Brendan Toal, who, when he lost his seat, was appointed by the Coalition as a land commissioner.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to enter that area.  I am merely giving an example of appointments made which could have been questioned but which were not.  The right of the Government to make these appointments was accepted by the incoming Government.  These people were allowed to serve out their term of appointment.  That tradition is now being abolished by the Taoiseach and the Government.  It amazes me that they would seek to implement this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Minister and Government Deputies sought to denigrate the members of the board by implying that there were delays in dealing with planning appeals and it was their fault.  Naturally there is concern about the delay in deciding appeals.  Steps should be taken to improve this.  However, during the course of the debate we put it clearly on record that blame for the delays cannot be laid at the feet of the members of the board.  I sought to explain the procedures of An Bord Pleanála and stated that, on average, the board take about one week to deal with the planning files which come before them, for decision.  The delays are taking place at administrative level, at planning inspector level and because local authorities are slow to forward documents to help in the proper compilation of the files.</P>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach and the Minister accept that it is a fact that on average the board only take about a week to dispose of files which come before them?  I challenged the Minister on a radio programme yesterday to state whether this was true.  He refused to answer the question but gave a different answer.  I challenge him now to say whether it is true that delays do not take place at board level.  I will sit down and allow the Minister to reply.</P>

      <P>Every time I give the Minister an opportunity to answer he avoids doing so.  He has made a false accusation against honourable people and seeks to imply that these people have no qualifications for the job.  It is not necessary to <Col N="993" /> have some kind of technical qualification. The board have been acting independently and autonomously and the only part of their autonomy which has been interfered with concerns the refusal of the Department to allow the board to take over full control of staff.  I will refer to this matter in greater detail on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>The Minister's undertaking in his Second Stage speech is not now to be fulfilled. What are we to accept from that side of the House?  The Minister said on Tuesday that the House would have an opportunity of examining in depth the main provisions of the Bill on Committee Stage.  How can we do so when we are limited to a few short hours?  We had difficulties recently on another Bill in trying to have a short discussion on each section.  Members will not have an opportunity to discuss in detail the provisions of this Bill.  The Bill does not cover many aspects which should have been included and a flood of representations has come in from the Royal Institute of Architects and other interested parties.</P>
      <P>The Bill is being rushed through without any opportunity to improve planning legislation.  None of our amendments will be accepted and we have not as yet seen any of the Minister's amendments.  When the 1976 Act was being discussed the then Minister, James Tully, stated in his Second Stage speech that he would welcome comments from the Opposition because he fully accepted that all the wisdom did not reside on the Government's side.  He said he would be interested to hear the opinions, suggestions, proposals and amendments from the Opposition and that they would get full and fair consideration. The Bill which finally passed through this House was a different instrument to the one he introduced and he acknowledged in his final speech the contribution of the Opposition.  Numerous amendments put down by me, Deputy Faulkner, Deputy Haughey and other Members were accepted and became part of the 1976 Act under which this board was established.  The Minister now intends arbitrarily to dismiss the board without any valid reason.</P>

    <P>Where is the Taoiseach's sense of fair <Col N="994" /> play?  How can he justify what he is doing?  Why is he not prepared to contribute to this debate and give valid grounds for the Government's desire to dismiss the board?  Where is his sense of justice?</P>
    <P>The best contribution from the Government's side came yesterday from Deputy Liam Cosgrave who made the only valid case we have heard.  He said that what the people were concerned about was the length of time taken to decide planning appeals.  The public and those whose projects are held up are concerned to ensure that decisions are made fairly by An Bord Pleanála and as expeditiously as possible.  He said that the public are not concerned about the political affiliations of board members.  If the board are expeditiously carrying out their duties under the legislation the public will be satisfied.  Deputy Cosgrave went on to say that the public are not concerned about the kinds of allegations and innuendos which have been heard.</P>
    <P>We who are involved in the political system and represent the people in this democratically elected Parliament should be the last ones to denigrate people because they hold political views or because they were appointed by people who held political office.  We have all appointed people when we held office. People of opposing views have also been appointed and I could give examples of judicial and other appointments when the Government were not deterred from appointing people who held differing political views.  Why should we seek on this occasion to apply this new principle that if a person was appointed by Fianna Fáil he is not entitled to hold office when Fianna Fáil are not in Government?  It is a vindictive political act.</P>
    <P>It is amazing that Deputies Garrett FitzGerald and Dick Spring would seek to destroy their own reputations as honest, decent men by proceding with legislation of this kind.  I would appeal to them to withdraw the Bill in its entirety or else to withdraw those sections which abolish the existing board and let us carry on with the other provisions which seek to improve the operations of the board.  Let <Col N="995" /> us apologise for the false allegations made against members of the board.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister on radio yesterday whether he would agree that the delays were caused by the fact that there is an insufficient number of staff and he replied that there was a direct relationship between the increase in the number of board members and the backlog of appeals.  Where is the logic in that?  We accept that there has been an increase in the backlog because there has been an increase in the number of appeals received and there is not adequate staffing to deal with them.  In 1977 there were 18 planning inspectors but at the end of 1982 there were only 15.  Early this year the Minister appointed four more planning inspectors.  Why has he not been honest enough to admit that since the making of these appointments there has been a substantial increase in output?  I would encourage the Minister to appoint another eight inspectors because the country cannot afford undue delay in decisions on planning appeals.  Projects are held up and costings are upset.  The appointment of four extra planning inspectors is not good enough and I would ask for at least six more.</P>

      <P>This is about a planning appeal board which is about to be abolished. I am pointing out that the only reason given was the delays in processing planning appeals.  I am showing again that that is a false argument, an untruth, and it is wrong of the Minister to seek to convey that impression.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party and others are seeking to put about another impression &mdash; that the only reason Fianna Fáil are taking this kind of stand is that we have some vested interest in some appeals that lie before the board.  I dismiss that type of innuendo as utter rubbish which should not be entertained for one second. We have absolutely no interest in that aspect of this Bill.  We are only concerned <Col N="996" /> with the principle that is being established. We must drive that home time and time again.  Why would we waste so much parliamentary time, why would we take this firm stand if we were not worried about the change that is taking place in the traditional method of dealing with planning and development and the way the country has done its business.  The Taoiseach can smile and smirk but he will be held responsible for this, he will have to take the blame in the years to come if he insists on proceeding with this legislation. He is not making any valid contribution to Irish society is he continues to push this Bill through.  It is the worst piece of legislation I have seen in my 18 years here.  I do not give a thrawneen about the appeals before the board.  That is only a red herring that is being dragged in to seek to weaken our argument.</P>
    <P>I appeal to those who convey to the public what is happening in this House, the media and those who have responsibility to ensure balanced reporting of debates in the House, that they will convey that clearly and not seek to convey the innuendo which the Government's propaganda machine is trying to convey to try to destroy the valid argument we are making.  In years to come the results of this decision will be seen and will be regretted.</P>
    <P>This process, which Deputy Quinn seems to be exceptionally keen to proceed with, the de-politicising of the planning process, is highly impracticable because it involves the complete re-writing of the planning and development laws.  Under the existing Act the role of the county councils is paramount.  If the Government go ahead with this total de-politicisation of the planning process they must remove the role of the county councillor.  Perhaps Deputy Skelly would like to see that.  I was not here when he spoke but from listening to other Deputies who spoke after him know they criticised him and dissociated themselves from his scurillous attack on the role of county councillors.  Deputies yesterday got up and dissociated themselves from his comments.  Perhaps Deputy Skelly has fellow travellers over there who feel that councillors should not have a role in <Col N="997" /> planning and that there should be complete change, that we should go ahead with this absolute de-politicisation of the entire planning process and remove every elected person from having any say in the planning laws.  It is completely farcical and impracticable.  Who will take over; who will elect the people who take over? We are about to hand over to some bunch of technocrats who will not be responsible to anybody, who will live in a cloud and make all sorts of decisions which will cause chaos and confusion for this parliament and for all public representatives. They will soon come into disrepute because there will be an outcry for change to ensure that the people responsible for planning will be elected by the people and answerable to them.  I make a last appeal to the Taoiseach not to be sniggering and laughing over there.  This is far too serious.  Maybe he does not understand what he is doing.</P>

We are challenging the Government to state their valid reasons and answer to the people outside, but do not persist in seeking to convey false, inaccurate and unjust allegations against honourable people who have served their country well.

      <P>I will make only a few observations on this matter.  It is essential that this Bill should be passed here and in the Seanad and signed by the President before the summer recess.  I served in this House from 1969 to 1973 when there was a Fianna Fáil Minister for Local Government. During that period decisions on planning appeals were taken by the Minister <Col N="998" /> and by the Parliamentary Secretary. I served in the House from 1973 to 1977. During the greater part of that Government's term planning appeals were determined by the Minister for Local Government and his Parliamentary Secretary &mdash; Deputy James Tully was Minister then.  Therefore, I am familiar with the alleged politicisation of planning between 1969 and 1976 under two different Governments.  I was Chairman of Dublin County Council in 1981 and I served on that council from 1974 to 1982.</P>

      <P>The only two reasons put forward for the first attack in this Bill in his contribution by the Minister for the Environment was the de-politicisation of An Bord Pleanála and secondly the long delays over the years and the backlog. He was talking about the members of An Bord Pleanála.  I have canvassed in seven general elections and in a number of byelections in my 15 years in this House, and I have yet to meet a person who criticised the fact that the Government or the Minister in question appointed members of boards.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> I was saying that in the course of seven general elections and several by elections I have yet to hear a single complaint about the fact that the Government or individual Ministers appointed members of the various boards.  Suddenly it becomes a major issue that the present members of An Bord Pleanála were appointed by the Government of the day, or the Minister, or Ministers because a number of them have served for more than one term.  I was Minister for the Environment and I never heard any complaints about the members who were appointed.</P>
      <P>The second reason put forward for bringing in this Bill is the fact that there are delays and a backlog.  I have yet to hear any mention from that side of the House of what steps will be taken to deal with this matter.  So far as I know it is acknowledged by both sides of the House that the blame for the delays does not rest with the membership of the board or the way they carry out their business.  The reason for the delays is lack of staff. There are too few inspectors and insufficient service into the board.  We have not heard whether the embargo on recruitment to the public service will prevent the Minister from appointing more inspectors and more staff.  The only way to deal with the only complaint against An Bord Pleanála is to deal with the staff situation.</P>
      <P>Yesterday I suggested that if the Minister is hog-tied by the embargo he can arrange to have people seconded from other areas of the public service, particularly technical people, inspectors and engineers.  They should be available because some Departments are not as busy as they were last year.  The Minister should show goodwill about doing away with the backlog whether or not this Bill goes through.  He should do something about the staffing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no effort here yesterday or <Col N="1003" /> the evening before to fillibuster this Bill. The longest contribution was Deputy Skelly's.  Some of us took half an hour, or 40 minutes, or thereabouts.  There was no effort on our part to fillibuster this Bill.  Now this guillotine motion is brought in this morning to finish the Bill at 5 o'clock.  There is another reason why this debate should not be curtailed.  The evening before last, and again yesterday, I had to listen to Deputy Skelly openly and sweepingly insulting members of our local authorities, democratically elected people.  Local authorities and local elections are at the very foundation of our democratic system.  These insults were cast at members of local authorities on a number of occasions and people sat over there listening to them who I know are members of local authorities.  No effort was made to contradict the gentleman on that side of the House.  We picked him up on one or two points and contradicted him.  Again yesterday he repeated the accusations.</P>
    <P>Lest some Deputies do not know what he accused members of local authorities of, I should repeat the three major points.  First he said councillors were ignorant people.  Secondly he called them asses.  That is a fact; it can be seen from the Official Report.</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> He called members of local authorities asses.  But more importantly and seriously he blatantly said that councillors were not to be trusted.  Those were the three major accusations, amongst lesser ones, he made against councillors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the people over there who are members of local authorities &mdash; or even those who are not &mdash; do not want to defend their fellow members in local authorities, there are many people here who are members of local authorities who do want to defend local authorities, their members, are willing to do so, waiting to do so, unlike people on the opposite side of the House.  Surely this guillotine motion will deprive them of their rights to do so apart from affecting their right to speak <Col N="1004" /> on this Bill.  The Taoiseach has said that if the guillotine motion goes through he is willing to reconsider the time factor with regard to this Bill.  Now is the time to consider it, not after five o'clock this evening, thereby giving members elected to local authorities and thereafter elected to this House the right to defend local authorities, to defend our political system and, most important of all, the right to defend democracy.  If that is to be eroded then we are heading in one direction, towards the style of countries behind the Iron Curtain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to start my short speech by making Fianna Fáil a present of two points.  It is entirely natural for them to complain about a time allocation motion and it would be surprising if an Opposition did not do so.  I do not fault the heated tone they have taken up with regard to that.  I can remember them doing it with, I suppose, even more justification, or even more naturally, when I was Government Whip and had to move time allocation motions which were a great deal more drastic than this one.  In those days the necessity was forced on the Government because of persistent obstruction by the other side which I am glad to say ceased around the year 1975.  I must admit that I have not seen anything like it since and would not wish to accuse either side of this House of getting back to the standards of those days which I hope have since been consigned to history.  Therefore, I do not object in any way to the Opposition's anger about being closured.  I wish it was possible, although it is not always possible, so to arrange Government business and by agreement, if possible, that there was no need for motions of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will go further &mdash; although I am sure the gentlemen over there will be surprised to hear me say it &mdash; I am inclined to dissociate myself from what was said by Deputy Mac Giolla the other evening. I have no doubt there are gougers in the Fianna Fáil Party, as there are in all parties, as Deputy Jim Tully used to say when he was here.  But I accept that the meat in the issue before the House here is sufficiently strong to justify indignation <Col N="1005" /> on the other side even if there is no concealed motive.  I do not think it is fair merely to allege &mdash; as others elsewhere in the House have done &mdash; that self-interest, nothing but self-interest, and of the basest kind at that, is behind the Opposition's attitude.  I disclaim that entirely for myself.  Having said that, my only criticism of the Minister in what he is seeking to do now is that he delayed six months too long in doing it.  It might have been better had he taken a shorter and quicker way of disposing of the matter he is going to such elaborate lengths to dispose of today.  Although very far from being an expert on planning &mdash; I am not a member of a local authority and never was, and I would willingly defer to almost any Deputy in the House on planning matters &mdash; I consider the style displayed by Deputy Raphael Burke in making the appointments which have caused this matter to be in front of the House today was grossly contemptuous of the public and of the standards which I hope all sides, in sober moments, would wish the people to be led to expect.  In saying that I have nothing derogratory to say about any of the gentlemen whom Deputy Raphael Burke appointed.  Frankly, I must say I do not think I ever heard of any of them before and still less do I know anything to the discredit of any of them.  But, since he appeared to go out of his way &mdash; and as far as I can recall in the last&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that this area is one which has been peculiarly controversial down the years, far more controversial than appointments to the boards of Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna or any other, for very evident reasons &mdash; because, on planning decisions, big money turns.  In a nutshell that is the reason.  Everyone knows that.  There is no use in being mealy-mouted about it, that is the reason.  The Fianna Fáil Party must acknowledge that I have not gone to the length of alleging that that is the only reason they are objecting here today; of course it is not.  If there was no money involved they would still be resentful of finding a Government Bill being brought in in order to nullify something done by one of their own colleagues. I have not made that accusation and I do not believe it is true.  But in this area above all, an appointment made of a kind which can determine whether somebody becomes a millionaire or remains a sweet-shopkeeper all his life ought to be made, must be made, by people in whom there is&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Ever since I came into this House 14 years ago planning has been a terribly sensitive and controversial issue. I remember when I first took an interest in politics one of the most controversial people in the country was Kevin Boland, not because of his views on the Irish language, not because he tried to Gaelicise the Army and Anglicise the voting system &mdash; two operations that justifiably might have drawn him into some criticism, both being inappropriate to the subject matter concerned &mdash; but because the planning decisions he was then making by himself were the subject of heated criticism for obvious reasons.  I remember former Deputy Jack Lynch called Kevin Boland &mdash; not long before Kevin Boland resigned as Minister &mdash; a &ldquo;rock of integrity&rdquo;. Perhaps I have grown milder with the years but I have come now to take a view of Deputy Lynch which would lead me to take him at his word when he used that expression to describe Deputy Boland.  Deputy Boland was a man as difficult, as crusty and as disagreeable as a politician well could be; but I will accept that it was beneath him and would never <Col N="1009" /> have entered his thoughts to enrich himself, or anyone belonging to him, by a halfpenny by anything he did in office and I am perfectly happy to allow that description of Deputy Lynch's to stand. Nonetheless that did not prevent the planning operations conducted by Deputy Boland from bitter criticism. There were no rows in 1967, 1968 and 1969 more bitter than those about the Mount Pleasant petrol station and other cases of that kind.  There were rows throughout the length and breadth of the country, rows which were the subject of headlines in the press and programmes on television, bad temper up and down the country and, in order to get rid of that, the Government I first worked for were determined &mdash; it took a long time to do it &mdash; to get rid of that system and replace it with a system which would be visibly impartial.  What we are getting here &mdash; I am sorry to say this to the Tánaiste about this Bill &mdash; is an attempt to depoliticise the process at two removes.  In a way I think it would be appropriate for the Opposition not to complain about depoliticisation, as though it is something that could not be done, but to complain about the process seen here in this Bill, and this is not the only sign of it these days, whereby elected people are passing votes of no confidence in themselves.  That is the point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is missing the point.  It is elected people I am talking about.  I consider the Tánaiste is himself well capable of appointing a decent respectable board of people of any political allegiance or none.  I do not consider that merely because a man votes for one party or another he will be dishonest or necessarily be suspect in the discharge of a public duty, particularly one for which he is being paid, or even if he is not being paid.  Believe it or not, it is possible to disassociate one's party allegiance from one's sense of public duty.  People do it all the time.  Judges do it all the time.  It is possible to do it.  But when I find that a Minister is not only going to have a planning board but is going to create <Col N="1010" /> another board to appoint the planning board &mdash; he is going to deprive himself even of the appointments &mdash; then I ask myself what are we here for at all?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely a Minister for Justice can do his job honestly and fairly and if a situation has been reached that that is no longer the case, and Ministers cannot be trusted, then the reflection is not on the Government which tries however hamhandedly to restore public confidence but on the people on both sides of this House who have brought matters to that ugly pass.  I have no partisan feeling about this at all, but I deplore the proposition basically at the root of it which has led people in this House to compete with one another for office by means of the dispensation of favours even to the point where we were bound to suspect that those favours were being dispensed by an abuse of a governmental process, such as planning or something else.  That is disgraceful, and the way back from that is, as people said in the old days, to make the sign of the Cross and resolve never again to be led by a purely political consideration into doing something which represents an abuse of a public office, whether paid or honorary; and unless we get back to that resolution in this House we are wasting our time appointing boards at one, two or three removes, with no matter how many buffers of blameless cottonwool inserted between the Minister and the people at the cutting edge of the governmental process.  We have to get back to that, and if we could get back to it and agree frankly and honestly with ourselves across the House that we would not put up with abuse of office even on our own side, there would be no need for the Tánaiste's Bill and no need either for the people Deputy Burke put in the last time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us, in the name of God, do that. The way the State here has been running over the last 50 or 60 years is admittedly weak.  The people over there or their predecessors felt strongly and bitterly &mdash; I am not saying without reason; there <Col N="1011" /> were reasons on both sides &mdash; about the men who ran this State in the first ten years or so.  But, say what you like about them, they looked and were men with certain standards for whom whole ranges of activities were beneath them, beneath them so far as to be quite out of sight. The very same was true of de Valera and the people who took over in 1932. Look at the photographs of them &mdash; crusty, intransigent, impossible to do business with, but for the most part incorruptible and for the most part people who would have considered, since they risked their lives to set the State up, whatever side they were on, that they had wasted their lives if, having got in here, they handed out favours to friends or took halfpennies or £ notes in backhanders, or enabled their friends to do so.</P>
    <P>I would like this House and the two big parties here &mdash; I am not excluding the Labour Party in a sense intended to be injurious; I consider in many respects they have maintained better standards than the two big parties, perhaps because they have been further from power &mdash; but it is important that the two big parties get back to the standards which are now perhaps laughable because they are considered to be old-fashioned, the standards of the 1920s and 1930s and which were taken for granted when a Parliamentary Secretary in the 1940s had to resign over a shoulder of rancid bacon delivered to the Army.  That is what I want to see here and, until we can get the two big parties to lay aside the idiotic tuppenny halfpenny Punch and Judy show that they seem to think the people should be well satisfied to pay for, until we do that and resolve to put up with no low standards in high or low places, even on our own side, we are wasting our time with this kind of Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the reasons which led the Tánaiste to bring in this Bill.  He had sound reasons in a sense I shall try to explain.  He realises the process has been brought into disrepute by <Col N="1012" /> the last batch of appointments &mdash; I am sorry to say that to Deputy Burke whom I regard as a friend &mdash; irrespective of the individual qualities of the people appointed but I regard the method he has chosen as a pathetic way of going about a job it is right to go about.  It would have been better if he had simply fired that board, when he got in, under the old legislation, and explained why he was doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last thing I want to say is in reference to something Deputy Molloy said shortly before I rose.  He was talking about depoliticisation and by that he meant something rather different from what I mean.  What he would like to see is people who make politics part of their lives at any level &mdash; now he knows far more about local government at central and local level than I do, but I would ask him does he really regard the planning process as having justified itself over the years since 1934 when we first had a Planning Act?  Let him look around at the desolate suburbs thrown up, at the thousands and thousands of houses built before there was any kind of facility for the people who were going to live in them.  Let him look at the city of Dublin, the scruffiest city this side of Baghdad, in which it is impossible to travel for half an hour on foot or any other way without getting a rush of blood to the head out of exasperation at the filth and disorder and dereliction of it.  Let him look at the section 4 applications which are such a source of reproach in his own county and in the neighbouring counties, and in Dublin as well, and ask himself whether physical planning over the last 50 years in this country really has been a success. I cannot hold an inquest on it now, or at any other time; I have not got the equipment to do that, and no one could reach a firm judgement on it without a lot of work.  But we can look around us and see what we can see.  The thing has ended up in a disaster.  Walk 200 yards from this House to the capsized egg-box on Fitzwilliam Street, where even Deputy Lenihan, when he saw it, was so appalled that he asked: &ldquo;Would you not put a lick of paint on it?&rdquo; The ESB offices &mdash; a tribute to the architects' profession as <Col N="1013" /> well, who seem willing to put up anything, even though there are certain operations a doctor will not do and certain cases a solicitor or a lawyer will not take.  But there is nothing you will not get an architect to put up, with of course the approval of the planning process.  With all the counsellors of the State standing behind them it will go up, no matter what the public say, no matter what An Taisce say, no matter what other private groups say.  They can should themselves blue in the face, and people like our planning chiefs, from Kevin Boland onwards, walk on them.  Do not tell me in the instances I have just given of the planning process in Fitzwilliam Street that any law was broken in a protest about that.  No one lay down in the street.  No one sent an anonymous call or letter.  There was no intimidation.  There was no sit-in.  There was no blackmail.  Everybody who cared tuppence for the appearance of the capital city made his protest in the only way open to him within the law, and he might as well have been idle.  They were walked on; and six months later, when the thing was up, there was the glad news that Deputy Lenihan had second thoughts about its aesthetic appearance.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lenihan thought it could be cured with a bucket of whitewash.  That is the level of the planning decisions we have been getting here; and anything which puts, metaphorically speaking, a bomb under that process, I will be behind, and I do not give a damn who I am insulting by saying that.  This country is a reproach, and Deputy Molloy knows it.  I believe he is man enough to admit it in private, even if not here.  Anything which can improve this planning process is something I wholeheartedly support.</P>

      <P>The Minister in recommending this Bill claims that by firing the existing board and appointing a new one he will remove from the planning appeals system any allegation of political influence and produce a well-balanced board with the qualities and capacity to deal efficiently and effectively with planning appeals.</P>
      <P>The clear innuendo &mdash; and this has been backed up by inspired leaks from a &ldquo;highly placed source in the Department of the Environment&rdquo;&mdash; is that some members since the appointment of this board in 1977 have been guilty of corruption, and in particular that the present chairman, Mr. Justice Murnaghan, and the present members have been all so guilty.  I could quote from a number of newspaper articles to back up the type of campaign that has been carried on by this highly placed source in the Department. The first was an article in <i>The Irish Times,</i> 14 March, which had a heading &ldquo;Planning Board to be Dismissed in Reform Move&rdquo;.  It mentioned the overall plan to improve public credibility and operation of the appeal system and went on to mention qualifications, expertise and a highly placed source in the Department of the Environment&rdquo;.  The next day the Minister had to make a statement which was printed in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 March.  There were articles in the <i>Evening Herald</i> under the headings &ldquo;Why Spring Sacked the Board&rdquo; and &ldquo;Spring Acts on Building Racket&rdquo;.  We had one article after another insinuating that the members of the board were guilty of corruption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An accusation against one member of the board arose from Question Time in this House when the then Deputy Quinn mentioned irregularities in planning. When asked to produce evidence he brought a so-called witness who made a serious charge against a member of the board.  That member had been appointed by the then Minister for Local Government, Mr. Tully.  The member was an official of the Department of the Environment and not an outside nominee. <Col N="1015" /> This so-called witness made this accusation to the Dublin City Manager and was reported to me as Minister for the Environment. Immediately I contacted the then chairman of the board, Mr. Justice Pringle.  The member took leave while the matter was being investigated by the Fraud Squad.  After a detailed investigation the good name of the member was cleared, and respect for the board was re-established.  Did we see the then Deputy come into this House and apologise for making those accusations?  We did not.</P>
    <P>The campaign which has taken place since the change of Government last December has not been started by the Minister, Deputy Spring.  I do not blame him because it is very clear that he is not involved in the drip-drip accusations and innuendo against the members of this board.  This campaign is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn.  I want to make that clear.  The Minister of State seems to be obsessed with corruption. Suggestions have been made about members appointed by my Government and by myself when I was Minister for the Environment.  I stand over every appointment I made because they are decent honourable men capable of carrying out their tasks as members of An Bord Pleanála.  I challenge the Minister for the Environment or any member of the Government or of this House to suggest that members have been less than honourable in their behaviour when carrying out their duties as members of the board. It is contemptible that a Government would attempt to cast aspersions on Mr. Justice Murnaghan, one of our leading jurists, a member of the High Court for many years, who served this country well.</P>
    <P>When the 1976 Act was being debated here it was the considered view of Members that a High Court judge should preside over the affairs of An Bord Pleanála because the decisions of the board, as well as the decisions of the local authorities with regard to planning matters, can vastly affect values of land, building and other property.  They can affect the value of a site by either reducing it or dramatically increasing it.  It had been the considered <Col N="1016" /> view of the Members of this House that a retired High Court judge should be chairman of that board because of the fact that he had been appointed by the President and would be above reproach.  Nobody has, or should, make any accusations against any of the three men who were chairmen of that board &mdash; Mr. Justice Pringle, Mr. Justice Walsh and Mr. Justice Murnaghan.  The Government have attempted to cast aspersions on the board and on the honour and honesty of a man like Mr. Justice Murnaghan by way of innuendo or by leaks by a &ldquo;highly placed source in the Department of the Environment&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste in his statement at the opening of this debate said that it was not really necessary to have a High Court judge as the chairman of the board because if legal advice was required legal advice could always be got for the board.  The judge is not there for legal advice; he is there so that it can be seen that the behaviour of the board is above reproach.  To suggest otherwise is unworthy of any Government and a disgrace.</P>
    <P>As regards the bona fides of the Department of the Environment, of the Minister of State and of the Tánaiste with regard to the behaviour of Mr. Justice Murnaghan, may I ask a question?  How often has the Tánaiste met the chairman of an Bord Pleanála since his appointment as Minister for the Environment? If the Tánaiste was concerned about the operation of the board, if he had any worries about it, surely it would be natural for him to ask the chairman of the board to come and see him and discuss the matter.  I would like the Tánaiste to take the opportunity, when he is replying, of clarifying whether he has met the chairman of An Bord Pleanála on even one occasion.  Has he acknowledged requests from the chairman for meetings or has the chairman been refused meetings? This is the Government who would cast doubts on the members of the board and on the chairman in particular.  Surely the bona fides of the Tánaiste on this can be gauged by the number of occasions on which he has discussed the operation of An Bord Pleanála with the chairman, a High Court judge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Motion No. 3 attempts to guillotine this debate.  On such a serious matter it is wrong for the Government to guillotine a debate.  I am highlighting the reasons this Bill is so important and why it should not be guillotined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some highly placed sources in the Department of the Environment and some of our particularly well-known interest groups and pressure groups have cast doubts on the members of An Bord Pleanála and suggested that it has lost credibility and that the members appointed were not qualified, whatever &ldquo;qualified&rdquo; is supposed to mean.  I should like to run through a number of the names I appointed.  This is not as a justification for myself but to clarify the situation.  One of them was Mr. John P. Keenan, an architect.  Surely an architect is well qualified to hold such a position? I expect that in the list of nominating bodies to be brought forward under this <Col N="1018" /> Bill architects will be included.  I appointed Mr. Michael Cooke, Dublin County Council.  He was involved in the processing of by-laws in the council, very much involved in the planning process.  I appointed Mr. Patrick Malone, county council official involved in draftsman's work and generally in the affairs of county councils.  The two other appointments I made, with the approval of the Government, were Mr. Daniel Molloy, a businessman and &mdash; probably the man who has taken most of the brunt of these accusations and innuendoes &mdash; Mr. Tony Lambert, my former special adviser in the Department.  I make an apology for the appointment of any of the members. No suggestion has been made in public that they have in any way dishonoured the trust placed in them by the Government. May I quote from the press statement issued when the very first board was appointed by the then Minister, Mr. James Tully.  On page 4 of the press statement he said:</P>
    <P>In appointing Mr. Seán O'Brien, I had in mind the need to guard against the establishment of an over-specialised board and felt it appropriate to have at least one member from outside the public and professional sectors.</P>
    <P>So it is with Mr. Molloy and Mr. Lambert. Mr. Lambert is a decent, honourable man who has worked down through the years on community affairs.  He was involved for many years with the Swords Community Council.  He had the experience of working as my special adviser in the Department and is consequently very much aware of departmental matters.  I find it nauseating that a Government should, by innuendo, try to cast doubts on the decency and honour of members appointed by a previous administration.</P>
    <P>The board is to be abolished by section 10 of this Bill.  Section 10 is the nitty-gritty of the Bill.  The rest of it is padding. In the debate on the 1976 Act the Members of this House were very careful as to how the chairman and members should be fired if it ever arose that their honesty and integrity were in question.  What is proposed in section 10 of this Bill is that <Col N="1019" /> the Minister shall break contracts entered into between the officer holder and the members of the board.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment and the Minister for the Environment of the day entered into contracts with individuals and the terms under which they could be dismissed were clearly laid down in the Act.  The chairman could be fired only if found to be incapable, through ill-health of effectively performing his duties, or if he had committed stated misbehaviour or if his removal appeared to the Minister to be necessary for the effective performance by the board of its functions.  No such statement has been made, no such charge has been laid.  In my view and that of many others, section 10 will be found to be unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>With regard to the removal of an ordinary member of the board:</P>
    <P>In the case of a member of the board who is removed from office under this Article, the Minister shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for removal.</P>
    <P>Where is the statement in writing of the reasons for removal?  The two cases which I have mentioned, one with regard to the removal of the chairman and the other with regard to the removal of a member, are the only ways under law in which the Minister can remove these officers from office and not, I suggest, by enacting legislation to break a legally binding contract.</P>

      <P>I am trying to illustrate that this is very serious legislation which does not deserve the guillotine motion which we have before us here.  I am illustrating the various reasons, facts and points on this Bill which need to be expanded on.  Unfortunately, because of this guillotine motion, time will not allow this.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us contains nothing new, except an attempt to breach contracts between the Government and the chairman and members of the board and in particular for the Minister to appoint ordinary members whom he will find suitable to him.</P>
      <P>For example, section 1 on definition is irrelevant.  Section 2 on the board's continuance is irrelevant.  Section 3 has no change except a small reduction in the number of members.  Section 4 on the general duty of the board &mdash; again no change.  Section 5 &mdash; the only change here is that in the nomination of two of his employees to the board the Minister effectively controls the appointment of the chairman.</P>
      <P>Section 6 concerning procedures at meetings &mdash; no change.  Section 7 on the appointment of ordinary members &mdash; no change except that the Minister retains totally control of the appointment of ordinary members.  Section 8 is an interesting section.  The Minister has said that he is anxious to remove the political taint from the board.  Here we have an additional power for the Minister which was not in the 1976 Act &mdash; the appointment of a deputy chairman of the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Chair, in the circumstances of the fact that it was I who happened to be Minister for the Environment at the time, acting on behalf of the outgoing Government.  This legislation needs clarification and the time will not allow this in any other way. <Col N="1021" /> I appeal for the Chair's liberal interpretation of the rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>That section gives the Minister a power which he had not before, of appointing a deputy chairman. The procedure of appointment of a deputy chairman up to now was a matter for the board members, to appoint one of themselves as deputy chairman.  Now the Minister who claims that his desire is to remove this appointment from the political process, takes unto himself the appointment of a deputy chairman to the board and the decision on the remuneration of that deputy chairman.</P>
      <P>Section 9, superannuation of members &mdash; no change.  Section 10, ceasing of office &mdash; that is the major breach of contract. It is the nitty-gritty of this Bill. Section 11, meetings and procedures &mdash; no change.  Section 12, the board's guardians &mdash; no change.  Sections 13 and 14, the Official Secrets Act &mdash; no change. Section 15, oral hearing &mdash; an insignificant change which has been gone into in great detail by Deputy Molloy.  Because of the type of debate, I shall not go into it now.  Section 16, vexatious appeals &mdash; that the board may determine these rather than dismiss as at present &mdash; no particular change.  Sections 17 and 18 are a repeat of section 5 of the 1982 Act.</P>
      <P>The Bill is padding, other than section 10.  Even that section, because of the structure of the Bill in section 7, ensures that the Minister still controls the appointment of the members, despite what he says in this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The way in which it is being sold to the general public is that it will speed up in some way the activity and operation of An Board Pleanála and remove the backlog of appeals which are before the board.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The operation of the board was clearly spelt out here by Deputy Molloy, that it is only after a long drawn-out process of the appeal being lodged, the views of all concerned being requested, of the local authorities, of the third party appellant, or of the appellant himself if <Col N="1022" /> it is a case of an applicant appealing against the refusal by a local authority, it is only after an oral hearing, an inspector viewing the application &mdash; after all that long drawn-out process which relates to numbers of staff that the files appear on the desks of the members of the board. It is at that stage that the members of the board decide.</P>
    <P>Changing the membership of the board will not speed up the decision by one minute or remove the backlog of cases at present before the board.  If the Minister was seriously concerned about speeding up the operation, why did he not meet the chairman of the board, who would have sat down with him and discussed the staffing arrangements?  To be fair, the Minister has made some alterations in staffing arrangements.  When I appointed the last members of the board I said in the statement at the time that I had approval from the then Minister for the Public Service for the appointment of extra inspectors to speed up the operation of the board and the number of decisions being made.  The situation was highlighted by Deputy Molloy, that in December 1977 there were 18 inspectors and in 1982 there were 15, despite the fact that the number of appeals have increased dramatically during that period from 1977 forward.</P>
    <P>In case the Minister or Members of this House think that this is just Deputy Ray Burke doing a vindication of his own decision when Minister, I could quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of Thursday, 26 May 1983, under the heading &ldquo;Former planning chief blames staff cuts for backlog.&rdquo; Surely the Minister will not cast doubts on the integrity and service of Mr. Justice Pringle and his experience and views with regard to the operation of the board.  Mr. Justice Pringle clarified the situation in that article, saying:</P>
    <P>Of course, the number of appeals coming in was considerably increased during the time I sat on the board, and the backlog grew.  Mr. Justice Pringle said that during his chairmanship the volume of appeals had increased by between 20 and 25 per cent.  He had been appointed by Mr. Tully.  This <Col N="1023" /> change in the board membership will not reduce by one day the waiting period in respect of appeals decisions.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in introducing the Second Stage of the Bill the Minister used the April figures to justify in some way his decision to remove the board.  Why did he not use the May figures?  Perhaps in replying to this debate he will tell us the number of appeals decided by the board in May instead of simply using older figures.  It is not true that since the increase in staff that he approved, and which I approved also, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of decisions? The Minister said in his speech that additional administrative staff have been made available by the Department in recent times to deal with the bottleneck in the flow of cases to the board.  The whole bottleneck has been at the staff and inspectorate level, but to use that situation as a means of casting doubts on the integrity, the decency and the honesty of the members of the board and on a former High Court judge is, to say the least, contemptuous and it comes from an administration led by Garret the Good.  Where will arise the level of decency and honour in the vested interests that will be appointed by the Minister to the board?  In section 7 there is provision for the nomination of certain bodies who will submit to the Minister a number of names from which we will decide who is to be appointed.  But he will retain the power, despite what he says publicly, to appoint the members because it is proposed that if he does not like the names put forward he can request that other names be proposed.  He may continue to do that until he finds the person whom he considers to be a satisfactory individual.</P>
    <P>The Minister attempts to say that by changing the composition of the board additional jobs will be created in the building industry.  This is the same Minister who on his first day in the House as Minister for the Environment replied in response to a question from me that there would be 30,000 starts in the house building sector this year.  I reminded him then <Col N="1024" /> that he should be careful, that he was on his first day here as Minister.  In other words, I gave him the opportunity to retract, but he persisted in saying that that would be the number of houses started this year.  Two months later the Government introduced a budget which removed £220 million from the capital budget.</P>

      <P>This Bill has been described as being the saviour of the building industry and as a measure that will reduce dramatically the unemployment figures.  If the Minister is serious about the problems of dereliction in our cities or about the problems of planning, he might tell us what has happened to the Urban Authorities Bills which we had before the House and which were designed to give new life to the inner city of Dublin?  What has happened to the Bill relating to the Custom House dock?</P>

The Minister would not even meet Judge Murnaghan.  When people accept responsibility and accept nominations by a Government to boards, whether the board of a youth employment agency, the board of the Dublin Gas Company or of Aer Lingus, the least they deserve is the respect of any incoming administration. They do not deserve to have their characters, their families and their lives generally subjected to smear and insinuation that is without foundation.</P>
      <P>The Minister has done a disservice to the democratic process by attempting to justify his actions and by casting doubts on the honesty and integrity of men without in any way trying to justify these doubts and accusations.

      <P>Obviously, one cannot discuss this guillotine motion without referring to what is proposed to be guillotined, namely, the Bill.  If ever there was a Bill that should not be the subject of a guillotine motion at this stage of debate, it is the Bill in question.  I say this, first, because of the serious implications of the Bill, for the people most directly concerned, the members of the planning appeals board, secondly, because of the implications it has for this or any other planning board and thirdly, because of the implications it has for other boards appointed by the Government from time to time.  It also has implications for the quasi-contractual arrangement and security of tenure which exist in respect of people who accept a Government's invitation to become members of a board.  This Bill requires both on Second Stage and Committee Stage very detailed analysis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Each of us brings a <Col N="1026" /> subjective view to bear on any legislation that comes before us depending on the side of the House we are on.  We are only being given four hours to have what the Minister calls a full opportunity to discuss Committee Stage.  That is flying in the face of reality.  It is flying in the face of what we must do to discharge our responsibility.</P>
      <P>As regards the urgency for the Bill, the key to this is to be found in the Minister's speech.  He said that without implying any reflection on the persons concerned he would have to say that the circumstances surrounding some of the appointments and especially their timing could have no other effect than to seriously detract from the public perception of the board as an independent and unbiased tribunal.  The main urgency apparently derives from the lack of confidence the public would have because of the timing of the appointments.  That is the Minister's case.</P>
      <P>If it is a question of timing, then the Ceann Comhairle, as a former member of a Government and the Taoiseach, must be very conscious of the fact that if the timing disqualifies in some way in the public mind the people appointed to a board there are a number of people in the Judiciary, in high office, on semi-State boards and so on whose capacity to hold and win public confidence is being questioned by the Bill.  I am speaking particularly about the interregnum between the election of 1977 and the result of that election.  If they are interested in ensuring that no appointments are made after the people have made their decision and if that principle is being introduced by the Government let them say so clearly.  Let them say that for the first time they are suggesting that after an election has taken place no appointments should be made until the new Government comes into office.  That would represent a very dramatic change on the part of a Government of which the Taoiseach and you, a Cheann Comhairle, were members who broke all precedents in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are about five members on this side of the House who were members of the Government in 1973 when the change <Col N="1027" /> occurred.  I was one of them.  I recall very clearly that we made only one appointment in the period between the date of the election and the coming into office of the new Government.  The exception was that we appointed a person to the board of the Central Bank.  This had been on the Government agenda for two weeks and it was decided that the person should be appointed.  We left numerous vacancies unfilled in the semi-State area.  That of Master of the High Court, a prestigious appointment, was subsequently filled by a former Member of the House with a Fine Gael interest within about a week of the coming into office of the new Government. Contrast that with what happened after 1977.  The Coalition Government at that time had a precedent to guide them. It was the precedent of the outgoing Fianna Fáil Government who did not fill any appointment, with one exception. The Coalition Government, after the people had rejected them, perhaps more clearly than ever before in the history of the State filled many vacancies in a short period before the new Government came in.  Among them was a former Deputy of the House who had been defeated in the election.  They made many appointments to semi-State bodies and the Judiciary. Before I came to the House from the Law Library I was aware that an appointment was being considered and that on the day before we came back to office.</P>
    <P>If the Minister's argument about timing is relevant and if the public have no confidence in the people concerned because of the timing of their appointments, surely that argument extends also to those who were appointed to the Judiciary, State bodies and so on in similar circumstances by the Coalition Government which was rejected by the people. The present Taoiseach was a member of that Government who set that most undesirable precedent.  They cannot say that the record of any Fianna Fáil Government enabled them to do this.  It was a precedent and an outrageous one. They set the precedent and we are now being told they want to correct the damage they say is being done to public confidence regarding appointments made in <Col N="1028" /> the interregnum in respect of the planning board.</P>
    <P>The implications of this extend beyond the board.  They extend to several people I know personally serving on the Judiciary, to members of the Land Commission and to numerous people on the boards of State bodies.  Does the Minister acknowledge that the argument undermines the confidence people should have in various appointments made, presumably, with the enthusiastic support and consent of every member of the then Government, including the present Taoiseach? Some of us have a little more experience and the Government of which I was speaking, of which I was a member, held office over ten years ago.  There are five of us still here but there are only two or three Fine Gael Members who were involved in the Coalition Government.  If we are to present a new impression we must correct the damage done by this Government's predecessors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the motion.  There is much to be said for the notion that no appointments should be made during an <Col N="1029" /> interregnum, as has been the practice of previous Fianna Fáil Governments.  The people who began the practice can illafford to imply that because of one particular instance something was wrongly done.  I do not accept that it was wrongly done but it followed the precedent established by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>Before reading this morning's papers I took the opportunity of looking at the legal implications.  Paragraph 6 of the Schedule to the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1976, states:</P>
      <P>Where the chairman of the Board is a person who formerly held judicial office, the Government may remove him from the chairmanship if he has become incapable through ill-health of effectively performing his duties, or if he has committed stated misbehaviour, or if his removal appears to the Government to be necessary for the effective performance by the Board of its functions and in case a chairman of the Board is removed under this Article the Government shall cause to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas a statement in writing of the reasons for the removal.</P>
      <P>There is a similar provision in paragraph 10 in respect of ordinary members of the board.  It so happens that the chairman of the board is a person who formerly held judicial office and he is to be removed from his office as chairman.  I should like a clear indication from the Minister that not one of the criteria for that removal applies in the case of the chairman or any other member.  If timing is their failure, that is not good enough.  Has the Minister indicated to any one of these people that he is incapable through ill-health or stated misbehaviour or otherwise?  If not, then he is removing people from office in a way that was never contemplated either in this legislation or in the Constitution. He is enacting legislation to break a legally binding contract.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When a person accepts a whole-time position, as the chairman did, there is a clear contract between the person accepting and the person inviting and it can only be terminated in the law.  We are being <Col N="1030" /> asked to terminate <i>ex post facto</i> a contract by legislation undermining guarantees under existing legislation.  The Minister has a certain degree of legal experience, though I may be a bit longer in the legal tooth than he.  He does not know the implications of what he is doing.  Similar provisions apply to the Judiciary, the board members of semi-State bodies and others and if people are to be removed because of stated misbehaviour it must come before us in this House.  If we were to amend various other Acts by introducing legislation because we could not bring forward any valid reasons for the removal of a person or persons, then we would be moving into a dangerous minefield.  We would hardly go as far as amending the Courts of Justice Acts because the Constitution would prevent us.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no argument to sustain his case.  A Minister from our side would probably appoint different people to a planning board than those who would be appointed by a Minister on the other side.</P>

      <P>It is important, if the Minister thinks that those people have been incapable and unfit for membership of the board, that we be told so clearly by the Minister.  Did he get a complaint from some reliable source &mdash; I am not talking about the usual anonymous reports that come in all the time &mdash; that those people were unreliable or that they have been guilty of misbehaviour of some kind?  I know they were not.  If they were not, can the Minister not see the danger of sweeping aside the essential characteristics of appointments by Governments, especially those which can be terminated when they are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas?</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister hints about allegations of political influence.  Has he had any complaints or allegations about improper decisions by the members of An Bord Pleanála?  Is the Minister saying that in future persons will not make allegations against members of the board? That would be achieving the impossible because it is impossible that allegations and charges will not be made.  If the Minister thinks, in his innocence and virtue, that complaints and allegations will not be made because there will not be political involvement, then he is not living in a real world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that allegations against the board will never arise again because An Taisce or other bodies will have recommended their appointments?  There is provision in the Bill whereby the Minister can go back to the selection committee and say he does not like a nominee or nominees.  He has said that the public can be given a guarantee about these appointments because things will be done in a certain way.  He is misleading himself if he thinks that will be the case.  Politics, by definition, is not a dirty business though it becomes subject to pressures, but if it is being implied that people appointed by Governments are tainted and unsuitable, we on this side reject that implication <Col N="1032" /> totally because we are elected by the people and answerable to the people and we must take decisions for the people.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will indicate when he is replying whether he has got complaints about the members of An Bord Pleanála.  If he has, he should let us know the nature of the complaints, as he should have done to the people concerned.  If he has not got complaints, why does he find it necessary to describe those people as being unqualified.  The Minister used the wretched cliché &ldquo;political football&rdquo; in another context on television.  He says he is taking the political taint away from this body.  He stated his position in regard to the divorce matter but if we are to kick a political football&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is clear that it is not the procedures of the board that have been responsible for delays in deciding planning appeals.  The fault was in the lack of inspectors.  That is what caused delays.  Matters could have been dealt with more quickly and efficiently if an adequate number of inspectors had been appointed.  Such appointments were sanctioned but not finalised.  The Minister implied that the delays were caused by the board.  The delays were caused by inadequate administrative arrangements and lack of staffing.  The Minister should make this quite clear and deny the implication that the board have been failing. That should be stated clearly.</P>
      <P>This provision in the Bill was not introduced because the board have been responsible for not getting the appeals out more quickly or because they have been guilty of misbehaviour.  It is because they were appointed by a Fianna Fáil Government, and that being the case many people in high offices, judges, commissioners and others, will equally be disqualified.  We did not treat such appointees in this peremptory fashion. The Minister must acknowledge these points.  In <i>The Irish Press</i> of 23 May last the Minister is quoted as having said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe if this is handled properly <Col N="1033" /> we can set up a totally independent board.</P>
    <P>There is the implication again that the board are not totally independent.</P>

      <P>Let us hear the obvious reasons in the Minister's reply. This will be important if what we see in this morning's papers is factual.  People will want to know in the course of pursuing their legal remedies if there is an implication that they have not been acting in a totally independent and impartial way.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of May 23 goes on to say that the board will be selected by a body independent of political influence. The same implication is there.</P>
      <P>I want to remind the Minister that, in going for what seems to be superficially an attractive way of doing things and winning, it would appear, a certain amount of superficial popularity at the moment, he is denigrating the political process.  Instead of upholding standards he is undermining them, not just in this area but across the whole range of the Judiciary, the Land Commissioners, and so on.  He should reflect very carefully before he forces us to do all these things through a guillotine motion.  We are being given three hours on Tuesday, the Minister of State said.  I thank him very much.</P>

      <P>My contribution will be brief.  I will start by stating that I am opposed to the application of the guillotine motion because of the serious consequences of the passage of this Bill without adequate time to tease out its implications.  Section 10 (1) of the Bill to my mind is the heart of the matter:</P>
      <P>The person who, immediately before the commencement of this subsection, held the office of chairman of the Board, shall, on such commencement, cease to be chairman.</P>
      <P>That is expressed in the cold words of the legal draftsman.  What it conceals of course is that a distinguished judge of the High Court is being sacked from a job for which he was eminently suitable, a job which he was fulfilling with great competence and to the admiration of any unbiased person who knew of the activities of the planning board.  Judge Murnaghan was chosen because of his reputation for rugged individualism and integrity.  I am proud to say he comes from a strong northern family noted for their contribution north and south to the legal life of the whole country, the Six Counties and the Twenty-six Counties.</P>
      <P>Section 10 (2) provides:</P>
      <P>Every person who, immediately before the commencement of this subsection was an ordinary member of the Board, shall, on such commencement, cease to be such ordinary member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to guillotine this Second Stage without consideration of the implications of this new legislation, of the precedent which this legislation is about to establish.  I served as Minister in a Department which had under their aegis many semi-State bodies.  Many members of those semi-State bodies were appointed by a Coalition Government. Without mentioning specifically any one individual, one chairman of a semi-State body came to me and told me straight out that he was not merely a Fine Gael <Col N="1035" /> appointee but a Fine Gael supporter.  I found him to be a man of the greatest integrity, of the greatest competence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the greatest expertise in the field he was dealing with. He was serving on that board practically to the detriment of his own business career.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>All he was getting from the State was peanuts.  I accepted that he had been appointed by a Coalition Government.  I accepted that he was a supporter of the Fine Gael Party.  He was an able man.  He was a forceful man.  He had expertise which he was deploying for the benefit of the country.  There was no way I would countenance interfering with him for the full period of his office in that semi-State body.</P>
      <P>What kind of precedent is being set by section 2 of the Bill which the Government are seeking to push through by applying a guillotine?  The House knows full well the implications of section 10 for future members of semi-State bodies, whatever their expertise may be, whatever their competence may be, whatever their integrity may be in their field.  The point has been made very eloquently and very articulately by Deputy Kelly that we should use all the expertise we can, no matter what people's political affiliations are, for the benefit of the semi-State bodies and eventually for the benefit of the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the implications of section 10 if future Governments start waving their tomahawks as soon as there is a change of Government, and start looking for scalps because they do not agree with the political allegiance of people who are doing a good job in a semi-State body? The whole semi-State sector could be and will be thrown into chaos if this Bill passes through this House inadequately discussed because of this guillotine motion. What do we find facing us in the future? We find utter chaos and an utter disregard for people's competence and expertise <Col N="1036" /> in their own field.  It will be very difficult to get people to serve if by hint, innuendo and indirect slur this House does not stand by the people who are serving on those boards.</P>
    <P>I am sick, sore and tired of this type of statement: &ldquo;I do not mean to cast any aspersions on the members of the boards as of now.&rdquo;  It is reminiscent of the scandal sleuths in the cheap papers: &ldquo;We wish to deny that it is a fact that Mr. Knickerbocker was seen escaping by ladder from the third floor bedroom at such an address.  There is no truth in this rumour.&rdquo;  That is the type of innuendo and aspersion we hear suggesting that there is something wrong with a board which has been serving the country well and which is manned by people of integrity.</P>
    <P>There are people who want to serve.  I mentioned already that many of these people spend their time working for semi-State bodies &mdash; I am not talking in particular about the planning board &mdash; and the time they spend there for a few ha'pence of directors' salary as far as they themselves and their interests are concerned could be better spent on their own businesses.  If we in this House do not stand by them and do not respect them for the work they do no matter what their political affiliations may be, the time will come when we will find it very difficult to get men of ability and integrity to serve on these boards.  That is a most important matter which should be teased out on Second Stage, Committee Stage, Report Stage and all Stages of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>A small number of the administrative staff attached to local farm development service offices have been temporarily redeployed to deal with other schemes. This redeployment was necessary for the operation of the schemes in the most economic way.  While some delays in the processing of applications may have resulted under the western drainage scheme, the position will be rectified when the staff resume their normal duties.  The situation is being closely monitored to ensure that any delays are kept to the minimum.</P>
      <P>Because of the severe pressure on Exchequer resources it has not been possible to make any revision recently in the standard national costings used to determine the amount of grant aid under the western drainage scheme.  The matter is, however, kept under continuing review.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, for administrative purposes, there are peaks and valleys in all offices. I understand from personnel section that the reason for this was that, in certain offices of which I am not aware &mdash; because it would be a different problem in the various counties &mdash; they have been switched around particularly in the past two months or so.  I understand that most people who left the various offices will be returning there very shortly and I understand that to be four to five weeks.</P>

In my county there is about one and a half year's work to be done and we would need a further 50 per cent increase in the staff there to have that work carried out.

      <P>One could hazard a guess that it is a very small figure for each county.  Would the Minister agree that the Programme for Western Development <Col N="1040" /> has not been implemented as envisaged, because it appeared on its accouncement that it would have transformed the twelve western counties? Would he agree that instead it has been rendered so restrictive between its qualifying limits and method of operation that very few do qualify?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect, a Cheann Comhairle, that would be one of the first questions to be asked on one of the most important subjects with regard to the £300 million Programme for Western Development.  I should be given an opportunity to ask the Minister whether he agrees with its system of operation.  It is only fair that we should do so at a time when the farm modernisation scheme has been withdrawn, while there is an opportunity afforded within the limits of the western counties scheme for facilitating many of those farm modernisation scheme applicants who fell by the wayside. I would ask you, Sir, to give the Minister an opportunity to make a comment on the questions I have asked.</P>

I did not do that.  I just asked him whether he was satisfied with the method of operation, whether it met the demands of that area.  I would ask that he be given an opportunity to comment because I know he is very concerned about that scheme for those counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will consider removing the income anomaly on off-farm employment so that farmers can qualify for headage grants both for cattle and sheep; the number of people who do not qualify because of the restriction; the number of cattle and sheep; and the estimated saving to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>If headage grants at existing rates were paid to all part-time farmers in the disadvantaged areas, about 11,000 farmers who were disqualified from payment of grants on some 125,000 cattle and 50,000 sheep since the limit on off-farm income was introduced in 1979 would be brought back into the schemes.  The abolition of the off-farm income limit would involve an extra cost to the Exchequer in the first year of £4.5 million and would mean that less resources would be available to those most in need, that is, full-time farmers and those with low off-farm earnings.  In these circumstances, I do not propose to remove the limit.</P>
      <P>The maximum cattle and sheep headage payment per livestock unit permitted by the EEC under the disadvantaged areas schemes is 97 European currency units equivalent to some £67 per head on adult cattle and £10 per head on sheep. To increase the current rates here to the permitted maximum would involve extra expenditure by the Exchequer of about £38 million in the first year and this also could not be justified in present circumstances.</P>
      <P>Any questions in regard to income tax and VAT payable by farmers in the disadvantaged areas are a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>My question referred to the loss he expected arising out of paying headage to part-time farmers and I was thinking that perhaps, with the introduction of income tax on all farmers, since half the headage is paid by the EEC and half by our own Government, then if farmers fall within the tax net the <Col N="1046" /> Government would be getting back almost all of its contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Deputy ask a question?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I only want the Minister to understand why I asked the question. I want the Minister to indicate if he can do a calculation on this in view of the changed situation with regard to income tax and if he could consider there might be only a small loss in bringing these farmers back into the headage scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, it would not be safe to assume that the Exchequer would get a return in taxation of certain moneys paid into the disadvantaged areas for the simple reason that no matter what the tax rate might be, unfortunately it is most unlikely that many farmers in these areas will ever have a taxable income.  It would be much better for them and the State if they had.  For that reason it is difficult to assume one would get a great deal of money.  It is something in which I have an interest and I shall certainly be looking at some of the figures involved but, because of the low income of the farming community in the west, there would not be a taxable income at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the attractions of this scheme is the fact that 50 per cent of the cost incurred is paid by the EEC and it would not be economic to use this scheme to increase the national herd by the extinction of the scheme at the full rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be hard to argue with Deputy Walsh's assumption. We are in fact getting reimbursed from Europe on a £ for £ basis.  This system has been in operation for a number of years and the problem is that we have to take note of the budgetary situation here. As well as that you have the problem that a number of areas which should be included in severely handicapped areas are not in at all.  An in-depth look is being taken at the situation but for a variety of reasons it has not been possible <Col N="1047" /> over a number of years to increase the headage payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it did not make sense in this budget year to restrict the qualifying limits for cattle headage grants and at the same time any person with another form of employment had to pay tax from zero? There was no £20 allowance.  Do the two things make sense in the confines of the budget itself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem was that within the confines of the budgetary measures, there was not enough money to go around.  The Government wanted to ensure that full-time small farmers and people with very low off-farm incomes got the money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking about part-time farmers.  Unless these people with sizeable farms have very big families, they will automatically be in the tax net.  Therefore the money paid to them through headage grants will be given back to the Government leaving the country and the farmers better off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the headage grants ever be given again to the people who do off-farm work?  Some people on unemployment get more than the limit for an off-farm worker.  Any small farmer doing off-farm work at present will not get this headage grant.  These grants <Col N="1048" /> should be given to small farmers in the disadvantaged areas so that people working but earning very small wages will qualify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of carrying out inspections under the various headage schemes in the severely handicapped areas in 1983 is about £1½ million or some 2.5 per cent of the grants totalling £63½ million payable to farmers in those areas.</P>
      <P>As regards spot checks, I would refer the Deputy to my written reply on 3 May to an earlier question by him.  In view of the need to guard against fraud and because of EEC requirements particularly in respect of the calf premium scheme, it is not possible now to rely on spot checks although they were used to a limited extent in 1982.  Every effort is, of course, made to simplify administration of the seven different types of livestock headage schemes now in operation and, in fact, considerable operational savings have been achieved through the use of composite application forms, common reference dates and single on-farm inspections for different schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned £5 million.  Does that take into account the fact that most of the officers employed will be sitting in their offices because of the restriction on this and other schemes?  Is their full salary taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's question relates to the working of the scheme this year.  There are 130 permanent inspection staff plus a total of 68 borrowed from other Departments and we take due note of their salaries.  Every effort has been made to ensure that for most farmers only one visit from an agricultural officer will be required.  This is a big step forward.  When one considers that the total headage payments for the entire country is £103 million this year it gives some idea of the tremendous number of inspections one would have if they were not channelled and done in a programmed manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that those 68 men are unemployed <Col N="1052" /> because they have no work in the FMS offices?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the inspection costs at least as much again because of the fact that farmers have to be involved as well as agricultural inspectors?  The disturbance to lifestock and the disruption of routine on the farm involves a serious cost that could be avoided if spot checks were carried out as they are in Northern Ireland.  If that were carried through and if severe penalties were imposed there is no question but that immense savings could be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very basic difference between the way we operate here and the way they operate in Northern Ireland.  They have a statutory system of herd and flock books which they have used over the years.  We have not got that.  The nearest we have come to it is the herd book that we had to have this year for the calf premium scheme.  There was a very enlightened approach taken to farmers who had less than four cows for inspection last year. Over 14,000 herd owners with very small herds were asked to send the cards to the local offices without an inspection.  I regret to say that in the majority of cases it just did not work out.  That was a major attempt to streamline the business and for a variety of reasons it did not work out.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider asking the payments section of his Department when sending out cheques for headage payments to put some note with the cheque, even the herd number, because of the confusion it causes every year when people get cheques with no reference to what scheme they relate to or even to the individual farmer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Irrespective of what I think, the payment was given on the basis of a supplement for farmers in disadvantaged areas.  My personal view is that it is a spark to production in the sense that people generally regard this payment as being connected with livestock improvement and additional cattle. Despite all the payments over the years we do not seem to have many more cattle on our farms but there are many other reasons for that as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware it is generally accepted that over the years we have been paying the minimum amount for cattle headage and that we did not approach it in a positive way at any time?  Does the Minister not also agree that by bringing this down from £5,400 to £3,500 or £67 a week, less than any man and his wife would be receiving on supplementary benefit, they are removing any incentive for people to increase their herds or improve conditions on their farms?</P>

      <P>The Minister mentioned the herd and stock book in Northern Ireland.  This would simplify inspections and would help to curb the incidence of disease.

Would the Minister consider the possibility of having a phasing out rather than a complete cut-off point at a particular figure?

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary aim of the Land Commission in acquiring bog was the provision of turbary for smallholders in need of household supplies. When their demands are satisfied, any balance is allocated to cottiers and other local applicants.  If significant areas of bog are not otherwise required, they are offered for sale to Bord an Móna, cooperatives or other concerns engaged in the harvesting of turf.</P>
      <P>The total area of turbary held by the Land Commission is 25, 836 acres of which 1,445 acres are in County Galway.</P>

These people seem not to be making any progress or getting any recognition.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has so rightly pointed out, it would appear that in the last number of years the Land Commission have more or less eased out of this operation.  This is for a variety of reasons.  Even five or six years ago there was no great demand for turbary rights, but because of the fuel situation the demand for these has increased again.  I will ask the area Land Commission officers around the country to take stock of what is happening with a view to following up the Deputy's suggestion.</P>

Further, there is not much point in the Minister coming up with new proposals for land restructuring when in County Galway and every county we have long lists of estates, ranging as high as 155 hectares in a case in Galway, which need to be divided and farmers dearly need the land.</P>

      <P>There is a hidden danger in the Minister's reply.  Can he give a clear indication to this House that the development work, equipment and buildings which have been approved in his Department but not by his people on the ground &mdash; the advisory service &mdash; will be grant-aided?  These people have complied with every regulation and their applications have been caught in the post, or something like that.  Is he now going to penalise those farmers because they were progressive and did what the Department of Agriculture advisers told them to do, or will he accept a fresh application for the work already carried out?</P>

      <P>If the Minister is not giving in on any other point I would appeal to him to reconsider his decision in relation to forcing those farmers to make new applications in November next in view of the fact that many of them applied for the grants as far back as February 1981, a year before the scheme was suspended.  In these circumstances would <Col N="1065" /> the Minister at least make a decision now that farmers who had applied before the scheme was suspended and who, through no fault of their own but because perhaps of slowness on the part of the Department in proceeding with the applications had not received approval, would not have to make new applications and possibly have to wait for another six to 12 months after November next?</P>

However, I must reiterate that for a long time the practice of the Department has been that before a farmer was grantaided he had to have prior written approval.</P>

One is the situation of applications which were in the office prior to the closing date but which were not processed because, perhaps, of pressure of work.  In those circumstances the farmers concerned should be entitled to have the grants processed.  The second aspect is that where there had been a visit by an official of the Department, the grant should be paid if only for the sake of the credibility of the official concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was dealing with the guillotine motion and the dangerous precedent which was being set.  I outlined the experience I gained when dealing with semi-State bodies where members and chairmen with different political affiliations were appointed by the Coalition Government but whose expertise, integrity and enthusiasm put them in a category apart.  If one were to follow the lead which has been given in this whole disgusting process then each time there was a change of Government the tomahawks would be out, scalps would be sought and there would be general disruption in this area where civic-minded people have been giving good service over the years since Seán Leamass began the whole system of semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>If this is the kind of treatment that will be meted out to people we will find it very hard to get civic-minded people to serve on these boards.  There are people who want to make a contribution even when they lose money in their own business or profession.  It will add to the growing lake of cynicism about public affairs and public life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us contrast what is happening now with what happened last February. During the last general election campaign members of the Youth Employment Agency were appointed.  Deputy Kavanagh, as Minister for Labour, was the person responsible at the time.  We took over on 9 March.  On 8 March the chief executive of the Youth Employment Agency was appointed.  This appointment was attacked by a very prominent Fine Gaeler. We used to receive letters from him. He is now an adviser in that Department. What did Deputy Gene Fitzgerald do in March of last year to his eternal credit? He defended the appointment against attack.  In other words, he followed the tradition of standing by appointments made and allowing the people appointed an opportunity to give service to the country.  This was despite the fact that they were blatantly political appointments. <Col N="1091" /> That did not necessarily hinder them from giving good service.</P>
    <P>The Government, in trying to push the Bill through the House by way of guillotine motion, are doing a great disservice to the tradition which has built up and was honourably followed, as I just mentioned, by Deputy Fitzgerald as Minister for Labour.  He was not defending his own appointees but rather those of the then Opposition.</P>
    <P>I was perturbed by the attack made in the House during the course of the debate on members of local authorities.  Such an attack can only come from a person who does not know the history of local government in this country and how much it meant in the last century to the people to have effective local government.  The grand jury system was the one which obtained up to the last decade of the last century and it was responsible to no one. It was regarded as a great step forward to have the 1898 Act on the Statute Book. People on both sides of the House should reject the kind of ignorant and narrowminded criticism made of members of local authorities.  The people who took over in the counties which the Ceann Comhairle and I have the honour to represent discovered the inefficiency and crookedness of the grand jury within a year despite the fact that in every prestigious English paper at that time we were told the Irish could not govern themselves even at local level.</P>
    <P>The point has already been made in the debate about who tries a man.  Who come to a decision as to whether one of our fellow citizens is guilty or innocent of a charge but a jury of 12 people picked at random?  Despite problems on occasion, that system has stood the test of time.  In the same way the non-technical person, the non-expert, the person with intelligence who is aware of what is going on in public life and in the community has a valuable input to make on any board.  We could have a line of architects from Vitruvius down to the present time on a planning board and they would drive the whole country mad.  There are sensible architects and there are mad architects. A person with commonsense is an important <Col N="1092" /> ingredient on any committee or board.  Criticism has been made of the board.  The only criticism I could make of them is that they never did what I asked them to do when I made representations to them, whatever their political affiliation. I would say that is the experience of Members on both sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Did they get the tools for the job?  We are told on the best of evidence that they did not.  The whole apparatus which was supposed to serve them was seconded on a seven-year basis and there was no proper back-up of civil servants available to them to speed up planning appeals. The delay which has taken place in dealing with appeals is something of a scandal. There is a remedy but it is not this kind of pseudo-reforming Bill.</P>
    <P>I remember being shocked years ago, before I had any intention of standing for Dáil Éireann, when talking to a senior civil servant, an honorable and efficient man.  During the course of a social conversation he told me much the same as the prestigious English newspapers were saying during the last decade of the nineteenth century, that he did not believe we were capable of local government and was doubtful whether local authorities such as county councils, urban councils, town commissioners or corporations should exist.  It is one of the hazards of administration at senior level that the officers get it into their heads that they have the sum total of expertise, knowledge and ability.  Part of the function of this House is to disillusion them on that.</P>
    <P>I see some evidence in this Bill of that kind of principle.  For that reason we on this side are fully justified in fighting it every inch of the way.  I would appeal even at this stage to the Minister, who as a barrister must have had training in deduction and logic, to look at his Bill again, to take steps to improve the points I mentioned about the service of the Planning Board and the speeding up of decisions and to leave the general structure he found there.  In doing this he will be impacting not merely on the planning Bill but on a whole range of legislation which has been developed to deal with semi-State bodies.</P>

      <P>It gives me no great pleasure to speak in this debate because I believe the Local Government (Planning and Development) Bill, 1983, should not be before this House.  The need for the Bill is certainly questionable and I would ask why the Minister decided to give priority to it when it was decided not to give any priority to a Bill setting up an independent broadcasting authority.  I was told by several Ministers that it was impossible to bring a Bill before the House prior to the summer recess to enable the setting up of an authority to regulate the chaos which exists in broadcasting.</P>

      <P>From my experience in this House and my previous work in relation to design, architecture and building, I have always found An Bord Pleanála to be above and beyond suspicion and to have the highest possible integrity, acting under the chairmanship of a retired High Court judge. In the membership of the board there were people who had a knowledge of planning which allowed for clear-cut decisions on the recommendations made by civil servants working for the board who were formally attached to the Department of the Environment.  It was a reasonable, practical board, established by the former Minister for Local Government, Mr. James Tully, to which members were reappointed by Fianna Fáil Ministers.  In due course other members would have been appointed by the present Minister and nobody would have objected to this approach.  It would not have given rise to the controversy which has been caused by the introduction of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are approximately 200,000 people unemployed.  Why is there not a Bill before us to do something about that drastic problem?  The creation of jobs should be a priority, not a vindictive Bill introduced by vindictive Ministers <Col N="1094" /> against a fair and honourable board.  That is exactly what it is and I hope that is the way the public will perceive it.  They will not be manipulated by those who would try to project Fianna Fáil as opposing this Bill because they have some vested interest. We have no vested interest and we have confidence in An Bord Pleanála. The Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, must be playing a strong role behind the scenes in relation to this Bill because it has his fingerprints on it.  His imprimatur was obtained.</P>

I wish to express my views on the Bill and on the guillotine motion which has been put down by the Government in an unprecedented manner.  There is no reason why the Dáil session could not continue for another few weeks to enable the Bill to be discussed in detail.  The Government decision is an unorthodox step, particularly when it is well known that the Government Chief Whip had a good relationship with our Chief Whip, both in Government and out of Government. Unfortunately, this is being upset by this motion, totally unnecessarily.  In one hour and ten minutes the guillotine will descend.  This Bill will not create one job but it will remove people from jobs who had them already.</P>

      <P>The Minister knows from a letter that the Bill will be challenged in <Col N="1095" /> the courts, constitutionally and on a matter of fair play.  As a result, the Minister will be paying compensation for many years to come, money that is badly required to create jobs.  Members of the board who will be sacked will be entitled to compensation for the years that remain of their appointments.  The Minister will have to pay compensation because their reputations have been damaged.  His Department can ill afford that type of compensation.</P>

      <P>This Bill should be thrown out.  It should be rejected by the House.  We should be concerning ourselves with legislation which would give employment to young people and give opportunities to young people.  That is what we should be debating today, not this type of vindictive legislation throwing out one board and replacing them with another, a board which will be no better and possibly no worse than the present board.  The Government's attitude has laid down very strange rules for the future.</P>
      <P>Under a Bill going through the House at the moment the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982, the Minister will have power to nominate people to two boards.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, will make sure that he will be able to make the decisions.  He is a man who likes to make decisions even down to the level of cleaners in his Department.  I am sure he will want to make the decision on the membership of An Post and An Bord Telecom.  He will be appointing worker directors nominated by the trade union movement, and he will also have separate nominations reserved to himself and not recommended to him by a committee representative of consumers or anybody else. In the normal way I am sure he will appoint people of honesty and integrity, people who will contribute to the postal and telecommunications services.  That is the normal procedure.  That is the normal way.  The Minister for the Environment has adopted a new approach to the appointment of personnel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;a new principle as my colleague said, a principle which was never before accepted in this House by any Government.  In a sense they are running away from the responsibility of Government.  A Government Minister has the responsibility to run his or her Department in a certain way.  Before his appointment a Minister should be a person of integrity, and they usually are.  He is then in a position to appoint people of honesty and integrity to any board.  I cannot understand why the Minister has brought in a Bill to take away whatever powers he has and give them to nonelected people like members of An Taisce, the builders' federation and others to nominate people for appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possible too.  The Minister has not outlined in the Bill the qualifications of personnel to be nominated. We all know what happened in 1976-77 when the first board took over. The former Minister, Mr. Tully, appointed a friend, a colleague, a supporter of the Labour Party from his own constituency, a man who had a good knowledge in a certain field of activity, in the bakery business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and we did not object to him.  We did not throw him off the board when we took over in 1977.  He proved to be a competent person.  I never heard of any objections to him.  I never received any complaints about him.  As a county councillor I was slightly surprised at the time to find they were the type of personnel the Minister was putting on the board.  When we took office in 1977 we could have thrown out this individual, a Labour supporter, but since there were <Col N="1100" /> no complaints about him, and he was carrying out his functions quite satisfactorily and quite ably, we decided to leave well enough alone.  In due course we had an opportunity to appoint other people who were qualified.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Burke outlined today, people who were appointed by our administration, had served to a great extent on local authorities, had knowledge and experience of planning, had the experience of dealing with planning matters.  They are the standards which should be adopted by any Government or any Minister in appointing anybody to a board.</P>
      <P>The public should know that, before a person can be appointed a member of any board by a Minister, that person has to be scrutinised by the Garda.  The Minister has to have a report before he makes the appointment stating clearly that that person has no known record, that he is a man of personal integrity and that he can safely be appointed to any board.</P>

It is 15 minutes beyond the time at which the order says that the Tánaiste is to be called.  You ruled yesterday, a Cheann Comhairle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my point of order to you, Sir.  You ruled yesterday, Sir, that because this House made an order indicating that the Second Stage of a Bill would be taken on 8 June and because 8 June had been passed and that Second Stage was not taken on 8 June, therefore, that order of the House had been subrogated.  That was your ruling yesterday.  You said because it had not been taken on 8 June the ruling of the House that it be taken by agreement of the Whips no longer applied.  We are in exactly the same position now, Sir.  It is a question of time now rather than date. The order of the House that the Tánaiste should be called upon at half-past four has passed and exactly in accordance with your ruling of yesterday I believe you must rule now, Sir, that the order of the House is negatived because the Tánaiste was not called at 4.30 and, therefore, he cannot be called now.  Perhaps you would rule on that, a Cheann Comhairle.  If I may say so I would not be prepared to <Col N="1109" /> accept an arbitrary ruling.  I would be very grateful if you would give me reasons for your ruling and if those reasons would be in accordance with the decision you gave yesterday about the order of the House for 8 June.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I ruled yesterday that a reference to agreement on 8 June did not apply.  That condition did not attach once 8 June had expired.  The order that has just been made now, in accordance with many precedents by the putting of votes in Private Members' Time and things like that frequently throughout the year, means at 4.30 or as soon as may be thereafter.</P>

We have now agreed to take the Estimates for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and Justice, and both will conclude tonight.  It is the first time that all the Estimates have gone through on debate in this House and it shows that we have been in full agreement.  The important point is that by agreeing on the rest of the business rather than doing it in any other way, the all-party committees and everything else will be taken next week.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £89,758,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>This revised Estimate provides for a total of £89,758,000 for the year 1983 as compared with an outturn figure of £85,037,000 for corresponding services in 1982, an overall increase of £4,721,000 or approximately 6 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal increases arising this year include £3,131,000 for Bord Fáilte's administration &mdash; tourism promotion expenses and £119,000 for that body's capital expenditure on tourism development works; £314,000 for Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, administration and general expenses on tourism-traffic development activities; £3,277,000 for Coras Tráchtála's administration and export promotion expenses.  The credit financing of certain capital goods exports provision is up by £390,000, while the provision <Col N="1120" /> for bread subsidy is up by £1,042,000.  The additional amount of £186,000 under the office machinery and other office supplies is to meet the cost of additional facilities for the Companies Registration Office and to provide weights and measures inspectors with the necessary equipment for carrying out tests as required under weights and measures legislation.  Post Office services are up by £155,000 because of higher postal and telephone costs.</P>
    <P>The most significant decreases are under export guarantee arrangements &mdash;decrease £489,000 &mdash; and £779,000 less for development of holiday accommodation due to some schemes nearing completion.</P>
    <P>Taking all the variations into account and with an expected increase in appropriations-in-aid &mdash; up by £527,000 &mdash; the net increase is £4,721,000.</P>
    <P>I might comment at this point, as a matter of interest, that both Bord Fáilte and Córas Tráchtála will also have recourse to additional funds which are provided in the Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Finance, under the Special Border Areas Programme Fund, to finance programmes aimed at improving the economic and social situation of the border areas in implementation of an EEC regional development measure.</P>
    <P>Invariably, Deputies would have many opportunities throughout the year to discuss various facets of my Department's operations because of the considerable volume of its business which comes before the House whether by way of legislation, motions or questions on specific matters.  On this, the occasion of my first presentation to the Dáil of the Estimates for my Department, I am, therefore, concentrating on those subjects which I consider call for particular mention at this junction.</P>
    <P>The first topic I shall deal with is the very important one of trade.  I am very conscious of the pressing obligations which are placed on me in my capacity as Minister responsible for international trade.  On the international scene my officials take part in various negotiations and discussions in relation to trade in bodies such as the European Communities, <Col N="1121" /> GATT, UNCTAD and OECD.  These activities represent a significant part of the work of my Department and their objective is to try to direct the affairs of those organisations towards decisions which will facilitate Irish trade. The ground rules for international trade are those of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and my Department played a prominent part with our Community partners in the GATT ministerial conference in November last which was, in a nutshell, seeking ways and means of increasing the flow of international trade. In addition, I am the Minister responsible for the affairs of Córas Tráchtála, the State body charged with the promotion and development of exports.  CTT with headquarters in Dublin operate through a network of offices abroad giving a variety of services and support to our exporters.</P>
    <P>Being an open economy Ireland is very dependent on foreign trade.  If we are to maintain existing employment and improve prospects for creating new employment we must seek to achieve the maximum growth in exports and, as a corollary, to improve the world-wide trading environment in which those exports may take place.  Indeed, the Programme for Government specifically recognises the place of exports in our plan for economic recovery.  We are, of course, also very dependent on imports for a considerable proportion of our energy and raw material requirements and that, in turn, places further emphasis on the need for increased exports so that the resultant earnings will pay for the imports and contribute to general economic well-being.</P>
    <P>It is therefore of vital importance that we should seek for, and contribute to, a system of international trade free from restrictions and barriers and, in so far as we can, try to ensure that the countries to which we export would not increase protection for their own industries at our expense.</P>
    <P>As I said, the conditions under which our foreign trade takes place are governed by Ireland's membership of the European Economic Community and by <Col N="1122" /> the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  As a result of our membership of the Community we have duty-free access for our exports to the member states of the EEC and because of a special agreement we also have the same access, in respect of industrial goods, to the EFTA countries...</P>
    <P>On a wider front the GATT provides a system of rules governing international trade which facilitates our exports to markets other than the EEC and EFTA.  On the other hand it will be appreciated that our obligations as members of the GATT and the EEC put strict limits on the extent to which we can protect Irish industries.  However, in certain very sensitive areas, such as textiles and clothing, we have been able to obtain some relief as a result of measures by the EEC to deal with the problem of imports from low-cost countries.</P>
    <P>In recent years the deepening world-wide recession has put increased pressure on all governments to take action to protect their industries and, taking the broad view, the progressive growth of restrictions on trade and the degree to which trade is being managed by special arrangements is very disturbing.  Trade between the EEC and Japan and between the EEC and the USA are areas of the international free trading system showing particular strain at present.  However, I hope that a continuing series of patient and co-operative discussions on the problems will avoid what could only be economically destructive trade wars.  I recognise that it is necessary for Ireland to make whatever constructive contribution we can to such negotiations and to strive, both in the EEC and in the GATT, to ensure that the multilateral trading system continues to function effectively.</P>
    <P>Still on the subject of the general business environment in which our trade takes place I now turn, specifically, to the markets of the EEC.  Apart from trade with countries outside the EEC, attention is now being increasingly given to the internal market of the Community. Formal obstacles to free trade between member states such as tariffs and quantitative restrictions were of course, removed in the early stages of the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1123" /> However, the problem of technical obstacles to trade remains and there has been increasing concern that these may prevent European industry from gaining the full benefit of the large EEC market. Increasing competition from Japan, the USA and newly industrialised countries has made it clear that European industry must adapt itself to take full advantage of the economies of the scale of the huge EEC market and the possibility of co-operation in research and innovation which it provides.</P>
    <P>Following on the decision of the heads of state of EEC member states, last December, four Council meetings on the internal market have been held.  Priority has been given to the possibility of obviating barriers to trade which might arise from having different standards or testing procedures in different countries and also to simplifying various customs formalities. Agreement may soon be reached on a procedure for certifying products coming from third countries and this would enable a large number of directives setting up Community standards to be finalised thereby facilitating trade in the products concerned.  A number of draft directives for simplifying customs formalities between member states has been examined by the Council and agreement has been reached on two such directives.</P>
    <P>At a later stage it is proposed to give consideration to such matters as freedom of establishment and trade in services, harmonisation of consumer protection measures and adjustments in relation to company law and patents, to which I will refer later.  Progress in securing the maximum degree of free trade within the Community is of considerable interest to Ireland.  About two-thirds of our exports of industrial products go to member states of the EEC and free access to a market of over 200 million people is of vital importance for the expansion of the exports of existing industry and the attraction of new export-orientated industry from abroad.  In a nutshell, the common purpose of all the measures proposed in relation to the internal market is the freeing of trade between member <Col N="1124" /> countries and this is advantageous for Irish exports.</P>
    <P>Because of my concern for the maintenance and increase of exports which, as I have already said, are crucial for economic recovery.  I have taken considerable interest in this matter and, either personally or through the Minister of State at my Department, have played an active part in the Council meetings on the internal market.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the question of the general climate for international trade, I come to our export performance.  In an era when nearly all the economic indicators show a dismal and depressing trend, that for exports, I am happy to report, continues on its upward slope.  As Minister with responsibility for international trade and exports I am, of course, heartened by the statistics but, more important, I would draw the attention of the House to the realities inherent in the continuing growth.  Were the figures to be stagnant or falling the economic crisis, already very worrying, would be far worse and the consequences for the balance of payments and for employment would be dire.  I cannot stress too much that a continued growth in export performance is one of the nation's key economic objectives.</P>
    <P>Because of our open economy Ireland's economic recovery depends to a considerable degree on the development of our exports &mdash; and the continued growth of this trade is vital because it is the basis for maintaining and creating employment in both manufacturing industry and services.  Notwithstanding the world economic recession, which shows hopeful signs of abatement, I am confident, on the basis of past performance and of the willingness of exporters to meet challenges with determination, that our exports will continue to grow. 1982 was a year of considerable achievement. Irish exports reached £5,690 million which was an increase of £915.5 million or a growth of 19 per cent over the performance in 1981.  Manufacturing industry, mainly electronics, pharmaceuticals, machinery and transport equipment, accounted for 61 per cent of the value of all goods exported and made an <Col N="1125" /> even bigger contribution to the increase in value over the previous year.  Exports of live animals and food, drink and tobacco accounted for £1,704 million and, in turn, represented an increase on the 1981 performance.  The significant elements in those categories were a recovery in meat sales and an upsurge in exports of drink.</P>
    <P>By any standards, therefore, our export performance in 1982, notwithstanding the very difficult world trading conditions which prevailed, was a highly creditable one.  Accordingly, it is my pleasant duty to put on the record of this House my congratulations to our exporters for their very important contribution to our economy and for their splendid efforts in the face of severe difficulties.  In the same breath I urge them to persist with this very important business and wish them continuing success in 1983 and beyond.  In all of their activities our exporters have the valuable support of Córas Tráchtála and their services.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised Córas Tráchtála's vital role in economic recovery by allocating £16.2 million to it for 1983.  This represents an increase of £3.277 million or 25 per cent on last year's outturn and by any standards, particularly in times of public financial stringency, this is a generous allocation and an indication of the Government's concern. The increased allocation brings with it increased responsibilities and the necessity that all the funds made available for the development of exports be utilised with maximum effect.  As a measure of my concern I have established a high-level group comprising senior officials of both my Department and Córas Tráchtála to review existing export promotion policy and strategies, to analyse developments in our export markets and to reassess the spread of them, to set realistic targets for the different sectors of Irish industry and to ecourage the development of new export-orientated products.  I recognise that there are some sectors of industry which have continuously outshone others in terms of export performance and I have asked the group to consider how best to increase the dispersion of exporting sectors by learning <Col N="1126" /> from the approach of the most successful firms.  The objective of the group is to identify how Irish industry can best cope with changes on the international trading scene.</P>
    <P>Those longer-term activities will not diminish the more immediate promotional efforts of Córas Tráchtála which will be aimed, as far as possible, at maintaining existing employment.  Córas Tráchtála will provide national stands at 31 trade fairs across the world.  Trade missions will go to different countries including Saudi Arabia and Japan and store promotions will be organised to cities as diverse as Berlin, Toronto, Tokyo and New York to display Irish food, drink, clothing, knitwear, furnishings and giftware.  For my own part I will, of course, lend all my weight to these endeavours.</P>
    <P>Various eminent commentators have spoken of the deficiencies in Irish industry in relation to marketing.  I would agree that we are deficient in this critical area of business activity and that deficiency affects our exports.  I consider that in the cut and thrust of the modern international business world there is little hope of success for amateurs relying on opportunism alone.  On the other hand, any business activity that is carried out on the basis of a well planned marketing strategy which embraces the vital elements of research, analysis, design, promotion and after-sales service in relation to market demands, is assured of sustained profits.</P>
    <P>With my encouragement Córas Tráchtála are taking active measures to improve the quality of Irish marketing skills with their employment support scheme.  This scheme, introduced in 1981, involves the training of specialist export-marketing personnel and it has been applied to selected companies for which it is envisaged the executives will make a significant contribution to increased exports.  In its limited existence the scheme has given every indication of being successful and with substantial funds Córas Tráchtála have been enjoined to give it special attention again in 1983.</P>
    <P>During 1982 the UK continued to be <Col N="1127" /> our main market taking about 40 per cent of our exports; 32 per cent went to the other countries of the EEC and about 8 per cent to the USA.  There are, therefore, various other markets which present opportunities for our products and services such as those in the Middle East and South East Asia and I would like to see the rate of export growth to these areas accelerated.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware that as part of the quest for increased export earnings, the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act, 1983, and the Insurance Act, 1983, have recently been passed by the Oireachtas.  The former broadens the range of Córas Tráchtála's existing activity, which was mainly concerned with merchandise goods, by enabling them to promote and develop the export of service activities.  Their activities will be supplemented by the Insurance Act which extends the existing export insurance facilities, which already exist for goods, to the services activities.</P>
    <P>The services, specified by order, are those rated as having the greatest export potential and include a range as diverse as agricultural development, medical services, computers and various training services.  If these Acts achieve their objective of increasing the export of service activities, it follows that a new downstream demand for Irish manufactured goods will be the result and I am naturally hopeful about this outcome.</P>
    <P>While those hopes are high I am realistic enough not to magnify too much the contribution which the export of service activities can make to the balance of payments and, consequently, economic recovery.  With all the means at my disposal I will be encouraging those involved to realise the maximum growth possible in the export of services with attendant advantages for export earnings and job creation at home and abroad.  At the same time, I recognise, and the House should also recognise, that exports of services will never match up to our manufactured or agricultural exports, nor should they be viewed as making up for shortcomings in merchandise exports.</P>
    <P>If our hopes as regards exports are to <Col N="1128" /> be realised it is necessary to provide appropriate financial support to the firms involved.  I recognise the increasing importance of our export credit insurance operations as a valuable security for our exporters who must contend with conditions of intense competition and, from time to time, with financial instability in certain markets.  A new agreement has been reached with the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, which acts as my agent in relation to export credit insurance aimed at improving all aspects of the existing scheme.</P>
    <P>It is as well to explain that, taking one year with another, this scheme must operate at no net cost to the Exchequer &mdash; in other words premiums received should equal claims paid.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Hear, hear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to report that in 1983 the premiums expected as appropriations in aid under subhead M(3) &mdash; £1.3 million &mdash; should exceed the amount being provided in 1983 under subhead I.1.  This is very satisfactory when it is borne in mind that premiums must be pitched at as low a level as possible so as to minimise the cost to exporters.</P>
      <P>Also for the support of our exporters, there is the special scheme of credit financing for capital goods which normally attract from one to five years credit. The scheme is operated in accordance with the International Arrangement involving OECD countries and provides export credit finance at concessionary interest rates to exporters of capital goods.  The facility is administered by the Associated Banks on the security of export credit insurance documents and with the aid of the interest subsidy which is provided for in subhead I.2 &mdash; £2.459 million.  Generally the amount of the subsidy in any particular case relates to: the amount of export business financed; the gap between the concessionary interest rate to the exporter and the prevailing rate of interest at which the banks must get the funds; and the exchange rate of the Irish Punt in relation to foreign currencies, principally the dollar and sterling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1129" /> By way of further support for our exporters I am pleased to tell the House that during 1982, the working capital for exporters scheme was extended, in the aggregate from £10 million to £45 million. The scheme provides subsidised loans to meet the additional working capital requirements of small and medium-sized manufacturing industry and particularly exporting firms.</P>
    <P>This scheme which was introduced on the basis of the arguments and initiatives of my Department, is administered by the Industrial Credit Company and provides subsidised loans to meet the additional working capital requirements of small and medium-sized manufacturing industry and, particularly, of exporting firms.  While the loans under the scheme are provided in Irish Punts, the rates of interest are related to low interest-rate EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>The rate of interest charged to the borrower includes an exchange risk premium as well as a margin to cover credit risk. Loans are made to firms operating in accordance with an approved export development plan and while the up-take is rather slower than expected I am confident that it has an important role in funding any export efforts.</P>
    <P>As regards the operations of financial institutions generally in the area of trade-related finance, my Department have been pressing forward with consultations with most of the institutions with a view to the introduction of improved and more competitive schemes of export credit finance linked to export credit insurance; the involvement of a broader range of financial institutions than previously in the operation of the schemes; and the increased promotion and marketing of export credit insurance as a valuable security to Irish exporters as they diversify from traditional to new markets.  I am glad to inform the House, as I have announced publicly recently, that these discussions have been satisfactorily concluded.</P>
    <P>I would also remind the House that the current budget provides for the remission of VAT at point of importation on materials used by firms exporting 75 per cent of their output and this decision will provide <Col N="1130" /> a further very welcome boost to exporters.</P>
    <P>While on the subject of export credit insurance it is, of course, true to say that, in keeping with our trade policy, Ireland's trading pattern is diversifying from our traditional markets into expanding markets which present greater long-term opportunities for our export potential.  Some of these new markets, and particularly those in the Middle East, represent considerable medium to long-term potential but on a short-term perspective can be perceived as being volatile with resulting increased exposure for claims under export credit insurance.  It is, I think prudent that the Oireachtas should be advised of this risk and should recognise its possible financial consequences.</P>
    <P>There is a compelling need, however, to take a more long-term view of the returns accruing from the development of markets rather than the simple outturn of the export credit insurance scheme. This is the policy adopted by our competitors who, with a view to the development of exports, extend export credit insurance cover for particular projects or markets which, in their view, offer considerable potential for development.  It is clear that if we want to get new business, and to extend our export frontiers, we cannot dictate the terms ourselves, but must respond as best we can to the realities of the various markets.</P>
    <P>I think that all the foregoing activities and arrangements demonstrate clearly that I am sparing no efforts to carry out my duties and obligations as Minister responsible for international trade and in the national interest.  I would invite the co-operation of Deputies on all sides of the House to do anything they can to assist and encourage the development of our exports.</P>
    <P>In concluding this topic of my speech I might add that the making of economic forecasts is a dangerous exercise at the best of times but there is reason for cautious optimism about the prospect for the major world economies.  There are signs in the USA and elsewhere that the world may be entering a period of more general and more sustained recovery and various <Col N="1131" /> international gatherings have the objective of trying to get the world economy moving again.</P>
    <P>Turning now to tourism, let me say that the Government regard the tourist industry as an integral part of the economic life of the country.  The appointment of a Minister of State to my Department, to whom responsibility for tourism has been assigned, is indicative of the Government's commitment to this industry.  This commitment has been further underlined by the Government's decision to reduce the VAT chargeable on hotel and other similar accommodation. There is a clear appreciation in Government that tourism brings major economic and social benefits to Ireland through spending by foreign visitors.  The Government's objective is to nationally maximise the benefits accruing from overseas tourists and from domestic tourists, in the most cost-effective way, while, at the same time, ensuring an equitable spread of the advantages throughout the regions of the country.</P>
    <P>The negative factors prevailing in our society for the past few years continue to have their effect on the tourist industry. The years following 1979, which was a record year for the industry, proved difficult for several reasons; industrial relations problems and world recession affected 1980, and in 1981 good prospects were negatived by the Northern Ireland situation and attendant massive publicity overseas.  Over the last couple of years, of course, high inflation levels have continued to adversely affect the competitiveness of the industry.  Notwithstanding these difficulties, 1982 saw a marked revival in tourism and, while the early part of the year was slow, by early summer business had picked up significantly. Tourism earned £500 million of foreign currency in 1982.  Without these earnings the deficit in the balance of payments on current account, of course, would have been significantly higher.  In addition, spending by Irish people on holidays in Ireland put a further £260 million into circulation particularly in the more remote areas of the country.  The total value of tourism in 1982 was £760 million <Col N="1132" /> and represented a 2 per cent increase in real terms over the 1981 level.</P>
    <P>While there are signs that the world economic recession is easing, 1983 is likely to be a difficult year once again for tourism.  In their published tourism plan Bord Fáilte set a target of 4.5 per cent growth for this year.  As a positive support to Bord Fáilte in their efforts to reach this target, the Government have provided the board with a current expenditure allocation of £21.258 million &mdash; an increase of £3.131 million over the 1982 out-turn.  In real terms this represents an increase of about £1 million.  This additional money will be spent in expanding the board's promotional activities abroad.</P>
    <P>Proposed initiatives to help achieve the growth target set include effective marketing abroad of the country as an international tourist location, increased emphasis on the need for the private sector in tourism to complement the board's efforts by an even greater marketing presence and the encouragement of Irish people to opt to a greater extent for home rather than overseas holidays.  The possibilities of extending the tourist season will, in so far as possible, be pursued to ensure greater utilisation of tourist resources and to increase the profitability of enterprises engaged in the tourist business.</P>
    <P>The VAT reduction provided for in the Finance Act will be of particular assistance in this regard.  With effect from 1 May last the VAT chargeable on accommodation provided by hotels, guesthouses, hostels, holiday camps, motels and camping sites was reduced from 23 per cent to 18 per cent.  Ancillary activities carried on by hotels etc. such as the letting of conference rooms, ballrooms and various sporting facilities also benefit from this reduction.  This is a concession which had been sought by the industry and I am very pleased that it has been possible to grant it.  The decision is indicative of the clear appreciation by the Government of the high export content of tourism.  It has been warmly welcomed. I am sure it will be of real benefit to the industry and help it not only to earn more foreign currency for the <Col N="1133" /> economy but also to safeguard the jobs of those employed in tourism.</P>
    <P>This year, Bord Fáilte will be employing extra resources in the British market. A three-year programme is being launched aimed at raising awareness and improving the image of Ireland among potential British holidaymakers.  Ireland has an image problem in Britain which has caused our tourism industry to lose out on the growth in holiday-taking there in the past five years.  The goal of the new programme is to arrest this trend particularly in the principal segment of the market, among non-Irish-related holidaymakers. Bord Fáilte's long-term campaign will include advertising, publicity and public relations activities.  It would be foolish to expect immediate success from this programme.  The board has set itself a target of a 5 per cent increase in visitor numbers from Britain in 1983. Present indications are, however, that this target will be difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>On the North American market, promotional activities this year are geared to maintaining the 1982 growth in visitor numbers and to increasing the Irish share of US-Europe traffic.  In 1982 Ireland's performance, aided by attractive air fares and a strong US dollar, was well ahead of other European countries with an approximate 15 per cent increase in US traffic to Ireland.  However, there has been a reduction in our price competitiveness this year <i>vis-á-vis</i> other markets competing for American tourists and best estimates at this time would indicate a total traffic level similar to 1982.</P>
    <P>On the Continent, despite recessionary and other problems, there are also some encouraging signs.  For the first time in a couple of years it seems likely that we will have real growth on a number of markets.  In Germany &mdash; our most important market in mainland Europe &mdash; the level of advance bookings, coupled with a renewed interest in Ireland as a holiday destination, strongly supports this prediction. Even in France, where the recently introduced currency restrictions on foreign travel have created problems, there are still some grounds for optimism.  Bord Fáilte, working closely with Irish tourism interests have responded with revised <Col N="1134" /> holiday packages to meet this situation. In fact, Bord Fáilte had the distinction of being the first tourism body out on the market promoting new packages in the wake of the French measures.</P>
    <P>On the domestic front, the general outlook suggests that the holiday market both north and south will not be buoyant for 1983.  The market place is highly competitive and it will be a question of the industry fighting hard to maintain the trend towards an increased domestic market share of total Irish holiday spending.</P>
    <P>It is clear that if 1983 is to be a good year for Irish tourism the full commitment of the industry throughout the year is needed.  As costs within the industry rise, it is essential now more than ever that attention be paid to the key areas of value for money, standards and quality of service.  Ireland, putting it bluntly, is no longer a cheap country for the holidaymaker and it would be unrealistic to expect our tourism industry to compete purely on a basis of price with destinations which, for a variety of social and economic reasons, are cheaper.  If we cannot offer low prices, we can &mdash; indeed we must &mdash; offer value.  The only sensible way of tackling the problem of steeply rising costs and restricted demand as a result of the international recession is to increase the perceived value content of the product so that the customer is left in no doubt that the value he receives is as good, or even better than that offered by the competition.</P>
    <P>We must be careful, however, not to become so involved in our short-term difficulties that our long-term prospects are ignored.  It is essential that the industry is, when the upturn in the world's economy takes place, in a position to benefit from the anticipated growth in tourism business.  It is essential that the industry be sufficiently developed to handle the expected growth in the years ahead and have the flexibility to adapt its products to changing tastes and the innovation to create new products.  The Government for their part will continue to examine ways to ensure that the full potential of the tourist industry is reached.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> The accommodation development programme which includes the self-catering scheme and the caravan-camping scheme continues to aid the industry by encouraging the improvement and development of accommodation stock.  In addition, the £6 million provided by the European Investment Bank to the Industrial Credit Company to aid capital development in the tourist industry is now being supplemented by a further £4 million.  Another important contribution to tourism development has been the working capital scheme for tourism introduced in 1982. At that time £5 million was made available at preferential interest rates to enable tourism concerns to benefit from loans up to a maximum of £250,000 for periods of up to three years.  I am happy to say that, in the light of the considerable interest shown in the scheme and the rapid take-up of loans by the industry, it has been necessary to double the initial fund to £10 million.  This additional financing will undoubtedly be a boost to development in tourism.</P>
    <P>As I have said already the Government will continue to play their part to ensure the development of this valuable industry to the fullest extent.  I hope to bring legislation before the House shortly to raise the statutory limits on the amounts of money used by Bord Fáilte for capital development in the accommodation and amenity areas.  I may also use the occasion to propose one or two other legislative amendments.</P>
    <P>The House will be aware of the review of tourism policy which has been undertaken in my Department.  A significant factor which has emerged is confirmation that effective tourism marketing abroad is of the utmost importance.  Promotional publicity is considered to be a highly effective and indispensible policy approach to securing more overseas tourists. The Government accept this and, as I have already said, an extra £1 million in real terms, has been provided to Bord Fáilte for increased promotional activity in 1983.  I am sure that this expenditure will have a very positive effect on tourism receipts.</P>
    <P>The whole tourist accommodation area <Col N="1136" /> and Government assistance towards its development have been looked at in the review.  The findings which have emerged would indicate that, in the past, development grant schemes may not have produced the maximum possible benefit.  In particular, schemes as originally conceived seem to have had too little regard to changing circumstances between their launching and the final implementation of projects aided.  Bord Fáilte have been asked for a complete assessment of present and future accommodation needs and, when this is received, I will be looking into the question as to how we should go about ensuring that supply will be able to match future demand.</P>
    <P>The activities of the regional tourism organisations is another area which has been examined.  It is clear that there is a need for greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness in their operations.  Bord Fáilte and the regional boards are already moving to introduce certain efficiencies and improved work practices in the regions and I hope that this effort will be accelerated to reap early positive results.</P>
    <P>I will be looking at other aspects of tourism policy over the coming weeks with a view to ensuring that the State's continuing investment in tourism will be more cost-effective in future and of maximum benefit to the industry and the country as a whole.  Any future State investment must, of course, be matched by renewed and more vigorous effort on the part of the industry itself.  Without this high level of commitment from those directly involved in tourism, the broad objectives which I have outlined are unlikely to be achieved.</P>
    <P>In my opening comments I referred to the considerable volume of legislation promoted by my Department.  I will now deal with that aspect.  A wide-ranging programme of amending legislation has been planned to reform and update company law over the next few years.  This will give effect to the provisions of various EEC Directives which have been adopted in the area of harmonisation of company law in member states and also deal with other issues of a domestic nature arising from a number of abuses <Col N="1137" /> of the existing law that have been highlighted in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1982, giving effect to the Second EEC Company Law Directive and related matters has recently reached the Statute Book.  It will become operative shortly under a commencement order.</P>
    <P>It was a largely technical and uncontroversial measure which I was anxious to see enacted as soon as possible, not least because the legislation was long overdue and we had been taken to the European Court by the EEC Commission for failing to implement the Directive by the due date.  Later this year, I shall be taking steps to implement three EEC Directives relating to the Stock Exchange.  These deal with admission of securities to listing, prospectuses for listed securities and interim reports furnished by listed companies.  Their requirements will not result in any significant change in the existing Stock Exchange procedures and requirements.</P>
    <P>At the moment, however, my first priority in the area of company law is the preparation and introduction of legislation designed to prevent abuses and evasion of responsibilities in the operation of limited liability companies.  The proposed Bill, which will realise a commitment given in the Joint Programme for Government, will strengthen, as appropriate, the existing provisions in the 1963 Companies Act and will introduce new measures the objective of which is to eliminate, deter or penalise with severe sanctions, malpractices in the conduct and direction of companies generally.</P>
    <P>Limited liability status is a privilege and not a right and it is appropriate, therefore, that those who enjoy such status should be left in no doubt as to the standards of behaviour required of them and the serious consequences of blatantly ignoring or failing to comply with these standards.</P>
    <P>We have seen, all too frequently, the situation where company operators liquidate one company &mdash; without any regard to the debts outstanding to creditors or employees &mdash; with the unmistaken objective of forming another company and, if it suits their purposes, to repeat <Col N="1138" /> the process and deceive further creditors and employees.  I have asked my officials to give this particular problem the most searching analysis with a view to achieving the most effective solution.  As regards the treatment of offenders who persist in this kind of activity, I will be seeking to impose the stiffest penalties acceptable within the legal code generally.</P>
    <P>The enactment of legislation is, undoubtedly, a fundamental step towards the elimination of the various abuses to which I have referred and which have, unfortunately, now become all too widespread.  Lest too much be expected of such legislation it is only right to recognise the fact of life that, as with other laws, its presence on the Statute Book will not, by itself, rid the business community of those who are intent on fraud or wrongdoing.  Moreover, it cannot protect the many people who are foolishly induced by the prospect of a marginal gain over normal rates of interest to invest their savings in doubtful investment bodies.  The best possible situation can only be achieved if all who are parties to corporate activity are continuously prudent and vigilant in their transactions and dealings.</P>
    <P>A later Bill will follow to translate into Irish law the provisions of the Third Directive on mergers and divisions of public limited companies and a related directive on divisions of such companies. Mergers by fusion and division are rare in Ireland.  Therefore, the legislation ensuring on the two directives is not expected to have any widespread application in practice.</P>
    <P>An important EEC Directive in relation to company law is the Fourth Directive on the preparation, publication and auditing of the individual accounts of public and private limited companies. The implementation of this complex measure will have a major impact both by significantly increasing the level of detailed disclosure required in accounts and, in particular, because private limited companies will for the first time be required to publish their accounts.  There are certain optional provisions in the directive, however, which vary its full <Col N="1139" /> impact on different sized companies, particularly as regards publication of accounts and disclosure generally. Ireland is at present behind schedule in implementing this directive but so, too, are the majority of all other member states.  I am hopeful, however, that when I have completed my examination of the issues in question I will be able to bring forward the necessary legislative proposals as soon as possible to give effect to this directive.</P>
    <P>A Co-operative Societies Bill, designed to replace the existing industrial and provident societies legislation, is at present being prepared in my Department. I hope to be in a position to introduce this Bill early next year.</P>
    <P>The Registrar of Friendly Societies, at my request, is undertaking a review of the Friendly Societies Acts, 1896-1977, to see what changes are necessary or desirable.  Those Acts govern the registration and operation of friendly societies and certain other types of societies, including benevolent societies.  The objective of the review is to provide a modern legislative framework for such societies.  They are mainly of the self-help voluntary type and provide insurance and other benefits for members.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the subject of companies and other incorporated bodies I should like to refer to a particular associated aspect.  My Department have received over the years a considerable number of complaints from the legal profession and others who use the Companies Registration Office about company files not being readily available for inspection.  While the great majority of inquirers are facilitated without significant delay, some files cannot be produced immediately either because some other inquirers are using them or because the staff of the office are working on them. Because of the huge volume of files in the office and the ever-increasing demand for services, operational difficulties have arisen.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the question of tackling these difficulties I should like to refer to the remarkable increase in the amount of business transacted in that <Col N="1140" /> office in recent years.  At the end of 1972 the total number of companies on the register was less than 28,000 and at the end of 1982 the total was over 70,000 &mdash; an increase of 150 per cent.  There was also in that period an increase of over 75 per cent in transactions relating to business names.  Additionally, the other services provided by the office to the community, mainly legal, accountancy and other business interests, have increased no less dramatically. In the area of access to company files for search purposes, for instance, less than 50,000 inspections were made in 1972 whereas the number in 1982, at over 106,000, showed an increase of 112 per cent.</P>
    <P>Against this background of increased activity should be noted that staff resources in that period increased by only 60 per cent.  That the office have been able to provide a service to the extent that it has done in the past number of years is a remarkable tribute to the hard working and highly skilled staff, who will continue to do their best to give the public the quality of service they are entitled to.</P>
    <P>The operation difficulties to which I have referred cannot, however, be overcome by dedication on the part of staff alone.  It has been necessary to devise new systems with a view to having immediately available the information most frequently required by the public. When current plans are implemented, hopefully within two years, the main information on company files will be stored on computer and will be available both on visual display units and as printouts. Needless to remark, the planning and implementation of such a project is both complex and expensive but it is being pushed ahead as quickly as possible and provision has been made in the Estimates for the necessary expenditure.  In the meantime certain complementary changes are being introduced which should considerably reduce the delay in obtaining information.  These include the installation of new mobile shelving to increase storage capacity and make files more readily accessible and a modern card retrieval system.</P>
    <P>A further important piece of legislation &mdash; the Casual Trading Act, 1980 &mdash; is <Col N="1141" /> now fully operative.  On 12 February of this year the Street Trading Act, 1926, was repealed and the Casual Trading Act, 1980, applies to Dublin city and other urban areas which had adopted the 1926 Act.  With a few exceptions specified in the Act, any person who proposes to engage in retail trading on the roads or in any other public place must now have a casual trading licence.  These licences are issued by my Department.  The Act empowers local authorities to designate casual trading areas and when an authority has designated such areas it is an offence to engage in casual trading elsewhere in that authority's area.  The local authorities are also empowered to make by-laws to regulate casual trading and they can attach conditions to the casual trading permits they grant.  I am satisfied that the local authorities have all the powers they need to ensure that all the nuisances associated with unregulated street trading can be abated, and it is for them to achieve this objective.  They do not have to get my approval of their plans.</P>
    <P>Insurance is, needless to say, a very important sector in my Department's functions.  In recent years, the non-life insurance sector has seen increasing participation in the market by new entrants following the implementation in 1976 of the First EEC non-Life Insurance Directive. A similar trend in the life assurance area is likely to emerge when the First EEC Life Assurance Directive is implemented into law later this year.  The resultant increased competition and greater variety of classes of cover on offer should be of benefit to the insuring public. When the Insurance Bill, 1982, to control life commission levels was introduced, the then Government indicated in their press release that, if agreement were reached, the Bill would not be proceeded with.  I am happy to note that all life companies have now signified their agreement on a maximum scale of rates. Such agreement will undoubtedly redound to the benefit of all concerned. However, I want this House and the insurers to be clear that should the commission's agreement run into difficulties, or its continued existence be thrown into doubt, I will immediately reintroduce the <Col N="1142" /> Bill and add to it any further measures which would be considered necessary or desirable to deal with the situation.</P>
    <P>The rising cost of motor insurance continues to give cause for concern.  Each application for an increase is rigidly scrutinised in my department and also by the National Prices Commission.  The inescapable fact, however, is that the cost of claims on which the ultimate size of premium rate increases depends, continues to escalate at an alarming rate.  Motor underwriting losses amounted to £26 million in 1981, an increase of over 36 per cent on 1980.  There is a need, therefore, for motor insurance to be kept under constant review.  In this connection the Prices Advisory Committee, established in November 1981 to inquire into the factors contributing to the cost of motor insurance, has now reported.  The committee's wide-ranging recommendations are being considered in my Department and in the other Departments concerned. A further expert committee, the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee, is currently finalising a long-term exercise aimed at establishing a statistical basis for the application of loadings to insurance premiums.  These investigations will help to determine whether the loadings applied to premium rates reflect the additional risk involved.</P>
    <P>In speaking of motor insurance, I must refer to a relatively recent phenomenon, which is of particular concern to me, namely the introduction of so called &ldquo;discount schemes&rdquo;.  I am concerned by what seems to be a departure from prudent underwriting in the interests of increased cash flow.  I am also concerned about the attempts by some insurers to corner what might be termed &ldquo;the better risks&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Schemes designed to achieve these aims carry with them the inherent danger of severe underwriting losses as well as distorting the motor insurance market.  I have clearly indicated to all insurers that any losses which may be incurred on such schemes will not be permitted to be spread onto the general insuring public. In other words, such schemes must stand or fall on their own merits.  Adverting now to the area of competition policy I have received a report from the Restrictive <Col N="1143" /> Practices Commission into restrictions placed on dental technicians by sections 45 and 46 of the Dentists Act, 1928. I have laid the report before both House of the Oireachtas and arranged for its publication.  The report recommends that section 45 of the Act should be amended to allow for the provision by non-dentists of dentures to a person of 18 years of age, or over, provided it does not involve work being done on living tissue.</P>
    <P>The commission have also produced a report of their public inquiry into the effects on competition of the restrictions on conveyancing and restrictions on advertising by solicitors.  The recommendations contained in the report are at present being studied in my Department and I expect to be in a position to take decisions on it fairly shortly.</P>
    <P>The Commission have also carried out an inquiry into the provision of tour operator and travel agency services insofar as they are affected by the activities of associations in the travel trade and are at present preparing a report to me in the matter.  In the coming year I also expect the commission to carry out an inquiry into the policies of building societies in relation to insurance and valuers' or surveyors' reports in respect of mortgaged properties.</P>
    <P>While on the question of building societies there are a few general remarks which I would like to make.  The House will be aware from the last report of the Registrar of Building Societies that comparisons between the management expenses of Irish and UK Building Societies did not indicate any cause for concern about the performance of Irish societies in this area.  It is to be pointed out that the management expense ratio is only one measure of the efficiency of societies and the Registrar has exhorted all societies to keep their overall performance under continuous review and to ensure that maximum efficiency is attained.  It should be widely recognised that building societies occupy a privileged position under law, the object of which was to enable them to provide a better service to the community.  It behoves us, therefore, to see to it that the public are <Col N="1144" /> properly treated in their dealings with societies.  It is pleasing, consequently, to note that the Registrar of Building Societies, who is the person charged statutorily with responsibility for the supervision of societies, will continue to monitor the performance of societies, both generally and at the level of individual societies. This exercise will also be concerned with such other aspects of building societies operations as redemption fees charged, legal expenses and other related matters.</P>
    <P>In the area of competition, I am also responsible for the operation of the Mergers, Take-overs and Monopolies (Control) Act, 1978.  A report on the cases considered under the Act is contained in an annual report which is presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas. I expect to be presenting, shortly, the report for 1982.  I understand the report will show that the number of applications received results in a considerable decrease on the 1981 figure.  This, I think, reflects the very difficult year experienced by business in general and is a good indication of the retrenchment which has taken place in most areas.  It is also fair to say that a larger proportion of the cases considered during 1982 fell into that category which might, broadly, be described as rescue operations.</P>
    <P>I will now turn to the subject of prices and price control.  As the House is aware, the National Prices Commission advise me on prices matters and examine and make recommendations on price increase applications.  The commission examine applications in accordance with strict criteria which lay down what increased costs may be recovered by applicant firms by way of increased prices.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, only unavoidable increased costs that have actually been incurred are allowed to be passed on to the consumer.  Applicant firms must be in a position to verify that cost increases claimed have actually been incurred.  In the case of material costs, for example, this is done by way of providing documentary evidence, in the form of invoices, of the cost increases claimed. Price applicants are also obliged to submit their financial accounts certified by auditors and detailed to the extent ordimi <Col N="1145" /> narily required by the income tax authorities.</P>
    <P>In deciding the level of price increase warranted under the guidelines the capacity of an applicant firm to absorb at least some portion of allowable cost increases is taken into account.  A company's trading record and the influence of competitive factors must also be assessed and evaluated.</P>
    <P>There is no obligation on the commission to compensate price applicants in full for increased costs and occasionally less than full compensation is given to encourage productivity and efficiency. The commission are very aware of the need for companies to at least maintain, if not increase, efficiency in the production of goods and the provision of services in order to ensure that consumers should not have to pay for inefficiency or lower standards.  As Minister, I am very concerned that these principles in the operation of price control are upheld.</P>
    <P>Occasionally, applications are received from companies seeking price increases to improve their profitability for investment purposes or to generate employment. Approval of such price increases is usually limited to companies whose prices are already competitive, who have a proven track record of investment in the past and who have viable investment plans for the future.  I am particularly concerned that capital generated as a result of price increases approved in this manner will be spent in this country on productive job creation projects.</P>
    <P>During 1982, 374 price proposals were considered by the National Prices Commission. The applicants who made these proposals claimed that they had sustained increased costs amounting to £661 million approximately on an annualised basis. Based on recommendations by the commission it was considered that £300 million of these costs could not be allowed. The effect of the cut-back was that consumers at retail level paid about 45 per cent less for the products and services covered by the applications than they might otherwise have had to pay.  This figure more than likely understates the true saving to the consumer when one <Col N="1146" /> takes into account the efficiency improvements and the costs absorbed by firms arising from the mere existence of a price control mechanism.</P>
    <P>In the operation of an effective price control system it is necessary to maintain a balance between the competing needs within the community.  To adopt a simplistic approach to price control by suggesting that all applications for price increases be rejected would have serious repercussions.  If companies whose costs continue to be affected by imported and domestic inflation found that they could not recover increased costs in higher prices, supplies of goods and services to the consumer would be seriously curtailed within a short period and in some cases would cease altogether.  The inevitable consequences of such an approach would be redundancies and firm closures on a large scale.  The social costs inflicted on the community for such policies would be intolerable.</P>
    <P>I would now like to mention some reservations I have about the effectiveness of the existing price control procedures. One of the features of the present system is that it tends to create in the minds of businessmen the idea that if they incur extra costs they can expect to be compensated by means of commensurate price increases.  In that kind of environment one must wonder whether cost increases are resisted as strongly as they ought to be.  Some new thinking is required here and it seems to me that more effective means of measuring competitiveness, rather than costs incurred, may have to be introduced.  At any rate the notion of automatically passing on increased costs to the consumer is firmly rejected by the Government.</P>
    <P>In recent months there has been clear evidence of a slackening in the underlying rate of inflation, particularly in relation to imported inflation.  This slackening is due largely to the current international recession and the action taken by our competitor countries to reduce their own levels of inflation.  When this recession ends, we cannot expect them easily to allow their economies to return to the double figure inflation rates that were so widely prevalent in recent years.  The <Col N="1147" /> decline in imported inflation has been reflected in the reduction in the number and the level of price increase applications received in recent months.  In 1982 the rise in Irish consumer prices was 17.1 per cent compared with 20.4 per cent in 1981.  Projections for the current year suggest that, despite the devaluation earlier on of the Irish pound within the EMS, the rate will be less than 10 per cent in 1983.  However, considering that most of our competitors will expect to have rates of inflation of half this level, there is no room for complacency on this issue.  A greater moderation in domestic cost increases is essential if Irish industry is to maintain its markets both home and abroad.  This factor will be obvious to firms exposed to international competition, but it may not be as obvious to firms &mdash; whether importers, manufacturers, or service industries&mdash;operating in the sheltered sector of the economy and it may have to be made clear to them that price control procedures will ensure that excessive cost increases will not be permitted to be passed on to the consumer.</P>
    <P>In the context of prices matters I might mention here what is a very considerable element in the Estimate, that is the amount for food subsidies.  The sum provided for the consumer subsidy on bread in the current year is £40,621,000, an increase of 3 per cent on the final out turn for 1982 of £39,579,000.  The consumption of bread in 1982 was less than anticipated and the 1983 allocation is considered adequate to meet the expected demands.</P>
    <P>The consumer subsidy on flour and wheatenmeal was terminated on 1 August, 1982 but a token provision has been made to cover the possibility of any carry over of claims having to be met in 1983.</P>
    <P>Turning finally to consumer protection, I am pleased to note an increased focussing nowadays on the needs of the public as consumers; to some extent this can be traced back to the Consumer Information Act, 1978, which has created a new awareness.  Indeed, apart from my specific responsibility, other Ministers and their Departments have a general <Col N="1148" /> responsibility for protecting the interests of the public as consumers within their own functional areas, whether it be in regard to medicines, safety of manufactured products, transport, traffic safety or otherwise.  The House will be aware that there are a number of EEC Directives at various stages of development which have important implications for consumers.  Regulations have been made to implement the Food Labelling Directive which requires particulars such as ingredients, storage conditions, durability marking and quantity declarations to be given.  Deputies on both sides of the House have spoken in support of the implementation of the directive requirements. Industry obviously needs some time to introduce the necessary changes into labelling practices.  My Department have been in direct discussion with the Confederation of Irish Industry and individual manufacturers/packers regarding the requirements of the regulations and I plan to bring them into effect later in the year.  Already the effects of the directive are becoming evident on the shop shelves in the range of new information being provided on labels and this represents an important step forward for consumers.</P>
    <P>I have recently signed regulations which will encourage the rationalisation of a number of sizes in which household goods are sold.  Regulations to give effect to the unit pricing of foodstuffs are at an advanced stage of preparation and I hope to sign them shortly.  Other directives being discussed in Brussels cover such items as product liability, doorstep sales, consumer credit and misleading advertising.</P>
    <P>The Product Liability Directive would impose strict liability, irrespective of fault, on a producer of a product in respect of injury caused by a defect in the product.  The injured party would simply have to prove the defect, the damage and the causal relationship between the two. This draft directive would give an important and additional form of protection to consumers as liability would be created whether or not the manufacturer was negligent.  It obviously has important ramifications for manufacturers and <Col N="1149" /> there are also insurance implications.  It is not surprising therefore that progress has not been as fast as originally envisaged. Nevertheless, all member states accept the principle of strict liability on which the directive would be founded and there is a fair measure of agreement as to the general shape the directive should take.</P>
    <P>The Doorstep Sales Directive is at an advanced stage of development and I expect to see it adopted without much more delay.  The Directive on Misleading Advertising is making progress, again after being the subject of protracted discussion on some fundamental aspects of scope, and the Consumer Credit Directive has been reactivated in the past year.</P>
    <P>Most of the EEC initiatives under comtemplation derive from the EEC First and Second Consumer Programmes.  In some ways, progress with many of the elements in these could be regarded as disappointing.  The reality is that it reflects in part the general difficulty of getting the member states to put aside national differences in favour of a Community agreement.  It also reflects, however, a certain hardening of attitudes towards consumer protection by member states because of the continuing worldwide recession.  There is evidence that in some of the countries which have been to the fore in consumer protection in the past two decades the general zeal for new initiatives displayed in earlier years is easing back and is being replaced more by consolidation measures within the framework of existing consumer legislation.</P>
    <P>I have stated already in this House in response to Dáil questions that I am examining certain matters relating to consumer credit to see if they can be effectively dealt with using existing powers. I believe, for example, that on the tourism front consumers, both foreign and Irish, would welcome menu prices being displayed outside restaurants and dining rooms.  This is the practice at present in many other countries; it is also fairly widespread here.  I now propose to make such price display a requirement.</P>
    <P>The foregoing do not purport to show the relative priority or gravity of consumer <Col N="1150" /> issues facing us but are intended simply to illustrate the type of measures which it might be appropriate to consider under existing legislation and which could have beneficial consequences all round.  However, I believe that no amount of formal consumer regulation or regimentation will ever be the complete substitute for the application of reasonable care and intelligence by consumers when making purchasing decisions.</P>
    <P>I would now like to refer briefly to weights and measures, prepacking and hallmarking legislation which have strong consumer implications.  A weights and measures Bill has been under preparation in my Department and is now nearing completion.  This Bill will update and modernise the existing weights and measures legislation to take account of technological progress, EEC developments, and the general pace of change.  The Bill will make provisions for a unified inspectorate under the control of the Office of Weights and Measures and will lay the foundations for the development of a modern progressive metrology service able to serve the needs of traders and consumers.</P>
    <P>The Packaged Goods (Quantity Control) Act, 1981, provided for the establishment of a comprehensive system of quantity control for prepackaged goods, thus significantly increasing the protection afforded the consumer from short weight while at the same time increasing the acceptability of our exports by bringing our control procedures into line with practice elsewhere in the European Community. A special inspectorate within my Department concerned with enforcing this legislation has been concentrating on helping and advising packers in meeting the requirements of the legislation.</P>
    <P>Finally, this country lodged recently the instrument of accession to the International Convention on the Control and Marking of Articles of Precious Metals. The Hallmarking Act, 1981, was introduced to enable this to be done and as soon as the accession formalities are completed I will sign the necessary regulations to bring the Act into effect.  The advantage of accession is that Irish traders in precious metals will be able to <Col N="1151" /> compete favourably in the markets of other contracting states but especially in the UK which has been the most lucrative market for Irish exporters.  The whole regime of hallmarking provides a valuable protection for the consumer in terms of the quality of the article of precious metal purchased and arising out of our accession to the convention this protection is now being extended to platinum.</P>
    <P>Having dealt as comprehensively as possible with the topics I had decided to include in my speech to-day I now conclude by saying that I will also, in my reply, endeavour to deal with matters which may be raised in the course of the debate.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister dealt very effectively with a considerable number of matters.  It is obvious from the sheer volume of his speech that his Department have a considerable influence on life in this country. However, it is regrettable that there is not a better attendance in the House on occasions like this.  The various aspects <Col N="1152" /> of this Estimate concern both the economy generally and individuals.  It is not my intention to deal with the whole range of business in the same way as the Minister dealt with it.  His speech amounted almost to a brief on his entire Department.  As he has said, these matters can be dealt with on other occasions during the year.  I shall confine myself to dealing with special aspects in which the general public might have a particular interest.</P>
    <P>In passing one must draw attention to the enormity of the Estimate figure.  The Minister has a great responsibility in discharging more than £98 million of our money.  He must discharge this money over a wide range of subjects and disciplines that affect every aspect of Irish life, that affect the housewife, that affect Bord Fáilte, that affect imports and exports, that affect employment and a whole range of economic and social matters. Even the bread subsidy alone is enormous.  One must realise the impact that £40 million has on the Exchequer. Such matters are often not highlighted in terms of Government expenditure but I should like to impress on the Minister the need to maintain the bread subsidy of 15½ pence per 800-gramme loaf.  It was suggested in the recent past that a think-in on subsidies was being held.  I should like the Minister to give an assurance to the House that in these difficult times when households budgets are under attack it is not his intention, as a Labour and socialist Minister, to contemplate the reduction or obliteration of this subsidy.</P>
    <P>The Minister dealt with a range of items.  I put down some questions recently to the Minister and his colleagues about some items which are relevant to the Estimate.  The Minister did not find it possible to reply to one of my questions because of the extra burden it would place on his officials, who are hard pressed as I know full well, but I was delighted to see that he made some reference to it in his speech.  It was in relation to a number of price increases.  I asked him for information concerning all the prices increases which had been granted since the beginning of January. In his speech, he afforded me that <Col N="1153" /> information and said that 374 price proposals came before his Department in 1982 and that these would have accounted for £661 million but for the fact that a number of them were not granted and £300 million of these costs could not be allowed.  The figures I wanted were in relation to price increases since January 1983.  I look forward with interest to receiving that information.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to certain matters relating to the Companies Office. By way of written reply to a question I asked, the Minister told me that 42 companies in the manufacturing sector closed between January and June 1983 with a loss of 3,646 jobs.  While it was not possible to calculate the cost of this to the Exchequer it bears out the fact that there is considerable difficulty being experienced by manufacturing industry at present.  It also means that we will have to make considerable efforts if we are not to have a continuation of company closures for the rest of the year.  I also ascertained by way of written reply to another question that the number of applications for finance aid to Fóir Teoranta since I January this year was 114.  These came from 109 companies employing 7,849 workers.  While financial facilities amounting to £12.437 million have been made available to 45 companies looking for aid, it is indicative of the number of companies which are in serious trouble.</P>
    <P>The number of people made redundant is staggering.  While the Minister may not have a direct responsibility in regard to these matters, nevertheless his Department and others must co-operate in order to relieve us of such dire consequences as far as company closures are concerned. We will have to have an end to the crystal ball gazing which we have indulged in. The reality is that there are close on a quarter of a million unemployed.  Pious hopes for a reduction in the number of unemployed or electoral excuses have run their race.  The sooner we recognise that Government institutions, some of which are under the control of the Minister, have a part to play, the better for all concerned.  We have come to the end of the road as far as unemployment figures are concerned.  It is not possible to <Col N="1154" /> tolerate an escalation of these figures. What is required is action.  People have been waiting too long for the Government's response to unemployment.  The Minister made reference to efforts being made and I accept that the institutions under his control have made a significant contribution, but that is not enough.  If it was, we would not have a quarter of a million people unemployed, a substantial proportion of them under 25 years of age. Some of them have never held a job and it is now accepted that people will be born who will never have gainful employment.</P>
    <P>Unemployment must be our primary concern.  Long-term planning requires considerable Government action. Our economic plan, <i>The Way Forward</i>, set out what was needed but the Government did not accept it nor did they take what was most useful out of it and utilise it to the best advantage.  They did not offer any substitute.  The first few months of a Government's term in office might be granted as a honeymoon period but it is no longer to be tolerated that a long-term strategy has not been laid before the House incorporating all Departments to deal with this enormous national, pressing problem of unemployment.</P>
    <P>Whatever about long-term strategy surely in the short-term the Minister and his colleagues should be outlining what proposals they have to bring about a situation where confidence can be generated and hope given to parents and young people that they will have gainful employment in their own country.  It is depressing to see how frustrated people are.  Unemployment is not confined to the sons or daughters of working-class people, not that they are any less citizens than anybody else, but now affects nearly every family.  We now have thousands of graduates who cannot find employment even in the most menial jobs.  They have no hope of emigration because the situation is often just as bad in countries to which they would like to go.  The Minister must utilise the power and the institutions of his Department which have a tremendous role to play because they spread across the social and economic structure. While the Minister referred to some good <Col N="1155" /> things that have happened, it did not seem to me that there was any kind of national plan to deal effectively with what must be regarded as a national disgrace, namely the Government's ineffectiveness in bringing forward either long-term or short-term strategies to deal with unemployment.</P>
    <P>I have to compliment the Minister and his staff on some of the measures they are taking in the promotion and marketing of our exports, but there is also the question of ordinary confidence among the business community.  That confidence has been seriously undermined during the past few months.  It may be easy to say it from this side of the House but I must lay the major portion of the blame at the feet of the Minister and his Government. The decline in business confidence has accelerated apace since this Government assumed office and the lack of confidence has permeated the whole economic scene.</P>
    <P>The work force are disturbed and frustrated not only in regard to their pay but also because of the number of closures. Many of them are working short time and many companies are seeking assistance from Fóir Teoranta.  Workers know that their jobs are not secure and something must be done to restore their confidence so that we can get the best from them. The unemployed have no confidence. Should they ever be welded into a unified force then the consequences for the economy do not bear thinking about. Business has lost confidence because many of the measures contained in the budget, the Social Welfare Bill and the Finance Bill have undermined the structure of business, to the extent that it is not now in the interest of many people to continue operations.</P>
    <P>It is possible to take only so much from the business community.  They suffer considerably from much of the drochphoblíocht atá ag dul leo le tamaillín anuas.  Much of that bad publicity is illfounded. While there are cowboys, flyby-nights and moonlighters of all kinds operating the vast majority of ordinary businessmen are decent, honest PAYE workers like the rest of us, doing a good <Col N="1156" /> job in the face of considerable difficulties.</P>
    <P>We must support private investment. How else can we expect venture capital to be made available by the private sector? We must give them an opportunity to get a good return on their investment. Praiseworthy as are the efforts of CTT, all will come to naught in the long term if we do not make business worthwhile.</P>
    <P>I understand that CTT have been given an increase of £3.277 million this year.  I think the Minister has short-changed CTT somewhat in comparison with the amount we intended to provide.  From my recollection of the Estimates we had prepared, we would have provided £17.240 million, an increase of £4.157 million.  Surely this is an area where there should not be cheeseparing because CTT have a magnificent track record.  It is absolutely essential in increasing exports that the marketing agency should be given increased funding rather than suffer a decrease.</P>
    <P>I am happy that CTT will be sending delegations to 31 trade fairs this year, a substantial number of them in new market areas.  I accept what the Minister said about these new market areas.  Much of the outlay will be speculative and some of it will be venture.  So what?  We have now reached the stage where we must have enough confidence in ourselves to speculate a little on export drives.  If the Minister expends taxpayers' money in opening up and developing new markets and if some of them fail, he will wait a long time to hear any criticism from me concerning this investment.  All the best indicators are that there are enormous markets in the Middle East and we should certainly get in on the first rung of the ladder now that these markets are opening up.  I will be hoping that CTT can improve their attendance at trade fairs. I would regard expenditure of this nature as money well spent and in the past it has never failed to deliver worthwhile orders. I heartily congratulate CTT on their efforts in this regard.  There will be bigger risks and export credit finance and insurance will be more sought after.  So it should be.  If the Minister's office gets involved to a very serious degree in <Col N="1157" /> improving these new export markets, he will have the full support of this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I am particularly happy that the export of services has had a significant impact on the balance of payments.  There is no doubt that the recent Bill which came before the House to help exporters has given assistance to people who are prepared to push exports.  We will support wholeheartedly any assistance the Minister can give to them.</P>
    <P>Of course, I must refer to employment, because exports have a big bearing on future employment.  During the years there was a carefree optimism here about employment.  There was the feeling that continuous growth would be there automatically and that irrespective of what happened it would be improving.  That carefree optimism has come to an end and only production and sales can bring it back.  There must be progression, first of all in production, followed by sales. That must be followed by income increases for those who provide productivity and those who make the sales.  That will lead to prosperity.  If you have increased growth, production and sales, that leads to increased incomes, increased revenue for the State and increased prosperity for us all.  There cannot be economic success otherwise.</P>
    <P>However, if one area is given impetus rather than another, it leads to distortion. Recovery for this economy is a matter of national determination, and forthwith we must cease to downgrade our work force. We must stop running down aspects of productivity.  National determination can be brought about by individuals.  First of all, there must personal determination and commitment by Ministers.  We require personal dedication and commitment primarily by the Minister now in the House, because he more than anybody is responsible for the growth of our economy through exports.  The Minister for Industry and Energy and the Minister for Finance also have something to do with this and so has the Minister for Labour, but all of them together will not be of any advantage unless the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism can <Col N="1158" /> deliver the goods by way of production and exports.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we get the balance wrong in this House because we lay greater emphasis on other Ministers.  I do not want to be derogatory in regard to anyone's responsibility, but the Minister now in the House has a much bigger bearing on the future prosperity and growth of our economy than is often attributed to him.  He must be given the necessary funding if he is to improve our tourism and our exports.  Although on the face of it he has been given £89 million, he has much less than £50 million if you subtract subsidies.</P>
    <P>We must have an alternative to our hairshirt attitude.  We must strive to restore confidence and we must cease this tittle-tattle across the floor of the House that we would do better than they.  In relation to our competitors, it will not do for us to run in the same race as they do. We must win.  Because of our open economy we must not be just equal with our competitors.  We have to be better than they if we are to achieve our targets and if we are to bring prosperity to our people.</P>
    <P>It might appear that the beginning of my remarks would have greater relevance to another Department.  It has not. Though the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism can achieve what their institutions have set out to do, this cannot be done without a higher standard of training and of technological knowledge among our work force.  Of course, that involves the employers.  Perhaps we have missed the boat in regard to these elements, and that is why I had hoped that in their six months in office the Government would have dealt effectively with the problems and utilised the skills, manpower and training and consequently would have provided short-term schemes in regard to training and technological knowledge.  It is only by doing that, by providing these facilities, that we can cultivate pride in our achievements.  Our work force must have simple pride in doing the job well and in knowing they are better than their competitors.</P>
    <P>There is much work to be done and it has to be done properly, and if it requires <Col N="1159" /> national discipline to achieve it that is what government is all about.  We are limping along with 250,000 people unemployed and the PAYE sector will have to continue to break their backs.  Surely we have something better than that in store for us.  We do not want a continuation over the years of this limping along.  As I said earlier, we do not want this talking across the floor of the House because the hundreds of thousands outside will be right when they say that that kind of thing does not achieve anything for them.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the bureaucratic, administrative and ministerial skill is here in this House if it could be tapped fully and if we could get away from this limping along attitude.  Unless that kind of initiative is there it will be forced on us before too long.  It will not be easy to take it then.</P>
    <P>I would go so far as to say that the State cannot finance every demand of the people.  The State cannot support every demand, and I would be the first to admit that.  Whether it is ambition to go up the political ladder here, or to achieve the top spot in the bureaucracy of a Department, or to be the managing director of a company, or to be the supervisor on the plant floor, ambition is always unlimited &mdash; but the public purse is not.  We will have to take all the ambitions of the general public into account and the extent to which the public purse can support them.  The expansion of our educational system, the expansion of our training facilities, the expansion of our agricultural development, health and transport services, our urban development and our environmental development, will have to be put into one plan. Priorities will have to be set, so that what I said earlier will take its proper place in the progression towards achieving prosperity.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that there must be an alternative to the hairshirt.  It is a cardinal error to cut public expenditure on investment at this time.  In a period of decline such as we have had over the past few years, we should not neglect the sources of growth, our agricultural sectors and our infrastructures.  If we neglect those <Col N="1160" /> areas by a massive reduction in the public capital expenditure programme, how can we benefit from the turnabout in the international economy to which the Minister referred?  It is only a very slight improvement but, if we neglect the investment necessary to develop our infrastructures and our agricultural and manufacturing sectors by withholding money, we will be limping along again when growth starts.</P>
    <P>We will be trying to arrange development programmes and making grand announcements about four year plans for our roads.  Now is the time to utilise the public capital expenditure programme to keep up job opportunities and to achieve the infrastructural development we will need in two or three years' time.  Somebody said it before me but it is well worth saying again: if you expect the hen to lay golden eggs you will have to feed her.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; in whatever capacity, I will see to it that he will get a seat on the inaugural flight.  In all seriousness, I referred to the alternative, which is the investment programme.  It is worth making that point because it is very relevant to the Minister's responsibilities in this area and to his responsibility for tourism. The public capital programme is expected to fall by about 10 per cent this year I understand.  The largest fall will be in industrial buildings.  Perhaps that is not the Minister's responsibility, but I regret it.  There is a further decline in private sector investment in building and construction. <Col N="1161" /> Overall investment in building and construction is due to fall by about 8 per cent.  Local authority housing and private housing will be seriously affected. These matters will have a big bearing not just on the future growth of the economy but on employment levels as well.  I know the Minister is as concerned about employment as he is about export growth.  In one way or another they are both related.</P>
      <P>A very disturbing statistic has come to hand.  Expenditure on plant and machinery will be down by about 9 per cent this year.  That involves a reduction in investment in new industries.  That can mean only one thing, a slowing down in IDA assisted projects.  The reduction in capital investment in this economy will have very serious repercussions next year.  That is why planning is vital.  In his speech the Minister placed great importance on world recovery and in particular in so far as it relates to industrial exports.  As the Minister knows, the only way we can sustain increased exports and the improved trends in that area is by maintaining our competitiveness.  In case I forget it later on I should like to congratulate the exporters who have achieved this result and to congratulate CTT on their efforts in that regard.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, could I ask you what time have I got?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I intended to refer to import substitution, cross-Border smuggling, an inquiry into ESB prices, the hotel industry, the Buy Irish Campaign, and a whole range of subjects, but we will continue on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Until 8.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to leave out a considerable portion of my speech but I am sure I will have another opportunity at another time.  I want to refer to the Buy Irish Campaign and the Guaranteed <Col N="1162" /> Irish promotion.  I know the restrictions on the Minister in that regard, but the same restrictions do not apply to me. Despite the fact that those two schemes have failed in that imports are taking a greater portion of the market year by year, I want to make a plea in the National Parliament for something to be done about a matter which has been brought to my notice recently.  Walking around some of our supermarkets is no different from walking around the supermarkets in London.  That is a national scandal.  I know there are restrictions on the Minister in dealing with this.  However, some measure must be taken to bring home to the people who own these businesses, who are selling to the consumer here, that there is an onus or national responsibility on them to give first preference in their displays and promotions on their premises to Irish-made articles able to withstand the competition and meet the price criteria the consumer wishes.  Some method must be devised to bring about an educational process under which our teachers could be deployed, whether by display programmes, by slides or whatever other type of promotional equipment to bring home to our youth the advantages and benefits that would accrue from buying home-produced products.</P>
      <P>On a recent visit to a supermarket I had to turn over the labels on many articles to discover that they had been manufactured abroad whereas the Irish product had it clearly written on the front of the label.  I had to look at some obscure place on the back of the label to discover that the article had been manufactured in a foreign country.  I would make it obligatory on such producers, when labelling their products, to have clearly shown &ldquo;made in Great Britain&rdquo;, &ldquo;made in China&rdquo; or &ldquo;made in Ireland&rdquo; and that it would be clearly shown on the front of the label so that people could readily identify the home-produced article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Also in regard to the food situation I was alarmed to find again on a recent visit to a supermarket the enormous number of ordinary goods &mdash; even those as ordinary as salt and pepper &mdash; marked <Col N="1163" />&ldquo;packaged in Great Britain&rdquo; for a particular group here.  This takes place while thousands of our people are made redundant and factories close.  Housewives are not given an opportunity of buying Irish. The ordinary sales people in these supermarkets could do an enormous amount of good for our economy if they put the Irish-made article on the front of their shelf, allowing the housewife the advantage of seeing it first anyway whether or not she buys it.</P>
    <P>Something drastic needs to be done there because the penetration of imports on our market has continued apace.  The Government's import substitution policies have failed.  It is a well known fact that £1.5 billion worth of imported products could be produced here and that one-fifth of our annual import bill of £8 billion is comprised of products that compete with ours.  The import penetration has reached an alarming level.  The percentage of sales are somewhat as follows: in electrical engineering goods 95 per cent; leather and shoes, 76 per cent; clothing, 74 per cent; and foods, 22 per cent.  Each sale of imports represents lost opportunities and a drain on our balance of payments.  The Minister may not have the power to deal with it, but import substitution is just as important as export promotion.  Import substitution has not been given the same importance as has export promotion despite the import penetration of our markets and our unemployment situation.  If we paid more attention to our import substitution policies then the IDA would not be losing the race in creating new jobs or endeavouring to catch up with redundancies.</P>
    <P>We must sell Irish; it is as simple as that.  Whatever about buying Irish, let us get the programme right: we must sell Irish.  It must be remembered that every £20,000 worth of sales is the equivalent of one job.  We can see clearly then that £200 million would provide 10,000 jobs. If the total of £1.5 billion of imports into this country could be turned around it would create 50,000 new jobs.  As we know the spin-off effect would be to create a further 50,000 jobs, when our unemployment <Col N="1164" /> difficulties would be eroded overnight.</P>
    <P>The Government and semi-State bodies spend hundreds of millions of pounds every year on imports.  I should like to hear the Minister say that he has made arrangements in so far as import substitution was concerned, to the effect that he will make it mandatory on the Government and semi-State bodies to buy in our economy, thus saving thousands of jobs. That is something directly within the capacity of the Minister and his colleagues. I cannot see, again in so far as import substitution is concerned why the Minister and his colleagues, in a situation in which companies are importing equipment and goods, could not ask them to make these articles themselves, bring it to their notice that instead of going off and buying some of the goods they need for reprocessing for some of their industries they should produce them themselves, provide the services, ask their young middle management, the young entrepreneurs obviously available in those companies, to set up on their own and provide the job opportunities necessary to relieve our unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to company law and said he would like to eliminate malpractice and abuse of company law.  He said he would deal with limited liability in the near future.  As he quite rightly said, it is a privilege to be allowed to work with limited liability but there will have to be some control of those entitled to do so.  It is difficult to prove fraud because it is also difficult to prove that the intention of defrauding was there in the first instance.  I should like to see the definition of &ldquo;wrongful trading&rdquo; being clarified by the Minister at an early date, that wrongful trading that has the personal liability attached to it.  I would see it as making purchases willingly and knowingly when one is unable to pay. There will have to be devised a licensing situation, an endorsement situation in which it would be recognised that those who continue to trade with such people would know there was an endorsement on their licence.  It might relieve an awful lot of the anxiety that has been brought <Col N="1165" /> about here in the recent past in so far as abuses of limited liability are concerned.</P>
    <P>Ordinary people should understand what company law and limited liability mean.  They should understand the basis of law, the formation of companies and their liabilities.  After all, they are using public money and the public should know how they are using it.  Employees should have the situation explained to them. Perhaps if the situation of companies getting into difficulties was explained in somewhat more detail to some of their employees then we might not have had some of the wild-cat situations we have had to endure with resultant job losses and company closures in the recent past. The balance sheets are not that difficult. If some middle management in some companies would take the time to explain to their employees the exact extent of their difficulties, how they are forming, then quite an amount of relief could be brought about.</P>
    <P>The Companies Office was referred to by the Minister.  There is need for computerisation there.  They have done a fairly good job.  Also with regard to the question of endorsement of licence for a limited liability operation here certainly an endorsement could be imposed if the information being sought was not being filed.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred also to the report of the inquiry into the cost of motor insurance, which was published in December 1982.  The cost of motor insurance imposes a very severe burden on all our people and there are large numbers of people evading their legal obligation to insure.  The only way that situation can be relieved is through more efficient enforcement of the law, with realistic penalties and greater policing activities. It is important to note from that inquiry that there was no evidence that insurance companies were making excessive profits. While investigating the matter there are some aspects in respect of which the Minister could take immediate action. For example, he could make a simple order that brokers when looking for their money from their clients at least would have to provide a copy of their renewal <Col N="1166" /> notice to the person paying for the insurance.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have consultations with the Department of the Environment in order to bring about a speedy allocation of moneys from the Road Fund to deal with the black spots well known throughout the country, the cause of a considerable number of accidents.  That is something that could be done without any great difficulty.  He might increase the money allocations significantly to the Road Safety Association so that proper and effective campaign material can be made available for school and adult promotions. He could impress on those responsible the need to clear the backlog of High Court actions rather than have people waiting three and four years for their cases to be heard.  This would reduce the cost of these cases and it would certainly reduce the cost of insurance.</P>
    <P>Driving and drinking has been given special attention in the report.  I have no sympathy with the drunken driver but I think the time has come to take another look at the different levels of alcohol in the blood which might be tolerated in different age groups and different circumstances. I am personally aware of considerable hardship in a number of cases.  In a majority of cases it is essential that men should drive in order to earn a living and I cannot see why an arrangement could not be entered into whereby men would lose their licences to drive during leisure hours but would be allowed to drive in order to earn a living. This is an area which can be discussed.  It is something worth considering.  We will have to have a more enlightened approach.  While being very hard on the drunken driver who earns the full penalty of the law, certain other aspects should also be taken into consideration. Uninsured drivers are on the roads every day.  The penalties imposed are a joke when and if they are caught and the Minister should take immediate steps to solve the problem in that area.  There would seem to be a good case for recommending a method of identification to show whether or not a driver is insured.</P>
    <P>I come now to the price of electricity. The Minister referred specifically to <Col N="1167" /> prices and price control.  It is time we got all the facts.  While major responsibility in this area comes within the ambit of another Department the Minister has responsibility for price increases which are recommended to him.  It is time there was a cessation of ESB bashing.  All the facts should be put on record.  The bashing has been going on for years.  It is the result of the apparent high price of electricity here as against European prices. There are two problems involved, capacity and overmanning.  In 1978 the ESB were told to plan for an 8 per cent average growth up to 1991 which would result in a demand for 5,500 megawatts per year. That target could not be achieved unless the Government decided, as they did in 1978, to allow the Moneypoint project to go ahead.  What options had they?  The EEC and the energy agency gave them the options.  It was coal or nuclear power and they took the coal option.  Now they have serious overcapacity.  I wonder what overcapacity they will have in 1991.  If we are going to make future planning for growth in this economy we will have to take due note of the energy requirements as well.  I would welcome an inquiry because it will bring about a situation once and for all of itemising the components on which electricity prices are based and identify the cost applied to those charges here as against Europe.  It will also identify and analyse the reasons why there are higher costs here than in other parts of Europe and perhaps it might examine the ESB debt as well. When all that has been inquired into we will have the Minister come back to say there is a very good reason for our costings and pricings of electricity.</P>
    <P>It has not been possible to deal with many other matters with regard to insurance and the registration of intermediaries which I would like to have dealt with.  Again, tourism is a major industry and to my way of thinking it could command a much bigger budget and bring about a much greater potential as far as foreign earnings are concerned to say nothing of job creation.  I would press the Minister to utilise the promotional and marketing money made available to him <Col N="1168" /> to bring about a better and more sustained effort in enticing people to spend their holidays in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the aspects referred to do not actually come within the ambit of the Department for which I have responsibility.  The question of employment was mentioned and Deputy Flynn was very concerned, understandably so, about unemployment.  I share this concern.  I am sure every Deputy shares the same concern.  However, except in the matter of exports and their direct relationship to job creation or job maintenance, the Department have no overall responsibility and the Deputy indicated that when he referred to the IDA's activities as being a major input in employment and also to some aspects of the activities of the Department of <Col N="1169" /> Labour.  I am referring to AnCO.  The Government have collective responsibility and it would be a mistake to say there was no overall plan or medium or long-term approach.  In the Joint Programme for Government there is reference to the task force which has been set up and the planning board which is in operation and which was announced recently by the Taoiseach.  There is therefore a medium and long-term view being taken of our very serious unemployment situation.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn spoke about the significance of exports to our economy and economic recovery.  He spoke very positively about them and I wish to express my appreciation for that approach.  He did not try to score any political points. He had a very clear grasp of our export situation and how it affected employment. Two out of every three jobs in manufacturing industry are directly dependent on exports.  This shows how important our exports are and why I laid such emphasis on that activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we can be optimistic for the current year because we will achieve a 17 per cent increase in exports, we cannot afford to be complacent, because the competition on the international market is fierce.  This is an area where all our skills and marketing abilities are utilised to the full.  We have been very fortunate in the professionalism shown by Córas Tráchtála over the years.  We have also been very fortunate because of the calibre of our industrialists involved in the export market.  We have laid great emphasis on the fact that there is a defect so far as marketing is concerned in some firms engaged in the export business. Córas Tráchtála are directing their attention to this matter because, no matter how well we manufacture a product, if we cannot sell it on the international market we are not backing a winner.  When times were good many of our companies could get by, but there is no way they will get by on the international market today without employing highly skilled marketing techniques.  Fortunately there is a growing realisation among Irish manufacturers of the necessity to do something about this.  I am not pessimistic as regards the export trade.  As I said, we can look <Col N="1170" /> forward in the current year with a considerable amount of confidence to a 17 per cent increase in exports.  When one realises that two out of every three jobs in manufacturing industry are directly dependent on the export market, one can see how significant our exports are.</P>
    <P>Many of the subjects touched on do not come under my direct responsibility. Company law was mentioned and the number of companies that were closing down.  I gave some figures of some of these firms and Deputy Flynn referred to them.  My responsibility deals with the legal requirements for the operation of a company.  There is no way we can legislate to make a company successful.  My direct responsibility is to ensure that companies operate within the law &mdash; keep accounts, fufil their responsibilities to the community and so on.  The law as it stands has been seen to be defective because it has allowed a small number of firms engaged in trade to behave in a way which was extremely damaging to the business community and very damaging to their employees.  It is not an exaggeration to say that these firms have been acting in a fraudulent manner within the law.  Their intent was to get away with as much as they could, with no sense of responsibility towards the people with whom they were doing business or towards those they employ.  As I said in my opening remarks, they would open companies, milk them for what they could, fold up, not meet their moral obligations but meet their strict legal obligations, and then open a new company the next week.  They would repeat this procedure time and time again.  It is my intention to put an end to that type of activity and it will be done in the Bill which will be coming before the Oireachtas in the autumn.  It is essential that it not only be done but that it be done in a responsible manner which will ensure that it will be effective.</P>

I believe the present Minister for Justice is trying to deal with the problems of urban crime with which we have been bedevilled for a number of years.  We have been hearing for a number of years that there were not enough gardaí on the beat.  In the last <Col N="1172" /> year or two there certainly has been an increase on the number of foot patrols. The Garda have tried to co-operate with the community and to overcome the massive problems of lawlessness.  It is almost impossible to stop the rising level of crime but if we could even control it and stop the escalation of vandalism, robberies, handbag snatching, robberies of houses, attacks on the person, if we could at least give some protection to the ordinary individual, we would be going a long way.  I believe that the present Minister, so far as it is possible for him to do so with the present legislation, is doing that.</P>
      <P>The major problem now in my constituency of Dublin Central and in every urban area is drugs.  The godfathers of the drug-pushing industry are succeeding in getting entire communities into an unbelievable position.  They are using the poverty and deprivation of the community to force them into robbing, theft and vandalism to feed their drugs habit.  It is impossible to stop this with the present legislation.  I know the Minister will take the opportunity presented by the Criminal Justice Bill to overcome this problem. I believe he will take hard, draconian measures, which will be implemented with a lot of criticism of him because the do-gooders of this world will tell him that his measures will discriminate against this person and that person.  It will be like the argument in 1977 that we did not need Loughan House.  Anyone who is familiar with the areas in this city where the real crime takes place will realise that it is not a question of a community centre or an open space or a job.  There are social problems, problems that are very important, but what this country needs very badly is not alone adequate measures to deal with the social issues but equally to deal with those people who use for crime the lack of social facilities and the lack of opportunities in this life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Dublin city at present there are many people who will abuse whatever system they can to further their own interests in crime.  These people have to be dealt with.  They have to be taken out of the system.  If that is not done there is no chance of dealing with either the social problems or the problems of law and <Col N="1173" /> order.  I hope the Minister and the Government will have the moral courage necessary to implement a Bill which is necessary to deal with that problem, it will not be a popular measure.  It will be a measure which will be supported by the silent majority, the people who are afraid to come out at night, afraid to walk the streets in the daytime and those people who have for a number of years been besieged by criminal activities.</P>
    <P>Earlier on this year I used the wrong words when I said that if those measures are not implemented the people will take the law into their own hands and the vigilantes will take over.  What I should have more correctly said was that, if there is not co-operation between the local communities and the police force to overcome and eliminate those people who actively pursue crime as a way of life, this country and this city in particular will degenerate.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister understands.  He is from a city himself.  There is a small element in Dublin, Cork, Limerick who will use vandalism and crime to make substantial sums of money.  If the Criminal Justice Bill does not take these people out of circulation in a very tough and forceful manner it will not have done the job I would have thought it would do. Jobs and community centres are other issues and the godfathers of crime are not interested in those things.  In one area a community centre was recently turned down by the local people.  It was to be a very excellent community centre arranged by Dublin Corporation to be built by AnCO services in co-operation with environmental work schemes.  It was turned down on the basis that if it went into this flat complex it would bring in elements from other areas and bring down the area even further.  That is a sad reflection on the situation.  It is sad that where facilities are badly needed a community besieged by the problem of heroin would refuse a facility offered to them. This is within a mile of O'Connell Bridge.</P>
    <P>There is very little being done about these problems.  I could take any Member of this House or you, a Cheann Comhairle, to a part of my constituency where you would see heroin for sale right now. <Col N="1174" /> These places are known to the Garda. The individuals who sell and push the drugs, who distribute them and co-ordinate the activities are known to the Garda, but still they operate.  That is a sad fact.  There are people between the ages of 14 and 18 whose lives are being totally destroyed.  We are in here with fairly plush facilities talking about problems but not reaching a solution.  We can talk all we like, but outside of this House people's lives are being pulled apart, families are being besieged, people are ruined forever, and some die &mdash; all because of the drug problem.  If we do not legislate to deal with those problems we are failing in our duty as public representatives. I know that nothing I say would surprise the Minister or shock him. He hears it every day.  Measures must be implemented to enable gardaí to arrest the racketeers, break their grip on the city and deal with these people who are dangerous to speak about or to work against.  If they are not dealt with quickly, the city will continue to decline.</P>
    <P>Three or four years ago heroin was almost unknown in the city, except in a few small circles.  Now it is freely available in several areas.  If the resources are not made available to deal with this menace, where will it stop?  One reads about unemployment, deprivation and lack of housing facilities; but up to 30 years ago the housing in this city and the jobs position were worse than they are today.  The tenements and slums, most of which have been knocked down but some of which still remain, indicate the conditions of those times when the present-day amenities were lacking.  Training schemes for young people and development and youth employment offices were unknown in the inner city.  In those times there was no problem of neighbour attacking neighbour, or of one street warning against another, of godfathers, drugs, vandalism and all the savage crimes using the present unemployment and recessionary conditions. These are a new trade to the city, mainly caused by the drug abuse problem and we appear totally unable to cope.</P>
    <P>One can talk about more gardaí, more Garda overtime and more and better regulations; but there must be a will and <Col N="1175" /> people cannot operate on a nine to five basis, standing at the end of the street hoping that nothing will happen tonight. That is not the way to solve the problem. The Garda must be committed in their determination to do their utmost to cure the present ailments.  If they do not, the consequences are unthinkable.  They need extra legislation, but that is not the whole problem.  Even with their present resources they can do a lot.  I am familiar with their endeavours in the inner city and congratulate the present Minister and his predecessors on increasing the number of gardaí.  However, it is no good only having numbers.  This city cannot afford to have no-go areas.  If we do not have them officially, they are there unofficially after dark.  Gardaí must use the present resources and, it is hoped, the extra ones which they will get in the future with the support of everybody in this House, to tackle the problem of these area.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister will have the courage to bring in the Bill which is necessary for these times.  There are the pressure groups that talk about the need to solve the root causes of the problem. The major crime gangs in this city are not interested in the root cause of any problem. They are interested in exploitation in every way possible.  If the Garda cannot be confident of successfully bringing these people to justice, we are going nowhere.  I have spoken frequently to gardaí on the beat who have told me of the five or six people who are causing the problems in their areas.  At constituency clinics, party meetings, residents' associations and community meetings you will hear precisely the same names.  However, you still see those people walking freely about the streets.  I wish to put on the record that it is an absolute frustration for a young, active, committed garda who wishes to do his job diligently and to arrest such people.  He may think he has a foolproof case against them but no sooner will the garda be out of the court than the person whom he brought into court will be back in the area.  That is not an exaggeration, although at one time I <Col N="1176" /> thought it was.  I have seen too many cases.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency about 18 months ago a person had been arrested seven or eight times in the same month. The gardaí warned him of the dire consequences of his continuing in his crimes and when they came outside the station they found that their patrol car was gone. They knew where to recover it and did so.  When gardaí cannot do their own duties no matter how diligent they are and when things like that happen to them, they feel useless.</P>
    <P>There are a number of speakers from my party and from the Government who wish to come in on this debate which ends at 10.30 p.m.  The Minister has perhaps one opportunity, because it is not every day that a major Bill on justice comes into this House.  It will have to be painstakingly prepared, detailed and ruthless. We hear the opinion of the do-gooders who live far away from these problems and who do not understand the distress of the 75 year old women whose homes are broken into time and time again or have to listen to the elderly women whose heads have been beaten off the ground, to men who have had their wage packages stolen or their social welfare payments snatched when coming back from places like Cumberland Street or Gardiner Street.  Unfortunately, these victims are not articulate in public debate.  They are never asked about their problems.  They are the silent majority who are absolutely sickened and bewildered by the present rules and regulations.  They wonder if the day will come when Dáil Éireann will legislate for them.  For years these people have traditionally supported democratic politics and have seen that these have worked, perhaps through two world wars but certainly through one.  Now, in their old age, they have no protection.  They can tell how these problems can be solved.</P>
    <P>If these problems are not solved by democratic means, unfortunately people will think that there must be other ways. None of us agree with that, but there is an absolute obligation on us to ensure that the legislative powers are given to the Garda force to carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1177" /> Otherwise, we waste our time as public representatives and the taxpayers' money.  The Minister, as a man coming from an urban area, will, I am sure, take the necessary measures once and for all to take on the godfathers of crime &mdash; the social problems are a different Minister's responsibility.  These people need sentences which befit their crimes.  One can afterwards deal with the people whom they have misled.  Until those criminals are taken out of circulation and serve the sentences which they deserve and not in and out under the Probation Act and because of adjournments and minor technicalities, the life of the city will continue to disimprove.</P>
    <P>People may say in court that these criminals have offended for the first time, but it may well be the fiftieth time.  They manage to commit serious crimes with the knowledge that there is a very small chance of being arrested.  If they are arrested, there is a smaller chance of their being brought before the court.  If they are brought before the court, there is an even smaller chance of ever being convicted and, after all those stages, if they are convicted they can be absolutely sure that they will not serve much of their sentences.  They can go free and continue robbing, committing crimes of vandalism and skullduggery.  If this continues, we will have failed absolutely as a parliament, as a body here to legislate.  The Minister will have my support and I am certain the support of the majority of Members for whatever measures he sees fit to take.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the sentiments expressed by the last speaker. He dealt in great detail with the problem <Col N="1178" /> of increased crime in the city.  However, this relates not only to the city.  The malaise of increased crime has spread throughout the country.  Those counties immediately adjacent to Dublin have been particularly hard hit.  I am speaking about crimes in which there is violence and, as the last speaker mentioned also, crimes against the elderly and sometimes, too, against the very young.  As legislators we have a duty to do everything possible to protect those who are no longer able bodied enough to protect themselves.  The best way of tackling this job is by ensuring that our Garda force are sufficiently strong in number and sufficiently well equipped both in modern communication techniques and mobile equipment to be able to combat the kind of crime rate that this country has been experiencing increasingly in the past few years.</P>
      <P>When the measures that are necessary are taken in respect of all types of crime, there will be some people who will be sympathetic with those who are given stiff sentences.  There will be people who will say that there are mitigating circumstances in so far as many of the hooligans are concerned but we do not always have people to stand up and speak for the victims of those crimes.  I am thinking particularly of the elderly who are almost afraid to go to bed at night because of the fear that their homes will be broken into and their property stolen.  There have been programmes on radio and television in which older people related some of the very bad experiences they had at the hands of criminals.  This state of affairs is a sad reflection on us as legislators and on society in general.  We have heard of elderly people who have sat inside their doors with iron bars or sticks with which to defend themselves.  This indicates a very serious stage in the crime wave.  I know that the Minister is genuinely concerned with taking whatever action is necessary to deal in the shortest possible time with these problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the debate began speakers have been referring to the problem of drugs. This is an area that is causing great concern not only for the Garda but throughout society.  Having regard to the big <Col N="1179" /> money that is involved in drugs it will be very difficult to deal quickly and efficiently with the problem.  It is estimated that the drugs business is valued at about £25 million.  That is £25 million worth of black marketeering that the Revenue do not hear about.  It is business that is of no benefit to the State but which has disastrous effects on many people.  The problem is one that must be tackled without delay.</P>
    <P>The Department of Justice will need to co-operate very carefully with the Department of Health in order to ensure that there is a combination of detection and prosecution and that there is the custodial and corrective care necessary to ensure that the users of drugs are out of reach of the pushers.  That is the most important element in dealing with this problem.  We have heard of people undergoing treatment at the drugs unit in Jervis Street being frightened to the extent of leaving the unit as a result of threats from those who are interested in the drug-pushing business.  Possible witnesses have been frightened into leaving the unit, a unit in which very good work is done.  This intimidation has caused serious problems in regard to the detection and the bringing to court of the pushers. In addition to custodial care for users, the Garda must crack down viciously on the pushers to ensure they are put out of business.  The last speaker referred to a number of areas in the city in which very dangerous drugs are readily available but that sort of situation prevails also in many country towns.  It is causing grave alarm among parents.</P>
    <P>After a period of careful mobilisation of the police force, after careful stalking of the drug pushers and after the removal from the arena of the users, it should no longer be economic for those who are bringing the drugs into the country to remain in business.  If we can bring about that situation we will be eliminating one of the major causes of crime in our society.</P>
    <P>The last speaker referred to mandatory or at least stiffer sentences as a means of dealing with the problem.  It is essential that those found with drugs in their possession <Col N="1180" /> do not have an opportunity of going once again into the market place to peddle their wares.  We must put the pushers out of society for a long time.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the necessity for a properly mobilised police force.  It is recognised now generally that young hooligans stealing powerful cars are at a big advantage when dealing with the Garda in that those cars are faster than the Garda cars.  These hooligans have little regard for human life and they have the resources by way of unlimited supplies of cars at their disposal.  It is well known that in some areas only certain types of cars are stolen.  This is because those vehicles are most likely to afford those who steal them the opportunity of escaping from Garda patrol cars. Because of this situation the Garda need to be supplied with very powerful cars. They need also the most up-to-date communications equipment through it is being alleged that some criminals now have such equipment.  However, modern technology lends itself to a high degree of skill in the communications area.  We must ensure that only the best is available to our Garda.  They should be at least as well equipped as are any other police force in Europe.  Because of the increased incidence of crime there is a greater need now than at any other time for such equipment.</P>
    <P>Another way of helping to reduce the crime rate is to have increased foot patrols.  It can be said with justification that two gardaí on foot are hardly a deterrent if an armed robbery is about to take place or if violent people decide to steal a highpowered car.  However, a foot patrol will always be aware of the movement of such people long before they start on the road to serious crime.  This has been established not only in towns and villages but in cities.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that extra gardaí are not the answer to everything and I agree.  The Minister should have particular regard to new urban areas especially those where there is no Garda station. There are many such areas in my constituency of Kildare.  Leixlip is one where there is no Garda station.  Some years ago <Col N="1181" /> the population would not have merited a Garda station but now we have a huge community with an up and coming teenage population.  It is essential that consideration be given to the provision of a Garda station in Leixlip and other areas where the population has grown.  I ask the Minister to consider taking that decision in principle in the near future.</P>
    <P>There are many towns in County Kildare where the number of gardaí in the local Garda stations has decreased, There can be no excuse for that.  I know there are pressures on the gardaí and that it is expensive to keep a high manning level in country stations.  Unless we are prepared to spend money on combating crime the problem will escalate.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is only too well aware of the things I and other speakers have said.  I wish him every success in dealing with the problems we have.  If they are not tackled they will get out of control and we will not have the resources to deal with them.</P>

This does not reflect on the present holder of the office or on any previous holder but because of the frightening situation we have.  Formerly we looked to the Department of Justice to protect us so that we could enjoy life in a happier fashion than is now possible. With the permission of the Chair I propose to take 20 minutes.</P>

      <P>Over the centuries man has accepted and submitted to certain regulations.  Whether they came from the temporal or church power we need not <Col N="1182" /> deliberate on.  Neither need we deliberate on whether one power has weakened and in doing so has weakened the other. Nowadays man does not want to submit to any laws or regulations and because of that we have the present situation of which we are all aware.  We are concerned here about doing something to redress the position particularly in regard to the moneys we extract from the community towards this end.</P>
      <P>The people are getting very poor value from the legal profession at present.  We know the position that obtains.  Young men and women are selected from society. They are subsidised while they are reading law and pursuing legal expertise. The fees which parents pay represent only a fraction of the cost involved and so they are paid for by society.  They emerge on society and their main preoccupation seems to be to defy society to prove that anyone is guilty of any offence even though in some cases the dogs in the street are barking that certain criminals can be identified and are living on certain roads in certain areas.  These people are brought before the courts.  Money is paid to the legal profession, the same legal profession educated by the community, so that they can play around with words and indulge in legal jargon and technicalities and defy anyone to prove anyone guilty of an offence.  That is probably an over-simplification but I use it to demonstrate the ridiculous and laughable situation that has occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know of a case which occurred recently where a lady living in what could be described as a middle-class area was attacked and raped and where the person in question was identified.  The guilty person was given free legal aid to prove that he was innocent.  The lady who was attacked, injured and subjected to this trauma had to pay for her own legal aid to be represented in court.  What a ridiculous situation.  That lady had contributed through taxation to the education of the legal person in question.  His legal adviser was able to call upon psychiatric, psychological and medical expertise at the expense of the community to justify what the wrongdoer had done. The lady who had suffered needed hospitalisation <Col N="1183" /> as well as psychiatric and psychological treatment but she had to pay for this herself.  What a stupid situation. We must put it to the legal profession that we can no longer tolerate this tomfoolery or else the person on whose behalf they operate will have to pay for the service provided until at least we reach the stage where the offended and the innocent party can enjoy the same service.  It is accepted that our courts exist not to establish the guilt of anybody but rather to defy the man in the street to prove a person guilty whose guilt may be very obvious.</P>
    <P>Some years ago I as junior Minister at the Department of Education and the then Minister for Justice opened Loughan House so that we could contain some of the young delinquents in this city and other urban areas who were attacking people in the streets.  They were sent for education and corrective treatment to Loughan House, a place which had services and accommodation superior to most I have seen in hotels.  There was a hue and cry because we were sending young boys a distance of 65 miles, too far for their mothers to travel to see them. That lobby obtained in Dublin and elsewhere the interest and attention of many professional people who would cause the former Minister for Justice and myself of being devoid of certain human sensitivity in that we would send a teenage boy who might have been guilty of serious crimes away from the scene of those crimes, notwithstanding the fact that the very best facilities were being provided which were of a standard far better than would obtain in the normal school.  I compliment the Minister on his decision to reopen Loughan House and I am hoping that other institutions will be made available so that these people can be contained and be given treatment which will serve to correct and deter them from continuing on the paths of crime.</P>
    <P>I refer again to the lack of faith and confidence of the people in the legal profession and the courts.  That is the saddest position in which we could find ourselves.  I can understand why there is such little faith in the legal system.  In my <Col N="1184" /> constituency and others teenagers and older people are attacking ladies, robbing bags and stealing cars.  Those who suffer go to the local garda station and often the reaction from the gardaí is that they are sorry but they can do nothing because their hands are tied.  These people are paying considerable sums in taxation to provide salaries for the gardaí and the legal services to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I am purposely not advocating more gardaí in my constituency or another Garda barracks.  I could make a strong case for having more Dublin-born gardaí serving in Dublin districts because it is important that young people should identify with the gardaí.  It is easier for a young person born in Dublin to accept as a friend somebody who speaks his own language, not somebody who has an accent or a language which is completely alien to him, somebody who may have come from a comfortable home in an isolated part of the country who would not be familiar with the difficulties of urban areas.  It is also desirable in respect of elderly people that they should be able to deal with a garda as old as themselves. These are matters to which I would refer more fully if everything else were in order.</P>
    <P>The main problem is that the system has been brought into disrepute because of what is happening.  There are lawyers who would say they are pursuing a case true to the traditions of law or jurisprudence but to the public it appears that they have a vested interest in the continuation of what is happening because they are doing very well out of it.  A person who is guilty of some offence and brought to a Garda station will not be allowed by the legal profession to talk to the Garda because the lawyers will be paid for talking on his behalf.  That is nonsensical. Why should the taxpayers have to pay a lawyer to talk on behalf of a person who is guilty of a crime?  I cannot see the reason for it.  The sooner the better we change the system whereby a person is innocent until proved guilty.  That system has failed us.  Let us adopt the other European style where by a person is guilty until he can prove his innocence.  We cannot afford to continue extracting from <Col N="1185" /> the people the colossal sums necessary to continue the farce of defying anybody to prove that a person is guilty of an offence when we all know that he is guilty.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he proposes to introduce a new Criminal Justice Bill.  That had been the hope of some of his predecessors.  I hope he will carry on from the preparation that had occurred when he assumed office six months ago. I hope the Bill will be before us in the next session of the Dáil because I am not at ail convinced that the Bill dealing with community service will be of any use.  I should like the Minister to indicate whether the necessary manpower to operate that Act has been arranged.  I am sure the Minister has discovered that that Act will serve only in a small way to combat crime and that he will not take it as an excuse to postpone the major reorganisation necessary by delaying the introduction of a new Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <P>The introduction of such a Bill would have a psychological effect on some of our people because elderly men and women would no longer be afraid to leave their homes.  Indeed they could restart living, as it were.  I say to the Minister that a great community need would be met by the announcement that a new Bill will be introduced early in the autumn so that old ladies who are afraid to go out can go out again and so that old ladies who are afraid to stay in can do so happily in the knowledge that they will not have unwelcome visitors and that if they do, penalties appropriate to the injury will be administered.  It is only in that way that we will get across the lesson that must be learned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on a subject I have been particularly interested in.  I was elected on a platform in the crime-ridden town of Dundalk.  Since I arrived here I have heard horrifying stories of crime in Dublin.  We have the twin problems of what the economy can afford and the maintence of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Governments have failed miserably to tackle crime and I must suggest that we are losing the battle.  The old <Col N="1186" /> maxim that crime does not pay has become outmoded because crime now pays.  Anybody who has read the newspapers about the recent trial of Mr Dunne will not have any difficulty in believing my words.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe firmly that what is needed in the fight against crime, if we are to be serious and if the public are to have confidence in our willingness to fight crime, is a radical rethink.  I believe the only way to fight terror is with terror.  The only way to deter is through a Judiciary who will do the job the people want them to do &mdash; to impose sentences on criminals appropriate to the crimes, when they are found guilty.</P>
      <P>I come from a judicial background but I think the Judiciary have failed miserably in the last few years.  Liberality towards criminals has gone from one extreme to the other.  For instance, the crime of murder had been downgraded. A man was shot dead in Dublin last week but two days later that crime did not rate a single line in the national newspapers. It is no longer a horror for a man to be gunned down in the streets.</P>
      <P>I echo what Deputy Tunney said when he criticised the Judiciary.  It is a gravy train for them that there is free legal aid. A lot of that money goes into the pockets of lawyers.  I am afraid the pendulum swings in favour of the person charged with crime and the Minister must redress the balance immediately.</P>
      <P>On the question of policing, in my area we have a very good police force but I should like to see an increase in foot patrols because no matter how sophisticated crime fighting may have become we will never match the deterrent of the policeman on patrol.  I suggest that part of the reason for the increase in crime in the past 20 years has been the removal of the policeman on the beat, the old-fashioned community policeman who has been replaced by four or five gardaí driving around in a car.  There is an unanswerable demand for the return of the policeman on the beat.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1187" /> We need more jails.  I have a question down about the possibility of reopening the jail in Dundalk.  I believe that the existence of local jails can contain local crime and I hope the Minister for Justice will look at that possibility.</P>
    <P>The burning question throughout the country is the drugs problem.  I hesitate to say what I would do with drug pushers because I might be branded as a dictator. If we are to be serious about the general crime problem some drastic measures will have to be brought in to contain the frightening crime of drug pushing.  I do not think any sentence could be harsh enough for a person who feeds drugs to boys and girls of tender years.  The Minister for Justice will have to deal with that problem many times in the next four years.  He must get to grips with this at an early stage in his term of office or otherwise the problem will escalate out of all proportion.  The situation with regard to drugs in Dublin is on a par with the problem that exists in New York and that is a frightening comparison for a country which 20 years ago did not have such a problem.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of corrective custodial care.  There is a need for remedial treatment for young criminals but we must also have deterrents.  There is an absence of discipline in homes and schools and we must have some form of discipline for young people found guilty of criminal offences.  There is a need for several Loughan Houses throughout the country and such institutions are fully justified.  The Minister must consider providing more jails.  My idea of a jail is a penitentiary where people will not be ill-treated but where the living will be spartan enough to encourage the prisoners when they have concluded their sentence to make a firm resolution never to return to jail.  It is the absence of deterrents that has resulted in more crime.  I hate to be pessimistic but unless the Minister, and the Government, face this problem in a determined way the crime rate will escalate here with unhappy consequences for us all.</P>

      <P>I will be parochial at the <Col N="1188" /> outset and tell the Minister of the grave disappointment I felt this week when I was informed that the consultants appointed in connection with the building of a Garda station in Cavan town had been informed that the building would not be proceeding.  I am aware that there is a grey area between the Department of Justice and the Office of Public Works as to where responsibility lies but this decision represents another blow to my area. The old station was abandoned by the Garda some time ago.  They got out just in time or otherwise it would have fallen in on top of them.  The Garda are now housed in what was a private house, accommodation which is totally inadequate. It would have been inadequate before the local station party was reinforced and is very unsatisfactory now. The Minister should reconsider the position with regard to that station.  He may not be aware that there is a bit of a background to this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Cavan town Garda station. As it is a Border town there are far greater numbers of gardaí there now and, while the need was great hitherto, it has become greater.  There has been a problem about the site.  Cavan Urban Council were promised that the site would be utilised and they reserved it for this purpose. They are beginning to kick.  They are proving recalcitrant and, at some meetings two or three months ago, they stated that they were fed up waiting for the Office of Public Works to utilise the site and if they did not utilise it they would bring it back into their own use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might also mention my local station at Finea.  The actual Garda station is in County Cavan, though the village, as the House knows, is a famous village in County Westmeath.  We have not had a sergeant there for some time.  I was interested in reading in the Minister's speech his indication that things have changed a great deal and consequently new methods <Col N="1189" /> have to be devised for dealing with a kind of runaway criminal.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of breakings and enterings in that area and I gather some arrests were made as far south as Templemore in County Tipperary in connection with them.  This is the kind of thing the Minister referred to in his speech.  If he saw fit to appoint a sergeant to Finea as quickly as possible, this would be a help to that area.  He will have a beautiful place to live in and, if he is able to cast a fly neatly, or to troll, the waters of Lough Sheelin are right beside him.  In fact, the river flows past the Garda station and he can leave his boat just outside the Garda station and go straight up into the heart of the best trout lake in the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no particular insights into the drugs issue but I want to back up what other Deputies have said about pushers.  No mercy should be shown in driving the pushers out of circulation in our society.  Big money is involved.  This has also been referred to. A philosophy has been developed.  When older people are advising young people about drugs this philosophy is brought into play: &ldquo;After all, you people take a drink.  That is a drug.  Alcohol is a drug. You smoke.  Nicotine is a drug.  Why not tolerate the mildest of the other drugs which are now illegal?&rdquo; This whole philosophy has been worked out and there is almost a Pavlovian response from young people when you refer to drugs. They come up with this argument.  It is not an argument which holds up on close examination.  The movement from the soft drugs into the hard drugs is very easy and has been proven to be the normal procedure.  That philosophy should be attacked because the hard drugs are the real problem.  They have arrived hot on the heels, so to speak, of the soft drugs which were defended by some sophisticated people in our society not so long ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to catching big fish in the pushing line, I should like to say &mdash; and <Col N="1190" /> this is a criticism of the Garda if you like; I know they have difficulties; I have an admiration for the head of the Drug Squad because I knew him before he was recruited into the Drug Squad, and as far as I know he is from the same county as the Minister &mdash; that I cannot understand how a particular criminal on a particular day who was a big fish in this game was not watched.  He was convicted afterwards. There is no point in blaming the bail system because obviously and patently it is too lax.  On that occasion it would have struck me, if I were in charge of that operation, to have that individual watched all the time until the trial was over and until he was either convicted or acquitted.  He was actually convicted.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that Loughan House is still being used by the Department of Justice.  I had to endure a great deal of criticism of Loughan House in this House at one time.  By the way people were talking about it one would have thought it was some kind of a first cousin to Devil's Island.  It is a beautiful building, beautifully located with very fine facilities indeed.  If one went down there now I do not think one could pick a more beautiful setting, with mountains in the background, a very famous lake nearby and a beautiful building.</P>
    <P>I had a question down about what use was to be made of Loughan House &mdash; I think it is still on the Order Paper &mdash; but to give an idea of how slow we are in reaching questions the event has outstripped the question and Loughan House is now being used.  I am glad for several reasons.  The Minister has a very fine, dedicated staff there &mdash; I want to pay them that tribute &mdash; staff who did not want to be uprooted.  They came to me, I put down a question to the Minister and, so slow are the workings of this House that it has not been reached yet.</P>
    <P>I want to pay tribute to the people who embark on the education of the young prisoners &mdash;&ldquo;prisoners&rdquo; is perhaps a strong word for them, but I can tell the House there are some pretty tough little educandees in Loughan House.  One must have patience, one must have faith, persistence, strength of will, but above all one must not give up heart.  Talking <Col N="1191" /> to them one is impressed by their total dedication to continue on, because without that kind of courage one would be inclined to give up.  On a broader scale the educational programmes available on television can benefit prisoners.  It must be remembered, after all, that there are some excellent students among the prisoners. I shall not expand on it now but I hope the Minister will pay attention to that area.  Being an educationalist himself I am sure my exhortation is hardly necessary.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to improved technology, improved transport, improved mobility for the Garda to deal with the increasing incidence of crime and vandalism.  Also I would go along with what Deputy Tunney said in that it is important that the Garda should identify with local communities.  Some of them are excellent in this regard.  Whether it be boxing clubs, football clubs, swimming clubs or whatever all over the country, there are many dedicated members of the Garda Síochána who are doing a great deal of social work.  Identification of culture, to which Deputy Tunney referred also, is important, although many people who were not born in the metropolis did adapt extremely well both to the metropolis and to youth work in the metropolis.  I take it that his basic point is correct.</P>
    <P>As we know during the year the lack of co-ordination in sentencing in the courts is something that has come up for criticism.  There was one scandalous example during the year that was adequately dealt with in the House at the time.  I am sure the able Presidents of the Judiciary at the various levels in the course of performing their duties in that role will apply themselves to this because it has an effect on public opinion if one judge releases somebody for a serious crime while another sentences harshly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn in making his contribution on the Trade, Commerce and Tourism Estimate &mdash; I think he was dealing with insurance at the time &mdash; referred to the problem of the blood and urine tests with regard to drunken driving.  I do not think we should increase the permissible <Col N="1192" /> content.  I find sometimes that chemistry is a hard master and that it is difficult &mdash; I shall not go any further than this &mdash; to season justice with mercy in the face of a chemical reading.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention a matter in my constituency about which I wrote to the Department &mdash; it may have been to the Minister's predecessor &mdash; that is the staffing at Belturbet Garda station in County Cavan.  It is a station on the Border.  The people in Belturbet have approached me on a number of occasions about the running down of Garda strength there.  Perhaps the Minister would study the question again and ascertain if he can be in relief of it.</P>
    <P>The Public Record Office was mentioned by the Minister also.  I am sure it would appeal to the Minister, as it does to me, that the Public Record office, where I did some minor studies at one time, should be buttressed to the maximum extent by the Minister by proper financing and by making facilities available to people who want to consult records there.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have noticed that on the Order Paper I have three or four questions down about the courthouse in Cavan town.  It is a fine classical building, built about 1810, with a Doric frontage. However, there has been trouble with the roof.  A section of the roof has collapsed and there are whole areas of the courthouse which are just out of bounds now for the court.  All the Circuit Court cases now must be tried in Bailieboro', County Cavan, which, as the Minister knows, is on the eastern border, near the Meath border and jurors may have to travel from Blacklion, which is at Belcoo, County Fermanagh, through Cavan town right to Bailieboro'.  The formal question I have on the Order Paper asks what instructions the Minister has given the local authority in regard to the provisions of proper courthouse accommodation in Cavan town.  I hope the Minister will address himself to that problem because there is great hardship, particularly for jurors and people who are using the courts as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Land Registry.  I am grateful to him for clarifying <Col N="1193" /> all the functions of the Land Registry because I was tarring them all with the same brush.  I am glad to see that it is in one area only there are long delays.  But, God knows, the delays in that area are dreadful; there is no question or doubt about it.  The Minister says that of course he is caught there by the ban on recruitment in the public service.  I would suggest selective ignoring of the ban where there is a backlog of 12 months, as the Minister mentioned.  There seems to be a slight lack of logic there in that I notice the Minister said somewhere else that the fees charged made the Land Registry self-supporting.  If the fees make it selfsupporting I wonder if the Minister would look at the income and ascertain whether he could afford to employ some extra people without doing any injustice, damage or inflicting any wounds on the law which now forbids recruitment.</P>

      <P>I would not agree with my colleague, Deputy Tunney, that we should adopt a Napoleonic system and regard people as guilty until proved innocent.  I can understand how people would advocate that because of frustration at what is actually happening.  The law's delays particularly in the High Court &mdash; the Minister spoke about it in his speech &mdash; have been proverbial since Shakespeare's time.  Law is something that takes time and the Minister has taken steps to improve the position in the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Just one final comment on the Housing Act, 1982.  A committee of the Fianna Fáil Party were asked to have a look at what was happening in the courts in regard to that Act and the report was pretty horrifying.  There was grave hardship on old people who, despite the fact <Col N="1194" /> that there is an attempt at informality, are scared stiff about been hauled up in relation to their rents.  I think the Minister and his officials could apply themselves to easing the plight of these old people who were never in court before and who are scared stiff at having to appear in court and are afraid they will lose their tenancies.</P>

      <P>I take this opportunity of congratulating the Minister on his appointment.  He has brought a new image to the office, a very necessary image, in restoring morale and the level of confidence in the Garda.  It is essential a Minister should have a very balanced relationship with the Commissioner in eforts to detect, solve and prevent crime. Crime is taking a major proportion of the budget.  In the Six Counties the British are spending £1.8 million, which is just half our budget here, and a fairly significant proportion of that budget goes in defence and policing activities.  A substantial amount is also spent on crossBorder activities and security in Border regions.  The Commissioner must be a man of absolute integrity.  In the last six years we had one Commissioner removed from office for not doing his job and another forced, or allowed to leave, because he did not implement the conditions of his employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not questioning his integrity at all.  The Garda Síochána are the guardians of the peace of Ireland and the Minister should ensure that is what they do.  The war against crime must be intensified and criminals must be made to realise what they are up against in taking on the Garda.  What has been said by others in regard to drugs and drug pushers has my fullest support.  Drug <Col N="1195" /> pushers are the harbingers of human destruction and death.  I would have no sympathy for them.  No sympathy should be shown to them.  No bail should be granted to them.  Furthermore, mandatory minimum sentences should be imposed, sentences equal to the crime they commit on human society.  Their only interest is to further their own financial position.  Justice must be seen to be done and mandatory sentences must be imposed on all convicted drug pushers. In other countries pushers may be hanged or shot or have parts of their bodies removed.  People who indulge in these activities deserve no mercy.</P>
      <P>The work of the Drug Squad is to be commended.  Three pushers were caught recently.  I hope they catch many more. Social occasions are used by these pushers and the Garda are aware of this. Syringes have been found on the scene of these so-called social activities.  This is something that needs to be examined. Recently a taxi driver told me that he gave a lift to a 17-year old who actually injected himself in the back of the taxi. He told me of another 23-year-old junky who needs £300 a day to get himself a &ldquo;fix&rdquo;.  Young people are under enormous pressures, as Deputy Wilson said.  All they can see is the next &ldquo;fix&rdquo;.  Where they get the money or how is immaterial.  They resort to violence to get the necessary funds and the end result is death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The work of Jervis Street Hospital is to be commended and I hope that every facility will be given to that establishment to enable them to cope with the increasing number of young drug addicts.  I understand some are as young as 13 and 14 years of age.  Those responsible for this situation are the so-called barons who live in their castles at the expense of our youth.  They must be given mandatory sentences.  Deputy Woods was Minister for Health and he produced a very fine report on drugs.  I would have hoped he would have gone further and ensured that the punishment fitted the crime.  If the Governments of the world who concentrate funds now on nuclear missiles and space experimentation were to devote those funds to the eradication of <Col N="1196" /> opium that would help to solve the problem. Every effort will have to be made over the next few years to solve the problem.</P>
    <P>The pilot area in my constituency has not worked to the satisfaction of the local people.  The guardians of the peace, as the police are known, should be able to build up a relationship with the people in the areas they serve.  It is not feasible to have squad cars from centres 20 or 25 miles away trying to police rural areas effectively.</P>
    <P>There are valuable points in the pilot scheme.  For instance, radio contact among the gardaí is invaluable.  This is a small island and it is very difficult to do something without being noticed.  People in rural Ireland are much more vigilant than people living in large sprawling urban estates who might not know their neighbours two doors away although they might be living there for a number of years.  The increased transport facilities provided by the Department is also a valuable asset which should be fostered and strengthened.  There is no point limiting the understanding of ordinary people in terms of the gardaí flashing lights on squad cars without their building up a relationship with members of the force to whom they can go if they need help.</P>
    <P>The appointment of extra sergeants should be dealt with right away.  Young gardaí coming from Templemore need leadership and they should be given an incentive to do their job properly.  Over the years statements were made about the eligibility of people who enter the force.  Many young intelligent people wish to join the Garda Síochána.  This means the force will get the best people with intelligence, motivation and dedication. The Minister should spell out clearly that the interview for entrance to the Garda force is the competitive side of that examination.  This will stop people saying there was political pull because if a person gets six honours in his leaving certificate and another person only gets a pass leaving certificate, the second person might be chosen because he made a better showing at the examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1197" /> In regard to the breathalyser, there have been cases where people were caught whose livelihood depends on a licence.  In fairness to the Garda it must be said that they have been more than courteous to everybody.  In many instances borderline cases are warned by the Garda.  In some States in America if a person is convicted of drunken driving he is given his licence to get to and from work and he cannot say that the sentence deprived him of his livelihood.  I ask the Minister to look at this.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this Estimate.  Those of us who work as public representatives, particularly those who work in large urban areas as I do, realise the implications and the importance of the matters we are discussing being fully examined and precautions taken against those who are involved in crime and vandalism.  No subject has taken up so much time in recent months than this topic.  We have had many debates here and, while they have proved worthwhile in themselves, they have not led to a decrease in the rate of crime.  That is very sad.  Once there was a time when one could feel free to walk the streets of our large cities in safety. There was a time when one could sleep in one's bed and know nobody would break in and attack one.  Sadly that is no longer the case.  Only a few nights ago in my constituency close to my home a young woman lay sleeping in her bed while her husband was away and her children were sleeping in the rooms beside here.  She was violently attacked and raped.  That is a very sad thing to happen in a country which is predominantly Catholic and Christian.  This kind of situation is occurring week in and week out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Political difference does not come into it.  We all want to eliminate crime.  I believe that prevention is better than cure as regards crime and vandalism.  While prevention is still the best method we must also provide adequate facilities &mdash;<Col N="1198" /> prisons and detention centres &mdash; to take these people, many of them very young, who are involved in crime.</P>
    <P>As a society we have not spent enough time taking the necessary precautionary measures to ensure that many of our people will not drift into the easy way of life by getting involved in crime.  I represent two of the newest towns in this county, Tallaght and Clondalkin.  It must be said that we as a legislature have not taken the necessary precautionary measures to help these people by providing the necessary facilities to ensure that they do not get involved in crime and vandalism.</P>
    <P>I have the honour to represent the Tallaght area, an area which has over 60,000 people and is the fastest growing in this country and in western Europe. Yet the Tallaght of 1983 still has the same Garda station it had in the early sixties when there was a population of only a few hundred.  I say to the Minister, as I said to his predecessors, that that is not good enough.  A town of that size must have a Garda station properly manned and equipped to cater for the population it is supposed to serve.  Neither is it good enough that some days of the week the time of many gardaí is taken up witnessing the signatures of people signing for unemployment assistance.  That is not the job of the Garda and they should not be expected to do it.  That should be done by officials of the Department of Social Welfare.  I hope that practice will be changed soon.</P>
    <P>The Tallaght area deserves to be a Garda district in its own right; it is still a sub-district of the Rathfarnham area. That too is not good enough.  The Tallaght Garda station should have more senior officiers.  They need a superintendent and inspectors.  It also needs, as does any large area, a female Garda officer because many crimes involve women, particularly crimes relating to family law. It should be essential that each Garda station in large urban areas would have at least one female Garda officer.  That is not the case in Tallaght or Clondalkin and I hope the Minister will see his way to providing this area with a female officer who could look after the type of cases <Col N="1199" /> I have already referred to, such as the rape case.  Only by having a female Garda can these cases by handled properly.</P>
    <P>All our new towns and new centres of population should be provided with proper recreational facilities for our young people.  Proper facilities in themselves will not always lead to the elimination of crime.  However, they usefully take up the time of our young people.  All centres should have properly equipped and properly managed sports and leisure facilities.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Tunney, referred to the legal profession and in many instances I agree with what he said. People get very bad value for their money when employing a legal person.  Why must one have a solicitor and then, if the case is to be taken before a court, junior and senior counsel?  That is not necessary. Many court cases involve four or five legal people on each side.  That is cumbersome, expensive and beyond the reach of the ordinary person.  Our legal profession badly needs to be investigated. One simply needs a lawyer, rather than a solicitor and a barrister.  I cannot understand why the present system is deemed essential even for the most minor cases and I ask the Minister to investigate our legal profession soon.</P>
    <P>We must also examine our entire court system.  The Minister dwelt on this in his speech, saying that many cases take quite some time to come before the courts.  It is not just a question of changing the law with regard to bail, which is also necessary. These criminals must be brought before the court as quickly as possible and their cases dealt with.  That cannot happen at present because we have not adequate court facilities.  The Minister intends to increase the number of courts by two and that will alleviate the situation but I hope for further improvements in that area before long.</P>
    <P>Family law has been talked about at some length in this House and outside it for quite some time.  Of special interest to me is the question of family law reform, particularly the establishment of a system of family tribunals rather than having the cases coming before district <Col N="1200" /> courts.  These cases need a proper forum where parents and children can be properly looked after.  As an intermediary step, the Minister should examine the possibility of establishing a conciliation scheme, similar to those in other countries. That would operate side by side with the courts.  The two parties in the marriage could get together with the conciliator and, it is hoped, some solution could be found to their problems which may not require court action.  The present situation under which the two people in a marital dispute must come together in confrontation in the courtroom is not in the best interests of either themselves or of the children.</P>
    <P>Having thought a lot about it, I have comments to make in relation to barring orders, having come across many who have been barred from the family home. In many cases barring orders are working to the discrimination of the male spouse in the marriage.  Whilst I agree with the principle of granting barring orders and of the extension of their period under Fianna Fáil from three months to 12 months, we have not catered adequately for the barred spouse, in terms of maintenance payments which he must pay to his wife and in support of his children, nor have we catered for him in providing alternative accommodation. What can a man do who has been barred from his home if he must pay a substantial amount for the upkeep of his family? Where does he go for accommodation? We have not examined that aspect and we should.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> First, I should like to thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate.  Many of the points raised have been dealt with in my speech in moving the Estimate, so there is probably no need to go over that ground again.  I can see the concern shared by everybody and, in a sense, feel like somebody who has come in in the middle of the film.  I do not know what the story was before I came in and cannot change that part of it.  However, I hope to be able to change the progress of the film from now on, that certain changes can be made and that I will have the co-operation of the House in making these changes which will improve the situation.</P>
      <P>One thing that struck me about the debate was something which was not in it rather than what was in it, that is, that nobody mentioned all the problems of subversive crime.  That is probably because the level of subversive crime is now quite low.  However, Deputies should remember that the subversives in prison are now taking up two of our major prisons, Portlaoise and Limerick. One of our major problems is the lack of prison space.  The result of subversive activity has taken two prisons almost totally out of use for ordinary crime. Obviously, the time of many gardaí is taken up with preventing subversive crime and that should also be remembered by Deputies.</P>
      <P>The point made most forcibly and with greatest concern in the House was that about the abuse of drugs.  I share that concern.  The situation is dreadful in that regard.  The Government responded to it by setting up a Committee of Ministers at the meeting at Barrettstown in May.  I hope that the report of that committee will be available shortly, because it will give us guidlines for proceeding with our efforts to eliminate this frightening problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson made a point which we should all remember, that there is a milieu or a drug-takers' philosophy, a society susceptible to drug-taking and the work <Col N="1202" /> of the Garda will not prevent that.  If young people, especially young, educated people in the universities out of middle-class families think that it is quite appropriate to smoke cannabis, it is then very difficult to blame deprived people who are being preyed on by drug pushers if they experiment with harder drugs.  What is astounding in the use of heroin in Dublin city at the moment is how quickly it became a major problem. It is certainly a matter of major concern. I understand that we will get the report very quickly and I hope that we can act quickly on the submissions it contains.</P>
    <P>I might point out to the House that the legislation which controls the use of drugs was passed in 1977 &mdash; the Misuse of Drugs Act.  That is legislation for which the Minister for Health has responsibility, not the Minister for Justice.  Consequently, amendments to that legislation would be more appropriate for the Minister for Health.  I might point out to Deputy Woods, who made some very good suggestions on how to deal with the problem of drug abuse, that the legislation which controls the abuse of drugs came from the Department in which he was the Minister up to 14 December and that he had, as far back as September 1981, a report from the Attorney General advocating changes in the Misuse of Drugs Act. While I appreciate his concern and the validity of the suggestions he has made and while I agree personally with the idea of mandatory sentences for drug pushers, that is within the ambit of the Department of Health.  That was the situation, too, when the Deputy was Minister for Health.</P>

Decisions as to the number and rank of the members to be assigned to particular duties or units are matters for the Garda authorities.  Following a recent review of resources aimed at making better use of existing manpower, the drug squad unit based at Dublin Castle and the operational drug unit formerly based at Garda Headquarters have been amalgamated under the control of a detective superintendent at Dublin Castle.  He has responsibility also for the serious crime <Col N="1204" /> squad.  It is intended that the amalgated drug unit and the serious crime squad will in future work more closely together in a combined effort to combat drug offences and other drug-related serious crime.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Woods made some critical references to the DPP and implied clearly that in some cases the Government or I have prevailed on him to take certain decisions.  This is a charge against me but it is a charge also against the DPP because it would be a serious impropriety on his part to have allowed himself to be influenced in that way.  Because of what has been said I wish to put certain facts on the record.</P>
      <P>The office of Director of Public Prosecutions is an independent statutory office and the director exercises his functions independently of the Minister for Justice and of the Government.  The suggestion that I made political representations, or any other kind of representations, to him about any of the cases in question is untrue.  It is wrong of the Deputy to have made those charges against one who is not here to defend himself and who obviously is not free to embark on public explanations for his decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy has tried to give his allegations an air of credibility by suggesting that the director took appeals to a higher court in cases which had what the Deputy regards as a political complexion while <Col N="1205" /> no such appeal was taken in the Fairview case.  Deputy Woods asks the House to believe that those cases were comparable and he suggested clearly that an appeal in the Fairview case would have been an ordinary part of the judicial process just as is the case with other appeals.</P>
    <P>The facts are very different.  An appeal against the suspension of a sentence is so far removed from being a normal part of the judicial process that, so far as my information goes, not one such appeal has ever been taken.  The right of the prosecution to appeal against a decision of the Central Criminal Court is not conferred by statute but was recognised by the Supreme Court as a right.  An analysis of the judgments shows, however, that it is not something that ought to be done simply because the DPP might think the decision was excessively lenient.  In sharp contrast, the appeals which the Deputy implies were motivated politically were not appeals against the leniency of the decision of the court.  They were appeals on points of law under a power that is provided for by statute and that is exercised freely and frequently.  There are no constraints on the prosecution in relation to appeals on points of law such as there are where what is at issue is a matter involving the exercise of judicial discretion.</P>
    <P>I am dealing with this matter purely on a factual basis by placing on record that the Deputy has attempted to compare a situation where an appeal would be unprecedented with a situation where appeals could fairly be said to be commonplace. I will not comment beyond that because to do so would mean that I would be commenting on the merits of the individual decisions by the DPP.  To do that, even where it was done in his defence, would be inappropriate because he is an independent statutory officer.</P>
    <P>The Governor of Portlaoise Prison is a civil servant for whom I have responsibility so in that respect I am obliged to set the record straight.  What happened was that in the context of certain overtime restrictions in the prisons area which I announced on 9 March last, the Prison Officers' Association made a statement which was reported in the media that the <Col N="1206" /> Governor of Portlaoise Prison had stated that any reduction in staffing levels at the prison would interfere with security.  This represented a misunderstanding of the governor's position as communicated to me in regard to the proposed restrictions on overtime.</P>
    <P>The governor issued a statement on 10 March verifying his position in this regard.  It is not my intention to raise the temperature of the House but once charges are made I am obliged to set the record straight.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy Wilson asked about a Garda station in Cavan town.  We have checked the information in this regard.  The Office of Public Works had a site for a new station in Farnham Street but a clause in the prescribed agreement between them and the local authority provided that if work did not start on 1 January 1983, the site would revert to the local Authority.  That was a condition attaching to the purchase of the site.  The Office of Public Works were not in a position to start the work on 1 January last and the local authority insisted on having the site back.  The OPW are looking for a new site.  There is no proposal not to provided a new station and neither is there any downgrading in the ranking order of the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> But I am sure that if the local authority could continue to provide the site, the matter could be speeded up.  I am glad of the contributions made by many Deputies but obviously I cannot deal specifically with all of them.  However, there is one point I would make for the information of the House and it is this: the areas of my Department obviously interlink whether it is the Garda side, the prison side or the courts side.  Therefore, reform in one area affects another.  In recent months <Col N="1207" /> there have been many convictions, many arrests and many crimes detected.  One of the major difficulties in this whole area is the lack of prison accommodation.  This is where matters begin to be difficult.  The Commissioner has put more gardaí on the beat so we presume that this will lead to more detection but if more crime is detected, more people go through the courts and so we need more prison spaces.  If we reform the courts so that the backlog of cases is reduced and so that procedures are simplified the same number of people move more speedily through the system and, consequently, more prison space is necessary.</P>
      <P>If one reforms the criminal law as I intend doing &mdash; I hope to have the relevant Bill ready before the commencement of the next session &mdash; and if one gives extra powers to the Garda, the presumption is that there will be more detection and conviction.  Again, this means a need for more prison spaces.  If we put this in the context of a situation in which 1,200 people were shed from the prison system last year and also in the context of there being no policy decisions outstanding that would give us any prison space until 1987, one realises the enormity of the difficulty and the desirability of having alternatives even if Deputies would be somewhat critical of alternatives such as those contained in Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill which is now going through the Seanad.</P>

When the item on the agenda dealing with discharges of radioactive substances from land-based sources was under discussion the Irish representative set out this country's position on the matter and, in particular, expressed our concern to protect our marine resources, fishing, industry and coasts from pollution from whatever source and to protect man and the environment from excessive levels of radioactivity. Our representative requested the commission to initiate further scientific studies with the objective of determining more precisely the measures to be adopted to deal with radioactive discharges.  The commission decided to refer specific question relating to such discharges to the Nuclear Energy Agency for further consideration.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the question, no bilateral discussions have taken place between the Irish and UK Governments on the question of dumping of nuclear waste.

      <P>The Land Commission have no proposals for the acquisition of these lands.  Due to budgetary constraints the direct acquisition of land by the Land Commission has had to be curtailed.  Instead local smallholders are being encouraged to join as a group to buy land coming on the market. The Land Commission will give all the help and advice required to such a group in relation to mapping, subdivision and subsequent rearrangement.</P>
      <P>If the local smallholders in this case are interested in buying for themselves, they should contact the Land Commission office at St. Munchin's House, Dock Road, Limerick.</P>
