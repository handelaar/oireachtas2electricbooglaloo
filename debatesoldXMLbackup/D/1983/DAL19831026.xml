      <P>On the Order of Business may I ask the Minister for Transport and for Post and Telegraphs to make a statement <Col N="706" /> in relation to the lack of balance clearly displayed on RTE over the last week.  For instance, on Sunday we had Keating, Monday we had Fennell and Robinson, Tuesday we had Hussey and today we have Mary Bonneti, a possible candidate for a by-election who is going live on television today.  This is unfair carry-on by RTE.  It appears that unless one has a red card or blue card one will not get on television.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by this debate to identify the problems that face our economy, to indicate the Government's approach to these problems and to give to the Opposition the opportunity to present their own analysis and approach to the economy.</P>
      <P>I would like to quote at the outset a key sentence from the Programme for Government:</P>
      <P>The dual task of halting and reversing the growth of unemployment while phasing out the current budget deficit poses a greater challenge than any Irish Government has faced domestically since the early years of the State.</P>
      <P>This sentence highlights in a critical way the twin dimensions of the task facing the Government.  First, there is the dimension of control &mdash; control which is vital if we are to continue to exercise discretion and choice at national level in the management of our economy, and to sustain the social progress already achieved.  We have already exercised that control.  On assuming office we had to take a series of measures designed to begin the long and difficult task of restoring order to the public finances.  We will need to continue to exercise that control in the months and years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="708" /> Second, there is a major need for a creative dimension in national policy that will help to create the large numbers of sustainable and worthwhile jobs that are required by our people in the years ahead.  I emphasise the need for creativity for many reasons.  Not the least of these are the major constraints and limitations on policy that already exists, arising from the recession and from the burden of accumulated debt both domestic and foreign.</P>
    <P>We cannot pretend that there are instant solutions or bogus remedies.</P>
    <P>Before elaborating on these themes, I would like to emphasise the impact of the recent recession and the problems it poses for us.  In general, in the post-war period until 1973 the Western World experienced strong growth with minor cyclical movements.  Ireland shared in that experience from the late fifties onwards.  However, from 1973 we have had two major recessions with one major recovery in the 1976 to 1979 period, with the most recent recession now turning into a gradual recovery.</P>
    <P>The Irish people chose by Referendum in 1972 to participate fully in the international trading economy.  Our performance is therefore linked to it, and there can be no long-term answer by OECD countries seeking to be more competitive with one another by currency realignments or other means.  The OECD themselves clearly recognise that there is no long-lasting solution possible without a great degree of international co-operation. In their July 1983 report, they make the point that, in the absence of a coordinated approach, there is the risk of the emergence of policies whose effects are quite different from those intended by the policy makers.</P>
    <P>As an open trading economy Ireland has been subject to the recession and stagnation of recent years.  This can most clearly be shown by putting before you the increases in total unemployment and in unemployment amongst those aged 25 or less that have taken place in certain Community countries between October 1979 and June 1983.  These were in terms of percentage increases:</P>

    <P>These rates of increase show that many European economies, however strong they might have been regarded, were not in a position to insulate themselves from the impact of the international recession.</P>
    <P>The recent OECD &ldquo;Employment Outlook&rdquo; put the international argument well in commenting that:</P>
    <P>The general magnitude of the task of dealing with unemployment can be illustrated by the following simple calculation. 20,000 extra jobs will be required every day during the last five years of this decade if OECD unemployment is to be cut to its 1979 level.</P>
    <P>It continues:</P>
    <P>Sustained economic recovery is obviously vital to reversing these trends.  There are clear signs that the long-awaited recovery is now under way, but it does not seem likely to make inroads into unemployment for some time and even when it does, a sizeable unemployment problem will remain, particularly in Europe.</P>
    <P>I have referred to these aspects of the international environment to show a general context for policy consideration.  I now return to the two themes mentioned at the outset in relation to domestic policy namely, the continuing need for a control dimension and at the same time the need for an approach in the years ahead whereby the creative talents and organisational capacities of our people can be harnessed to the national task of sustainable job creation.</P>
    <P>It is clear to everyone that we could not continue, in the management of our economic affairs, along the lines followed generally in recent years.  For example, at the end of 1982, foreign debt was £5,200 million; in 1971 it was £90 million. <Col N="710" /> The interest charges which represent a real transfer of resources outside the country were £5 million in 1971, and £516 million in 1982, excluding interest on the debt of semi-State companies.</P>
    <P>It is essential for the moment to continue with the policy of borrowing abroad but the rate of increase of such borrowing has been slowed down and the rate of increase of new additional foreign borrowing, as distinct from refinancing, has got to be slowed down further, in the years immediately ahead.  This has nothing to do with any economic theory.  It is a realistic judgment on balance to ensure for the Irish people the maximum degree of choice and discretion in economic and social policy.</P>
    <P>This year, for the first time for many years the broad overall budgetary targets will be reached.  This does not mean that we are seeking to &ldquo;balance the books&rdquo; for their own sake.  It is necessary to get the public finances under control so that our credit rating can be sustained and limited flexibility created for the years ahead.  The Programme for Government (December, 1982) stated:</P>
    <P>The phasing of the elimination of the current budget deficit between now and 1987 will have to be undertaken with due regard to prevailing economic conditions, and in particular to the importance of achieving economic growth and dealing with unemployment.</P>
    <P>This does not mean that the current budget deficit must be phased out equally over a five-year period, nor does it imply that other magnitudes such as the size of the Public Capital Programme or the level of the Exchequer and public sector borrowing requirements are not important. It means that we as a Government have to be serious, not cavalier, about certain financial targets because otherwise the level of correction that would ultimately be required would be such as to damage all prospects for growth, decimate the social services and threaten the democratic cohesion of the nation.</P>
    <P>After an improvement in 1982, the balance of payments is improving sharply <Col N="711" /> again this year to a level around 2 or 3 per cent of GNP, compared with about 14 per cent in 1981.  Some of this is related to favourable price movements in oil products, to a fall off in import volumes due to the recession, but also is directly related to an exceptionally strong performance in manufactured exports which this year are expected to increase by 12 per cent in volume terms.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there had to be a major adjustment by comparison with 1981 when we were overspending abroad to the extent of one-seventh of our national output.  The balance of payments situation is crucially important because it means that when we get back to the growth required to reduce unemployment, the balance of payments should not re-emerge as a major constraint on Government action.</P>
    <P>I should like also to underline the sharp decline in the rate of price increase which started in mid-1982, and which has reflected the general decline internationally, the strength of the £IR during the winter period, and the more moderate wage movements in recent times. There are now very good grounds for believing that with a constructive response from everybody &mdash; and I accept that this has to include Government action in the indirect tax area &mdash; we will move in the future back towards the type of single figure price increases experienced in the sixties.  A reduction in inflation will help to make us more competitive, and will make more real for pensioners, unemployed people and other social welfare recipients the impact of the 10 per cent and 12 per cent increases last June, and the additional 5 per cent payable to the long-term unemployed since early this month.</P>
    <P>As we all know, improvements in various indicators have been occurring at a time of little or no growth in the economy when major job losses continue to occur with the numbers unemployed rising sharply.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the options for dealing with these problems in the immediate budgetry context for 1984 are limited by the constraints arising from the policy <Col N="712" /> choices of previous years.  In this context, the level of current expenditure and its targeting, the level and distribution of taxation and the level and composition of the Public Capital Programme have to be seen in the context of both what is feasible and prudent to borrow, both at home and abroad next year.</P>
    <P>The House will have many opportunities to debate these matters in the months ahead.  I wish at this stage to make some general remarks.</P>
    <P>The facts dictate that we must have a careful and planned approach to public expenditure.  By far the greater part of public expenditure in practice is committed in advance in any given year; for example, the payment of interest to service existing debt, expenditure on essential services and on necessary transfers for social welfare and other areas.  I do not hold the view that a high level of public expenditure is of itself socially or economically undesirable: public expenditure is vital to secure certain key economic, social and redistributive objectives and will remain so.  What must be an issue is the efficient management of existing public spending programmes, the elimination of waste, and the phasing down of programmes that serve no necessary economic or social objective.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to distinguish between the legitimate views of interest groups of all types in public expenditure programmes, including both those providing and receiving the various services and the overall resource cost and economic and social impact of individual programmes.</P>
    <P>In the area of taxation, the widespread demand for tax equity in the years ahead must be translated into a series of concrete actions including the widening of the taxation base.  It is, however, important to remember that a large proportion of tax revenue will be pre-empted each year to service the national debt, and any prospects of a reduction in overall taxation must take account both of this and of the need to maintain essential public services.</P>
    <P>The same constraints apply to capital expenditure as to the current side.  Selectivity and careful targeting of limited resources by reference to economic, <Col N="713" /> infrastructural and social needs will be of prime concern to the Government.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to the need for a creative dimension in policy approaches to the issues we face.  I think, having outlined the context of these problems, that no Deputy will disagree that only radical and bold initiatives will help us to overcome them.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of debate, I want to encapsulate those problems in two words.  The first of those words is unemployment, the second is equity.  And I want also to start from the point that as far as I am concerned, there are no sacred cows, immune from critical examination, that can be allowed to stand between us and solutions.</P>
    <P>To turn first to the question of unemployment, we are in grave danger of allowing the emergence of an alienated, frustrated and bitter population, young and not so young, for as long as we fail to redress the scourge of unemployment. The economic effects of unemployment are obvious, not only to the individual but to the community as a whole, both in terms of human hardship and an ever-increasing drain on smaller and smaller resources.  We have now a human emergency in this State and we do not have the capital resources available to us to deal with it.  Given that that is the case, how do we begin to approach the solution?</P>
    <P>Firstly, we argue strongly that a medium-term economic plan, prepared on the basis of independent expertise and setting out the options and decisions that are open to us, is vitally necessary.  Such a plan, which will also spell out the benefits of decisions in terms of improved employment prospects, is now in the course of preparation by the National Planning Board, which was established by this Government, and it is expected to be ready for submission to the Government early next year.</P>
    <P>Secondly, since they came into office, this Government have continued with the task of ensuring that each of our industrial sectors is planned in accordance with a long-term strategy in order to realise the full potential of each sector.  We are now well advanced in this work.  Already <Col N="714" /> over two-thirds of industry is the subject of searching analysis by tri-partite committees representative of industry, trade unions and Government.  Already two reports have been completed &mdash; on the clothing and textile industry and on mechanical engineering.  These reports and the others to follow shortly on electronics, beef, marketing, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, plastics, fishing, construction and the dairy industry will be the basis of a series of radical decisions by the Government to accelerate the growth of these industries.  The recommendations being made reflect the considered views of all concerned with the industrial sector in each case and, therefore, will provide a solid base for action. Among the actions that we intend are that the training funds and agencies will be able to contribute more directly and effectively to the needs of progressive and enterprising companies.  We also intend to ensure an infusion of management, marketing and technological skills where that is necessary.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, by examining and encouraging measures to improve the competitiveness of our goods and services.  All of us accept competitiveness as vital, although I regard it as a wider concept than often discribed.  For instance, it does not necessarily follow that low wages will produce efficiency, quality, and predictability of supply, and it is these attributes which in many cases are the key to competitiveness. There are many areas where there is a need to bring a high level of commitment to bear on the realisation of excellence in terms of quality; the marketing and delivery of products; and on essential research and development, both in the area of new products and new methods of production.</P>
    <P>Ways of improving this commitment through greater involvement and participation in real decision-making, need urgent debate, and the relationship between wages and productivity needs greater study before simple conclusions can be drawn.</P>
    <P>I do not intend, in making this point, to deny the truism that in the short-term, and with a given technology, movements in money wages greater than those of our <Col N="715" /> competitors will tend to reduce competitiveness and increase unemployment.  It is also true that there are other factors that affect competitiveness, such as increases in the costs of social insurance, energy, transport and telecommunications, and in many of these areas the Government have a key role to play in controlling costs.</P>
    <P>Fourthly, my party have always believed that there is a strong case for significant State involvement in job creation. The Government will shortly have before them for consideration a draft White Paper on industrial policy, setting out the decisions that need to be taken for a revitalised approach to industrial development.  The National Development Corporation will play a substantial role in that revitalisation, and will contribute to the creation of viable jobs in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>Fifthly, it must be recognised, that we have a special problem here in Ireland. We have the highest growing population in Europe, and we have the highest proportion of young people in our population in Europe.  If that means nothing else, it must be seen to mean that the emphasis of policy must continue to be towards the young, both in terms of training and work experience on the one hand, and the creation of sustainable jobs on the other.  The agencies that we have created and charged with this task have worked well within the limited structures available to them.  Great demands will be placed on those agencies in the years ahead.  To date, for instance, more than 100,000 young people have participated in youth employment and training programmes under funds set aside for this purpose &mdash; 47,000 in 1983 alone.</P>
    <P>Sixth, there are many things which we as a community can do in relation to the problems facing us.  I do not believe there has been adequate public debate about the changes in attitudes that may be necessary, and the sacrifices that must be countenanced, if we are to make inroads in a real way into the despair of many of our young people.  It may be that a great deal of research is necessary into these areas.  For my own part, I believe that <Col N="716" /> they need to be exposed to the light of public view, so that the whole community can exercise a choice.</P>
    <P>What sort of areas am I talking about? Let me list several that I believe would benefit from full and open discussion:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the ending of restrictive practices, including many that may operate in the professions;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the relationship between shorter working hours, increased leisure, and income;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the limiting of overtime;</P>
    <P>&mdash;earlier retirement;</P>
    <P>&mdash;later entry to the work force through increased emphasis on the transition from school to work.</P>
    <P>All of these, and more, are subjects which have something to contribute to the question of employment.  How much they have to contribute is a question that can be answered only by research and debate.  For many reasons including this; I welcome the willingness of the social partners to engage in dialogue with the Government in the coming weeks.</P>
    <P>Seventh, since the adjournment of the Dáil in July, there has been reassuring news on the mineral exploration activity off the Waterford coast.  Pending the emergence of information from further essential tests, it is necessary for us all to be just cautiously optimistic.  The basic framework relating to the development of hydrocarbons has been in place since the mid-seventies, and the Government are determined to ensure that any commercial finds are developed to the maximum national advantage.</P>
    <P>If Ireland were to become a major energy producing economy, there would be greater flexibility in the long run in the management of the national economy.  It would be foolish to assume, however, that the discovery of oil, even in large quantities, would necessarily secure major continuing growth in national wealth or in employment.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the question of equity, particularly in relation to our taxation system.  I have already stated my view, well-known to Members of this House, that real equity in our taxation system can come about only through a <Col N="717" /> broadening of the tax base.  I want to make some general remarks on this subject.</P>
    <P>Before doing so, I would like to remind the House that the 1983 Finance Act contained within it a greater degree of commitment to this principle than any recent such measures.  The numerous provisions of that Act aimed at stamping out evasion, together with the introduction of the income-related residential property tax, were clear evidence of the Government's determination to move as fast as possible to a situation where people could be content that the level of tax they were paying, if high, was no more than on par with what was expected from everyone else in proportion to their means.  There remains a great deal of work to be done in this area.  Over the next few years we will have to move to ensure that wealth is taxed in a visible, measurable and substantial way.</P>
    <P>I recognise that there will be many in this House who will find such discussion unpalatable.  However, there can be no escaping the reality that a disproportionate share of our burdens are now being carried by the PAYE sector and that simple justice demands that the load be shared more evenly.</P>
    <P>I would like, now, to refer to issues relating to the construction industry.  The Government inherited major problems in this important sector at the commencement of 1983.  Employment had dropped by 18,000 and output was down some 18 per cent from the peak years.  Efforts had been made to sustain and increase the level of public spending, but there had been a drastic fall off in private investment which was down some 50 per cent from 1979 levels.  Heading into this year, therefore, the Government were faced with a building industry in steep decline and a crisis in our public finances which severely constrained the Government options relating to the public expenditure component of investment demand.</P>
    <P>The task of Government was to find a balance between the necessity of control in the public finances and supporting a building and construction sector that had become over-dependent on public spending. The level of public investment was <Col N="718" /> planned at the highest sustainable level, but the inherited financial constraint meant that public sector investment could not be undertaken at a level that would offset the substantial fall that has occurred in private investment.</P>
    <P>In so far as major programmes under my Department's control are concerned, output and employment in housing, roads and sanitary services are likely to show an increase in real terms over 1982.</P>
    <P>Housing now represents 42 per cent of the total output of the building industry. As the provision of housing for the community is also an area of prime social concern, it is encouraging to find that the output of the housing sector is holding up well despite the adverse economic environment and the decline in construction output generally.  Completions this year should not be far short of 26,000 &mdash; about 6,000 on the local authority side and the remaining 20,000 or so on the private side.</P>
    <P>The relatively good performance of the house building sector is due in no small measure to the massive scale of Government investment in housing this year. Between capital and current the total provision for Government expenditure on housing is £500 million.  Of this £208 million has been allocated to the local authority house building programme and this provision has allowed local authorities generally to increase activity under their programmes.  As a result the number of dwellings completed by local authorities will show a marginal increase, average employment on the programme will be up 7 per cent to 6,300 and the number of dwellings in progress at the end of August was 8,067, compared to 7,318 at the same time last year.</P>
    <P>The relatively good outturn on the private housing side is due to the availability of mortgage finance and to the level of Government incentives to first-time owner-occupiers.  The building societies are, at the present time, doing very well as the main suppliers of mortgage finance.  It now appears that their loans to house purchasers this year will come to about £375 million &mdash; a very substantial increase on the £292 million lent last year. <Col N="719" /> This sum is complemented by a further £125 million provided in the public capital programme &mdash; £75 million through the local authority loans scheme for persons in the lower income bracket and £50 million through the Housing Finance Agency catering for those on incomes of £10,000 or less.  The sums provided under both of these schemes will be fully utilised. It is particularly gratifying to note that the agency is proving attractive to house purchasers and, by drawing on institutional funds that may not otherwise be invested in housing, is proving to be a real bonus to both the house building industry and to purchasers alike.</P>
    <P>The fact that house building has to a large extent weathered the worst of the current economic recession gives grounds for confidence that an improvement in general economic conditions will be reflected in increased output.  The recent fall in building society mortgage interest rates, which are now at the lowest level for over five years, is another factor contributing to confidence in the future of the housing sector.</P>
    <P>The main improvements required to bring the road system, and especially the national routes, up to a standard adequate to meet our economic, social and environmental needs have been set out in the Road Development Plan for the eighties.  We are now four years into the term of the plan and I have had a major review of it completed in my Department which I am about to submit to Government as an updated framework for road investment throughout the rest of the decade.</P>
    <P>Some £260 million is being spent this year by local authorities on road transportation and safety.  This includes grants of £115.5 million from my Department's Vote for road improvement and maintenance works, an increase of 14 per cent relative to 1982.</P>
    <P>As far as future strategy for the building industry is concerned the Government will have a number of aims:</P>
    <P>firstly, to return the industry to a pattern of sustainable growth underpinned by sound economic policies;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> secondly, to restore stability and to avoid the undue fluctuations that have caused so much damage in the past by prudent use of the public capital programme;</P>
    <P>thirdly, to ensure that investment meets reasonable economic criteria in regard to return and effectiveness;</P>
    <P>fourthly, to devise new means of broadening the scope for private investment in construction and in particular to bring new sources of private funding to the provision of infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I am hopeful in addition that the steps I have taken to streamline the planning process and to remove other unnecessary constraints to development will make their own contributions to the improvement of prospects for the industry.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, then, it is clearly the Government's job to accept the primary role in leading the nation to recovery. This is not to say that unemployment can be reduced or reversed on a continuing basis by Government action alone. National co-operation and understanding for the measures that we are and will be taking will over time reverse the trend in unemployment.  Dialogue and communication with the social partners will be a critical part of this process.  To succeed in the major task ahead will require an entrepreneurial and organisational capacity far in excess of what we have shown in the past in the public, private and co-operative sectors.</P>
    <P>If we want increased living standards and are seriously striving for the goal of increased employment, we must honestly accept the disciplines and risks involved. I believe that as a nation we can rise to the challenge.</P>

      <P>As the collapse of the economy continues and unemployment rises to unprecedented levels it is becoming increasingly clear that the policies being followed by the Coalition Government are the wrong policies: They are turning the country into an economic wasteland and they are doing this without achieving even the objectives they are <Col N="721" /> supposed to achieve.  Practically every indicator points downward.  Crushing taxation, factory closures, rising unemployment, collapse of investment, falling consumer spending, devaluation, high interest rates, a sour industrial relations climate all demonstrate the failure of the Government in their management of the economy.  The fall in the balance of payments deficit would be welcome if it could be attributed to an improvement in the economy.  Unfortunately, it is the reverse and mainly reflects the decline in the general level of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is instructive to examine the Government's economic and social policies from the point of view of their own stated objectives.  Government Ministers and spokesmen have pontificated about these at great length.  We are told that the main requirement of policy at present is what is euphemistically referred to as restoration of the public finances and adherence to the principles of financial rectitude. These are translated into the specific objectives of reducing the current budget deficit, reducing exchequer borrowing and in particular foreign borrowing, lowering the rate of inflation and making the economy more competitive.  Everything must be subservient to these objectives, and in pursuance of them this Coalition Government have imposed widespread hardship on the Irish people, particularly in the form of crushing taxation and rising unemployment.  These burdens have caused direct and substantial hardship and deprivation throughout the community, and the tragedy is that they have been inflicted in vain because there is nothing to show as a result.  They are not succeeding in doing what they set out to do.  The current budget deficit is not being reduced.  In fact, it will not be much different in 1983 from what it was in 1982. The level of exchequer borrowing is not being reduced.  Inflation is not falling.  It is almost certain also that there has been a deterioration in national competitiveness rather than an improvement.  The overall depressing outcome is that none of the things that the economic policies of the Government were supposed to achieve is in fact being met, while the ruthless attempt to achieve them has <Col N="722" /> depressed the economy to the lowest level for decades.</P>
    <P>The general economic indicators add up to a very depressing picture.  The building of houses and homes is one of our most important economic and social activities because of the need to rehouse large numbers of families and the employment the construction industry provide.  But housing completions, according to the latest Department figures, will be 25,000 at most this year, compared with nearly 27,000 last year. Housing starts this year will be down to 15,000, which represents a drastic reduction. Unemployment in the construction industry is 73,000, down 32,000 on the level of 105,000 when we left office in June 1981.</P>
    <P>There has been a general slump in consumer demand, with a fall in the volume of retail sales of 6 per cent in the second quarter compared with 1982.  Motor registrations from January to August are down by 8,500.  Investment will fall by almost 11 per cent in 1983.  The imports of capital goods, which was fairly positive in 1982, is down by 5 per cent in the first half of 1983, compared with a growth of 1 per cent in 1982.  That fall in our investment rate is probably the most detrimental factor in the whole picture because for many years, no matter how bad our overall economic position was, we could always point to the highest rate of investment in Europe.  That picture has now suddenly, dramatically and drastically changed.</P>
    <P>Growth in GDP will be down to ¾ per cent compared with 1¾ per cent last year. Growth measured in terms of GNP will be zero.  Inflation is actually rising, not falling, according to the Central Bank's latest report, largely due to devaluation. The bank states:</P>
    <P>The year-on-year increase in the CPI, which was 10 per cent at mid-August, is expected to rise to over 11 per cent by mid-November.</P>
    <P>Last year we reduced the rate of inflation dramatically from the Coalition peak of 23.3 per cent in mid-November 1981 to 12.3 per cent in mid-November 1982. Now we are told by the Central Bank <Col N="723" /> that this Government will have succeeded in reducing inflation from 12.3 per cent in mid-November 1982 to 11 point something in mid-November 1983.</P>
    <P>The one positive feature on the horizon is the continued growth of industrial production and of exports, particularly in the new high technology sector.  But these new industries were brought to Ireland by Fianna Fáil between 1977 and 1982. Between 1977 and 1980 we increased the number of people at work by 80,000 and created a wave of industrialisation which will stand this country in good stead for many years to come.</P>
    <P>Coalitions invariably create unemployment. When we left office last year unemployment stood at 169,000 or, seasonally adjusted, at 171,000.  Today, with the autumn and winter months still ahead of us, unemployment stands at 193,200 or, seasonally adjusted, at 197,600.  The Government maintain that the increase in unemployment is slowing down.  The figures do not bear that out.  Between September 1981 and September 1982 seasonally adjusted employment rose by just under 33,000.  Between September 1982 and September 1983 unemployment seasonally adjusted rose by exactly 33,000. The unpalatable fact is that the rate of increase in unemployment is not slowing down, as the Government suggest, but that it is rising steadily.</P>
    <P>It is an open secret that the Government are now deeply divided on general economic policy, on the phasing out of the budget deficit, on levels of expenditure and on capital taxation.  There is now no longer any attempt to present a united front.  The Tánaiste and leader of the Labour Party is no longer taking issue with the Minister for Finance.  He has taken issue with the Taoiseach himself and demanded that, from the Taoiseach down, Ministers must not speak in public about fiscal policy and budget matters. What type of leadership can we get from muzzled Ministers at a time of national economic crisis?  Because the Government cannot agree on the basis of economic policy, each month's rising unemployment statistics are accompanied by <Col N="724" /> nothing more than banal cliches about competitiveness.</P>
    <P>I have recently called on the Taoiseach to stop distorting our recent economic history.  I want to do so again in this debate.  It may be a convenient political alibi to blame someone else for the present disastrous state of the economy and to attribute the failure of his own economic policies to historical causes.  It may be politically expedient for him to do this, but it certainly will not contribute to solving the problems of today or to alleviating the hardship that exists.  In fact, by giving a distorted picture of our recent economic history and putting forward a false analysis of the root causes of our present problems, he can only make the solution to those problems all the more difficult.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has made this distortion of our recent financial history, this lie, the central plank of his present political platform, and the excuse for the failure of his own policy.  He has given his distorted version so frequently that there is now a danger of its being accepted as valid.  At the Fine Gael Ard Fheis on last Saturday night, the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>You all know the heritage of overspending and debt that we found facing us when we came into Government. One sentence will suffice to describe the situation then facing us.  Next year alone, we shall have to pay £900 million, that is an average of £1,000 per family, to bankers outside this country in interest on and repayments of foreign borrowings incurred to finance increases in spending over the 1977 level in the years from 1977-1982.</P>
    <P>There you have it.  The big lie.  The great distortion.  A dishonest attempt to suggest&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Sizeable current budget deficits and major recourse to foreign borrowing first became a feature of our public finances here during the period of the 1973-77 Coalition Government in which Deputy FitzGerald, the present Taoiseach, was a major and influential figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, the general impression at the time was that he was the economic guru of that Government. When Fianna Fáil left office in 1972 the current budget was £3.8 million, or 0.1 per cent of GNP &mdash; in other words, it was negligible.  The economic and fiscal policy of that 1973-77 Coalition Government was to stimulate an economy which already had a growth rate of 5 per cent. Mr. Richie Ryan, the then Coalition Minister for Finance, maintained, presumably with the full agreement of his colleagues including Deputy Dr. FitzGerald, that:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> A higher rate of growth could be achieved without causing serious difficulties.</P>
    <P>He went on to boast that he had brought in the largest budget in the history of the State.  By 1975 exchequer borrowing had been increased to 16.5 per cent of GNP and the budget deficit outturn in that year was more than double the original estimate.</P>
    <P>For the period 1973-1977 the foreign debt of this country increased eight-fold &mdash; from £126 million to £1,040 million.  In 1974, Minister for Finance, Mr. Richie Ryan, said in his budget speech:</P>
    <P>This is the second year in which I have used fiscal policy to stimulate the economy by presenting a deficit budget.  This policy has involved increasing public expenditure at an exceptionally rapid rate which, if unchecked, could pose problems for the future.  Taken in consideration with the expansion of the public capital programme, it involves a very large increase in foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>Lest there be any doubt about the clear policy adopted by that Coalition Government, I wish to quote from an address given by Brendan Corish, Tánaiste in that Government, to his Annual Party Conference in November 1975, in which he also praised the support that the Labour members of that Coalition had been getting from all their Fine Gael colleagues, who included Deputy FitzGerald. That quotation, which is a classic, is:</P>
    <P>We have insisted in Government, and let it be said, have had willing and full support from our Fine Gael partners, that everything possible must be done to support the greatest number of jobs and that those in receipt of social welfare payments must be protected against inflation.</P>
    <P>With that in mind the Government has had recourse to a conscious policy of large budget deficits.  Put very simply, the Government has spent more on social welfare and health, on education and housing, on farming and job creation and on the rest of the Government services than it raised through <Col N="727" /> taxes.  The difference between current expenditure and income has been financed by borrowing.</P>
    <P>When we were in opposition the Labour Party and the entire Labour movement besought the Fianna Fáil Government to follow a policy of budget deficit, principally to stimulate employment, but these entreaties were contemptuously rejected.  And in fact, the last budget of George Colley had a current deficit of only £6 million.  It is estimated that this year we will have a budget deficit of £180 million.</P>
    <P>So when we are asked what is Labour doing about the crisis, what is the Government doing, I reply, that is what we are doing.  We have swept aside the restrictions of conservative economic policies so beloved of Fianna Fáil, and have replaced them with the most progressive economic policies ever pursued by an Irish Government ...If I might put it more dramatically, the Government is borrowing more money this year than the entire revenue raised by VAT.</P>
    <P>And lest there be any doubt as to whether this enthusiasm for borrowing and budget deficits was fully shared by Fine Gael, let me quote from the last budget speech of Mr. Richie Ryan in 1977.  He said &mdash; and I quote:</P>
    <P>In 1974 and 1975 successive injections of public expenditure had been necessary to stimulate economic activity and support living standards and employment at a time when little could be expected from the private sector.  It is undeniable that the heavy borrowing to finance growing current deficits as well as capital spending was the correct economic response to the economic situation then facing us.</P>
    <P>Let there be no more distorting of history. Massive Government spending, financed by borrowing, began under the 1973-77 Coalition Government of which the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, was an influential member.  An important part of today's public debt is the result of the massive borrowing undertaken <Col N="728" /> between 1973-77 and an equally important part of the interest payable in 1984 to which Deputy FitzGerald refers, also applies to that borrowing.  The build-up of Government expenditure and Exchequer borrowing began under the first Coalition Government in 1973-77 and large current budget deficits have been a feature of economic and financial policy in this country since then.  Whatever about subsequent years in the period 1973-77, the formula of running large current budget deficits and engaging in massive Exchequer borrowing was not accidental or something that was arbitrarily imposed by circumstances on the Government.  It was, as the quotations I have given clearly demonstrate, deliberate Government policy, enthusiastically embarked upon, by a Government in which the present Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, occupied a dominant position.</P>
    <P>I would like now to direct the attention of the House and the general public to the situation in regard to foreign borrowing and foreign indebtedness.  Again, the facts of what has happened are totally at variance with the impression which the Taoiseach and Coalition spokesmen are endeavouring to convey.</P>
    <P>We are indebted to Eddie Collins, TD, Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy, for a rather intriguing speech which he made recently in London when he disclosed that our foreign debt would amount to approximately $8 billion at the end of 1983. When we translate this into Irish pounds at current exchange rates that is, $1.19 to the Irish pound, our foreign debt at the end of 1983 will be £6.723 billion.</P>
    <P>Now, according to the Central Bank, our total foreign debt at the end of 1982 was £5.29 billion.  Accordingly, our outstanding foreign debt will have increased by £1.433 million during 1983 under this Coalition Government.  The corresponding increase in foreign debt in 1982, under Fianna Fáil, was £1.497 million. The real picture therefore, is that our foreign indebtedness rose by almost exactly the same amount in 1983 as it did in 1982.  It may, depending on the fluctuations in the dollar rate of exchange, <Col N="729" /> be £60 million less, but it may not even be that.  Hardly a picture of &ldquo;remarkable progress&rdquo; which is the phrase used by the Taoiseach last weekend.  The reality is, and the Taoiseach and the Government must face it, that despite the massive deflation imposed by their budget this year, the reduction in living standards and the rapid rise in unemployment it has caused, foreign indebtedness went up this year by almost the same amount as it did in the previous year.</P>
    <P>The picture in regard to the budget deficit is very much the same.  It now appears that this year's current budget deficit, because of the general slump in economic activity, will be in the order of £950 million, a level not significantly different from the year before.  This outcome again indicates the failure of the Government's economic and financial strategy.  That strategy involved the phasing out of the current budget deficit by 1987.  The reduction in the deficit from £988 million to £950 million in the first year does not represent a very impressive start.  In fact, it can hardly be regarded as a start at all.  We have recently been informed that the target for 1984 is £855 million, in other words, a mere £39 million below this year's original budget target. The reality again is, in regard to the current budget deficit, that no real progress was made in 1983 and nothing of any great significance can be expected in 1984.</P>
    <P>It is now valid to ask if the Government any longer have any real intention of phasing out the current budget deficit by 1987.  The Labour Party never really believed in that aim anyway.  The target of £855 million for next year must be taken as a clear indication that the 1987 target will not be achieved.  It now appears that it is the massive deflation of the economy, brought about by this year's budget and the consequent rise in unemployment and fall in consumer spending, that is making the prospect of phasing out the current budget deficit by 1987 very unreal.</P>
    <P>If this massive dose of deflation inflicted on the economy has put the elimination of the current budget deficit out of immediate reach, should we not now <Col N="730" /> be looking at the alternative of a prudent and cautious stimulation of economic recovery?</P>
    <P>Neither do the figures substantiate the Government's claim to have established control over Government expenditure.</P>
    <P>This Coalition Government came into office in July 1981 and for the remainder of that year exceeded their own targets of £85 million.  In this year, 1983, latest estimates are that current Government expenditure will be about £80 million &mdash; £90 million above published targets.  In 1982, however, we kept Government current expenditure £50 million below the budget estimates.</P>
    <P>The overall picture, therefore, is that claims by this Government to achieving success in the management of our public finances do not stand up to examination. The claims they are making are a myth. They are not succeeding in reducing current Government expenditure to any significant extent.  They are not making any real progress in the elimination of the current budget deficit, they have achieved nothing in so far as reducing our foreign indebtedness is concerned.  I hope that in this debate, Government speakers will face up to these harsh realities and acknowledge what is the real outcome of their financial and economic policies.  The misleading generalisations about progress and success in achieving policy objectives are not in accordance with the facts which do not sustain these claims.  They are bogus claims and they reflect seriously on the integrity and standing of those who are making them.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of our argument in this debate is that despite the hardship, suffering, deprivation and general depression which the economic and fiscal policies at present being implemented are causing, they are not achieving their objectives in regard to the control of Government expenditure, the reduction of our current budget deficit, the reduction of our foreign indebtedness reducing inflation and that in these key areas they have failed.  On the basis of this assessment, therefore, a review of current policies with a view to their revision has become urgently necessary. There is a very real possibility that the <Col N="731" /> present downward spiral in the economy may continue to feed on itself and that our industrial base will be dangerously eroded to the point where any prospect of ultimate economic recovery will be endangered.</P>
    <P>We are proposing that prudent and cautious stimulation of the economy in selected areas be undertaken.  The blunt instrument approach has clearly failed. Our economy clearly cannot absorb that type of approach because of its small scale and its comparatively underdeveloped state.  Skilful sensitive management should now be brought to bear with the object of generating economic activity in key areas.</P>
    <P>I believe that monetarist policies, which have caused devastation elsewhere, are not acceptable to the majority of our people.  They are alien also to Labour Party philosophy and if the present Labour Party continue to embrace them they are finished as a political force in Irish life.  Let them be under no illusions about their role.  They are not softening the impact of monetarism, they are making possible the implementation of monetarist policies.</P>
    <P>What is needed is a clear vision of the future which will seize new opportunities and which will foster a job-creating environment. At present, there is no support for the productive sectors of the economy.  This year the farm modernisation scheme, the loan subsidy scheme and the four-year plan for agriculture were all suspended.  State support for the development of our marine resources has also been cut back.  The Government have failed to reopen the Clondalkin Paper Mills, which could use our forestry products.  It is a shameful reneging on promises that the Government have refused to proceed with any attempt to re-open Clondalkin.  The Minister for Industry and Energy now apparently wants to close down our peat-fired stations.</P>
    <P>What we now need more than ever is a progressive approach, which while leaving more freedom to the productive sector also actively encourages and promotes it.  There is much that requires to <Col N="732" /> be done in the development of our national resources, our small industries, our amenities and our physical infrastructure. We have the people to carry out the tasks.  We cannot tolerate a situation where unemployment creeps steadily over the 200,000 mark and towards a quarter of a million, while the Government stand by and do nothing.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have recently proposed that the question of selective reductions in taxation in specific areas be examined.  The objective would be to make reductions in certain areas where they would not result in any diminution of the return to the Exchequer while at the same time stimulating employment. One such area which could be looked at is the drink industry.  The figures here are very interesting.  They suggest that the law of diminishing returns has been operating.  Between 1979 and 1983, the excise tax on alcohol increased by 20 per cent in real terms while sales declined by more than 25 per cent.  This suggests that revenue may have been foregone by setting duty levels too high.  At the end of the first week in October with more that three-quarters of the year gone only 71 per cent of this year's target has been raised compared with 74 per cent last year.  To some extent this falling off in revenue may be due to decreased consumption but it can also be traced to other factors including a switch in consumption from taxable to non-taxable areas.  These would include smuggling, the increase of duty-free supplies and some increase in home brewing.</P>
    <P>A reduction in the level of duty could have the effect of bringing these purchases back in to the taxable area of expenditure.  I believe it is perfectly legitimate to argue that a combination of factors would bring about a situation where a reduction of the rates of tax in the drink industry would not result in any loss of revenue, but would, on the other hand, be very beneficial from the point of view of the tourist industry and employment in the drink industry, particularly at the retail end.  As an experiment, I suggest that a reduction of somewhere between 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the excise duty be implemented.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="733" /> I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not confining myself exclusively to the drink industry.  I merely give it as an example which may be typical of what is happening in other areas.  For instance, I would like to see the same sort of examination carried out on the electrical goods industry with a view to a similar type of experiment being undertaken there.</P>
    <P>The Government have concentrated solely on the public finances, and on the doubtful assumption that economic recovery will come of itself once balance in the finances is restored.  The fact, however, is that demand is acutely depressed. Rationalisation and improvements in efficiency and competitiveness will not bring about recovery or stop the rise in unemployment, so long as demand remains depressed.</P>
    <P>The Government know very well what methods can best be employed to increase demand and to create jobs.  The construction industry has been decimated. A further substantial real cut in the public capital programme from £2,135 million in our estimates last November to £1,890 million in the February budget &mdash; the outturn will be even less &mdash; will of course severely depress output and employment in the construction industry.  If the objective in <i>The Way Forward</i> were being followed of increasing the capital programme by 2 per cent in real terms in 1984, we would have a capital budget of £2,366 million or some £460 million above the level that is apparently proposed by the Government next year.  Such expenditure could be used to improve our roads, restore farm investment, carry out our decentralisation programme, prevent factory closures, and permit progress on a host of essential capital projects.  I am not of course saying that, after the way the economy has in fact been mismanaged this year, such a level of capital expenditure would be possible in 1984.  There is no doubt however that the further fall in investment next year will have a seriously depressing effect on jobs and on the level of economic activity.</P>
    <P>I described the speech of the Minister of State at the Department of Industry <Col N="734" /> and Energy, in London recently, as intriguing. The following excerpt from that speech is one of my reasons for that description:</P>
    <P>The Government's foreign currency debt will amount to about eight billion dollars at the end of 1983.  Although this is a relatively high level of foreign debt, its maturity structure is well balanced with no large bunching of repayments in any one year.  Borrowing for the most part has been in medium and long-term loans with very little utilisation of short-term credits ...  While access to foreign capital markets has posed no undue problems for us, we have recently tapped the US prime market and the Swiss, German and UK capital markets.</P>
    <P>Not exactly what the Government have been preaching at home for the last twelve months.  Apparently, you say one thing to the people in the dole queue at home, when you are telling them that there is no capital available for job creation, but you say something totally different when you are mixing with European corporate planners in the Savoy Hotel in London.</P>
    <P>The other thing the Government must consider is to revive demand by increasing the spending power of low income groups, especially pensioners and other long-term social welfare beneficiaries and the lower paid worker.  I would urge the Government also to reconsider their harsh decision to deprive old age pensioners of their double payment at Christmas. Next year the Government must provide some tax relief for the lower paid.  Those on lower incomes in general terms have a greater propensity to consume home-produced goods, and therefore social equity also makes sound economic sense.</P>
    <P>Government economic policy is totally and disastrously misdirected.  This Government seem to confuse the state of the public finances with the state of the economy.  It is, of course, possible to have the public finances in perfect order and the country in a state of deep economic depression.  In fact, it can be argued, the first is very often the logical outcome of <Col N="735" /> the latter.  At present, we have the worst of both worlds.  We have a deep deflation of the economy without any improvement in the public finances.  This Government completely ignore, in formulating their policy, the fact that this country has a major development task facing it.  Our labour force is growing at 1.4 per cent per annum, in addition to a current unemployment figure of nearly 200,000. In Government circles there are many commentators and spokesmen who preach a new doctrine of economic fatalism. Their cynical message is that we must never again speak about full employment and that we shall have to live with high numbers of unemployed in our society.</P>
    <P>I challenge their right to say these things.  They have no special insight into the world of the future.  Neither have I, but I do know that the whole structure of western industrial society is changing rapidly and I believe that, if we take the right decisions and go for the right options, we can fully occupy our relatively small labour force in a new world where the very concept of employment has changed.  It is not correct, for instance, to say that a new electronic and information-technology revolution is coming; it is already here.  In the USA 66 per cent of all workers are employed in services; in the UK, 59 per cent and in Japan, 55 per cent.  What we need is an entirely new approach towards industrial development.  We must go for industries which are based on high technology and capable of high productivity.  The world around us is changing rapidly and fundamentally. The time to fit into these changes is now.  This will involve changes in education, training and research.  It will involve selecting, shrewdly and carefully, the growth areas we are going to go for.  Some of these are already manifesting themselves in the electronic and computer industries, health care, engineering soft-ware and in information-technology service industries.</P>
    <P>Even in the present world recession a great deal is possible for a small country like ours with a highly educated, flexible work force.  But nothing is possible, nothing <Col N="736" /> can be achieved, until we succeed in getting a complete reversal, not alone of Government policy but of Government thinking.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has stated that his policies require &ldquo;steady nerves and strong will&rdquo;.  In fact, all his policies require is a hard heart.  To be able to implement policies that cause ever rising numbers of unemployed, with all the human misery and tragedy that that entails; to look upon great numbers of young people wandering aimlessly through our streets; to see urgently needed health and welfare amenities abandoned or postponed; to see widespread hardship and deprivation needlessly inflicted on one's own community &mdash; these things need only a cold and uncaring outlook.  To deny an old pensioner a little extra at Christmas does not require an iron will, only cold unconcern.</P>
    <P>The policies of this Government are not alone hard-hearted in the extreme but they are failing to achieve even their miserable bookkeeping purposes.  It is time for a change; if not a change of policies, then a change of Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The lack of interest displayed by the Government in this debate here today is extraordinary.  The Fianna Fáil Party have at least scored in showing their interest in the debate by their attendance in this House.  Apparently the Government side have allowed the House to debate the economy but are not interested in listening to what the House has to say and have no intention obviously, whatever we say here, of even examining their policies in order to see if they are going on the right road.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Haughey said, the policies of the Government are not working, no matter what they say.  The objective is to cut back as much as possible, and damage the economy thereby, in order to get money here and there, scrimping and saving, to pay back the national debt; but the national debt is not being paid back and the economy is going down and down.  As it goes down, less new wealth is being created, less is available to pay back the debt, and so there is less and <Col N="737" /> less possibility of paying back the national debt in the future.</P>
    <P>Recently the Government accused Deputy Haughey of making a U-turn on policy.  It is time the Government made a U-turn and had the guts and courage to do so when it is obvious that the whole thrust of their policy is failing.  Next year, as a result of the continuing downturn in the economy&mdash;which they are engineering; it is not accidental but deliberate policy in the whole area of the economy &mdash; the possibility of balancing the budget or repaying the national debt will be less and less.  Therefore, the Government should listen to this debate on the economy today and should seriously consider a U-turn on this issue, because it is obvious that the more production is increased, the more new wealth is created, the greater will be the possibility of paying off the debt in the future.  If they will stop considering the vital necessity of paying off debts and instead would consider the vital necessity of building the economy, of injecting more enterprise by both State and individuals into wealth creation&mdash;which can be done in so many ways&mdash;the possibility of repaying the national debt would be far greater in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no planning.  There is no government plan before us on agriculture or industry.  The Government should consider when the problems started in this country.  They did not start with the recession and they will not end with the recession.  Our problems are much more deep-seated than that.  Our problems are that industrially we have been relying on an IDA strategy, but with the best will in the world the IDA can no longer succeed in &ldquo;producing the goods&rdquo; they produced over the past decades.  Now we have so many competitors in developing countries all over the world who can give far better incentives, lower wages and so on for the type of assembly line low-wage industry which the IDA to a great extent were depending on and which is not available to them any more.  The whole IDA strategy was very successful in bringing new industry in when our own industrial base was collapsing, with all the closures in the shoe and leather industries and the <Col N="738" /> textile trade which were not noticed too much because so many new industries were coming in and new jobs were being created.  Nobody worried too much about the closures then, but now we can see that the continued closures are a greater and greater threat because they are not being replaced by anything.  What is the Government's industrial strategy?  They have no industrial strategy whatsoever. They have no alternative to the old IDA strategy, which cannot now succeed as it did before.  To blame the recession for everything is very bad policy on the Government's part.  When the recession ends in Britain and in America it will be found that the lack of any policy here will ensure that the recession does not end here.</P>
    <P>Another factor which the Government should consider is that they have been dependent on the EEC for their agricultural policy and have no strategy or plan for agriculture other than what the EEC suggests or dictates.  The policies are decided in the EEC, not by the Department of Agriculture or the Minister for Agriculture.  Therefore, we battle away against the collapse of the EEC Common Agricultural Policy, the super levy and so on without any new policy of changing production or attitudes to agriculture or development in that field.  There is nothing new.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Government should listen very seriously to the debate which will take place here and should consider whether they themselves should make a U-turn.  As has been pointed out, full employment obviously has now been accepted by the Government as pie in the sky, impossible.  No other country is looking for full employment.  We should not even consider full employment.  There are major problems in the big industrial countries which have very advanced technology. They realise that they can maintain the same productivity as before in various areas with a lesser work force and will have problems in the unemployment field.  However, that is not our problem. We have the type of problem associated with developing countries, which is lack of industrialisation.  We still have the possibility of full employment in an industrial <Col N="739" /> economy if we develop a new strategy of building our industry on our resources and working towards full employment in that area.</P>
    <P>Even if the Government do not consider full employment, at least they must consider employment of some measure. The construction industry, in particular, is one sector with the highest unemployment &mdash; 50 per cent of its work force are unemployed at the moment.  Government policies have contributed enormously to that situation, in their taxation policies, their VAT and their cut-back policies.  This is true particularly of the cut-backs made by the Department of the Environment on local authorities for roads, harbours and houses.  Everything is cut back to the limit in an area where, almost overnight, thousands of new jobs could be created, at the same time building the infrastructure and houses to supply the needs of the economy.  This would provide employment with very little loss to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that the total real cost &mdash; not just the payments to the unemployed, but the cost of administration of these payments and so on &mdash; to keep a person on social welfare is in the region of £7,000 a year.  If that figure is correct, the cost of our present unemployment would be in the region of £1,350 million annually.  When one thinks of those enormous figures rising, one realises that allocating money from the Exchequer to capital projects which would quickly take people off the unemployment register would be an aid to the Exchequer in many ways and would also increase productivity, enabling the country to pay off its terrible national debt much more quickly.</P>
    <P>The construction industry, an area in which employment can quickly be created, has been in crisis for the whole period of office of this Coalition Government. Despite warnings from unions, the Construction Industry Federation and others that the situation would get worse, no action has been taken.  Far from helping the situation, Government decisions have militated against the industry.  The reduction of the capital programme by <Col N="740" /> £120 million and the increases in VAT on building materials have contributed to this decline in the last eight or nine months.  In addition, the recent planning legislation announced by the Minister for the Environment has failed to tackle the real problem facing the construction industry and has done nothing to speed up the process of planning applications so far.</P>
    <P>This Government promised that there would be 30,000 house completions in 1983.  It is now clear that this figure will not be reached.  All that our most important industry has got from this Government are broken or unfulfilled promises. It is totally unacceptable that the Government should blame the international recession for this sorry state of affairs. The well-being of the construction sector is almost totally influenced by domestic factors, particularly Government monetary and fiscal policies.  This Government, in particular, have shown a total lack of foresight and planning and have failed to streamline the various agencies involved in the construction industry.  It is a scandal at a time when so many are in urgent need of housing that unemployment in the building industry should be approaching 50 per cent.  There are at present 36,000 families on the local authorities waiting list, which represents more than three families waiting for every local authority house to be built annually.  There are 15,000 families living in unfit or overcrowded conditions throughout the whole State.  Despite this, the number of local authority houses being built this year is falling and for next year the projected numbers are fewer still.</P>
    <P>The figures published recently by An Córas Tráchtála indicate that our export sector is doing well.  There is a need for the Government to see that profits made in this area are used for job creation.  The country is crying out for houses, hospitals, roads and so forth and while exports are of vital importance there is a need for the Government to ensure that the domestic wealth-generating potential of the country is also developed.</P>
    <P>Until 1979 the number in the employed work force was increasing and so was the <Col N="741" /> level of investment.  Since that year investment has fallen.  In 1982 it came down with a very severe bump by 45.3 per cent in volume.  Certainly we would not have had native investment in the Celtic Sea oil, for instance, if Atlantic Resources were left to their own devices. In their efforts to raise money they had to be underwritten by the State in the form of the Industrial Credit Corporation. Private investment is just not capable of developing our economy.</P>
    <P>The numbers of unemployed between the ages of 45 and 54 amounted to almost 30,000.  These are experienced workers who in a normal society would expect many more years of earnings but they are being told that they are on the scrap heap. In the 34 to 44 age group &mdash; these are mature, experienced workers and people with various family commitments &mdash; there are well over 35,000 unemployed at present.  The highest number &mdash; over 50,000 &mdash; are in the 25 to 34 age group. This is the most active productive age group who obviously have a big contribution to make to our national output. Not only are they unemployed but, apparently, they are without hope of employment in the future.  That is not to mention the 60,000 in the under 25 age group many of whom have never got jobs.</P>
    <P>It is foolish to talk about our national debt while Government policies are robbing people of their self-respect by refusing to allow them to work and forcing them to live a life of poverty at great expense to the Exchequer.  It is Government policy to spend borrowed money to pay people to be idle.  That is precisely what they are doing.  The Government have recently proposed to make £500 million cuts.  These cuts will put even more building workers on the dole. About 70 per cent of the money spent on the building industry comes from the State.</P>
    <P>Unemployment will also be created in many other industries.  I referred to the need for the development of industries based on our own resources.  The leather industry is a good example.  Unemployment in the leather industry began before <Col N="742" /> this recession started.  It is continuing because we will not reorganise the industry to ensure that raw hides go to Irish tanneries rather than abroad.  In 1981, 31,946 metric tonnes of raw undressed cattle and horse hides were exported to the value of £17 million.  In 1982 the figure was 32,561 metric tonnes of raw hides to the value of £22.294 million.  In addition we exported 32,213 metric tonnes of sheep and lamb skins with wool on them, and a further 11,000 metric tonnes of sheep and lamb skins without wool.</P>
    <P>We had leather imports to the value of £5 million in 1982 and imports of footwear to the value of £55 million.  When we are exporting over 60,000 metric tonnes of horse, cattle, sheep, lamb and calf hides and skins every year and importing over £60 million worth of leather goods, that sort of economics is absolutely crazy.  The Government do not appear to have any policy to ensure that our leather industry is made viable. We should be providing all the leather for our own shoe and leather industry, and we should also be in the export business.</P>
    <P>We raise more live animals per head of the population in this little country with a population of three million people than any other country in Europe and possibly in the world.  The number of animals we raise is of a very high order and the vast majority of our hides and skins are exported.  These are our native raw materials which should be used as the basis for our industrial development. We have no plans for that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>At the same time our land is under-used. This year cattle numbers have come back to the level they were at when we joined the EEC in 1973.  Where is the development?  Where is the great productivity? Where is the expansion in our agriculture?  Some farmers have expanded.  Others just sat and took the money and the handouts, with a handful of cattle roaming on their little patch of land.  Overall our agriculture has not expanded.  Productivity has not expanded.  Our land use has not improved.  We continue to depend almost totally on meat and milk.  That is where <Col N="743" /> the money is in the EEC.  That is drawing to a close.  The pressure is on and the writing is probably on the wall.</P>
    <P>We have our co-ops which are supposed to be co-operating together and trying to help everybody.  They are not supposed to be competing against each other and building up their own little empires.  They are fighting against each other, competing against each other, taking court injunctions against each other, trying to grab farmers here and there to build up their own little empires.  To make money for whom?  They are not co-ops.  They are private enterprise developments ripping off people, ripping off farmers, workers and consumers, putting up prices, putting up the price of milk.  What type of co-operation is that? They see the problems coming and are trying to grab what they can while business is good.  These co-ops have not advanced one whit since we joined the EEC in their productivity and the material they produce.</P>
    <P>They are still in the hard cheese business for which there is a decreasing market. They are not in the soft cheese business for which there is a greatly expanding market.  Does the Minister for Agriculture know that?  Is he concerned about that?  Has he asked any questions about it?  Have we any plans for the use of our milk?  Have we any plans for changing over from milk and meat production to other areas such as vegetable production and processing, and poultry and egg production?</P>
    <P>Last year we imported £10 million of eggs in the shell because our farmers cannot produce eggs.  They have no hens any more.  They produce milk and meat, and that is it.  We also imported £13 million worth of potatoes.  Farmers have their milking parlours and their cattle roaming the fields, and they will not even dig a patch of ground to grow potatoes for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is far more than £13 million. The Deputy's case is better than he knows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have the wrong <Col N="744" /> figure but it is an unbelievable figure.  It is extraordinary that we have not yet got to the stage where we can clean and grade our own vegetables and our own potatoes and present them in a proper manner to our consumers in the supermarket as other countries do.  There is a wide area for expansion and development in agriculture into other areas but our conservative farmers are not being encouraged or given the incentive to develop into them and get away from the well-tried milk and meat areas.  Even in the milk and meat areas, production is not reaching its full potential.  We have only 25 per cent of added value off the farm on our agricultural production.</P>
      <P>We are now at the stage where we may become an oil producing nation.  It is almost certain that at least there is a commercial oil find, with the possibility of further finds off our coast.  The public are entitled to know what the Government's plans are in this area.  They should be well developed beforehand and presented to the people so that we can have a discussion and reach a consensus on how best these resources can be used.  Is this new resource to be wasted in precisely the same way as all our other resources are being wasted, in the same way as our hides and skins are being exported in a raw state with no jobs being created from them?  Year after year 350,000 tonnes of raw ore, lead and zinc are pouring out with no jobs being created, no new industry being created.</P>
      <P>We have no smelter which could use considerable amounts of electricity and at the same time provide the raw materials for industry whether it be in the production of cars, washing machines, cookers and various things like that.  Our lead and zinc were wasted; they poured out of the country.  This is still happening and holes are being left in the ground.  Is it the Government's intention to allow this new oil well to be piped direct to Milford Haven?</P>

      <P>Neither would I.  Even though this discovery was made beside Cork, the general thrust and development of the Government seems to be that the most commercial way to use this oil find would be to pipe it direct to Milford Haven.  Seemingly the Government have accepted that.  That would be an absolute disaster for our oil industry but it would also be a disaster for this Government if they allowed that to happen.  Our oil refining capacity must be developed. Whitegate, which the Government reluctantly conceded to after a fight by the workers and when they realised there were votes in it, provides approximately half our needs.  With the new oil find the Government should tell us their policy in regard to refining capacity.  Do they think Whitegate is becoming obsolete?  Are there plans for any new development of oil refineries, or do they intend that all our refined oil should come from Milford Haven into Dublin port?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a great deal of agitation about building an oil refinery at Dublin port beside the power station at Poolbeg. It was said there would be great dangers from fire, spillage and so on from this 200 million tonnes of crude oil coming into Dublin port, but there was no mention of what was happening across the bay in Clontarf.  There, more than 200 million tonnes of refined oil, petrol, a highly dangerous inflammable material, far more dangerous than crude oil, is, and has been coming into the large tanks for a number of years, and the amount is increasing all the time.  But there is never a mention of that.  That is kept quiet. When the cavern system for liquid petroleum gas under the bay was suggested, that was shot down by the same oil companies which shot down the new refineries. Yet there is no mention of their very big tanks at Clontarf.  Yesterday Deputy O'Malley mentioned ESB and Bord na Móna.  In my view it is time for the Government and the Ministers, not some of the seven sisters, to get together and <Col N="746" /> decide our oil and energy policies and the future of our new oil development.</P>
    <P>If one thinks of the economy and repaying national debts and so on, one must have clear-cut industrial policies that will increase our national wealth, because one must increase wealth before one can repay debts.  Our problem is that for every £90 we earn, we spend £100.  The Government decided that we should cut back to £90 when what we should be doing is increasing our earnings to £100. That is the purpose of development: increase earnings and wealth and then one will be able to pay for one's spending. We should balance our books upwards rather than downwards.</P>
    <P>In any discussion on industrial policy a Government must have a policy on the timber industry.  When the State was founded we did not have any forests.  One of the first moves the State made was to plant and develop forests.  For decade after decade our people paid their taxes to plant forests because they knew they would be good for the country at some time in the future.  They knew they would not get anything out of them in the twenties, thirties, forties or fifties but considered that in the seventies and eighties they would be a great boon to us.  So far we have not done anything with our forests. Only a few weeks ago a very modern factory in Fermoy with up-to-date computerised equipment closed down because they could not get the type of timber they wanted from the Department. Three years ago when this factory was being set up the Department were told exactly what timber was wanted and they said they could produce it.  They did not produce it.  To get timber the factory had to tender under a system which has been used since the twenties.  Under this system a factory or contractor must tender for a forest and take whatever is in it; they must take the good with the bad.  I went down to Fermoy and was shown the truck loads of timber being delivered to the factory, and less than half of the timber was what was wanted.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Fisheries and Forestry should take a serious look at this problem. Those in authority do not appear to know what is in our forests.  When cut-backs <Col N="747" /> are needed, where are they made? The number of foresters is reduced but there is no reduction in the administrative staff.  In my view, forestry should be taken out of the Civil Service and established as a semi-State concern, similar to Bord na Móna, or Bord na Móna might be given responsibility for the development of our forests from the planting to selling trees to industry and so on.  If we had an integrated plan for forestry and development, there would be no problem providing timber for the Clondalkin Paper Mills and our construction industry. In this way we would save £200 million on imports by the construction industry and approximately another £200 million importing paper which could be produced in the Clondalkin Paper Mills. There is no point talking about viability unless the Minister concerned has a plan which will make industry viable.  No such plan has been brought forward so far as this industry is concerned.</P>
    <P>Over recent months there have been heavy attacks on State companies from private individuals and from Ministers, the people who got these companies into trouble.  This Government imposed a £20 million special levy on the ESB this year. Instead of raising money for the Exchequer by taxation, they do the clever trick of imposing it on the ESB, when the ESB have to pay them £20 million and increase the price of electricity to their consumers. When they do things like this &mdash; increase the price of turf to the ESB, the price of natural gas to the ESB and delay about six months in allowing them to increase their prices &mdash; they then say to the ESB, &ldquo;Oh, you are in financial trouble.  Oh, that is terrible, you had better get yourself out of financial trouble and give us a plan to show how you are going to cut back.&rdquo;  Then, when the ESB produce a plan &mdash; if the Government want cut-backs &mdash; they say, &ldquo;Right, we will cut back on all these power stations if that is what the Government want.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach gets very annoyed and says that there is a political input into this, here is the ESB producing a plan which will damage some of our Ministers in their constituencies.  That is a political <Col N="748" /> input.  For God's sake, no matter what plan the ESB, CIE or anybody else puts forward it will damage somebody.  For instance, if CIE say they will cut the train service to Tralee, that would be politically damaging to the Tánaiste Deputy Spring.  They might well say they would cut the train service to Malahide which would be politically damaging to Deputy Haughey.  But they must effect cuts somewhere if the Government order them to make cuts.  And if they effect cuts somewhere they will damage somebody in his or her constituency.  Then the Taoiseach complains because the ESB produce a plan which will be politically damaging to him.</P>
    <P>This is the greatest nonsense we have heard from any Government.  The Government would really need to have a plan and let us hear clearly whether they are totally against all State companies, all State involvement in productive activities, or what precisely they plan in regard to the ESB if they insist on their effecting cutbacks, or for that matter what plan they have for CIE.  But we do not have any plans.  We have merely <i>ad hoc</i> decisions in order to save money to pay back the international bankers. Without an integrated plan there is no possibility of the international bankers being repaid.  Therefore I ask the Government to take their courage in their hands, take a good look at our economy and then decide to make a complete U-turn.</P>

      <P>I do not inagine that Deputy Mac Giolla will pay me the compliment of waiting to hear my speech, so, while he is gathering up his papers and withdrawing, let me say in his hearing that I could not but agree with a great deal of the sense which I found in his remarks. He knows that I bitterly disagree with the ideology which he occasionally voices, but this morning he kept the ideology on the back burner, as I think the modern, naturally imported, cliché has it, and spoke with what I thought was a great deal of sense in regard to simple matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also heard a good part of the speech of Deputy Haughey who preceded Deputy Mac Giolla.  I should like to take <Col N="749" /> some of the things Deputy Haughey said as my starting point.  In doing so I will probably offend &mdash; and I am sorry to do that &mdash; Deputy Gene Fitzgerald opposite me and his three colleagues.  I am afraid it is unavoidable.  They are stuck with Deputy Haughey as a leader.  They must, therefore, share the hard expressions and allow them to apply in some measure to themselves, which the rest of the world will have to use, as indeed they have been using about him, up to now.</P>
    <P>The message which comes through from the party, at any rate as led by that Deputy&mdash;I do not say it would be like that in every set of conditions&mdash;but the message which comes through from that party, as under its present leadership, is always cheap, superficial and populist; they go for the most irreflective and simplest stratum of the population, and fix up some package for which they will grasp as a child grasps at a lollypop.  That is the secret of having 35 or 40 per cent of the voters with you as a starting point. If, by a combination of seminars, teachins, weekends, favouritism, patronage, back-slapping, perhaps even intimidation, you can add another 10 or 15 per cent to that, you are home with enough people for a government.</P>

I do not single him out because he is a particularly bad case, I single him out because I happen to be friendly enough with him <Col N="750" /> when we meet and he does not, I think and hope, mind me poking fun at him; but I remember that Deputy Leyden once made a budget speech here which from first to last was a mendicant cry on behalf of the people of his constituency.  I rebuked him at the time, since most of my own people come from the West.  I am ashamed to think that when their representatives come in here their tone of voice is always: &ldquo;Wisha, wouldn't you have e'er a halfpenny for this old fellow?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;Wisha, could you not spare sixpence for that one?  Wisha, would you see this poor old woman put in this situation or that young man in the other situation?&rdquo; We have had enough of the soft heart if that is the way it is going to end up at the political level.

Now that we are talking about people being provocative, it is only about three weeks, in the context of the New Ireland Forum's operations, since a little deputation from it went to tour the North of Ireland.  When Deputy Lenihan, much to his credit, and Deputy Andrews, who were part of the deputation, were entering a hotel in Derry they were met by a group of demonstrators representing the Paisleyite interests.  All Deputy Lenihan had to say to them was, &ldquo;How are you, lads&rdquo;, and the placards began to <Col N="751" /> fly.  The Paisleyites said afterwards that they were treated provocatively by the people from the Republic.  They regarded that as provocation.  They have got awfully thin skins in the Paisleyite party. They cannot even take, &ldquo;How are you, lads?&rdquo; from Deputy Lenihan without feeling provoked.  I admit that I have been a little bit more severe than that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I want to say this about the &ldquo;hard heart&rdquo; allegation.  Deputy Haughey himself has the name of being soft-hearted. To be fair to him, I have no reason to think that, on a personal level, he is hard hearted or unfeeling.  I have heard from his friends and foes alike that he is a man to whom one can go with a hard case. That is a human quality for which no one wants to take credit from him.  But, when he is operating on the public level, when he is saying things, whether in Government or Opposition, which are intended to affect the course of the Government's steering of the economy, expressions like &ldquo;hard heart&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft heart&rdquo; are out of place.</P>

      <P>When listening to Deputy Haughey it is quite hard to be sure whether he is in his inflationist, deflationist or reflationist phase, because his revolutions, according to whether he is in or out of power, according as he perceives some necessity relating to his own career, change so rapidly that you could be just about focussing on Deputy Haughey's <Col N="753" /> reflation stage when you notice that that is all off, that was last month, and we are now on to a different facet of his philosophy.  Then it was something more responsible, more stringent.  This time he has decided that it is the moment for &ldquo;modest reflation&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The talk which we thought we had put an end to at the time of the election in 1982 about &ldquo;self-financing subsidies&rdquo; is on the deck again.  This time he has not got Deputy Reynolds to float it for him &mdash; we wish him a speedy recovery &mdash; but Deputy Haughey is himself floating the &ldquo;self-financing subsidies&rdquo;, the &ldquo;self-remunerating tax cuts&rdquo;.  I wish Deputy Haughey would let the ball out to the financial wizards of the rest of the world who have not been able to think up simultaneously satisfactory self-financing tax cuts and self-remunerating systems of borrowing.  Let us not be selfish about this.  We are always boasting about our spiritual empire, bringing the higher light to the barbarians in the outer undiscovered parts of the world.  Let us let out the secret of the self-financing tax cuts to them, the self-supporting borrowings and subsidies.  Let us not be greedy about it. Many things could be said about the Irish, but we are not an ungenerous people. We are not dogs in the manger.  Therefore, let us hear about how to establish and run a self-financing tax cut or conduct self-remunerating borrowing.</P>
      <P>Naturally, none of them is home grown, because the party of the rear guard do not believe in anything homegrown. Mr. de Valera is gone.  They sniggered about him behind his back when he was there, and they can laugh freely about him now, whatever they may say in public.  His slightly homespun variety of economics is, of course, forgotten, as is that of Seán Lemass.  Instead of using words coined by either gentleman, they import their vocabulary of political abuse.  According to them, the people on this side are &ldquo;monetarists&rdquo;, &ldquo;Thatcherites&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe there are three people on the Fianna Fáil benches who could give on the back of a postcard a coherent account of what monetarism is.  But it does not matter, because it has a nasty <Col N="754" /> complicated ring about it.  It conjures up professors, well paid, battening on the taxpayers, who will never stand in a dole queue.  It has a nice populist ring about it that can be slung from the top of a barrel or the back of a lorry at an election meeting and the simpler souls, who are probably in their pockets anyhow, will be impressed with it.</P>
    <P>We are being accused of &ldquo;Thatcherism&rdquo;. There was a time when Mrs. Thatcher was top cat with Deputy Haughey.  That was when she started out. She and Deputy Haughey were going to put the North of Ireland to rights.  He suddenly discovered that Mrs. Thatcher was made of the kind of stuff that is not very much in evidence in his party or perhaps even in wider circles.  He began to realise that it would take more than a silver teapot to make her do what every instinct warned her against, namely, to trust him.  And, of course, she became public enemy No. 1 and now she is so low in the stakes that her very name has become an acceptable term of abuse.</P>
    <P>I will tell him something about Mrs. Thatcher &mdash; although, if I were British, I do not think I would ever vote for her party because I regard the English Tories, from occasional glimpses of them on television, as a crew I have not much in common with.  I will say this for Mrs. Thatcher and the single-mindedness with which she has pursued a certain policy, namely, that of reducing inflation: the result of this policy can be seen in this republic.  I will tell you how.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon is behind me; and he will bear me out, and he will be able to speak more eloquently about it than I. Weekend after weekend busload upon busload of our people, with their pockets stuffed with our money, cross the Border to the North and buy goods there, not merely goods that are differentiated against by high excise rates or VAT here but even flitches of bacon, sides of ham, halves of sheep, to bring back here for their deep freezes.  That is what Thatcherism is about in the UK economy.  At a dreadful cost, undoubtedly, in terms of unemployment, she has managed that, because she has succeeded in reducing the prices of goods sold in shops in the <Col N="755" /> UK to a point when it pays the people in Dundalk to desert Deputy McGahon's constituency and travel over the Border. It pays not only them, but it pays people in Deputy Durkan's constituency.  Publicans and shopkeepers in Mayo are wringing their hands at their public representatives and in appeals to a Government who failed to apply that kind of discipline in recent years.</P>
    <P>If we had had that kind of discipline here since 1976 or so, if Richie Ryan, who is nearly approaching national hero status, had been allowed to continue in 1977, if he had not been put out by Dr. Bunsen and his tax-free cars, this situation would have been reversed.</P>

      <P>If we had had a Government here since 1977 &mdash; we have one now which may get back to that situation &mdash; our affairs would not have taken a turn away from the direction begun by Richie Ryan and the Government he worked in, and which I worked for with pride.  It would have meant bus trips over the Border &mdash; but they would have been in the opposite direction, as once upon a time they used to be.  There would have been buses travelling over the Border in this direction, stuffed with people with pocketfuls of money buying in the towns represented by Deputy McGahon.  That is what Thatcherism is, about which we hear in the whinging and whining of people who are deserting those towns because they do not want to spend money in them.  Deputy Haughey should remember that when he talks about monetarism and Thatcherism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no secret about monetarism. I am not an economist, and I could not <Col N="756" /> give a coherent account of monetarism that would satisfy my son, for example, who is in the course of becoming an economist. But basically it means something that everybody does anyway in their own private housekeeping, namely, making sure that the amount of money they spend in a week or the amount of credit they take up does not exceed the amount they take in, or, if it exceeds it in one week, making sure they have a good chance they will be able to cover it within a reasonable time.  I will give it a homegrown name &mdash; it is Lemassian or de Valerian economics.  When I hear people talking about this Government having a &ldquo;hard heart&rdquo;, being &ldquo;obsessed with figures&rdquo; and being anxious to &ldquo;run an economy while not having any time for the people&rdquo;, I have to say &ldquo;show me any difference between that point of view and that which you were proud to support when it was being put into effect by Deputy Lemass and Deputy de Valera 30 and 40 years ago.</P>

      <P>There were hard times in the thirties.  I have often said in this House that I have a regard and a respect for many of the acts of the Fianna Fáil Government of those days, and I do not feel they were all devil-inspired, as some of my colleagues at that time used to think.  They were hard times of poverty and deprivation.  That did not all end in 1932 with the change of Government. The thirties were times of hardship, although I can sympathise with some of the reasons for the Economic War. Deputies opposite are too young to remember anything about it, but they know that they were times of hardship, as were the forties, except for the unusual war conditions which meant that there was a strong market for many Irish products and there was nothing to buy with the money, hence reserves were built up.  There were also hard times during the fifties, but whether a Fianna Fáil Government were in office or an inter-Party Government, no Taoiseach or Minister for Finance went in for the &ldquo;soft heart&rdquo;.  They would have thought it <Col N="757" /> beneath them and despised that talk.  Of course, they themselves had soft hearts; and I am certain that Deputy de Valera and Deputy Costello and their Ministers felt grieved at the condition of ordinary people.  But they were not contemptible enough to accuse one another of having &ldquo;hard hearts&rdquo; because they did not borrow recklessly in order to alleviate conditions temporarily.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey of all people is the most discredited when it comes to economic management.  He has given a whole new meaning to the word &ldquo;discredited&rdquo;.

      <P>In the years after 1977 almost every economic indicator, except for those temporarily influenced by simply throwing money at the economy, went downhill.  Deputy Haughey made great play this morning of the dreadful unemployment figures which are likely to get worse before they get better.  The events of 1977 are receding in history, and I can see at least one Deputy in the House who will not remember as an adult what was happening then.  In that year we were promised by Deputy O'Donoghue, who at that time belonged to the despised tribe of academics, that we were going to break out of encirclement. He compared us to a party of settlers crossing some unsettled, uninhabited and dangerous part of the mid-West surrounded by a moving circle of whooping Indians.  Were we to stay there crouched behind the wheels of the wagons and the powder barrels trying to pick off the occasional Indian and being <Col N="758" /> gradually worn down ourselves, or were we to try to break out?  His solution was that we were to break out.  By that time the economy had already very largely broken out of the mid-seventies recession, and every important indicator was tending upwards, as he had the courage subsequently to admit.  It came rather curiously from a man who was saying the exact opposite in 1977.</P>
      <P>When the Fianna Fáil Government took office the unemployment figure was about 116,000 &mdash; far higher than ought to have been acceptable and recognised as something of a national disaster.  At the end of 1981, when Deputy Haughey left office, the figure was 160,000.  I should like to know from the geniuses who advise him how he was able to say in his speech that his party in those years created 80,000 jobs when the crude unemployment register shows that there were 45,000 more people out of work at the end of that era.</P>
      <P>It is easy to create jobs.  Every country can make a job of a sort by printing money.  This point has often been made in this House, not just by the present generation but also by Deputy Lemass. A short-term result can be produced by printing or borrowing money and spending it.  There will be a momentary euphoria; but it will have the effect of creating an import boom, driving up wage demands and reducing competitiveness, leaving the economy worse off in the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although nobody has a secret recipe which will simultaneously reduce inflation and create full employment, we do know that there are sensible things to do. It is sensible not to waste money at election time by promising airports or hospitals and promising all kinds of things to any sort of lobby or pressure group who raise their head.  Naturally, the people want decent services; but we are a country in which a modern, essentially British, governmental structure was superimposed on a population which was impoverished, demoralised, never trained in collective self-reliance, carrying a centuries-old inferiority complex, accustomed to dependency and clientship, tugging at the garment of somebody more <Col N="759" /> important to see if he could do something. That was a disastrous organisational development.</P>
    <P>When we got our own State, instead of working out the way that society should be structured from scratch, we imported holus-bolus a British system, governmental, organisational, financial and so on, fitted and suited to a quite different people.  The result of that, after a couple of generations, is that we have a population which, although they are better dressed, better housed and better fed, have never inwardly outgrown the sense of dependency, the sense of insecurity, the lack of confidence in themselves, the instinct to be a client, to try to receive patronage and help, rather than getting into a position where they do not need it, but rather one in a position to help somebody else.  That has never been eradicated; and we have, on top of that, politicians here &mdash; I am sorry to say my own party are not guiltless but we have more conscience in this regard than the party on the other side of the House &mdash; whose activities have reduced the people to a situation where, as individuals, they want their neighbours to pay for them and, as a nation, they want their grandchildren to pay for them.</P>
    <P>That must be turned around.  I did not hear all Deputy Haughey's speech but I did hear his brassy denunciations of Deputy FitzGerald and his team.  Not one word suggested that he recognised that we have deep problems here that simple, monetary and budgetary management will not solve.  In a sense, Deputy Mac Giolla came near putting his finger on it. I hope he will not mind me paraphrasing what he said.  He asked why should we have enormous unemployment here, when there are so many areas of potential activity which we could get into.  He mentioned a whole lot of things, but I have not time to deal with them now; I essentially agree with his proposition.  I cannot understand why, with so many climatic features in our favour, the cheese, vegetable, fish and timber situations should be as they are.  To do Deputy Mac Giolla justice, he did not say that it was now up to the State to carry out all the tasks in <Col N="760" /> these economic fields which had so far been left undone.  That would be the last kind of solution, because it is shirking yet again the business of trying to get the people to think in terms of each one for himself, each village for itself and each little town or county for itself.  They should try to get the most from the resources which God has given them; and we have not got the structures for that. We have organisations for charity, sport and voluntary service of all kinds but not for this.  This is what we need and there will be no improvement in the situation until we re-organise the whole way of doing things and the balance of responsibility in regard to the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to say a few words about a couple of points in the Tánaiste's speech.  It almost seems as if there were two hands at work in that speech.  Perhaps it is wrong to be making educated guesses about this sort of thing, but the first half of this speech could have been delivered by a Fine Gael Minister.  I could nearly have seen myself, in happier days, delivering the very same speech.  Some of the other parts of the speech were either written in their entirety by someone else if someone else was shown the original draft and asked to go through it and put in what was needed.</P>
    <P>Much as I admire the Tánaiste as a person, since I have taken the position I have on coalition, I hope he will recognise my right to comment on his speech. I had got half way through and I was beginning to think it was possible that we could get through a speech on the economy read by the Tánaiste with no reference to the National Development Corporation.  Had that been buried for good?  Had that spook been laid to rest in Schoolhouse Lane forever?  Unfortunately, as I turned over to page 12, he said that &ldquo;his Party&rdquo;&mdash; although I thought he was speaking for the Government, and this is why I think some person in a rookery in the Labour Party headquarters was given a free hand with the Tippex &mdash;&ldquo;have always believed that there is a strong case for significant State involvement in job creation&rdquo;.  Later on he said that &ldquo;the National Development <Col N="761" /> Corporation will play a substantial role in that revitalisation and will contribute to the creation of viable jobs in the years ahead,&rdquo; At the risk of becoming tedious, I should like to ask the Tánaiste, and anyone else who thinks that the National Development Corporation is a good idea, the question which I have asked dozens of times before in this House and outside it, though always in vain &mdash; what will the National Development Corporation do? It sounds very well.  It is a nice little phrase to throw around and draw applause from people who believe in you for other reasons.  But what economic function is it going to concentrate on?  Is it some of the things that Deputy Mac Giolla was talking about?  They, undoubtedly, are in need of development; but will a top-heavy State apparatus which will, as I am never tired of saying, concentrate first on equipping themselves with expensive quarters and all the other paraphernalia that no one here seems to be able to operate without, be able to do what private enterprise plus the unions, leather companies, co-ops or farming organisation have failed to do?  What is there in the record of other semi-State enterprises in this, that or the other field to guarantee that that is going to be likely?</P>
    <P>I accept and agree that these are areas in which national development is deadly urgent; but the way to get it is to retrain our people, starting in school, to think industrially &mdash; I am using the word in its broadest sense &mdash; to think economically and throw off this awful over-reaction to the buried inferiority complex which takes the form of boasting about ourselves. People do not really believe the boasts; they utter them to keep down their doubts about themselves.  We should get school-leavers to think not in terms of 12,000 applying for a clerkship but to think, as Deputy Mac Giolla thinks, of a field in which it must be possible to make money and to sell something which people will want and replace things which they are now paying foreigners to grow for them, like the humble potato.  If we could get the 12,000 school leavers that batter on the doors of the Civil Service Commission and the Local <Col N="762" /> Appointments Commission to think in those terms, we would be getting somewhere.</P>
    <P>I would not care then whether it was done under a State aegis or under a private aegis.  I am not an ideologist.  I am happy with either kind of enterprise, provided that it works, and that at the far end a product comes out which somebody will buy for not less than it took to produce. Unfortunately, that is what is missing in Deputy Mac Giolla's ideology, so far as I have been able to grasp it.  It is also missing in the Tánaiste's.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste mentioned in his speech the oil hopes we now have, and he very wisely and rightly was anxious that no exaggerated hopes should grow up around the oil.  He is absolutely right to speak like that and I applaud him.  However, since he did mention oil, let me say something in defence of the private sector. It was not a semi-State body that found the oil, if there is oil; it was not a semi-State body that took the risk that they were going to throw away hundreds and hundreds of millions of pounds in digging holes at the bottom of the sea and filling they in again.  It was private enterprise. But it will be no time at all, after that oil starts coming ashore, before we will be hearing people giving out about multinationals and millionaires grabbing our national resources.</P>
    <P>I would be perfectly happy if the State had had the competence, the commitment and enough money at its back to be able to afford to take the risk to have done that exploration.  I would not have had any ideological objection to that at all provided it appeared to be an economically justifiable risk.  However, the State did not take that risk, private enterprise did; and now that it is going to pay off, private enterprise will expect to be treated as though it had taken the risk and will feel entitled to the proceeds.</P>
    <P>I hope the State will drive an extremely hard bargain in regard to royalties; but I am anxious to point out, since we have been talking in some context about the competition between private and public enterprise, that were it not for private enterprise and the fact that private enterprise <Col N="763" /> is able to build up reserves of profit &mdash; yes, profit &mdash; which make it possible for them to sink countless hundreds of millions of pounds in an exploration like that, there would not be any oil.  The oil would be there but it would be just as useless to us, because we would be as uninstructed about it, as the fish were in the sea at the time of the Famine.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste made a point about taxation in the course of his contribution. He said that the Government are committed to taxation equity but then went on to make what I would describe as an unfortunate &mdash; I would not say provocative&mdash;reference to residential property tax.  He called it an income-related residential property tax.  I have opposed that property tax since I first heard it mentioned, which was before the meeting held by my party on 12 December last to discuss the Coalition deal.  I thought it a hare-brained idea when I saw it in the Labour Party's manifesto.  I should like to ask members of the Labour Party why has their nerve failed them in this regard; why are they not able to propose a property tax, not just restricted to residences, but to all types of property and levied at a rate which people can afford, a rate which would be modest enough to command consensus, which would be transparent enough to command consensus and reasonable enough to command consensus?</P>
    <P>The residential property tax does not fulfil any of those criteria.  I cannot make any reference, for obvious reasons, to the litigation which is pending about this; but even if the litigation was to go against the plaintiffs and the courts find that there is nothing wrong with the tax from a constitutional point of view, I will still have every objection to it on other grounds.  In my view it does not fit into any scheme of taxation.  It does not conform with any principle of taxation which is familiar to people in a country like ours.  It is not related to one's consumption, like excise duty or VAT; it is not related to one's wealth, because it only concentrates on one form of wealth, and a very deceptive one, and even when it concentrates on that it does not take into account the <Col N="764" /> equity which the resident of the house may have in it.  He may still owe three-quarters of its value.</P>
    <P>The tax is not based on income; or one's notional burden on local services; or on one's ability to pay.  In fact, it is not based on any of the tax criteria or principles which are familiar here.  It is a bad, irrational and arbitrary tax, even though the burden which it will represent for the individual is not heavy.  I have paid my own, and it is much less than I would have had to pay if the rating system was still in force.  So that I am not whingeing or complaining about it; I would pay twice that amount gladly under a reasonable system of property taxation, if I was liable for it.  I was not within an ass's roar of being caught by the old wealth tax but a lot of other people who were not within an ass's roar of it either were whingeing about it.  It was a smart thing to say one was going to be destroyed by the wealth tax.</P>
    <P>A proper, well designed, equitable, evenly spread and modest property tax would command my support.  It would be striking a blow for industrial peace here too, because one of the irritants in industrial relations here is the sense of inequity and grievance which ordinary workers have when they hear well-fed, suedeshod politicians and industrialists exhorting them to accept a rise in wages less than the current inflation rate, while those people, to whom they do not begrudge prosperity, are not contributing anything from their substance to keep the whole operation going.  I sympathise with workers who have to endure that type of lecturing.  I would advocate that everybody ought to accept a modest &mdash; I do not mean crushing, vindictive or accusatory tax &mdash; evenly spread, reasonable and rational tax on property.  I am afraid that in putting it like that I am obviously parting company with the Tánaiste who said &mdash; I believe he was a foolish man to make this statement &mdash; that &ldquo;over the next few years we will have to move to ensure that wealth is taxed in a visible, measurable and substantial way&rdquo;.  The Tánaiste spoke for the Labour Party, and I want to speak for the Fine Gael Party, but I hope I do not see any smiles of delight at this difference <Col N="765" /> of opinion opening up from the gentlemen on the other side.  They are in the boat also and if it sinks they will go down with it.</P>

      <P>Any reference to &ldquo;substantial taxation of wealth&rdquo; is a dangerous phrase to use because it frightens people, even those who do not have substantial wealth.  The Tánaiste has fallen into the same error that the 1973 Coalition Government did.  It was the proudest experience of my life to serve in that Government and I would be very proud if I thought I could serve in another such Government; but the mistake that Government made was in advertising the wealth tax at that time in such a way that it appeared ideologically pointed.  It was called, in a number of parts of the White Paper an effort to &ldquo;re-distribute wealth.&rdquo; That Government were not elected on a wealth re-distribution platform.  They never sought a mandate on such a platform, and would not have been given a mandate on such a platform.  Neither Deputies Spring nor FitzGerald have any such mandate either.  Any talk about substantial taxation of wealth &mdash; while he may not mean it like that &mdash; will be read by people on the other side, and by people outside who may be friendly disposed to the Government in a general way &mdash; as who could fail to be? &mdash; and will pre-dispose them to fear.</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly's contribution has emphasised the contradictions that exist when any issue is discussed here.  It is obvious that our party leader in his excellent contribution this morning hurt Deputy Kelly sorely in pointing out where the borrowing pattern started.  Deputy Kelly has said he was <Col N="766" /> proud to be a member of the Government that started that borrowing pattern.  I regret that the Deputy has left the House so quickly because I intended saying in his presence that if I were in the entertainment business and was listening to the first part of his contribution, I would have considered him to be a top drawing card.  Unfortunately, we are not discussing entertainment but the economic situation and the difficulties facing us all. To Deputy Kelly's credit he returned to that eventually although he showed contradictions of interest and approach.</P>
      <P>I would prefer to deal with the economy in a more serious way and to analyse the performance of the Government in its first year in office.  We are debating this motion just one year since a debate on a no confidence motion which brought down our Government.  What progress has taken place since then? What progress has been made on the commitments by the Coalition partners in the election campaign?  We are entitled to examine the performance of the Government very critically.  The central theme of the no confidence debate last year was <i>The Way Forward,</i> a plan prepared by Fianna Fáil after only a few months in office.  We had also prepared the Estimates and they were almost ready for debate here.</P>
      <P>The Tánaiste made his maiden contribution on that motion.  It was interesting to hear this morning his comments on the state of the economy and what has happened since then.  I should like to quote from column 1034 of the Official Report, dated 4 November 1982 when he said with regard to the Government:</P>
      <P>It must be compassionate, economically and socially progressive, and fearlessly face up to the vested interests in our society.</P>
      <P>What a change there has been in his attitude since he became a member of the Government of which Deputy FitzGerald is leader.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about the hard-hearted Government.  I am sure that I would call them that.  I repeat and support what was said by the leader of my party that the performance of the Government <Col N="767" /> and the way they are managing the economy is causing hardship for almost every single person.  We have rising unemployment and rising prices&mdash;all the problems they promised to eliminate.</P>
    <P>Last year the central issue was unemployment, as it was in the election campaign. Let us see how the Government have performed there.  A year ago there were 160,000 people unemployed, but today the figure is almost 200,000.  I intend to devote some time to my own county and city at a later stage and I will give the relevant figures for them.</P>
    <P>
      <i>The Way Forward</i> had proposed a plan to develop our economy and to take it through the tough years before us.  Our Estimates showed what we would spend on the current and capital side for 1983. In the first budget of this Coalition Government there was a cut of £120 million in capital expenditure.  One must ask if that was wise.  This morning the leader of our party pointed out in a clear and concise way that the financial rectitude, the balancing of the books of which we hear so much, has not been successful despite the impositions imposed and the hardships caused to so many people.</P>
    <P>During the election campaign we were told about the Cabinet sub-committee. We have not heard from them.  When questioned last week about the setting up of the famous task force the best the Taoiseach could tell us was that perhaps for next year they would have some advice to give regarding the preparation of the Estimates.  He was really saying that nothing had been achieved.  I want to know from the next speaker, who is in the relevant Department, how many jobs the sub-committee and the task force have created.  I wish to know how many jobs the Youth Employment Agency have created in that period.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency were deprived of expenditure of about £11 million in the middle of the year, when further cuts were made.  Incidentally, the Youth Employment Agency were part of the Labour Party manifesto in the election of June 1981 and the undertaking became part of the famous Gaiety <Col N="768" /> Theatre document.  The board members of the agency were appointed during the election in February 1982.  The chief executive officer was appointed on 8 March 1982, on the eve of the appointment of the new Government, when I went into the Department of Labour.  He was appointed amid a furore by some members of the agency, one of whom was a representative of the Youth Council who is now advising the Minister of State in the House and the other has become an employee of that agency. I do not say to their discredit because I believe they are excellent people.  However, those people were part of the Fine Gael machine.</P>
    <P>I want to know what is happening in the agency and how many jobs they have created.  I must compliment them on a project in my own constituency where they became involved with a community group.  The undertaking in question was an excellent co-operative, which I think will do very well.  However, there is considerable disillusionment among members of the staff.  They are not sure of the direction the agency is taking.  The position of the agency was undermined by the Government's decision to appoint consultants to examine the possibility of coordination between all the agencies involved with youth employment and activities.  The agency themselves should have been given that role; in fact, it was the only clear-cut role I considered they could have when I was Minister.  We need answers to some questions regarding the Youth Employment Agency and the jobs they have created.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  There has been a breach of faith by the Government with regard to this project.  They are constantly preaching gloom and doom and are discouraging effort and enterprise.  They are creating throughout the country an air of no confidence. This is a time when positive leadership and encouragement is needed. Despite the difficulties and neglect of the Cork area by the Government, given a little assistance the people of Cork will rally to resume the industrial development of that area.  The position of Clondalkin Paper Mills must be considered. <Col N="769" /> Not only is it serious in itself but what has happened to it is a symptom of the approach of the Government.  I should like the Tánaiste to bear this in mind when he talks about the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Kelly speaking. He is the man who preaches to all of us, despite his advising the Tánaiste this morning that he should not lecture. Deputy Kelly lectures to us all and has done so for many years.  Deputy Kelly was a member of the Government from 1973 to 1977.  It was during the time of that Government that the National Development Corporation was born.  We had long discussions here about what it would do and how it would be used.  If Deputy Kelly was not a member of the Government in the early stages of their term of office he certainly was a member later on.  It was during that time that the proposal regarding the National Development Corporation was put forward. Nobody spelled out clearly what it would do and neither has the Tánaiste done so this morning.  If the Government have run into genuine difficulties about Clondalkin Paper Mills, surely they should tell the corporation about it.  They should point out the commitments they have made, that they purchased the paper mills in March for £1.7 million and that they made a commitment regarding jobs in that project.  They could tell the corporation to take it under their control and see what they could do on behalf of the workers.  I should like to quote from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of today's date a statement by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in relation to the Clondalkin Paper Mills:</P>
    <P>Congress is disgusted and aggrieved at the attitude adopted by the Government towards Congress in respect of the commitment given to it about the paper mills, an attitude bordering on one of contempt.</P>
    <P>The reason I am laying such emphasis on this is that it is important and serious in itself because of the obvious breach of faith.  As well as that, this is symptomatic of the whole Government approach to this type of problem at the moment.  The Government should change course <Col N="770" /> quickly in the interests of the future of the country and restore some confidence. They have tried to get their financial book-keeping across to the public as their entitlement to Government, which is purely a facade they are presenting.  They are trying to convince the people that this is their own and that everything else must be forgotten.  They should remember the night they came in here and the present Taoiseach and the Minister for Energy, who does all the preaching, voted to nationalise Fieldcrest.  What they are doing now is a long cry from that in early summer of last year.  When we talk about honesty and integrity the Taoiseach has to be reminded of issues of this type.</P>
    <P>I would like to return to what has been a very hard hit scene in my county and city.  I read with some amusement today one of the likeable comments, the Dáil sketch, which referred to my efforts yesterday to regionalise Michael Mills, the new ombudsman.  I know that the lady in question knew well I was not going to perform a rather severe operation on the said gentleman and regionalise him.  It reminded me of the danger which I fear exists in the Government and which was also, strangely enough, a problem in the 1973-77 Government.  The problem was that beyond Newlands Cross they did not think Ireland existed.  I am afraid that is beginning to creep in very quickly again. Parts of my county are about 250 miles from Newlands Cross and regionalisation is extremely important there but this has been dropped completely by the Government.</P>
    <P>There are some questions we must ask ourselves.  Will the increased moneys we are paying out in social welfare continue forever?  Can we not endeavour in times of very high unemployment to maximise the benefit of that pay out in the interest of saving jobs?  The Government appear to have very little interest in saving jobs. The unemployment figures for Cork city and county are very serious.  I will give those figures not to preach further doom and gloom but to point out the neglect of the area by the Government.  I believe there is goodwill in that area provided we get a few things from the Government. We are not looking for a lot.  At the end <Col N="771" /> of September, the last date for which figures are available, the unemployment figure was 11,328 for Cork city compared with a figure on the same date in 1982 of 8,789.  That is a very substantial increase during that period.  The figure of 11,328 does not include the recent huge number of Dunlop workers who were laid off or other industies in the Cork area which closed during this month.  In other words, the figure is much higher.  The figure for the county in the same period has gone from 7,883 to 9,443.  The total unemployment figure for Cork city and county at the moment is 20,770, which is an increase on the 1981 figure of about 60 per cent.  It is an increase in the city figure of about 90 per cent compared with the 1981 figure.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see the Minister for Labour in the House.  I want him and his Department to get the message of how serious the situation is in Cork city and county.  This must be rectified.  I am emphasising this because there appears to me to be an attitude at the moment, as far as the Government are concerned, of not being interested in Cork.  They know there are problems down there but they will forget about them.  There is an article on the back page of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of today's date under the heading of &ldquo;Mitchell False on B &amp; I&rdquo;, which is written by a very reputable travel correspondent for <i>The Cork Examiner,</i> named Dick Brazil, who obviously has been turned down for seeking the same information regarding the Rosslare-Pembroke sailings as was given by the Minister at a press conference in Cork recently in respect of the Cork-Pembroke sailings.  He states in his article:</P>
    <P>Transport Minister Mr. Jim Mitchell has been accused of giving &ldquo;a false or at least misleading impression&rdquo; of the Cork-Pembroke summer service of the B &amp; I Line.  Meanwhile the Minister has refused an <i>Examiner</i> request to elaborate on the figures and give details of the performance of the B &amp; I Rosslare-Pembroke route during the summer.  The Minister in his reply to us states that the queries raised refer <Col N="772" /> to the day-to-day running of the B &amp; I and should be put to them.</P>
    <P>Further on in this article another Corkman, the Chairman of the Cork Harbour Commissioners and a reputable and well-known businessman there, Mr. Denis Murphy, questions the accuracy of the figures given by the Minister for Transport.  I call on the Minister for Transport to look seriously at the B &amp; I situation and in the interests of Cork to restore the sailings the B &amp; I have carried on between Cork and the Welsh coast.  I do not mind if it is Pembroke or some other port.  It is all the better if it is Swansea.  So long as it is a Cork-Welsh link operated by B &amp; I which will restore employment to some of the people who have lost their jobs I will be satisfied. This must be done.</P>
    <P>I do not want to re-live the Dunlop trauma.  I believe that the dilatory tactics of the Government with regard to mediation or preventing the development of the industrial relations problem in Dunlop caused this dispute to go on for so long.  I am satisfied because of the actions of the Minister concerned, that he was not fully aware of the serious repercussions which developed for a period.  I want to compilment the performance of the mediator, Mr. John Horgan, who did a very good job but who should have been brought in much earlier. I am satisfied that if he had been brought in earlier and if mediation had taken place the stoppage at Fords would not have occurred.  I believe, if mediation had taken place sooner, the steam supply to the Ford plant would have continued. It is a pity mediation did not take place sooner because what has happened has shattered faith in that plant for the future.</P>
    <P>I read with interest the commitment of the Minister for Energy to sectoral committees.  Is he fully in touch with the Cork situation?  Has he had discussions with management and the trade union side in relation to the motor assembly at Fords which is important to Cork and the country in view of the change in protocol that is taking place next year?  I want the Minister to assure me that he has met them and that he will continue to meet <Col N="773" /> them.  It is very hard for people to have any confidence in the present regime particularly when at the Ard-Fheis great emphasis was placed on the fact that the Taoiseach and some of his economic Ministers will now meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the farming associations and the employer bodies in the interests of employment and job creation as well as of economic development.  This should have happened every month since they were appointed.  This was a feature of the Fianna Fáil Government for quite a number of years.</P>

      <P>Apart from the many contacts being made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance and Agriculture, in the Council of Ministers and bilaterally, I have had discussions in Brussels with the Belgian Acting Prime Minister and other Belgian Ministers.  I have also put Ireland's case to the President of the European Commission on separate occasions as well as to two Vice-Presidents of the Commission. Recently I met with Mr. Rocard, French Minister for Agriculture, and Mr. Dankert, President of the European Parliament, as well as with a delegation from the Parliament.  Next week I shall, at his invitation, be in Athens for discussions <Col N="774" /> with the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Papandreou, who will, as President in office, be chairing the European Council in Athens in December.  I shall also be meeting soon with the British Prime Minister. Mrs. Thatcher, and with the German Chancellor, Herr Kohl, who, we expect, will be paying an official visit to this country, shortly.  Between now and the settlement of these critical Community issues, I shall have whatever other discussions with Community leaders may be necessary and possible to ensure that our vital national interests are protected.</P>
      <P>Finally, on the last part of the Deputy's question, it would not be appropriate to disclose details on these confidential discussions at a time of intensive and critical negotiations in the European Community.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach agree that this haphazard approach is damaging Ireland's case?  Can he tell us at this stage if he is rejecting totally the milk levy or if he is accepting it with derogations?  I want a clear statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing haphazard about the approach.  What we have been doing has been carefully thought out and planned for months back.  Everything we are doing has a purpose and a reason.  As regards the super-levy, we regard it as an inappropriate mechanism in itself for the purpose of dealing with the problem because it introduces into the Community system something which in practice works like a quota and it would freeze the existing market situation, and therefore it operates against the basic market principles of the Community.  We also, of course, oppose it in relation to our own position because of the inequity it would create in respect of a country like our own in which milk plays such an important part, accounting ultimately for something like 9 per cent of GNP, and has a role in our economy about five times as great as in the rest of the Community.  As I have pointed out, the effect of the imposition of the super-levy here over a period of years on our national output would be enormously greater than the impact on <Col N="775" /> other countries and enormously greater than the impact of other situations which are considered by other member states to be unacceptable to them, and have, indeed, been regarded by our partners in the Community as requiring adjustment.</P>

      <P>I have clarified that we are opposed in principle to the super-levy. I point out also that its operation in respect of this country if it were to be applied here would create an unacceptable situation.  At both levels we are opposing it.  The outcome of the negotiations obviously has yet to be determined, but the Deputy, the House and the farming community can be assured that we will continue to pursue the carefully planned approach to this matter designed to produce the best possible results for this country in difficult conditions and difficult negotiations.  We have a vital interest in the success of the total negotiations because it is vital to us that the Community's own resources be increased; otherwise the CAP would be undermined in any event.</P>

      <P>I ask the Taoiseach to clear up the confusion which exists in the country at present not alone in the farming community but among trade unions as well, that is the confusion created last weekend when the Taoiseach issued one statement and the Minister for Agriculture a totally different one.

They have, on the whole, been favourable comments.  Regarding the matter raised by the Deputy, I have made the position perfectly clear.  We regard the super-levy as an inappropriate solution to the problem as offending against the basic principles of the market and we also regard its application to this country as unacceptable because of the damage it would do to our economy.</P>

If, as the Taoiseach says, the approach has been strategically planned and prepared for several months, could he explain to us, first of all, the different statements, as outlined by Deputy Byrne, from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture at their party gathering at the weekend; secondly, the apparently contradictory statements of the Minister for Agriculture himself on the day he was interviewed in Dublin Airport and the next day on the European scene?  If it has been strategically planned over a long period, can he explain how the Minister for Agriculture seemed to have different approaches on two successive days?</P>

Since 1981 the Industrial Development Authority have approved almost 900 projects for Cork city and county which plan to provide about 10,500 jobs at full production.</P>
      <P>The IDA have succeeded in recent years in attracting a significant number of major industries to the Cork area.  Many of these companies are still recruiting and a large number of jobs have still to come on stream in these projects.  They include North Star Computers, Compucorp and CPT Ltd.  These companies already employ over 240 people and plan eventually to employ over 600 people.  Three other electronics companies, Western Digital, Cado Systems and Perkin Elmer, recently opened their new factory premises in Cork where they will continue to expand.

      <P>Earlier this year the IDA launched a major new initiative for the promotion of the small industries sector in Cork city and the east Cork area. As part of a pilot programme, the IDA have decentralised their process of providing assistance to small firms.  Eight small industry specialists have been assigned to work exclusively with small companies and an IDA small industries board have been established with full <Col N="781" /> grant-giving powers.  This represents a major commitment by the IDA to the future growth of the small industries sector in Cork.</P>
      <P>The IDA have a strategic site of almost 900 acres at Ringaskiddy which they are promoting for industries requiring special facilities.  In addition, the IDA have almost 280 acres of land available in the Cork city area at various locations for industrial projects.  There is also 170,000 sq. ft. of factory space either available or under construction in the area which is being promoted for suitable new industries. As part of their ongoing commitment to Cork, the IDA is also providing a new craft centre at the Cork butter exchange in Shandon.  Construction work is now well advanced on the 17 unit centre, and it is expected to be completed in the near future.  A 30,000 sq. ft. enterprise centre is also planned for the city.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister could have spared us the additional information.  That is all old news which has been there for a long time.  First of all, would the Minister indicate how many of the 10,500 jobs which he mentioned have already been filled and secondly, when will the full potential of 10,500 be achieved &mdash; in other words, in how many years?  Is the Minister aware that the growth in unemployment in Cork city from end September 1981 to end September 1983 has risen from 6,531 to 11,328&mdash;more than an 80 per cent growth and those figures do not include the recent Dunlop losses?  Would he not, as a matter of top priority, give special attention to Cork and by special attention I mean, particularly, attention to the major labour-intensive industries which are at present experiencing difficulty? Would he not regard it as an important aspect of his administration at present to look immediately at the Cork scene regarding such industries, to prevent further job losses and then to tackle seriously, and not in the manner which he suggests, the job creation line?</P>

However, this is a reasonable question and I shall obtain the information for the Deputy.  As far as the other aspects of the question are concerned, I would not regard the number of initiatives which were announced as being in any sense old news.  They may have been announced before but they are very important, in particular the designation of Cork as the area where a pilot small industry programme is being launched &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;with an independent board for the Cork area working within the IDA ambit.  This is a major initiative, in particular in the number of highly skilled staff who have been allocated to find the potential of small industries in Cork, the individuals in Cork who have the capacity to set up businesses. One thing which is quite clear, as the Deputy will agree from his own experience, is that increasingly one finds among the people who, we regret, are unemployed those of tremendous talent who could set up industries or small businesses of their own.  In view of the undoubtedly very serious redundancy situation in Cork it is entirely appropriate that the Government should have decided to initiate this intensive small industry programme with an independent board in Cork, where there are undoubtedly a particularly large number of people amongst the unemployed with the capacity to set up businesses of their own.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a few questions. Would the Minister not agree that by creating confidence and providing incentives he would ensure that the Ringaskiddy programme would be completed, thereby providing employment? To provide jobs in the Cork area, will he ensure that the £120 million removed from the capital programme by this Government last February is re-introduced? The Minister and the Government could do that if they had the will <Col N="786" /> and the political commitment to Cork to do it.</P>

      <P>All I can do about the first part of the Deputy's question is to take note of it.  It is not solely my responsibility or indeed directly my responsibility. I will discuss it with my colleagues.  I am surprised that Deputy Lyons should attack the emphasis I placed in my reply on small industries as a means of solving the problem of unemployment in Cork and elsewhere.  The experience here and abroad is that there is a better record in creating employment and sustaining it through good industrial relations in small industries than there is in large prestige projects which tended to be promoted by Governments all over the world in the sixties and seventies.  In the light of experience the emphasis all over the world now is on small, viable, well-managed projects where there is a good relationship between employer and employees.</P>

Surely the Minister is aware that Cork is now a disaster area where unemployment is concerned.  He mentioned the efforts of the IDA to attract industry to Cork. At the same time the Government are jeopardising the initiative of the IDA by not providing the necessary money to establish a proper harbour in Cork.  One statement by the Minister is contradicting the other.  It is about time there was collective responsibility between the Minister and the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that as a member of the European Communities, Ireland is generally precluded from restricting the import of materials produced in other member states and may act against non-EEC imports only within the framework of Community policy.  The maintenance of international competitiveness under the <Col N="789" /> headings of price, quality and delivery performance, together with the development and availability of new products, are essential if Irish firms are successfully to compete against imports on the domestic market.  The extensive services and expertise of the State agencies are available to assist Irish industry in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in the 1980-81 Foras Forbartha review they identified areas of imported building materials to the extent of £170 million which could be substituted here? In the review published a few weeks ago following a big drop off in building they said the amount has increased by £20 million.  Instead of making headway the Government seem to be going backwards in reducing imports of unnecessary building materials and components.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is definitely a problem here which is widely recognised. There could be a greater development of home supply for the building industry and other industries.  Successive reports not just on the building industry but also on multinational industries located in Ireland have indicated very large markets for small Irish firms which are not being filled.  For that purpose the IDA have established a project identification unit. They use a computerised record of all the components brought in by industries located here.  People who think they could produce something on that very extensive list are given all the assistance possible with regard to specifications, and so on, to enable them to get into production. I agree strongly with Deputy Leonard that there is considerable room for expansion in this area.  People who think they might be able to set up an industry supplying anything being imported at the moment should contact the IDA, because at present they are laying special emphasis on this type of work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that, from the pathetic reply he has given, it is obvious his Government have no policy in the area of import substitution? He and his Government continue <Col N="790" /> to give us this excuse of the European Court decision despite the fact that other European countries, particularly Britain and France, have got around this situation and are very active in their policies of ensuring import substitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware that I have taken a number of initiatives on behalf of the Government to counter protectionism in Europe.  I believe, the Government believe, and Deputy Fahey might also believe if he reflected for a moment, that protectionism such as he is advocating is directly contrary to the interests of a small country like Ireland.  There is no other country in the EEC, except Belgium, which relies as much on exports as we do&mdash;almost 50 per cent of all we produce is exported.  If we take action which leads to retaliatory action somewhere else, we have more to lose than they do.  It would be very foolish for us to provoke action in a war we cannot win.  I believe very strongly, therefore, in pursuing the approach I have outlined, which is a positive one, not of seeking sanctions against imports but of developing and giving incentives to existing Irish industries to supply needs which could be supplied from the home market but which are imported simply because nobody here has produced the quality product needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that most of the products used in the building industry&mdash;bricks, concrete products, floor covering and so on &mdash; can be manufactured by low technology industries and we have the necessary factory space lying idle at present?  Does the Minister think the IDA are doing all they can in this area?  Would he also agree, since 80 per cent of the materials used in this industry are heavily subsidised by State agencies, that it is incredible that the Department cannot insist that Irish made materials are used?  According to the reports on the timber industry, we should be self-sufficient in timber by 1984.  This year we are importing materials and timber components for the building industry worth over £100 million. Rather than trying to meet this <Col N="791" /> demand, the Department appear to be falling down &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is primarily the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment.  However, I agree that the point made by the Deputy is reasonable. As to his advocacy of discriminatory practices against imported products, I would like to tell the House that, as estimated by the IDA, these practices by other countries have cost us 2,400 jobs. We have been trying to eliminate discriminatory State purchasing practices in Europe because, as a country with high unemployment and with a greater reliance on inward foreign investment than other European countries which have established industries, we believe we have more to lose as a nation from the building up of protectionist walls in Europe than we have to gain.  That is a judgment I made.  It may not be a judgment Deputy Leonard or his friends agree with, but I believe it is the right judgment.</P>

But, as soon as the National Development Corporation is established, the National Enterprise Agency will cease to have any independent existence and will merge into the National Development Corporation.</P>

      <P>I appointed Mrs. Mary Shinners as my personal secretary on a salary of £130.46 per week plus an allowance of £11.00 per week.  She is seconded from the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy, Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Kitt</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Energy if he will give a <i>de facto</i> guarantee that the building of the proposed peat briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan, Ballinasloe, County Galway, will commence in 1983; the size of the factory; its capacity, the number of permanent workers to be employed there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the financial situation facing this Government <Col N="797" /> when we took office last December I initiated a review of all major capital projects under the aegis of my Department. The Ballyforan factory was one of the projects included in this review.</P>
      <P>An appraisal of the project was carried out in conjunction with Bord na Móna. This has recently been completed and I intend that its conclusions will be put before the Government at a very early date.  It would not be appropriate, therefore, for me to give any guarantee relating to the project until the matter has been considered by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that just one week short of 12 months ago the sod for this new factory was turned? Is he further aware that he met a deputation on 4 August last, which is one week short of three months ago, when he told us that this review was at an advanced stage?  Can he now tell us the reasons a decision cannot be taken with regard to this project?  We want to know are the Department going ahead with this project or not.  Can he give us the reason it is being put off weekly, daily and monthly? It looks now as if it will be well into 1984 before any decision is taken.  Yet, the Minister told me on 4 August last that he expected a decision to be taken this year. The Minister laughed when I asked that question.  I want to know the exact position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think I laughed when the Deputy asked the question. Actually, the deputation to which the Deputy refers raised a number of points of considerable value which I had to have considered in addition to those already being considered in the review.  I indicated at the time that I would have the points made by certain members of the deputation examined carefully in the review.  I can assure the House that there will be no avoidable delay in coming to a decision in this matter.  However, it is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that where a new investment is being undertaken its return will be sufficient to at least remunerate the funds being borrowed to finance it, given that <Col N="798" /> these borrowings are guaranteed by the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is the second review that has been carried out by this Government in two years?  We were told in the House by the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, that the review was at an advanced stage in the first week of July and that the Minister was to submit it to the Government within a few weeks.  A subsequent deputation &mdash; which did not give us any other news &mdash; met the Minister in August.  Now in October we still have not got any decision.  Has the Minister submitted the review to the Government, as was promised by the Minister of State last July? Can the Minister also confirm that we will get some kind of demountable dwelling or half a factory in Derryfadda rather than a full scale briquette factory?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The first review was basically about the price that Bord na Móna were able to charge for their fuel. That review was completed and there were increases in the prices.  That review was initiated by a Coalition Government. The actual price increases were implemented by their successors, the Fianna Fáil Government.  The present review is a different one.  It is concerned with the capital project in Ballyforan and whether or not this can remunerate itself in terms of the interest that has to be paid on the borrowings to pay for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>We are very disappointed with the negative reply from the Minister. We were expecting at this stage that at least the Government would have the competence, capacity or ability to take a decision in relation to a project commenced 12 months ago.  It is about time the Government started governing.  As far as we are concerned in my constituency, the Minister is not representing the best interests of our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that the plant has started to arrive for the project in Ballyforan, that this plant was ordered and paid for?  Is he aware that the IDA have allocated £3 million for this project?  Is he aware also that it was approved by the <Col N="799" /> previous Government, was allocated and budgeted for?  Surely it is about time the Minister took a decision to continue a project which had commenced.  Without the project the whole region would be virtually wiped out, because there is no other major industry there.  We are dependent on the Department now to take a decision in relation to this project. I hope that Government TDs from East Galway and Roscommon will rally forward and lay on the line exactly where they stand, because as far as I am concerned they have been standing idly by with regard to this project.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous Government and Governments ensured that major capital projects, once commenced, were reviewed from time to time to ascertain whether or not they were going to be completed within budget and meet the objectives for which they were commenced. If they had been as careful as we, we would not have so many major financial problems in the public sector.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 to 18 together.</P>
      <P>The strategic plan has been prepared by the ESB itself and on foot of the board's statutory responsibilities.  I am considering it against a background on which, I believe, there is no serious dispute, that is, that our electricity prices are high and have been adversely affecting the competitiveness of our economy and jobs in industry.  Indeed, before the plan was received I had set up a special inquiry into the reasons underlying the high level of electricity prices and had set very limited deadlines for an interim and final report from this inquiry, A number of the matters raised in the ESB plan will obviously have been addressed by the inquiry on its own initiative.</P>
      <P>The strategic plan puts forward proposals for dealing with the comprehensive range of problems which the board perceive as affecting their costs of which excess generating capacity and associated manpower and other expenditures are very significant.  Also covered in the plan are administration, accounting procedures, industrial relations matters, consultancy services, general overheads, office development, trading practices and major reorganisation of structures within the board.  Since action on certain of these headings has implications for staffing levels, the board's plan also contains proposals for redundancies and consequential financial provisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am subjecting this plan to a detailed examination and it is necessary to complete very comprehensive consultations with the ESB and with Bord na Móna whose activities could be affected by reductions of excess generating capacity. I would like to emphasise that there have been no decisions yet on the ESB's proposals. Since my responsibilities and those of the Government have a wider compass than the responsibilities of the ESB, the final decisions on the plan will take account of all relevant factors, social, regional and strategic, as well as economic.  I do not consider that it would be productive or constructive to go into the implications of specific proposals in the plan, including those relating to <Col N="804" /> planned closures, until my examination of the plan and its full implications has been much further advanced.  I should say, however, that the fundamental problems identified in the ESB Strategic Plan and the implementation of measures to solve them are primarily for the ESB to tackle itself in the light of whatever general policy guidelines I or the Government may indicate.</P>

      <P>It is impossible for us, the large number of Deputies who had put down questions, to deal with this matter because of the manner in which the Minister has treated these questions. Specifically, in Question No. 11, I asked if the Minister would specify the power stations proposed by the ESB for closure in whole or in part, the extent of the closure in each case and the dates of the proposed closures.  Why did the Minister not give that information?  This House and the public at large are entitled to have that information given to us here as elected public representatives.  We are not expected to crawl around back streets trying to find the information surreptitiously. We are entitled to this information. I put down a parliamentary question and I have been blocked from getting the information by a stratagem of the Minister.  Naturally, Deputies will put down questions on matters such as this because they concern many parts of the country.  As spokesman on Energy for the Opposition I am entitled to be given the information requested in No. 11.</P>

This is a report prepared by the ESB and it is confidential as far as the board are concerned.  The ESB prepared it for their internal use.  I indicated to the Deputy that I will consult with the board to try to have it laid on the Table of the House so that Deputies can peruse it carefully before the debate on this subject will be resumed next week.  I cannot go further than that now.  The Deputy will accept that there is a certain amount of autonomy vested in these bodies.  This <Col N="805" /> is an ESB plan, not a Government one &mdash; if it were a Government plan I would be in a different position.  Then it would be a matter solely for me whether I should have it published.  It has not been published although there may have been selective leaks from the report which reached the newspapers.  It has not been published and as it is not my document the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me unilaterally to decide to publish it.</P>

The Government associate themselves fully with the statement issued yesterday by the Secretary General of the United Nations in which he warned of the possibility that the escalation of tensions could further complicate an already complex situation in that region.  The Government consider that there is a duty on the part of all concerned to facilitate a speedy resolution of this crisis in accordance with the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for the territorial integrity and political independence of that state.</P>

      <P>I outlined earlier the unemployment problems generally and also within my own region.  This Government have an obligation during these very difficult times, yet every step taken by them in the area of employment is negative.  I referred earlier to the cutback in the capital expenditure programme. What we need is an injection of political faith by the Government which will give encouragement to the community to overcome their problems.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has already been approached by a deputation from Cork and given a full briefing by the harbour commissioners regarding the urgent necessity and desirability in the interests of the industrial survival of Cork of providing the money necessary for the deep water berth.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla spoke of the hoped for oil find off our shore.  I hope it is a commercial find but I worry about references to the possibility of the oil being piped to Milford Haven.  I demand an assurance from the Government that if this find is commercial the oil will be piped to our own State refining company in Whitegate, which is only 27 miles from the area of the oil find.  If the oil is brought in by tanker there is a danger that there will not be a permanent link with the refinery.  An act of political faith of this kind is badly needed in the Cork area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has also been reference in the course of the debate to the timber industry and it is to be regretted that the enterprise in Fermoy has had to close with the loss of 75 jobs in Fermoy and approximately 75 jobs in the forests.  This is the kind of indigenous industry on which we should be concentrating more and more. This Government, since they took office, have failed to take one positive step forward in that area.  The Cabinet sub-committee are remarkably silent.  We have heard nothing from the task force or the Youth Employment Agency.  The cost of <Col N="846" /> unemployment has been allowed to continue rising.  I can cite the case of an employer in my own city where 48 per cent of every pound generated goes into tax of some shape or form, VAT, PAYE, PRSI, postage, telephone charges and so on.  What is left is supposed to cope with wages, material costs, etc.  That situation cannot be allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>In the presence of the Minister for Finance, I welcome the sympathy expressed by his colleague, Deputy John Bruton, at Question Time today when I asked him about the urgency of providing assistance to existing Cork industries. They are big employers, intensive industries, who, because of the very depressed situation, are suffering severely and finding it difficult to continue with their work force.  I welcome the fact that the Minister will allow us to bring any such case to the attention of his Minister of State and I sincerely hope the Minister for Finance will express the same sympathy and will support Deputy Eddie Collins when we make the necessary information available to him.</P>
    <P>At election time, Fine Gael said they would halt and reverse the trend of unemployment. The Labour Party said they would be a voice to be heard in Government. My God, what a voice.  It is a whisper and who has heard it or when has it been heard last?  When have we heard from a Labour spokesman for the Cork area regarding the dreadful unemployment there?  It proves how empty the promises were and how the U-turns were taken.</P>
    <P>Up to now I thought no Government could ever be superior to the Coalition Government of 1973-1977 in the area of press relations.  I thought they had all the answers but they are only a pale shadow by comparison with these brilliant people.  There is no doubt that the money which the Minister for Finance makes available for paying to the various agencies which they employed was paid to those who worked and contributed to the election of the Fine Gael Party.  They did well, they got good appointments and contracts&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is obvious that someone in RTE, and I am very anxious to find out who, is now operating as Fine Gael election agent.  As a member of this House I resent the patronage being offered by a State-sponsored station in recent times.  I would have no hesitation in saying, even outside the House, that they are being manipulated by people in high places.  On Thursday night there was a so-called programme which was a party political broadcast.  Then the Fine Gael Ard Fheis was covered.  Of course that was understandable and would be given to any party.  It is acceptable.  On Sunday we had an appearance by Justin Keating, a former Coalition Minister, in his usual spot.  On Monday we had a member of the Labour Party, Senator Robinson, and we also had the Minister of State, Deputy Nuala Fennell, appearing on a programme. On Tuesday we had the Minister for Education who performed very well and today, I understand, we had Mrs. Bonneti who is a possible candidate in a forthcoming by-election.  I am not sure who will be appearing tomorrow. The Minister had his turn recently and, obviously, before the week is out we will have many more.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I have met several irate people recently who are dissatisfied with the bias shown by RTE and say that the only cure is not to pay their <Col N="848" /> television licences.  I certainly do not approve of that and I condemn it but I had quite a number of telephone calls over the weekend pointing out that that is the only language that RTE understand. RTE must realise that we are the biggest party with the greatest volume of support in the country and that it will not be too long before we are back in Government.  I am glad to be a Member of the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies and perhaps I will be able to question them on that subject in the near future.</P>
      <P>We have to take every possible step to preserve existing jobs.  I have always believed that too much lip service has been paid to the buy Irish and sell Irish campaigns.  This Government appears to have no commitment to such a campaign and I urge that, within reason, they support any measures to protect our own products.  I appreciate the dangers and difficulties of protectionism and the harm it could do but there are areas where we can help in a big way.  For example in my city there is dumping of British newspapers. It is startling to learn that a well known English newspaper is now taking second place in sales in Cork city.  For many reasons, that is a frightening situation. However, the reasons for it are obvious because it is being dumped at a price.  When all of the factors are taken into consideration it is being sold a lot cheaper than in the UK.  That serious situation must be faced up to.  We must remember that it could have a serious impact on jobs and we cannot afford to lose any more jobs in Cork or anywhere else.  The Minister should have the matter investigated by one of his many Ministers of State.  He should investigate this matter rather than going to London to make the speeches he is not permitted to make at home.  Those he makes in London are unusual in that there is a different slant to them.  He would be better employed investigating matters at home such as the dumping of newspapers.  Another serious repercussion could be a take-over of our newspaper industry by foreign concerns. This question should be examined as a matter of urgency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction industry is experiencing <Col N="849" /> its worst recession, even taking the fifties into consideration.  At least 50 per cent of that workforce do not have a permanent job and prospects are not good.  The only hope is for an improvement in the capital budget programme. We cannot be sure what the work situation will be in 1984 and that is one of the reasons why I condemn off-the-top-of-the-head comments by the Taoiseach. There is no doubt that academics have an important role to play in life but statements by academics who do not have experience of the hard facts of managerial life can be dangerous.  It was wrong for the Taoiseach to pluck a figure like £500 million out of the air and then argue later that he did not say £500 million but a figure of the order of £500 million.  The figure does not make much difference because the Taoiseach's statement tended to depress, undermine confidence and prevent the creation of some extra jobs.  People will not be inclined to create employment until they see where the cuts amounting to £500 million will be made. I have heard rumours to the effect that cuts will occur at Moneypoint although commitments have been made in regard to the third phase of that project which is probably the only worthwhile heavy construction project in progress at present. I do not have to stress in the House the need to preserve our skilled work force until we reach better times.</P>
    <P>The Government seem to have a new <i>laissez faire</i> approach to industrial relations. Strikes, disputes and threats of disputes are widespread and nobody appears to care to any great extent.  We have a seven-week-old strike in Industrial Gases &mdash; a matter mentioned last night &mdash; and the consequences for that industry could be horrific because many jobs are threatened.  I accept that the area of industrial relations is not an easy one and progress cannot be achieved in it overnight. Deputy Kelly, in the course of his contribution, made an important point about lecturing workers.  The Coalition Government from 1973-77 not only created an air of doom and gloom, as is happening at present, but they lectured to many people.  This morning we had some more lecturing from the Labour <Col N="850" /> Party leader, a new role for such a person, who told us what we should be doing and how.</P>
    <P>We need leadership and an injection of faith by the Government.  We need the same type of patriotism that was shown before, patriotism in the workplace where we all work together in the interests of the country and our young population. This year we did not have sufficient places in our third level institutions for our young people and we do not have jobs for them.  However, they represent our greatest asset and must not be neglected or misused.  Conditions may not be as comfortable as they were some years ago but the national consideration should be paramount in the workplace. The Government have preached about financial rectitude and told us of the importance of getting the books right but they have failed in that regard and that was highlighted by our leader, Deputy Haughey, this morning.  The press relations that have been working for the Government are wearing very thin and will not last much longer because people are beginning to ask questions.  A year has passed since the Coalition came to power and the unemployment trend has not been halted, let alone reversed. The voice of Labour has dropped to a faint whisper and there is little joy or expectation from the Government.  We need leadership and the Government must alter their course.  I appeal to the Government to place the creation of employment at the top of their list of priorities.  We do not need lip service. The Government should investigate the best way to preserve the many jobs placed in jeopardy because of the downturn in economic activity.  They should ensure that the balance of expenditure is in the right direction and see to it that costly, and often wasteful, social welfare payments are directed in a more positive and productive way for our future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government welcome this debate on the current economic situation.  We should know what Members feel about the situation facing us and what answers they believe should be given to our problems. <Col N="851" /> I am bound to say on the last point that we may have to wait for a long time because no answers or specific suggestions have been put forward.  All we are faced with from the Opposition is a denial of a plan they put forward in November last and presented as being the way forward, the way out of our difficulties.  It has now been ignominiously jettisoned. We have a repetition of proposals made many years ago which the party in Opposition had an opportunity of trying out while in Government but which, for their own good reasons, decided not to do so. On that point I give them credit for having some sense but I do not see why the rest of the country should be subjected to these fairy tales from Fianna Fáil in Opposition when even they would not dare to perpetrate those nonsenses while in Government.</P>
      <P>Debate on our economic situation in the House should be more than a recital of proposal and counter proposal, a series of attacks and replies.  It should be an occasion to examine the fundamental basis of the Government's approach, the approach of the House and our people to the improvement of the welfare of our people in the circumstances which face us.  To do this we must look at the whole situation and not just at discreet separate pieces of it.  I believe that the debate on our economic problems here has suffered greatly from a general tendency to concentrate on specific parts of the problem and a failure to take a wider view of the needs that face us and of our ability to meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This creates an illness, a disease that I call the &ldquo;single issue syndrome&rdquo;, public attention being seized by those who concentrate on specific issues or specific sectors.  They put forward with skill, conviction and a great deal of persuasion, and mostly in good faith, measures to deal with the problems as they see them. We have all heard such cases being made. In fact, many of us made those cases ourselves.  In their own terms these cases may be sustainable and produce the benefits that are claimed for them.  The difficulty is that when they are all added <Col N="852" /> together they produce a combination of requirements for support of different kinds from the Exchequer which is unsustainable. That is a major difficulty we have in economic debates.  Even in this House it is extremely difficult to get people to put the various pieces together, to look at the overall picture, and to judge each of the separate measures that are being defended or promoted in the light of what the overall picture indicates we can do, of what can be afforded and the combined effects of the different measures being defended.  Much of the disappointment and disenchantment with our economic and political system stem from this single-issue approach to our problems.</P>

      <P>Much of the difficulty we experience today in responding to the problems which face us arises directly from an excessive inclination in past years to respond separately to the separate demands which were made without enough attention having been paid to the overall framework of action or to the relationship between the different measures taken.  This unco-ordinated response to separate and often conflicting demands has given rise to an unrealistic expectation that such demands can all be met simultaneously.  It has given rise to expectations about real income levels which cannot be sustained by a country in our situation.  We must break away from that kind of approach to economic debate. <Col N="853" /> We must focus on our real, fundamental requirements and agree on the measures to meet those requirements which are realistically within our capacity.</P>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that the central concern of Government policy is employment.  In recent years we in this country, in common with most other countries, have experienced a dramatic increase in the level of unemployment. However, our difficulties have been greatly compounded by demographic factors and by the signal failure of policies and attitudes to adjust to the fundamental change in the economic order that was brought about by the recession in the period 1979 to 1982.</P>
      <P>We have now 193,000 people out of work.  Each year a further 20,000 people come on to our labour force and this rate of growth is likely to continue into the medium-term.  This has profound implications for economic and social policy here and for the choices we have to make in those areas.  For example, it means we must create 20,000 new jobs each year before we can even begin to make any attack on the total level of unemployment. That is a rate of job creation we have never been able to sustain over any period.  If we are to deal with the problem it means we will have to change fundamentally the attitudes we take to economic and social policy and decision-taking.</P>
      <P>The enormity of the task facing us can be gauged from our performance in recent years.  From the middle of April 1979 to the middle of April 1982 the number of new jobs created in industry and private services exceeded job losses in those sectors by only 2,000 annually.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I want to <Col N="854" /> point out to the Deputy that he may hear some things that are not in the script. Sometimes I tend to get carried away by my concern to explain things in the greatest possible detail to Deputy Fitzgerald. I know he takes most of his opinions from the newspapers and since they are often inaccurate I wish to make sure we will not suffer from that disability here.  I know the Deputy is very suspicious of the media in general.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>He spent some time a few minutes ago explaining to us about the conspiracy he sees in the media, not even to misrepresent his party but simply not to represent them at all.  I am concerned to make sure that in reading and listening to me today the Deputy will have all the information he needs to react.</P>
      <P>As I pointed out, from mid-April 1979 to mid-April 1982 the number of new jobs created in industry and private services exceeded job losses in those sectors by only 2,000 annually.  Taking account of the labour force growth and the outflow from agriculture &mdash; and excluding the public sector contribution &mdash; there was an annual shortfall of some 28,000 in the rate of private sector job creation required to prevent unemployment increasing.  In manufacturing industry, which should be the main source of new jobs, there was a net loss of more than 24,000 jobs over the three years of 1980 to 1982 with estimated job creation of over 55,000 being more than offset by estimated job losses of nearly 80,000.</P>
      <P>The striking feature of these statistics is the extent of the haemorrhage of jobs. If we had managed to preserve existing manufacturing employment since 1979 our success in creating jobs would have ensured that the rise in the numbers out of work during the recession would have been far fewer.  This underlines the vital importance for the future of directing our collective actions at creating all the conditions necessary to improve every aspect of our competitiveness.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I point out these figures not to make any particular point about Governments <Col N="855" /> that may or may not have been in office during that period but to underline what is far more important than any political argument in this House, namely, the simple fact that our population structure means that in order to get within any kind of striking distance of reducing unemployment we have to create 20,000 new jobs each year.  That is something that should inform all our decisions on economic policy, social policy, taxation policy and on all the other individual desirable items which all of us tend to promote from time to time as being desirable in order to make social and economic progress.</P>
    <P>There are other elements in our population structure which emphasise the vital urgency of the approach which I have been setting out here.  We have the fastest growing population in Western Europe.  Our rate of natural increase is 1¼ per cent per year and from recollection I can think of only two western countries, one being Yugoslavia and the other Turkey, where there is anything like that rate of net population increase in a given year. We also have the youngest population in Western Europe and we have the highest dependency ratio.  For every three people at work there are four other people either under the age of 15 or over the age of 65. This situation creates its own problems in terms of the demands on the public purse and, therefore, on the taxpayer.  It further underlines the crucial importance of job creation for us because if we do not raise the numbers in the active age groups who are gainfully employed those who are at work simply will not be able to support the continuation, even at present levels, of the wide range of public services which have come to be expected from government, not to speak of any improvement in the volume, range or the quality of these services.</P>
    <P>I do not think that we are sufficiently aware of the dramatic implications of this situation.  These implications are many, and a few examples will illustrate their magnitude.  The increase in our population creates inevitably an extra demand for educational facilities.  It creates extra demands on our health services.  It creates <Col N="856" /> an extra requirement for investment in housing, whether publicly or privately provided.  It creates extra demand for sanitary services and for transport infrastructures. It is clear that these extra demands must be met to some degree, either from public or from private resources.  The very act of meeting these demands, however, pre-empts our ability to meet other demands which are not directly connected with those demographic trends.  Thus, the level at which we decide to meet these demands and the balance in our response between public and private provision are questions which ultimately affect our ability to devote resources to other uses.</P>
    <P>There is a clear need for a new national consensus on the ordering of our priorities. Without such a consensus, we will have division and dissatisfaction, and judging by our experience in recent years, an allocation of resources out of time with our fundamental needs.</P>
    <P>This Government are determined to bring about the necessary consensus, both through realistic discussions in this House and with the social partners, and through the development of the process of medium-term planning.  Consensus-building and effective planning both require, however, that we start from a solid base.  That base must be stability and control in the public finances.  In fact our public expenditure, fed by the increasing demands of a rapidly mounting burden of debt, has now reached the enormous total of over two-thirds of our GNP, with current expenditure equivalent to over half our GNP.  This puts us rather high in the &ldquo;big spenders&rdquo; league, substantially above countries such as Germany and the UK which have higher GNP <i>per capita</i> than we have.</P>
    <P>There would be nothing inherently wrong with a high level of public expenditure if, as a community, we were willing to accept the inevitable consequences, namely a high level of taxation, lower personal disposable incomes and a reduced level of private provision of goods and services.  They go together operating within the constraints of a given level of GNP.  The problem in our case seems to be that we want an ever-increasing <Col N="857" /> level of publicly provided goods and services, lower taxation and higher personal disposable incomes.  The huge gap between current revenue and current expenditure is a direct result of attempts to secure these three objectives simultaneously.</P>
    <P>We have seen in the last few years just how disappointing efforts to meet those three objectives simultaneously have been because we do not attain the objective of lower taxation, we do not attain the objective of higher personal disposable incomes and we do not attain the objective sought after by many of an increased level of public provision of goods and services.  An attempt to meet these three objectives at the same time inevitably gives rise to a failure to meet any one of them and, therefore, the kind of dissatisfaction that we find today among our community.  This House and all of us in it owe it to our communities to explain why that should be the case and to inform our own actions and their expectations accordingly.</P>
    <P>There have been many complaints during the past year about the level which taxation has now reached in this country. Many people feel that we have already gone too far in that direction and that the point of diminishing returns has been reached or even passed in some areas.</P>
    <P>Our tax rates are undoubtedly high. International comparisons show that we are above the average for OECD countries in terms of taxation as a percentage of GDP, despite the fact that our <i>per capita</i> GDP is lower than that in most of these countries.  The situation is aggravated by the narrowness of our tax base, which requires very high rates of tax in particular areas.  To give an example, the fact that we prefer to maintain a zero rate of VAT on a large area of consumer expenditure means that the other VAT rates must be correspondingly higher.  If all goods and services were taxed at one common rate, that rate could be as low as about 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>On the income tax front, the wide range of allowances and reliefs available reduces the tax base and requires higher rates to achieve a given yield.  For example, loan interest relief means that the <Col N="858" /> Exchequer will forego over £80 million in this tax year; the child income tax allowance will reduce tax revenue by over £30 million.  There are extensive reliefs also for businesses &mdash; the export sales relief scheme reduced tax liability by over £100 million in 1981-82, and capital allowances for buildings, plant and machinery are together of a similar order of magnitude.</P>
    <P>There are calls for more reliefs and reduced taxation in other areas.  Yet, collectively, we all want public expenditure maintained, or even increased, although individually we might be prepared to countenance cuts in areas which do not impinge on our own particular interests. The fact of the matter is that as a result of deliberate choices we have narrowed the tax base and yet continue to expect a level of public provision that is more in accordance with what the tax base would be if we had not restricted it in the way we have.</P>
    <P>These moulds of perception will simply have to be broken because we are faced with the objective imperative of reducing Government borrowing.  The necessity for such action should be evident to anybody who makes a serious attempt to analyse our situation.  In 1972-73, the Exchequer borrowing requirement, covering the current budget deficit and the capital borrowing requirement, amounted to 5.8 per cent of GNP.  It reached 17.1 per cent in 1981, and this year will be between 13 per cent and 13½ per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>The current budget deficit, which came to 0.26 per cent of GNP in 1972-73, has risen in all but three years of that period and this year will amount to about 6¾ per cent of our GNP.  During that period borrowing and its consequences have created a growing problem not just for Governments but for the whole community and, in a very real way, for every taxpayer.  By the end of this year our total national debt will be some £15,500 million &mdash; over £4,500 for every citizen of this country.  The service of Exchequer debt will cost some £1,700 million this year, or about 32 per cent of total tax revenue.</P>
    <P>In the absence of corrective action our total debt and our debt service commitments <Col N="859" /> would continue to grow, eating further and further into our current resources and leaving less and less room for manoeuvre in relation to our fundamental requirements.  We cannot allow this to happen.  Our concern with corrective action is directly inspired by our desire to be able to respond to our real problems today and to be able to plan properly for what we know will face us in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>In this connection I cannot stress too much the fact that we know that facing us in the years immediately ahead is an increase of 20,000 every year in the number of people looking for jobs.  We know that they are there and that there will be 20,000 extra next year and another 20,000 the following year and another 20,000 the year after that.  I go back to the point I made earlier: that we must provide employment for those people before we can start to reduce our current level of unemployment.  That is why it is important for us to get control of the public finances.  That is why it is important to reduce our debt servicing commitment. In effect, this means getting back control of the resources we will have in 1984, 1985 and 1986 to deal with the problems and requirements we will have to face in those years.</P>
    <P>As I have said, every citizen, every taxpayer, is involved directly in this problem. The prospects for real relief in the overall weight of taxation depend directly on getting the problem of borrowing under control.  This year we have made a start on that road, and we will continue to follow that course.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out in my budget statement last February, the origins of this dilemma go back about ten years.  Following the massive oil price increase in 1973, we followed the option of maintaining our standard of living by recourse to borrowing rather than adjusting to the reality of the transfer of real resources to the oil producers.  Some efforts were made to redress the situation in the mid-seventies but these were reversed in 1978, despite the relatively favourable economic conditions at the time.  Following the second oil shock of 1979-80, and <Col N="860" /> despite budgets which gave the impression that action was being taken, we actually increased our level of borrowing further.  As a direct result of these failures of policy, we are now in the position of having little or no room for manoeuvre at a time when we most need it.  That is a situation that no Government should contemplate with anything other than a firm determination to get ourselves out of it as quickly as we can.</P>
    <P>What is perhaps the most disturbing feature of those years was that, when the present leader of the Opposition became Taoiseach, he diagnosed the problem correctly &mdash; Deputy Fitzgerald's problems did not seem to exist then &mdash; and went on television to address the nation about the state of the nation's finances. He said, correctly, that &ldquo;we are living beyond our means&rdquo;, that &ldquo;we have been borrowing enormous amounts of money, borrowing at a rate which just cannot continue&rdquo; and that &ldquo;we will have to cut down on Government spending&rdquo;.  But what did he do about it?  Current expenditure in 1980 and 1981 increased by 28 per cent each year, the highest rate of increase ever recorded here.  The Exchequer borrowing requirement increased by over three percentage points of GNP, reaching the highest level recorded of 17 per cent.  If we had not taken action in the supplementary budget in July 1981, when we took office, the EBR for that year would have been even higher.  It was the reversal of the trend in the public finances in 1978 and the inability of the current Leader of the Opposition to implement the policies which he recognised to be necessary which landed us with the massive problem which we face today.</P>
    <P>As I said, we made a start on remedying the position in our July 1981 supplementary budget.  In 1982, the overall Exchequer borrowing requirement was at least kept slightly lower as a percentage of GNP than in 1981, though the current budget deficit still rose to its highest ever level of 8½ per cent of GNP.  In 1983, however, the apparently inexorable worsening in the public finances, inexorable as it had been up to then, has been decisively halted and reversed, an <Col N="861" /> achievement which the EEC Commission has commended in its recently released Annual Economic Report for 1983-84.  It is a significant indication of our careful monitoring of the budget position that this year, for the first time in five years, the actual current budget deficit for the first nine months of the year was below the original budget target for the year as a whole.  This year, for the first time since 1978, the final outturn will be close to the original budget targets.  It will also be the first time since 1977 that a significant reduction in the Exchequer borrowing requirement will have been achieved.</P>
    <P>These are important indicators not only that we want to get the public finances under control but, more importantly, that we are able to set targets and stick reasonably closely to them.  This will re-assure our foreign and domestic creditors that they can rely on this Government to achieve their stated aims.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of discussion during the past year about whether the balance between revenue and expenditure measures in the 1983 budget was the most appropriate.  Undoubtedly the main emphasis in that budget was on increasing revenue, and I readily accept that the level of some particular taxes is now very high.  But the House is aware also that there was significant action on the expenditure side.  The rate of increase in current expenditure was kept far below that achieved for over a decade.  In fact, one must go back as far as 1967-68 to find an increase as low as the 13½ per cent which is emerging for 1983.  I might add that the figure in itself is not a particular cause of satisfaction; it is the trend that is important.  The figure in itself is even less a cause of satisfaction when I recall that the weight of debt service that we must deal with this year means, as I said in my budget statement last February, that in a year when the object of public policy should be to act in a counter-cyclical way, we have not the room to do it as a direct result of what has gone on in the previous five years, if not more.</P>
    <P>Given the faster increase in debt service costs due to the high borrowings in 1982 and the increased take-up of certain <Col N="862" /> services due to demographic and other factors, restricting the overall rate of increase in current expenditure to 13½ per cent was in itself an achievement.  It stops the strong upward trend in current expenditure as a percentage of GNP. More importantly, it is a step towards reducing the escalation of debt and of debt service costs.  It is a step towards regaining control of our own resources, for use to the benefit of our own people.</P>
    <P>This adjustment is a difficult process, but the House can be assured that there will be an honest and systematic rethinking of national priorities &mdash; priorities which became blurred if not indistinguishable in the years when the cost of delivering services rocketed and when every sectional demand was converted into new and expanded expenditure programmes, without any regard to the willingness or capacity of ordinary taxpayers to pay for them either in the short or the long run.</P>
    <P>These, then, are the realities of our situation and they have been confirmed by the EEC Commission.  Anybody who pretends differently is doing grave injustice to our community and to future generations. That goes in particular for those who are now suggesting that some unspecified reflationary measures would be appropriate.  There is, in fact, no alternative to adhering to our current policies. They are the policies which carry with them the best chance of ultimate success and we have already seen them create the basis for this success.</P>
    <P>Within the framework of these policies the Government are, of course, prepared and anxious to assess the balance between different measures in order to ensure the maximum positive economic impact.</P>
    <P>Apart from the decisive stabilisation of the public finances, the improvement in our balance of payments has been little short of dramatic.  In spite of corrective measures in 1981, the balance of payments deficit soared to a peacetime record level of 13½ per cent of GNP leading to heavy losses of reserves which had to be made good by borrowing.  This year, we expect the balance of payments deficit to be under 3 per cent of GNP.  Our trade <Col N="863" /> figures for the first nine months of 1983 confirm this improvement.  In this period, the gap between our merchandise exports and merchandise imports was £380 million, a reduction of £609 million, or over 60 per cent on the corresponding period in 1982.</P>
    <P>The trends in the public finances and external payments are regarded universally as the two most important indicators of the soundness of a country's policies and, therefore, of its credit-worthiness. We have recently benefited from our achievements in these areas by successfully floating substantial loans on the US and UK markets, despite the continuing international financial uncertainty.  In case anybody on the other side of the House might find some apparent inconsistency between that remark and my satisfaction at having been able to raise those loans and what I said earlier about our total borrowing requirements, I would make it very clear that the borrowing requirements of 1983 and the level of our borrowing for 1984 will be entirely consistent with the overall objectives that I have set out that we must achieve in order to give ourselves the leeway to respond next year and in future years to the problems as we meet them in those years.</P>
    <P>Our success in controlling inflation is no less impressive than our achievements on other fronts.  Inflation ran at an annual average rate of 17 per cent between the years 1979-82.  We have reduced this substantially. The consumer price index in the year to mid-August 1983 rose by 10 per cent.  If we exclude the effects of increased indirect taxation which the Government were obliged to introduce to control the public finances, the underlying inflation rate is now well into single figures.</P>
    <P>During the course of his remarks this morning, Deputy Haughey made a reference to inflation and made the point that, in fact, inflation seems to be accelerating. I am not sure how he does his sums, but to my mind a reduction in the rate of inflation from 17 per cent in 1982 to 10 per cent, or 11 per cent which is the range that it will turn out for the year of <Col N="864" /> 1983 is, in my book and in the kind of arithmetic which I have been taught and which I have used, indeed, a reduction in the rate of inflation.  The underlying rate of inflation, as I have said, which we adjust for indirect taxes is well down into single digits and that is progress on that front which no amount of fancy arithmetic is going to gainsay.</P>
    <P>We are proud of our record so far in reducing inflation.  We are determined to reduce it even further to the low levels now prevailing in the stronger industrialised countries.  The achievement of low single-digit inflation is a key element in our overall strategy for restoring competitiveness and for restoring the dynamism necessary to get the economy moving again on a path which will enable us make substantial progress towards reducing unemployment.</P>
    <P>Productive investment and, therefore, job creation are encouraged by the existence of a favourable interest rate structure. We must do all in our power to ensure that our domestic economy is well placed to take full advantage of any favourable international trends in interest rates.  There are occasions when events outside our control, other than a change in the trend of international interest rates, can have a significant short-term effect on domestic interest rates. One such occasion was the period immediately before and immediately after the realignment of currencies within the European Monetary System which took place last March.  The money market pressures associated with that realignment led to a temporary increase in associated bank interest rates but this increase was fully reversed by 1 July last for all borrowers.</P>
    <P>By the third quarter of this year, it was clear that the corrective measures which the Government took at budget time were paying dividends, particularly in the form of the much reduced balance of payments deficit which I have already mentioned.  These policies made it possible for the associated banks further to reduce their interest rates by up to 1¼ percentage points with effect from close of business on 23 September last.  This reduction brought associated bank interest <Col N="865" /> rates down to their lowest level since 1978.</P>
    <P>I welcome this reduction in interest rates as, indeed, does everybody connected with business or the provision of employment here and I hope that it will lead to an increase in the level of productive investment without which we could not hope to create the jobs needed to solve our unemployment problem. Government policy is designed to ensure that domestic interest rates can be reduced as quickly as possible to a level consistent with a balanced economy and the level of international interest rates. Therefore, as we restore financial balance to the economy over the coming years, we will be creating a climate which should allow a level of domestic interest rates below that which would otherwise prevail.  For the moment, the scope for further reductions in interest rates is mainly dependent on a resumption of the downward trend in international interest rates.</P>
    <P>The marked improvement in our balance of payments deficit this year has also facilitated a significant increase in our official external reserves.  At 30 September last these reserves stood at £1,914 million, an increase of £320 million on their end of 1982 level of £1,594 million. At this level, our official external reserves are the equivalent of well over one-quarter of the estimated cost of our merchandise imports for the whole of 1983. We are now in a position where we are better insured by the level of our external reserves than we have been for many years.</P>
    <P>An aspect of the turn-around in our balance of payments which deserves special mention in looking at the domestic economy is the performance of industrial exports.  Last year, despite world recession, these exports rose by almost 11 per cent in volume terms.  So far this year, they have equalled that achievement and it is reflected to a considerable extent in the trend in manufacturing output so far. In the period from January to July last, manufacturing output rose by 5 per cent on the corresponding period of 1982.  I must say that I derive an extra degree of satisfaction from this statistic because, <Col N="866" /> after I had pointed to the growth in manufacturing output in the course of the Adjournment Debate in this House on I July last, I was accused of playing fast and loose with the figures.  I am glad to be able to say that my objective assessment of the situation at that time has been borne out by subsequent developments. I might also point out, in passing, that if anybody is playing fast and loose with figures it must be he who today sees the change from 17 per cent in 1982 to 11 per cent in 1983 as an increase, or something going in the wrong direction.  I stick to my guns.</P>
    <P>These heartening trends in industrial output and exports are an indication of what we can achieve when world recovery gathers momentum.  So far, the base of the renewed growth in output is a narrow one, although it is widening.  But if we act to secure it, there is no reason why the recovery now under way in certain sectors of industry could not be quickly extended and accelerated to embrace all aspects of economic activity. We would then achieve a dramatic improvement in the employment and investment situation.</P>
    <P>The opportunities open to us are expanding with the recovery in the world economy which is now becoming increasingly evident.  Recently, I attended the annual general meeting of the IMF in Washington and was struck by the mood of cautious optimism about the world economy which had replaced the gloom that was prevalent a year earlier.  The consensus at that meeting was that, for most of the major economies, the recovery phase has set in.  There are, of course, doubts about the sustainability of the recovery, particularly as many of the difficulties which prolonged the recession have yet to be resolved.  However, it is clear that there is a widening appreciation among the major trading countries of the world of the degree of interdependence between all of our economies.  A recession, in fact, is something which to the analytical observer will bring home that fact very quickly.  I am confident that that increased appreciation of our interdependence will assist us in having economic policies in major trading countries <Col N="867" /> cast in a mould which will allow us to benefit from the expansion in their activities. That in itself should tend to support the recovery which is now emerging.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn to some of the statements made earlier in the debate.  I have mentioned one or two of them.  The Leader of the Opposition said that practically every indicator points downwards. I cannot see how he can possibly sustain that kind of remark in view of the factors which I have been outlining.  This year we had a net improvement in the level of manufacturing output.  We had an extremely good performance this year in the level of industrial exports.</P>
    <P>The gentlemen and ladies on the benches opposite often accuse people on this side of the House of doom and gloom.  They excel any performance of doom and gloom there has ever been when, in the face of a pick-up in manufacturing output and exports and an improvement in our balance of payments situation of the kind I have outlined, they can see indicators pointing in the wrong direction.  They are indulging their long-standing talent for looking the other way and not seeing what is going on in our economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey also said the fall in the balance of payments deficit reflects a decline in economic acitvity.  He is partly right, but it also reflects an improvement in our export performance.  I should like to draw attention to some of the things pointed out in the quarterly report of the Central Bank published today in relation to our balance of payments deficit.  I should like, if I may, to read a passage from it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;which will illustrate what I am saying.  It has very important implications for the way we manage economic policy from here on.  On page 6 they say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in relation to the balance-of-payments deficit, while undoubtedly encouraging at present, is partly dependent on certain factors <Col N="868" /> which could well be transient.  The deficit will begin to deteriorate again as imports resume a more normal relationship with domestic demand; as the latter expands, partly as a result of a reversal of the recent rise in the savings ratio; and as oil and other commodity prices respond to international economic recovery.  The resumption in foreign investment in Ireland, which it is hoped will accompany the international upturn, while ultimately beneficial to the economy, will provide an immediate boost to imports.</P>
    <P>I wanted to quote that because it is very relevant to our situation and to the course of our policy from here on.  The paragraph concludes as follows:</P>
    <P>There remains, therefore, an underlying balance-of-payments problem and a corresponding need on that account to persevere in the process of restructuring the economy on a more competitive basis.</P>

      <P>It will.  The second paragraph on page 7 reads:</P>
      <P>Restoring balance to the public finances is not an end in itself.</P>
      <P>I could have written this passage myself, but I have not got the pleasure of working for the Central Bank.  It goes on:</P>
      <P>It is a necessary means of avoiding the pre-emption of resources that would otherwise be available in future for employment in both the public and private sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will be my concluding reflection.  I have been concerned today and for the past ten months to point out that balance in our public finances is not something we seek for the sake of elegance of presentation or for any accounting reasons. Fundamentally we need it to get our hands free so that year to year we can <Col N="869" /> deal with the problems which arise.  I have pointed out the one the Government believe to be the most pressing of all.</P>

      <P>I am arriving at finality. We must make sure that we do not follow a path of current expenditure, current consumption and not very selective capital investment which would very seriously endanger our ability to provide employment for our young people.  I submit to the House that that was tried from 1977 until 1982, with a short interruption in 1981 and the early part of 1982.  That policy has failed and has put us into the difficult position we are in today.  We will not continue that kind of policy because that is not what the country expects from us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Tánaiste's opening statement this morning and to the Minister for Finance just now, and I regret to say I do not see much cause for hope.  The Government's policies have failed over the past year. We have high taxation and a rate of VAT which is doing damage to one of our major industries, the tourist industry, and to many businesses in the Border areas in particular.  We still have a high level of borrowing.  To hear the truth from those in positions of responsibility would give confidence to people outside. It is important that the people should be told the truth about borrowing.</P>
      <P>Borrowing started in 1973 on a high scale and reached as high as 16½ per cent of our GNP in 1975.  It did not start with Fianna Fáil Governments.  It was started by the Coalition Government in 1973 on an unprecedented scale.  The Minister told us inflation was going down and he took pride in his contribution to bringing it down.  On page 8 of the Central Bank Quarterly Bulletin published this morning it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reduction in the rate of inflation which had been taking place since early <Col N="870" /> 1982 ceased and, indeed, the rate has begun to rise again.</P>
    <P>They project 11 per cent inflation by the end of the year.  There is nothing about single figures and nothing about inflation coming down.  They say that inflation, which had begun to come down when Fianna Fáil were in office, is now rising again.  I contend that is a direct result of the policies pursued by this Government.</P>
    <P>This morning the Construction Industry Federation made a submission to members of this House.  They said the most alarming feature is the prospect for the proximate future and that all the indicators point to further decline unless there is a change in Government policy. Nobody can suggest that they are here on the Opposition benches making those statements which the Minister for Finance is not prepared to accept.</P>
    <P>Many people have no confidence in the Government.  Many of them are unable to meet their commitments as a result of the Government's policies.  We are told disposable income is down by 3 per cent. Members of local authorities are well aware of the unprecedented number of people who are unable to meet their repayments to local authorities.  The policy the Government embarked on has done nothing to deal with the problems they set out to deal with.  The Taoiseach made it clear earlier this year that the policies they were pursuing were diametrically opposed to those necessary to create jobs and to create employment. At column 841, Volume 342, of the Official Report of 11 May 1983 the Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>The fourth factor affecting our employment situation has been the deterioration in our public finances. Given the scale of unemployment and the fact that much, but not all, of it is determined by external events, government should, in the face of the resulting crisis, seek to alleviate the problem by reducing taxes, stimulating domestic growth and creating employment opportunities where there is necessary infrastructural work to be done, whether it be road building, housing, the construction of schools, the development <Col N="871" /> of telecommunications and so on.  No Irish Government, whoever they might be, can at this time take such action on an adequate scale because the public finances are in such disorder that the maintenance of public solvency requires action diametrically opposed to that which the employment situation demands.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Taoiseach, he made it clear that at that time the creation of employment was far down on his list of priorities.  We contend that the creation of employment should be the first priority of Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance spoke about lower bank interest rates and said he hoped they would lead to productive investments.  The first thing people need for productive investment is confidence in the Government.  I regret to say the people do not have confidence in this Government not only because of the policies being pursued but because they are reading all the time about disagreements between the parties which make up the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Consumer spending is down.  The Central Bank Report this morning stated that the fall in the volume of domestic demand in 1983 was estimated to be somewhat greater than previously expected and that the volume of both investment activity and consumer spending, the main components of domestic demand, are now expected to fall back to the lowest level for several years.  When the Minister was quoting from the Central Bank Report he seemed to have overlooked that paragraph.</P>
    <P>Since this Government took office the unemployment rate has increased by 33,000.  In September 1982 there were 169,000 people unemployed and in September 1983 there are 193,000 unemployed. We are now facing the winter months when we can expect those figures to rise even higher.  In May 1983 when the Taoiseach told us the policies he was pursuing were diametrically opposite to those needed to create jobs, we had 15 per cent of the civilian working population <Col N="872" /> unemployed, the highest percentage in Europe.</P>
    <P>There are more than 20,000 young people coming on the labour market every year.  Nothing we heard today from the Government benches will instil any confidence in the Government.  The Tánaiste recognised the seriousness of the unemployment situation, the serious socio-economic implications and the serious social problems created for those unfortunate enough not to be able to find work, but he offered no real solution.</P>
    <P>Government policies have contributed in many ways to the fact that jobs are not available.  Manufacturers, those in business and those who might set up businesses are deterred by high taxation, high rates of PRSI and the number of levies charged.  They are afraid to take the opportunity to start up a business or to employ more people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey said this morning and on another occasion that there should be a reflationary policy.  He suggested that the rates of duty on such items as spirits, petrol and electrical goods should be reduced.  He was criticised for that by the Taoiseach on an earlier occasion and he was criticised here this morning.  If one lived north of the Boyne in any of the Border counties one would realise how right he was.  There are people living in the Border areas who have not bought a gallon of petrol on this side of the Border since the last budget.  If one crosses the Border one will see many motorists from the Republic queueing at the petrol stations. Whiskey sales have decreased 60 per cent in the Border areas since 1981. It is estimated that as a result of electrical goods being bought in the Six Counties £50 million is lost to the State, apart altogether from the money lost to the business houses in the Border towns.</P>
    <P>All the towns along the Border are feeling the economic depression.  In County Monaghan in December 1982 64,900 gallons of petrol were sold on the forecourts of garages and in April 1983 that figure had dropped to 19,100 gallons. That is an indication of the effects of this Governments' taxation policy on business on this side of the Border and in loss of revenue to the State.  Deputy Haughey <Col N="873" /> was right when he said that if petrol were the same price on both sides of the Border it would no longer be attractive for people to cross the Border so often because when they are in the Six Counties they purchase many more goods.  It is estimated by the Border traders, from Donegal to Louth, that £150 million in revenue is lost to the State as a result of cross-Border trade.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons that no action is taken to correct this situation is that, for the first time in the history of the State, there is no Minister from a Border constituency at the Cabinet table.  I am sure that you yourself, a Cheann Comhairle, when you were a Minister in previous Governments made many contributions concerning the special problems obtaining along the Border.  Not having that input at the Cabinet table has resulted in a very serious situation not only for the economy of the Border counties but for the State itself in high loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>We heard at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis at the weekend that the Government had reduced VAT on hotel charges.  But it must be remembered that it was the present Government who increased the rate of VAT from 18 per cent to 23 per cent and two months later reduced VAT on hotel accommodation to 18 per cent &mdash; in other words, it was their own 5 per cent they reduced after two months when they saw how wrong they were.  But they did not reduce the rate of VAT to 18 per cent on the cost of food in hotels.  The tourist and hotel industry is suffering not alone from the high rate of VAT but also from the high rate of duty on petrol and spirits.</P>
    <P>The Government's record in the health field has nothing to recommend it in almost 12 months since assuming office. The House will remember that last year the outgoing Government fell as a result of a vote of confidence brought about because of the removal of 900 items from the general medical services prescribing list.  The present parties in Government promised that they would review those 900 items, which they did.  The result of that review was not to restore those 900 items to the general medical services prescribing list but rather to add another 274 <Col N="874" /> items to the list of drugs not allowed under the general medical services.  In their deliberations at Barretstown in the third week of July this year the Minister for Health stated that he hoped to save another £13 million on the current Estimate for Health in 1983.  By way of parliamentary question I asked him how he proposed to save those £13 million.  The answer I received, on 19 October, was that the savings on the Health Vote were to be achieved by a combination of the following: buoyancy in receipts from health contributions, collection of arrears of health contributions from farmers and extra receipts under EEC regulations.  To the extent that these measures fall short of the overall savings to be achieved it was stated that other adjustments in the Health Vote would be necessary.  At this stage of the year the general consensus in the country is that receipts from health contributions will fall short of the amount the Minister expected to collect.  It appears that before the end of the year there may be even further hardship imposed on those dependent on the health services.</P>
    <P>The Government's hospital policy shows no sensitivity whatever to the needs of people, particularly those in rural areas.  For example, at present there is a situation in Bantry in which the Government, through the Southern Health Board, have closed the maternity unit in the hospital there and women are being asked to travel instead to a hospital 110 miles away.  That illustrates a total lack of sensitivity to the needs of such people.  One does not have to advance any other argument, because to suggest that a maternity hospital facility some 110 miles away is satisfactory is ludicrous. There are no circumstances, economic or otherwise, under which one could justify that type of decision.</P>
    <P>Then there is the situation in Dundalk Hospital where there is a very active maternity unit and where the county surgeon retired.  He was a product of older times when the county physician and surgeon acted together to run an obstetric unit.  That is unacceptable in 1983.  Again, the Minister has refused to appoint an obstetrician to Dundalk Hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="875" /> There is also the situation in our own constituency, a Cheann Comhairle, in which for no good reason whatever the hospital in Cavan has not been proceeded with.  The Minister asked the health board to close the adjoining hospital in Monaghan &mdash; to arrange to have it closed and sold &mdash; and that that would not take place for perhaps five or even ten years until the Cavan Hospital was built.  That letter was issued on 9 June last.  That was the first anybody heard of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise it merely to indicate the type of bungling going on with this Government, which I believe to <Col N="876" /> be the root cause of the problems obtaining in our economy.</P>
      <P>I might move on to the area of social welfare where the same thing applies &mdash; promises from the Government, promises of a family income supplement made so often by the Taoiseach himself and by various Ministers.  We were promised we would have it in September but, again at the meeting in Barretstown, we were told that it would not be forthcoming until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>In a debate on the economy it is reasonable to draw attention to the difficulties people are experiencing because politics is all about people.  A caring Government should be concerned with people and their problems.  Five million pounds was allocated for the family income supplement scheme last February.  If even that amount had been divided among the 120,000 families, each would have got only £4.89 per week, not a lot of money in these difficult times.  But the Government were not able to manage even that: they postponed it until, they say, the end of the year.  At the moment we have no indication that it will be paid at the end of the year.</P>
      <P>Children are a low priority with the Government.  There has not been an increase in children's allowances to compensate for the difficult situation that exists.  This year people were not paid the dependants' allowances in September, which had been allocated in previous years to help parents to get their children back to school.  With rising costs and school bus charges it was more necessary this year than ever before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to all members of the Government, but particularly the Minister for Social Welfare, to allocate a double allowance to each social welfare recipient next Christmas as has been the practice for a number of years.  It must be remembered that this year the increases in social welfare benefits were less than at any time in the past five or six years recipients received only 12 per cent and 10 per cent respectively in benefits and assistance. The increases were over a nine-month period, not a 12-month period as in the past.  The Government have a responsibility to ensure that at least at Christmas <Col N="877" /> these people will be able to enjoy a little extra as in previous years.  In response to pressure from the House before the recess, the Minister increased some unemployment assistance by 5 per cent from the beginning of October but that, on top of the earlier 10 per cent, brought the increase up to only 8¼ per cent in a 12-month period.  We were told this morning by the Central Bank that inflation will be 11 per cent by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>The plight of small farmers on the west coast is a matter of serious concern.  They live in very poor circumstances because of their totally uneconomic holdings.  In the Social Welfare Bill this year the Government abolished the notional system of assessment in respect of small farmers.  One does not have to be a social welfare officer and to go to west Donegal to see the difficulties being suffered by small farmers.  Those people, on very poor land, have raised the finest families this country has seen.  In 1966 Fianna Fáil, in Government, introduced the notional system of assessment to ensure that those smallholders would have a little supplementary income to help them to stay on their farms and to rear their families.  These supplementary benefits also ensured that they would not be discouraged from increasing production, because if such people had increased their production their cases would have been re-investigated and their supplementary incomes decreased.  The present Government have been using as an excuse the High Court ruling on PLV to abolish the notional system.  If the PLV system was unconstitutional, surely there were other ways the Government could have used to pay unemployment assistance to those small farmers.</P>
    <P>In reply to a question in the House recently the Minister stated that 906 people have ceased to be entitled to any unemployment assistance as a result of this decision, and 1,213 people had their payments reduced.  This has happened since the February budget, and many of those people will have had their incomes assessed at a time when their incomes were at their highest because many of them have a few cows and were sending <Col N="878" /> milk to the creameries.  In the winter months they will not have milk to send to the creameries and now they will face new difficulties.</P>
    <P>We appeal to the Government to show their concern and ensure that as many as possible will stay on smallholdings, that they can survive there and rear their families, as they did in the past.  But today we have not heard anything worthwhile offered to the people outside who have lost confidence, particularly the unemployed, the young people coming on the labour market for the first time.  I appeal to the Government to be more caring and to create employment so that unemployment figures will be reduced in the coming months.  The Government have a responsibility as well to those who depend on social welfare for their existence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I will start with a little story which might bring some relevance to the Opposition benches.  About this time last year they proposed for 1983 that the desirable current budget deficit would be 5.5 per cent of GNP.  That would mean a figure of about £730 million.  What source did such a draconian proposal come from?  Was it from a savage Department of Finance memo, from an insensitive Fine Gael Minister sounding off his own private personal viewpoint, or even Deputy John Kelly?  It was not.  Such a draconian proposal for the 1983 current budget deficit came from the Fianna Fáil <i>The Way Forward,</i> which clearly laid down that the current budget deficit for 1983 would be £165 million less than the Government target in February this year. It is interesting to look at the documentation. The Book of Estimates published last November shows that what was required when the sum was added up was extra taxation, when you include buoyancy, of £250 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here we see again the party of the hurler on the ditch, the party of incompatible exhortations in relation to the economy.  They agree that borrowing must be reduced and that the Exchequer borrowing requirement must be kept within confines, yet they look for reductions in taxation.  They wish to reflate the <Col N="879" /> economy but do not wish to have any cuts in expenditure.  These are totally irreconcilable suggestions.  Their proposals and their policies not only lack any lustre but also lack any credibility.</P>
    <P>We have seen the inconsistencies and the U-turns since 1979 and this makes it very hard to stomach verbiage such as we heard this morning from the Leader of the Opposition.  He blamed everything on the Government and failed to identify the international recession as a major factor, something he would readily have identified were he on this side of the House.  He also failed to identify our unique dependency ratio of approximately 70 per cent and the fact that 48 per cent of our population are under 25 years of age and, more significantly, 31 per cent are under 15 years of age.  He failed to mention that we inherited a legacy of a national debt of £15.5 billion and that debt service this year will amount to £1,700 million.  He omitted to mention that we have been in office for only ten months and failed to recall that inflation in that short period has dropped from 17 per cent to 11 per cent, that interest rates have dropped by 4.5 per cent and that we have achieved the most moderate pay settlement in the Public Service during the past four or five years, despite higher settlements in the private sector.</P>
    <P>There is also the specific development initiated by the Government towards Dáil and Public Service reform, the establishment of the Planning Board and the sectoral committees, all of which will be adjudged in the future.  Deputy Haughey also failed to acknowledge that for the first time in four years Government finances are under control and that what we say is what we mean in terms of the budget deficit.  We are not consulting ourselves out of existence or being muddled into a consensus which results in avoiding the issues which must be tackled.</P>
    <P>Every speaker I have heard has referred to the problem of unemployment, now standing at 200,000 or 16 per cent of the work force.  In October 1979 the figure was 82,600 or 6.1 per cent.  At present the average rate of unemployment <Col N="880" /> in the EEC is 10 per cent.  We need to create 30,000 jobs per annum to stand still at an unemployment rate of about 15 per cent.  To revert to the level of the mid-seventies we would have to create 40,000 jobs per annum.</P>
    <P>Before suggesting the methods that should be adopted to deal with this problem, we should look at some of the deceptive policies and short-term expedients adopted by Fianna Fáil.  Between 1977 and 1981 Public and Civil Service recruitment amounted to 24,000 people.  Our local health board employed people for whom real jobs were not available and subsequently their role and responsibilities have had to be teased out.  Is this a solution to our unemployment problem? The tax increases which were necessary to pay for these newly created jobs caused an equal number of job losses in other sectors.  In this time of deep recession the Government cannot pursue a policy that will allow investment because of the expenditure needed as a result of this recruitment.  We are trying to sustain the unsustainable because we cannot get rid of these people.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil were very keen on the expansion and creation of industries in the semi-State sector.  In 1982 total losses in this sector amounted to £700 million. Only two semi-State bodies, Irish Life and the ICC, are making any profit.  CIE, NET, Irish Shipping, Irish Steel and the Sugar Company are all making a loss.  We hear from the Opposition benches, now empty, that we should re-open Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Would they put their own money into it?  It is because we have moved so far away from this criterion that we have created jobs just for the sake of jobs and ignored the real world.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil also say that we should reflate the economy.  There are two standard ways of doing this, either by increasing spending in the capital or current programme or by giving tax reliefs which will give a stimulus to the economy.  The reality is that 50p in every £ released into the economy will be spent on imported products, creating economic growth in other countries.</P>
    <P>Another Fianna Fáil policy is to pump the construction industry.  Nobody can <Col N="881" /> deny that this sector has suffered more than any other in this recession.  What kind of construction do we want to encourage?  In the industrial area we already have three million square feet lying idle in advance factories.  Yet we have requests to the construction industry to put more money into bricks and mortar that will only add to our long-term debt and for which there will be no immediate use, given the amount of spare capacity.  What of the housing sector?  At present the greatest inhibiting factor is that the subvention under the differential rents scheme is such that so much money is being swallowed up in paying for houses already built that we cannot provide housing for young people.  By pumping barometers of the economy such as the construction industry or the services area we are only tackling the symptoms rather than the root cause of the problem. Our economic and fiscal policies are designed to eliminate the root causes of the problem, as opposed to tinkering with the symptoms as suggested by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>It behoves me now to suggest policies which will bear fruit.  We must create an environment for private investment, given that employment can be sustained through viable and profitable production. You cannot go very far down the road without stating where the problems are to date.  Our electricity is 40 per cent dearer than the European average, telecommunication charges are 30 per cent dearer than the European average, we have seen the IRFU and the Sugar Company when they want to post large numbers of letters going to the North where a stamp only costs 12 pence.  Those with telex machines and sister companies in Britain find it cheaper to telex the message across and to relay it to the British office rather than to send it direct from here.  The essential cost inputs to production are out of line.</P>
    <P>When we get down to analysing how to solve this problem we will need a ruthless reappraisal of the State service sector. Are they self-serving or serving the exposed sector of the economy which may not be able to pass on the charges to their customers?  Are we more concerned <Col N="882" /> about the long-term employment which they serve or the employment within those sectors?  I suggest that we must analyse the cause and effect of these semi-State bodies.  We must ask if a monopoly is the best role for these State services?  Could anyone else in the private sector do a better, more efficient and cheaper job?  No number of consultants' reports will say anything else &mdash; we must look seriously at the privatisation of our infrastructure and our semi-State bodies because they are under such pressure now that we cannot attempt to effect a transition whereby we would try to create the kind of climate which would attract internationally mobile investment that we so desperately need.  If I had a vision, or if the Government had a long term objective, it would be that we should try to create a mecca for international mobile investment at whatever criteria they set down, whether it is more flexible labour legislation or a private, efficient infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Bank rates are the other crippling factor which no business can get away from. Interest rates are affected by three basic factors, firstly, supply and demand, that is the number of investors and the number of people wishing to borrow money; secondly, the current inflation rate which is 12 per cent.  People investing their money are at least entitled to 12 per cent so that they do not lose money.  The third factor is international free market rates. This is a classic example of getting to the root causes as opposed to the symptoms. The Government's economic policies which have caused deflation have helped to meet that second objective.  Moreover, by reducing our Exchequer borrowing requirement we have slackened the demand on the money markets and now we are able to avail of the overall reduction in international interest rates and we can now meet them.  We do not have to shore up our currency with external reserves and put ourselves in a position where we have to maintain artificially high interest rates because the fundamental aspect of Government fiscal policies are out of line.  We have corrected that and we have seen a 4½ per cent or 5 per cent drop in interest rates subsequently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="883" /> I should like to see specific improvements which would help in relation to employment.  There is no doubt that the tax which is most inhibiting the development of the industrial sector is VAT at the point of importation.  However, we must be realistic about this.  The Government are not in a position to write off £140 million of tax revenue.  The Confederation of Irish Industry, the FUE or representatives of business should renegotiate with the Revenue Commissioners and the Government in relation to this matter which is really a loan from industry to the Government of £140 million. Let us do away with red tape.  Let us be blunt and frank and raise a loan from industry and work out a mechanism whereby we would pay it and do away with all the red tape at the ports.  If we cannot go along with that, we must realise that some people who are importing raw materials do not know whether their cargo will come into Rosslare, Greenore, Cork, Dún Laoghaire or Dublin and they have to run around like lunatics with bank drafts to try to accommodate whatever VAT office is dealing with it.  There should at least be one central office in which to lodge a bank draft which will cover any cargo importation and which would greatly help industrialists.</P>
    <P>In relation to import penetration, there needs to be a vast improvement in the State purchasing mechanisms.  I understand from business associates that there was something like £360 million in contracts for goods and services bought by the State and the semi-State sector in 1982 that are directly available from Irish manufacturers.  I wish to quote the case of a firm in my own constituency, Dalton Tag Supplies, who have serviced the British Ministry of Agriculture and the French Ministry of Agriculture and have been successful in obtaining many international contracts for ear tags.  They tendered to the Department of Agriculture but some British contractor got the contract instead.  There is no discreet mechanism through the State purchasing systems to give Irish people a fair chance. That must be changed.  Furthermore, there is a need to cop on in terms of <Col N="884" /> technical trade barriers.  Yet again in my constituency I know a company that produce household electrical cables.  They had £326,000 worth of business in Northern Ireland which was cut off over-night through the implementation of a BASEC standard by the British authorities which completely outlawed, in a technical way, their products.  The quality of the wires had to be of a BASEC standard, they protected their own producers and suppliers by this standard.  We have an IMEC standard here, through the IIRS.  We must implement this in such a way so as not to contravene any principles of free trade or any aspects of our Community involvement.  We must do it in a way which is effective and which matches that of our partners.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the enterprise grant scheme which has not yet been finalised or agreed but I understand from the Department of Labour that grants will be paid to those who are unemployed and who have creative talents which are going to waste at present.  I hope the Youth Employment Agency will meet the needs of young, unemployed people and that the Department of Labour will cater for the needs of the long-term unemployed sector.  In this desperate time of unemployment I cannot see why the environment and improvement schemes cannot be re-organised in such a way as to provide emergency employment schemes.  We have many needs for physical developments; we need urban renewal.  In rural areas there is a need for the development of heritage parks or other tourist amenities.  The environmental improvement scheme should be reorganised &mdash; at present 60 per cent of the cost must be put up &mdash; to provide jobs in unemployment black spots.  It should apply to areas where the unemployment rate exceeds 16 per cent of the work force.  Those on assistance should be paid the rate of benefit and given their stamps. That is the only way they will get off the bottom rung of the subsistence ladder.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need to tackle the redistribution of our work load.  In terms of job sharing &mdash; not work sharing &mdash; we should split the hours, the wages and taxation.  There should be a special incentive <Col N="885" /> to reduce PRSI without loss of entitlements.  Part-time work suits many people but they are forced to retain their employment on a full-time basis.  We can meet the needs of those seeking employment and those anxious to do part-time work if we reduce PRSI for those on job sharing.  In many cases job sharing would be an added benefit to employers.  We should invoke a special taxation clause whereby lump sums and gratuities on retirement which are not subject to tax at present will be taxed on a sliding scale after an employee reaches 60 years of age.  At 60 people should be entitled to take their money and go tax free.  Thereafter there should be a rising scale of taxation on the lump sum and the routine tax on pensions.  That would encourage people to retire early and take up part-time work for voluntary organisations and so on.  We must remember that we have twice the number of young people entering the labour market as there are retiring and we must do something about that.</P>
    <P>In productive terms exports are the key to our future.  In a free trading concept we must improve our marketing if we are to increase our wealth and raise our standard of living instead of the Government falsely pumping it.  We must have competitive export credit finance.  I was shocked to hear from one of the largest industrial engineering firms about Government facilities for export credit finance.  At present there are HP arrangements for a purchaser abroad who is buying a product.  The rate at present is 12 per cent while France and other countries are quoting 8 per cent.  We must get our act together in regard to exports.  I have discussed the matter with the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Cluskey, and I hope the White Paper on Industry will contain a plan for competitive export credit finance.</P>
    <P>We should employ unemployed graduates and send them to specific firms to promote exports in China, Greece and other parts of the world.  We should not rule out, as Tony O'Reilly said about quality sales, the brand name idea.  We should not be afraid to get the best and pay certain people £1 million to promote <Col N="886" /> a certain product on the export market. Our products, such as Baileys Irish Cream, are excellent but we do not have the international markets for them.</P>
    <P>I am Chairman of the new Joint Committee on Small Businesses and in the course of any debates the House may have on the economy I intend to refer to its activities.  No sector of our economy has been crucified as much or had its feathers plucked so often as the small business community.  We need a major shift in attitude towards them.  I should like to give the House some examples of the way they are being screwed.  On taxation I should like to point out that the creation of one job in the Revenue Commissioners creates ten jobs in industry because they have to keep pace with the mass of red tape related to PAYE, PRSI and VAT returns.  If we create one job in the industrial engineering sector we create one in the service sector but not so in regard to tax collection.  The reality is that the whole system in relation to a simplified tax regime is out of control and has led to additional costs for this unpaid third party who acts between the employee and the Revenue Commissioners. A substantial change is needed in that sphere.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the trade union movement.  At local branch level they go to the wealthiest businesses, the most viable and profitable ones employing many people, and extract an increase of about 12 per cent and that figure is sought from all small businesses even though they may not be able to keep pace.  We need a shift in attitudes towards small businesses who, leaving aside the public service, provide 90 per cent of the jobs here.  In terms of costs such as bank charges, electricity and telecommunications charges, the big business concerns are able to negotiate special deals whether they involve EIB money, relief for special use of electricity or other matters. Small business concerns must be given a new deal to take account of their problems.</P>
    <P>The first action of the new joint committee was to invite submissions from the public or organisations wishing to make a contribution to the development of the <Col N="887" /> small business sector in our economy.  I hope people will respond to that request and will view the joint committee as a focal point to which they can address their grievances, problems, suggestions and proposals.  I hope we can be a lobbying power greater than any specific interest group.  I hope the proposal of the association for small firms for the establishment of a small firms investment corporation to provide equity or venture capital will be accepted.  Such a corporation should review the existing loan schemes which are very tight for small business men.  There should be some rationalisation and co-ordination of the 27 State agencies that relate to the business sector.  They should be enveloped into county development teams or into a one-stop agency operating through an agency such as the IDA.  Something will have to be done so that business men can carry out their dealings at one centre and not spend a lot of their time chasing officials. I hope the new joint committee plays an important part in the development of that sector of our economy.</P>
    <P>I should like to stress the need for an indigenous development plan.  In the area of the IDA and industrial investment we have got our act together in terms of industrial policy.  There are certain contradictions in our economic policy, capital gains tax, capital grants, PRSI and subsidised wages, but our industrial policy is in order.  However, in the area of fisheries, forestry and agriculture we have not got our act together.  There is no co-ordination between the primary producers, the multi-nationals and the retailers, and that has led to problems of continuous supply, quality control and economies of scale.  That is why we have seen so many failures in this sector.  If a national development corporation is to have any role it should be to look at the area of indigenous development, exploiting to the full the potential of our natural resources and utilising them in a planned way to overcome gluts and scarcities of items such as potatoes, fruit and vegetables, fish and so on.  We should work in a co-ordinated way to ensure the full <Col N="888" /> development of our natural indigenous sector.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the initiation by the Youth Employment Agency of the community and youth enterprise programme. This is the first time the agency has moved away from training and the overcoming of the transition of young people from school to work.  It is now the intention of the agency to go further and try to create jobs.  This type of self help attitude is what we need and I wish that programme well.</P>
    <P>During the summer there have been two very important developments in relation to our economy.  One was a positive development and one was verging on disaster: the latter was the super-levy and the former was the oil find.  I wish to make a few comments on both matters.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus in this House and in the country on the reasons we entered the EEC.  We entered the Community on the basis of three underlying principles that are now being torn up.  They were: free trade &mdash; we have seen what we have lost in terms of imports of industrial products; open competition in any sector among all member states; and the development of the poorer regions.  The super-levy runs counter to all those principles. There is no way any Irish Government or anyone in the country could attempt to say it was fair.</P>
    <P>If we say that our payment of the levy would be £100 million &mdash; I have seen forecasts of £120 million &mdash; our contribution to the levy would be 10 per cent of the total.  That percentage from a country that produces only 4.5 per cent of total milk production in the EEC is most iniquitous and unfair.  Even the suggestion of this proposal on 28 July means that the future of 17,000 jobs in the dairying and beef processing sectors will be put in jeopardy, that 50 per cent of family farms which are the backbone of rural Ireland will be put in jeopardy because of their dependence on milk or beef. Moreover, this proposal takes no account of the latent human misery of people who, since 1981, either have changed their method of farming from dry stock or tillage to dairying or whose herds have <Col N="889" /> been annihilated by TB or brucellosis and whose output decreased but subsequently improved on the 1981 base or those who have increased their output and production.  What future is there for those people if the levy of 70p in the gallon is imposed over and above the 1981 quota?</P>
    <P>The Government must adopt the attitude through diplomatic initiatives or whatever political means are open to them to get to the root causes of the problem.  They are the importation of fats and oils which are producing the surplus and an effort to deal with the milk factories in Denmark and Holland.  The cows in those countries never see the light of day: they are fed on concentrated imported foods that are adding to the balance of payments problems of the Community in general.  There has been no attempt to tackle that aspect.</P>
    <P>The Government must look for a derogation on the basis that this can be applicable to us only when we reach a certain quota per cow per annum &mdash; let it be 1,000 gallons per cow per annum &mdash; or a quota that is equivalent to the EEC average.  That is the only way we can get parity.  It is the only way to ensure the development of the poorer regions of the Community and ensure that we have free trade and open competition.  I commend the Government on their attitude to date.  It is very simple to say that we use the veto but we must get an increase from 1 per cent to 1.4 per cent of VAT own resources.  We cannot be simplistic about the matter.  It is a matter of vital national interest and is non-negotiable.</P>
    <P>The oil find is basically good news but a few factors have been overlooked. From the indications to date there is nothing to suggest that the find is anything more significant in cash terms than the Kinsale gas find.  While we welcome that contribution to the economy, it has not solved all our problems.  We should temper any great expectations with that kind of realism.  We can learn a salutary lesson from the Kinsale gas find.  The last thing we should do with our oil is to give it at a cheap rate to certain sections of the economy who then lose money on the project.  We should exploit it to its maximum <Col N="890" /> cash potential and use the cash thereafter as opposed to propping up NET in Cork.</P>
    <P>If the find is small, a total of 40 or 50 million barrels, that would have a production flow level of only 14,000 barrels per day.  Given that our national requirement is 90,000 barrels per day, a small find might not be commercially viable and would not be significant or solve our problems.  However, if it was a medium size find, between 150 million or 200 million barrels, there would be reason for optimism in relation to our balance of payments and to our revenue sources. We should not follow the road of Mexico or Norway where they ended up with a debt-ridden economy, where all their revenues created by the oil find have been repaid to foreign bankers and where they have ended up with no extra production from their natural resources or their manufacturing base.  Neither should we do what Britain did and basically use the money to pay the dole with a lower degree of net manufacturing output.</P>
    <P>We have two options.  We can go for higher rates of taxation, as was done in Norway, that will spread out the life of the oil find and its exploration or we can be less punitive in terms of taxation and ensure that the maximum exploration work goes ahead and that the oil is brought ashore.  I do not see this oil find as a bonanza for Whitegate.  I define Whitegate as a machine where you put in £10 notes and £9 comes out.  Whitegate is run down and it needs extensive modernisation if it is to have a meaningful role in relation to our oil find.  In the final analysis, we must use the money in a conservative and effective way to ensure that we do not pay it back to foreign bankers, having had a good time before we ever get the oil.  Our one objective should be to build up our manufacturing base.</P>
    <P>I wish to reiterate the statements made in this debate and at the Ard-Fheis last weekend by members of the Government in relation to hope and confidence.  Members of this House know that people outside who are trying to make a living, to create employment and to expand their businesses, realise the extent of our problems. <Col N="891" /> However, we are starting to see a glimmer of hope at the end of the tunnel. I do not say this from a party political point of view but on the basis of statistical information.  If we take the most crude method of determining our development in terms of our trade balance, the money that goes out of the country and the money that comes in, a trade deficit last year of £1 billion now looks like being a deficit in the region of £300 to £400 million. That is progress and is a most welcome indication in relation to our living standards.</P>
    <P>I have deliberately refrained from giving the Government party bit about public finances because Members of this House have heard detailed arguments from the various Ministers concerned. Since 1981 we have reached half-way towards our target in rectifying our public finances.  I believe the 1984 budget will be the last of the tough budgets.  If we maintain the attitude in relation to getting value for money in respect of every penny of State expenditure, getting more efficient results from our semi-State sector and getting equality in our taxation code, then I see every opportunity for development and reverting back to a capital growth.  We can then take off on a path of sustainable growth, not short-term expediencies or gimmicks, and we can take part in the international recovery that is now evident in the US and Japan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this economic debate. It gives me an opportunity to dwell on a few matters in relation to the economy. There is very little confidence among the business community throughout the country.  This has been caused by a number of factors affecting the economy, mainly the high level of taxation which is now forced on such companies.  People are questioning how the large amount of taxation business are paying is spent. Employees in companies are affected by this as well as those who pay PAYE.  The burden of PAYE taxation is very great at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="892" /> I want to refer to the employment levies and special levies that have been imposed.  I have a number of questions to ask in respect of these.  Is the money being collected spent prudently?  There seems to be a clash between the Youth Employment Agency and AnCO in relation to certain types of work.  The Youth Employment Programme has not got off the ground.  It is being passed from one officer to a senior officer to the assistant manager and then to the general manager. All the projects go through about ten different people before we see them in operation on the ground.  That is red tape at its worst and very little progress, if any, has been made in regard to this.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency expressed some views on that recently.  If my interpretation is correct, they were not very happy with the direction they were going.  They possibly thought their hands were tied.  This will have to be looked into.  People have those levies deducted from their wages.  They believed when those levies were imposed that the money would be put to good use and would create employment for young people, but this has not happened.  Many of my colleagues in the House will agree with me on that.</P>
    <P>There seems to be overlapping between AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency.  I believe that, if that can be unravelled, it will be in the best interests of the community.  AnCO supply labour for many of the projects, but in only a very few cases do they supply the materials.  They should look into the question of supplying materials for those projects.  They are in a very favourable position in relation to buying materials. If AnCO were purchasing large quantities of materials I believe they would be able to buy them at a competitive price.</P>
    <P>At the end of last year the Minister for the Environment, in reply to a question about housing, stated that there would be 30,000 new starts this year, but that has not happened.  I believe this year that the total number of houses which will be completed, between local authority housing and private housing will be around 22,000.  That is a drop on the number erected in previous years and it shows the <Col N="893" /> effect the recession is having on the economy.</P>
    <P>I want to say a few words about our roads.  There has to be a change of direction in relation to the grants allocated at the beginning of the year to each local authority.  Part of the money allocated is earmarked for major road networks.  The members of the local authorities or the corporations have not any say about how that money should be spent.  I was taking a look at that when I was in the Department. As far as I know, the rules laid down by the Department of Finance are that money which comes from the EEC Regional Fund has to go for projects on the road network better known as the major regional roads.  There has been a grave deterioration in other roads, secondary and third class roads.  These roads do not qualify for any EEC grants but for what are known as block road grants, which come from the local authorities' own funds, and some minor grants from the Department of the Environment.  The whole situation in regard to the financial allocation to local authorities for roads must be reappraised.  The local authorities should have more say in the handling of this finance so that some of these roads which have deteriorated can be attended to.  This is becoming a major problem.  Of course, one problem in regard to this is the high cost of maintaining those roads and carrying out work on them.</P>
    <P>Another question I would like to pose is: are we getting good value for the moneys we are spending on the road network? Sometimes I have the view that we could get better value for our money &mdash; taxpayer's money &mdash; if some jobs were given out by local authorities to contractors who would be able to quote highly competitively for carrying out this type of work.  I have looked into this.  In case any road workers in any of the local authorities would be worried about it, I can tell them that it would not create a loss of jobs in any of the local authorities that I know of.  In regard to removing bad bends on roads and other major works of this nature we should consider whether private contractors should be given an opportunity to tender and we can see how their prices would compare with what <Col N="894" /> holds at present.  I am not satisfied that we are getting good value for the money we spend on such works.  We must see where projects can be carried out more cheaply for the taxpayer.  It could mean possibly that additional money would be available for other roads in an area.</P>
    <P>Some local authorities hire very expensive machinery and plant at very high rates.  Some of this plant is hired at an hourly rate on the usual quotations given to local authorities.  The question is: are we getting value for the money paid in respect of that?  I do not believe that we are in a good many places.  This matter should be investigated also.  I would be anxious that local authorities would not hire any plant for which they have not use on at least every day of the week.  I have seen operations where a laden lorry would leave an area and would be away for some time while the machinery hired would be idle until the lorry came back. The company, however, would have to be paid for the hire of the machinery.  I do not intend to be hard on local authorities when I say that in a time of tight financial constraints on them this matter should be looked into.  We must not merely blame the high cost of the worker's wages.  The management end of the local authorities should be investigated also to ensure that the money is well spent and that machinery hired by the local authorities is not idle.</P>
    <P>In regard to private investment, some people have the view that the State can provide all the jobs.  On many occasions people have told me that it is the duty of the State to provide employment and everything else.  I do not read the situation in that way.  There must be a mixture with private investment, the Government of the day and all the other State bodies involved.  Overheads and costs in industry are very high.  Of course, taxation is extremely high also and it is most alarming to note that from 1 January to 30 September approximately 500 companies have closed or gone into liquidation.  That number is frightening considering the very big loss of jobs entailed.  These companies have closed, possibly through marketing difficulties, not being able to compete, high levels of taxation, and they <Col N="895" /> have been caught up also in some industrial disputes.  On the European and foreign market today there is no charity. Where we have contracts we must be able to supply our goods in a proper manner, at a competitive price and, above all, be able to deliver on the day promised.  If there are delays because of disputes and other difficulties, the people abroad who are purchasing these goods will ask questions in regard to the timetable and our fulfilment of our contracts.  If contracts are not being met, other companies, mainly outside this country, will be very quick to seize the opportunity to gain those contracts.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be hard on employers, trade unions or employees.  It is a three-way process.  In case anybody thinks I am anti-trade union, I was a trade union member for a great number of years before coming into this House and involved in negotiation, so I have a fair idea about how they operate.  All avenues should be explored before workers decide to down tools and walk out.  Many workers have told me that they never recovered from a certain dispute.  All involved must negotiate.  If there is a walk-out or a work to rule or problems of demarcation, those who are purchasing, whether at home or abroad, may find that the terms of the contract are not being followed.  Employers, workers and trade unions must think carefully, because lack of co-operation between them is having a severe effect on industry. I want to drive it home that lost orders are almost impossible to get back.</P>
    <P>At the turn of the eighties we were experiencing a number of demarcation disputes; but, as I said earlier, I do not want to lay the blame on any one sector. No dispute should take place which ends in a walk-out unless there is a secret ballot.  It is not good enough to down tools over some very minor issue and perhaps stay out for a couple of days. Investors coming into the country are beginning to ask questions.  They want to know how we are behaving and managing our affairs.  We will have to look into the situation and be careful about our actions.  The effects of such action can be <Col N="896" /> far reaching, not alone on the economy but on one's job and on the company involved.</P>
    <P>I admit that companies should be a little more frank.  In my own constituency some companies inform their employees every month, some by letter, how the company is operating and the situation regarding orders.  It is very good for morale to know that the orders are coming in and that the company is going fairly well.  Their managers on the floor talk to the workers, giving them down-to-earth information about their problems.  This has worked very well in the companies about which I know.  The workers then know where they stand.  There may be a cursory mention of a company in the morning news and an announcement that information has come, through a leaked document, that they are going to close one of their subsidiary companies.  That is not the correct procedure.  Directors and management should inform the workers about what is happening.  This will boost morale and help greatly to bring about better relations.  There would not then be so much working to rule or so many disputes concerning demarcation, all matters which affect orders and the future of the company as well as the future prospects of the employees.</P>
    <P>Our small industries have worked very well.  I am talking about those with ten, 20 and 30 employees.  I am very pleased with their operations.  The Shannon Free Airport Development Company, better known as SFADCo, are doing very good work in my own constituency and in the Munster area, which is very gratifying.  I thank those involved in small industries in the IDA and SFADCo for all the co-operation and help given by them down the years.  I am very pleased with the way in which they meet their clients and those who have a project in mind and are interested in setting up small industries. SFADCo have done a very good job in building small units in many areas where the IDA do not feel obliged to operate. SFADCo have moved into small villages. A small factory in these areas means a lot to the people.  I highly commend them on that.</P>
    <P>I want to talk about something which <Col N="897" /> is having a very bad effect on the hotel industry which has been giving good employment over a number of years, that is, the high rate of VAT.  Hotels are operating under very severe pressures. They are going through very difficult times with high costs.  In many cases hotels are not catering for the ordinary people with their menus and their prices.</P>
    <P>Some hotels are providing economy lunches, but more have become very expensive.  They provide silverware, but they charge high prices.  That is not on for the ordinary person irrespective of what his employment is.  The hotels cannot blame everybody else for the difficulties they run into.  They must take a share of the blame themselves.  They will have to re-organise to meet the ordinary day to day demand and provide lunches at a nominal cost.</P>
    <P>Overnight charges in hotels are open to question.  I have strong views on this. They say their charges must be high because of the cost of electricity and staff. Possibly if they lowered their charges they might do more business.  In many hotels bed occupancy has gone down.  In the past couple of months it has gone down further.  Leaving out Dublin, Cork and other major centres, there are idle beds in many provincial towns and, because of that, they should look at their charges.</P>
    <P>Cleanliness in our restaurants is also open to question.  The owners seem to think anything is good enough for the people.  That is not on.  They should ensure that everything is presented in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that I can see nothing bright on the horizon for the immediate future.  Next year will be a very difficult year for industry.  If some of the Government's plans are put into operation, they will have a devastating effect on employment. There is a lack of business confidence and investment confidence.  Investors are wondering what will happen. They wonder what the attitude of the Labour Party in Government will be to future capital taxation.</P>
    <P>Will the Labour Party pin the Fine Gael Party into a corner and say: &ldquo;Go after the investor and screw him.  Nail <Col N="898" /> him down as you never nailed him down before&rdquo;?  Some of the Labour Party members of the Coalition Government have grave reservations about certain things that are happening.  It is only right that they should have those reservations.  If the Labour Party screw the people who are investing, they will ask many questions before they extend a factory or consider any extension.  They will wonder if they do expand will they be caught for more taxation.  Company taxation is extremely high.</P>
    <P>Levies are being deducted from PAYE workers.  They do not mind paying those levies provided the money is put to good use, and provided it is not bogged down in bureaucracy, with ten people handling it before it arrives at a project to create a job.  AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency are providing work for young people for three, four or five months. Then they are let go and a new lot of people are taken in.  I question the wisdom of that.  I do not like the way bureaucracy is spending the money. There is a clash of opinion between AnCO and the Youth Employment Agency about who should do what.  The Youth Employment Agency are not happy about the way the scheme is operating. I heard them saying that at different interviews.  That has to be looked into also because the people paying these levies will be, and have been, asking what is happening with this money.  An enormous amount of money has been collected. I am open to correction but I think by the end of the financial year about £60 million will have been collected from one levy.  People want to know how that money is being spent.  I am not happy with the way the scheme is operating. Some say it is going through teething problems.  That may be, but the sooner they are resolved the better.</P>
    <P>As regards business investment there will have to be a new emphasis.  I would be very interested to see the white paper or the green paper, I do not know what colour it will be&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the Government <Col N="899" /> are bringing out very shortly.  I hope it will spell out a policy on industrial investment and will tell us the line the Government will take.  It must be attractive because if it is not, people will have more questions to ask.  The Government task force have been in operation for some time but when we ask when the report will be issued, we are told it will issue &ldquo;shortly&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Shortly&rdquo; can mean anything. Sometimes we are told it will be issued &ldquo;in the future&rdquo; or &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;. That could be next year.  There is no timetable as far as I know, but I hope in the near future we will know what the Government have in mind to deal with job creation and the industrial programme.</P>
      <P>I would like to deal with farming.  If the levy is brought in, it will have a very detrimental effect on the economy and on the agricultural community.  What I fear most is the Government getting into what I call a bartering situation, where export premiums, grants and so on are bartered one against the other.  I want to warn the Government against being drawn into that trap.  Many Deputies spoke at length about this levy but I do not intend to go into it in more detail.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer briefly to horticultural marketing.  We have fallen down completely on this matter.  So far we have been unable to co-ordinate properly the farming organisations, growers, suppliers and others.  I am not blaming this Government for that because many Governments and farming organisations have failed to make progress in the marketing and preparation of horticultural produce.  In my view, it is a shame to see carrots from Denmark being sold in our shops because carrots can be grown here. The housewife buys a bag of potatoes, big ones on the top and the smaller ones on the bottom.  You can fool her once but you cannot fool her a second time, because she knows what is right.</P>

    <P>A lot needs to be done in this area of grading and marketing.  I believe this could be done at very little expense.  We should grow our own produce, make the necessary preparations and set up a board of good people to look into this matter. <Col N="900" /> This would bring about a great improvement in the present situation.  As I said our horticulturalists can produce our own food but we have not been able to package our goods to the best advantage and then sell them on the home market.</P>

      <P>Unfortunately I cannot be here tomorrow because I will be deputising for the Mayor of Limerick.</P>
      <P>I welcome this debate coming as it does simultaneously with the preparation of the departmental Estimates for next year's budget.  If we are to debate this matter seriously it behoves all of us not to insult our people, especially the young, by pretending there are easy answers to the present difficulties.  At present I am involved in discussions with the socialist group in Europe drawing up a programme to combat unemployment.  It is interesting to meet these people and to learn from all the Common Market countries that nobody has the answer to the unemployment problems facing Europe &mdash; governments, trade unions or farming organisations.</P>
      <P>At present there are about 30 million people idle in Europe.  In this country 29,000 people in the 18 to 25 age group are registered as unemployed.  This is the biggest problem I see facing us.  The effect of unemployment on personal and family relationships, where people become demoralised, is becoming one of our major social problems.  It is important that people would not become despondent; they should try to become involved in socially useful activities.  It is equally important that young people would not feel they are being exploited or ripped off by some unscrupulous employers who are abusing the £30 training scheme grant made available for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally, I am aware that the fact that these young people can gain experience is of tremendous benefit.  I was approached by the fathers of some young <Col N="901" /> girls recently who felt that the young people had become very sour because they seemed to be exploited by the managements concerned and felt that the companies should be asked to supplement the contribution of the State.  It is bad enough to be unemployed and be there on a temporary basis only without feeling that one is being abused by what I might describe as unscrupulous employers.</P>
    <P>If we as a people are to retain our nerve and confidence it is vital that the Government give leadership in the whole area of the provision of a plan for employment. In that context I welcome what the Tánaiste had to say in his statement this morning.  It is imperative that a national plan for the economy, as envisaged by the task force, should spell out realistic targets.  Employment must be our first concern.  In this regard the small and medium-sized industries programme offers the best hope for the future.  I am involved with the Socialist Group in drawing up a strategy for employment. The statistics that emerge are very interesting and show that the SMEs, the small and medium-sized enterprises, as a sector have done better than any other in the economy, not alone here but throughout Europe, in fending off the effects of the present recession.</P>
    <P>There are 11 million small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe employing some 30 million people and comprising 60 per cent of the Community work force.  In other words, 60 per cent of the EEC community is employed in small companies comprising 90 per cent of Community firms.  In this country, in spite of the sharp fall-off in the number of job approvals by the IDA in small industries, the level in the small, grant-aided firms was maintained last year at the same level as the preceding year, as was shown in the 1982 IDA report on small firms published on the 4th of this month.  The numbers employed in small industries here at the end of 1982, at 28,700, was the same as at the end of the preceding year.  SFADCo, which were given responsibility for job creation in this field of activity, indicated in their annual report for 1982 that they were <Col N="902" /> pleased that the small industries programme had maintained the momentum of the previous four years.  In spite of the fact that they faced the most testing economic conditions since the thirties, the same pattern of survival has prevailed in this area throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>We should look much more closely at what the Telesis Report had to say.  I doubt that it would now be possible for the IDA or SFADCo people to attract large labour-intensive industries here.  It is now realised by everybody that the days of large companies coming in here are over.  We must now turn in on ourselves in the best possible way by deploying our resources to the optimum advantage of our people.  There is real need to train people in the necessary skills to move into the small industries area.  This area provides employment that is flexible and adaptable and has a crucial role to play in revitalising the economy, in improving the employment situation and boosting competitiveness in the technological innovative area.  In this latter context the Plassy Technological Park in Limerick and the micro-electronics application centre there have a major contribution to make in providing training and facilities to avail of the opportunities offered by changing technologies especially in the information and data-processing areas.  Apart from all that, the small and medium-sized enterprises have a tremendous role to play in the area of import substitution which, it has been estimated costs this country something in the region of £1,000 million per year, goods that we could produce at home.</P>
    <P>Turning to the more traditional areas of employment, I am convinced that the Government should set about making optimum use of any hydrocarbon finds off the Waterford coast.  While it is, as yet, too early to say definitely that the finds in oil and gas are of sufficient commercial quality or quantity, it is not unreasonable to assume that the present hopeful signs will be justified.  That being so, the Government should set about meeting the country's multiple needs in the areas of employment, housing, roads and land drainage.  With these oil and gas finds as our collatoral we should set about <Col N="903" /> borrowing to undertake major programmes in house-building needed to meet the demands of an expanding young population.  We should develop a new roads programme, which could be funded by an additional levy on petrol to be used exclusively for road-building purposes and which would not suffer the fate of the Road Fund robbed by successive Governments for every other purpose but that for which it was intended.</P>
    <P>Equally, there is an unanswerable case to be made for commencing land drainage schemes throughout the country.  I understand there is a difference of opinion at present between the economists in the Department of Finance and those in the Office of Public Works on the feasibility of such land drainage schemes.  If that is so, it should be made known to the public.  I side with the Office of Public Works' people that such schemes are self-financing, with no cost to the Exchequer in terms of balance of payments problems.  It is a scandal that in my constituency of East Limerick there are tens of thousands of acres flooded each year by the Mulcaire, and this in the heartland of some of the finest pasture land in Europe.  Its value would be increased by £15 million in 1982 terms were it drained.  The Drainage Act of 1946 has established a ranking order for these drainage schemes which means that some rivers might not be finished for 30 years.  The present desperate unemployment situation warrants desperate and imaginative measures if the country is to be put on its feet.  I would propose that every river in the country requiring drainage would form part of a national drainage scheme and that they should be drained as part of a concurrent national programme.  If the State is to put public money into land the taxpayer must get a full return on the money invested.  That is the policy of the Labour Party.  Professor Tom Rafftery of UCC, who has done so much for agriculture here, estimates that our total agricultural production could be doubled with the right policies. The whole thrust of our funding policy for agriculture should be to make land available to young people.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="904" /> There is grave need for revitalisation of the housing programme in order to revitalise the building industry, which Professor Milton Friedman has identified &mdash; I do not often quote that gentleman &mdash; as the greatest reflationary agent in a downtrodden economy such as ours at present.</P>
    <P>Another area we should be examining very seriously is that of co-operative development.  The Danes have led the world in this regard.  They have none of the resources we have.  Yet they have achieved the position in which they are tenth in the world in terms of gross national product.  I call on the Government as part of their overall programme to introduce an equitable tax structure in order to bring efficiency to the public sector and so that the taxpayers will get value for money.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to the capitalist-run industries which provide so much employment.  I would remind him that his leader was rebuffed in no uncertain manner by the FUE when he said it was not the function of private enterprise to create jobs but to make profit.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Proposed Closure of ESB Stations: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Malley on Tuesday, 25 October 1983:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann rejects the proposal to close in whole or in part fourteen power stations and calls on the Government to give priority to indigenous fuel in its national energy policy and in particular because of the employment they provide in the midlands and the west, to ensure that the ESB's peat fuel stations are kept fully operative.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="905" /> To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;endorses the action of the Government in setting up the inquiry to investigate systematically the reasons for the high cost of electricity, notes that the ESB has submitted to Government a five-year Strategic Plan and calls on the Government to have due regard to the social, regional and strategic implications of the use of indigenous fuel in national energy policy when considering this plan.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I may be of some help to Deputies.  Last night Deputy O'Malley suggested that the Minister might put copies of the ESB report on the Table of the House.  For the information of Deputies, copies are now in the Library for the use of Deputies and Senators.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>That is no good to me. I am here and I must resume the debate. Perhaps one of the officials would be kind enough to pass me a copy.  I would be grateful for it.  This is one of the most important motions to come before the House in my time here.  I have never seen so many Deputies from both sides so anxious to speak on a motion.  It affects not only the midlands but many regions throughout the west.  I am glad copies of this ESB plan have been issued.  We know the document was leaked deliberately by the ESB.  At Question Time today the Minister said this matter was the ESB's responsibility because it concerns the generation of electricity and other operations of the board.  The Government of the day are responsible for semi-State <Col N="906" /> bodies and they cannot shift that responsibility to the ESB.</P>
      <P>This year an Bord Gáis increased the price of their product to the ESB and in my opinion that was done solely by the Government in order to get money for the Exchequer.  In my estimation this increase meant approximately £40 million a year extra cost to the ESB at a time when industry and consumers in general were complaining about the price of electricity. With a stroke of the pen the Government added that huge extra cost indirectly to the consumer of electricity.</P>
      <P>The turf-fuelled generating stations throughout the country and their employees have served us well.  So have Bord na Móna who provided the fuel.  There has been some discussion about the cost of Bord na Móna fuel to the ESB.  In my opinion Bord na Móna have only brought the price of turf to a reasonable level, and that position will remain for some time.  I would point out that Deputy Reynolds, as Minister, allowed an increase to Bord na Móna last year because the European Investment Bank would not lend the board any more money until they had brought their prices up to realistic levels.</P>
      <P>It has been Fianna Fáil's policy as far as possible to burn native fuel in the generation of electricity.  A few years ago the ESB were very glad to burn native fuel.  Anyway, it is good for the economy. Apart from keeping the money at home, disputes in foreign lands could make it difficult for us to import fuel.  As well, we are paying for our foreign coal in dollars and in sterling and the exchange rates can be most unfavourable to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the midlands and throughout the west these threatened closures will have a devastating effect.  For every one job lost in the ESB, three will be lost in Bord na Móna.  That figure has not been contradicted. Subsidiary industries and firms who now supply equipment to Bord na Móna and the ESB will also be seriously affected.  Successive Governments told us, when we sought major employment-giving industries in Offaly: &ldquo;You are OK &mdash; you have Bord na Móna and the ESB&rdquo;.  We would not be all right with the plans now before us.  These closures <Col N="907" /> would have a detrimental effect on the economy of the midland region.</P>
    <P>Our spokesman on Industry, Deputy Reynolds, is in hospital and he would very much have liked to contribute to this debate.  He wants to assure the workers of his constituency and those in other areas that he is with them in this and that we will not allow the closures to take place.</P>
    <P>Sod and milled peat has been used in these stations for many years and I do not see any reason for change.  I warn the Minister and the board of the ESB that if they try to deliver a sweetener we will meet it head on.  A sweetener is all right for a while but who will have to pay for it?  The consumer will have to pay increased charges and the numbers on the dole will be increased by hundreds or thousands.  We will fight this head on and we will not shilly shally.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak further on this matter but I know that a number of my colleagues are anxious to contribute.  I will not use up all my time and it will not then be said by other Members that I prevented them from speaking on this very important matter.</P>
    <P>In the midland region alone the ESB employ 1,230 people, more than 10 per cent of their work force, and this contributes about £91 million to the economy. In Portarlington, Rhode, Ferbane and Allenwood many people are solely dependent upon the ESB for their livelihood. I cannot understand these proposals and the switch by the ESB to oil and coal.  While in Copenhagen last year I visited a generating station powered by waste paper and garbage.  Why do we not use our native resources?</P>
    <P>What is to happen to these 14 stations? Millions have been spent in carrying out major repairs to some of these stations and this was done in the best interest of the community.  The ESB should not change over completely to using coal and oil.  What will happen if a war breaks out? I hope that the Minister and the Government will quickly make up their minds about this matter because the work force are very demoralised.  They are wondering what will happen and whether there <Col N="908" /> will be another leaked document.  I will conclude now and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am extremely grateful to the Ceann Comhairle.  I am not going to detain the House.  I remember a time, especially in my own constituency of Laois-Offaly, when there was no Bord na Móna in operation and no power station.  It was then the most depressed area in western Europe.  There was unemployment, complete depression, decay and stagnation in our towns until Bord na Móna operated in the constituency. A number of turf generating stations were then erected and as a result of that, especially in Rhode, Shannon-bridge, <Col N="911" /> Portarlington and Ferbane, a vast amount of employment was given.  In my presence that employment was guaranteed by Mr. W.F. Brown, the then chairman of the ESB, who spoke on the roadside near Lumcloon in Cloghan to a Mr. Carroll, a Mr. Gilligan, a Mr. McCabe and a Mr. Kenny.  They were told that when the ESB constructed a power station in that area there would be a guarantee of prosperity, full-time employment and that it would be the means of changing the whole face of the county. The same thing happened in Portarlington and, as a result of the coming of the ESB and Bord na Móna, the whole face of County Offaly and the midlands was changed.  In so far as the proposals from the ESB are concerned, I am asking the Government to firmly reject them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I released the confidential document to the workers in the area because it concerned my constituency.  I was told it came from a very senior executive in the ESB who wanted this information released.  I immediately got in touch with the Department and everybody else concerned because I realised this was a vital matter concerning the livelihood of the people.  In reply to a parliamentary question today, the Minister said that before the plan was received he had set up a special inquiry into the reasons for the prices of electricity.  Did the ESB submit this plan to the Minister or did the Minister ask the ESB for the plan?  Bord na Móna and the ESB have been responsible for providing first class employment in the area.  The midlands was the poorest part of the country and the ESB and Bord na Móna changed the whole face of the economy in that area simply because native fuel was being used.  I have always supported Bord na Móna since the days of the old Turf Development Board, and that is not today or yesterday.  It nettles me to see Members of this House, whether they are Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael or Labour, rejecting the use of our peat and other natural resources.  If electricity has to be provided there is no reason why our own fuel cannot be used instead of keeping American miners in employment while our own workers in Counties <Col N="912" /> Offaly, Laois, Roscommon, Donegal and elsewhere are being thrown on to the unemployment heap.  What has happened to the new bog which has been opened up in Ballycumber and Killeigh and the thousands of acres of virgin bog in that area?</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority told us whenever we approached them in regard to industrial development in Birr, Tullamore or Portarlington that we could not get industries because we had Bord na Móna and the ESB.  Other areas had the advantage of industrial development, but we were handicapped.  Now, as a result of industries being placed elsewhere, we are losing the ESB and Bord na Móna with the consequence that 1,200 workers will lose their employment.  This will affect over 3,500 people, including women and children.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today he would like to emphasise that there has been no decision taken yet on the ESB proposals. If no decision has been taken there is no reason to lose our tempers.  However, we want to warn the Government that when it comes to a decision it is time to cry halt in this matter.  I have never seen a proposal surrounded by such daftness and madness as that submitted by the ESB. I appeal to the Government to firmly reject these proposals.  Our stand should be to generate our electricity from native fuel and cut down imports of American coal.  If we are to use coal in such stations we should develop the coal deposits in the Leinster coalfields in Carlow, Kilkenny and south Laois.  It is easy to develop those coalfields using modern technology.</P>
    <P>I should like to express my thanks to the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to voice a firm protest in relation to this matter.  I do not like the plan.  I can recall what Offaly was like without the ESB and Bord na Móna and I do not want to see that again.  I saw too much hardship, semi-hunger and poverty and I do not wish a return to those days. The people in that county do not have anything else to depend on but the ESB and Bord na Móna.</P>

      <P>Debate on this motion is not the time for political point scoring. We now have an opportunity to discuss not just unemployment generally but the real threat to the livelihood of thousands of families, particularly in the midland counties.  The ESB have put forward a five-year strategy plan for consideration by the Government and this proposes to phase out in whole or in part 14 generating stations, many of which are milled or sod peat plants.  My constituency will be hardest hit if these proposals are implemented and because of that the only description I have for this plan is that it is a plan of destruction as far as the industrial life of Offaly is concerned.</P>
      <P>It has frequently been the boast of Cumann na nGael, and later Fine Gael, that they initiated rural electrification here.  That is fair enough.  It should be remembered that Irish water and Irish labour were used to power the first hydroelectric plant and Frank Aiken and Seán Lemass initiated the harvesting of our bogs and the production of native fuel in economic quantities.  Suddenly the bogs were producing what we describe in Offaly as &ldquo;brown gold&rdquo;.  Vast tracts of waste land in Offaly were turned into economic areas.  Most of the land cultivated by Bord na Móna is in County Offaly.  Of greater importance was the fact that permanent work was provided for thousands of midlanders who then saw a future in living there.  That hope and security replaced despair and insecurity and only a midlander can fully appreciate what the harvesting of peat has done and is doing for the centre of Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rapid progress in the development of the boglands has been much admired by many countries, particularly the Scandinavians and Russians.  Irish ingenuity was seen at its best in the progress of Bord na Móna's activities down the <Col N="914" /> years.  Following that the ESB used home produced fuel for an increased number of power stations.  They worked with Bord na Móna and nobody can deny that the use of native fuel made sound economic sense.  Any country in a position to supply power from native fuel is bound to do so and that is what took place here.</P>
    <P>The ESB became Bord na Móna's best customer, but their activities in the last ten years do not make sense.  It is not too long ago since we heard the ESB advocating the establishment of an atomic power station.  We were given the impression that if such a station was not erected all our lights would go out.  The Government of the day were asked to sanction the building of such a station without delay.  A few years ago the ESB were requesting people to conserve electricity. In one year we were told to use electricity sparingly but the following year we were told the opposite.  What is their plea today?  They are asking us to scrap 14 of our generating stations.</P>
    <P>I am confident that Minister Bruton, a commonsense man, will not go along with the ESB's proposals.  If those proposals are implemented, if there is a pruning or phasing out of generating stations in County Offaly, upwards of 3,000 people in that county will be out of work.  Can any Government at a time of serious economic recession adopt a plan which will lead to the putting of 3,000 workers on the scrap heap?  I am confident that will not be allowed to happen by the Government.</P>
    <P>For the purposes of this debate I will count Portarlington as an Offaly town, because half of it is in Offaly.  If one draws a line from Portarlington through to Edenderry, Daingean, Rhode, Ferbane, Cloghan and Birr, one will see how dependent they are on ESB and Bord na Móna workers.  Are those towns to be damaged by the implementation of this plan of destruction for County Offaly and the midlands?</P>
    <P>I regret that it was necessary to limit the amount of time for this debate because to me it represents one of the most important issues to be raised here for many years.  It affects my constituency, but it will also affect other parts of <Col N="915" /> the country.  I should like to stress to the Minister that the people of Offaly and Laois will not agree to a proposal that will wipe out the right of individuals in those counties to earn a living at a time when there is little hope of attracting alternative industries.  The people of Offaly, and the workers in Bord na Móna and the ESB, will not tolerate such a move.</P>
    <P>It is evident to most Deputies that electricity can be produced at a cheaper rate than Bord na Móna and the ESB together can produce it, but the Government must put aside that point so far as this plan is concerned.  Commonsense must prevail. The social and economic implications that the implementation of these proposals would produce, particularly in County Offaly, are so horrifying and detrimental to the future of the county that, as an Offalyman, I could not consider such action being taken.</P>
    <P>The country is going through a severe economic recession and the Government and the Minister might be considering the implementation of this plan on the basis that it would save the Exchequer some money.  There are roughly 6,000 industrial jobs in County Offaly, 3,000 of which can be linked to Bord na Móna and the ESB.  Offaly has fared badly in industrial development because successive Governments have pointed out that the county had Bord na Móna and the ESB.  As a result, industrial development and growth have not been as great as in other areas.  Now the Government cannot implement the plan and put in jeopardy the jobs of 3,000 workers.  I am confident that no Irish Government would take such a stance or implement such a plan so far as the midlands and Offaly in particular are concerned.</P>

      <P>One of the faults of this House is that in a major debate such as this Deputies do not have an opportunity to study properly the documentation and information available.  I welcome the decision of the Minister to have the report of the ESB placed in the Library for the information of Deputies, even though it was at extremely short notice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="916" /> This debate has attracted quite a number of speakers.  Their interest and concern is evident from the fact that many have been lining up to speak for the past two nights.  We must face reality and realise that while the debate is important it need not have taken place.  It is a phoney debate in one sense.  It is well known that the ESB have excess generating capacity.  When industrialists and consumers quite rightly pointed out to the Minister the pressures they faced because of the cost of electricity, he initiated an inquiry into the matter.  That is as it should be.  The Minister was quite right to take that action.  For the ESB to state that if the cost of electricity is too high they will close 14 power stations is nothing short of playing politics.  I regret the ESB have involved themselves in this because it is not in keeping with their past history or with the many innovations in that organisation.</P>
    <P>Peat stations here should never close until that source of indigenous energy lying under our feet is used and the ground put to further use.  Experiments have been carried out on this matter in other countries and also in Ireland.  It is entirely wrong of the ESB to adopt the attitude that they will close 14 power stations if the Minister tells them the cost of electricity is too high.  Everyone realises the political consequences of such action.  I am a Deputy from Mayo and our county has been ridiculed for many years for having more than enough bogs. I wish to inform the Government and the ESB that any move to close the power station that affects County Mayo will be resisted by the people <i>en bloc</i>.  Any Minister who has been to Mayo during the years will have travelled over 50 or 60 miles of bog.  For the ESB to close the bog in Mayo in 1985 is nothing short of disgraceful.</P>
    <P>In the early seventies the cost of peat per tonne was about £2 and with a moisture content of 55 per cent I suppose that was reasonable.  In the late seventies the price had risen to approximately £5.50 per tonne and now it is in the region of £16.90 per tonne.  Even if one takes a 15 per cent increase over each of the years the price should be in the region of £9.60 <Col N="917" /> per tonne.  There is a difference of £7.30 per tonne because of the grossly inflated price to the ESB for the peat they purchase from Bord na Móna.  The tonnage involved is in the region of 3.5 million tonnes.  That works out at approximately £25.5 million.</P>
    <P>When Bord na Móna are unable to service their loans they have two choices. They can ask for a Government subvention or they can rip off the ESB.  The cost of the ESB having to pay inflated prices is borne by the consumer.  That is why housewives in Ballyfermot, Ballymun and throughout the country, not to mention industrialists, are under extreme pressure in trying to pay ESB bills.  They cannot understand why those bills are so high.  Electricity in Finland costs half the amount it costs in Ireland.</P>
    <P>In many ways Bord na Móna are antiquated. The terms of reference of the ESB which state they cannot make either a profit or a loss should be applied also to Bord na Móna.  Some years ago the Minister for Industry and Energy &mdash; incidentally, I hope he recovers soon from his temporary illness &mdash; was in a position to give a Government commitment to grant a 32 per cent price increase to Bord na Móna, and there should now be another Government initiative to reduce the price of milled peat to the ESB.  Even if that were reduced by half the difference of the £7.30 already referred to, it would mean an instant decrease in the cost of electricity and it would ease the burden on housewives and industrialists.</P>
    <P>We are exploring for oil off our coasts and yet the ESB propose to close 14 power stations.  I cannot see the logic of that.  The alternative of imported coal would mean further jobs in America for Americans.  I understand that contracts have or are about to be placed for American coal.  It would mean Irish people would be made redundant with devastating consequences for our rural areas, many of which have not been developed in the same way as other parts of the country.</P>
    <P>The fact that some elements in the ESB are at present promoting an anti-Minister Bruton campaign is now pouring oil on troubled waters, if I may use that pun.  I <Col N="918" /> understand that a document is circulating within sections of the ESB with the Minister's picture on the front, he is bedecked with some kind of cap, pointing his finger and saying, &ldquo;I want your job&rdquo;.  This document indicates there is a two-pronged attack on jobs and wages in the ESB, that districts are to be eliminated, that the head office is to be wiped out, that sales outlets are to be closed and that the job of every ESB worker is on the line.  I want to make it clear this is not a Government initiative.  The union that has put out this document does not represent the majority of workers in the ESB.  It is something I deplore and it is not in keeping with the good work of many trade union officials. It is causing rumours to circulate and is causing scares among workers in the ESB.  It is very unjust.</P>
    <P>The Bellacorick power station in County Mayo is a 14 megawatt station using about 300,000 tonnes of milled peat per year.  It was built in 1962-63 and the ESB propose to decommission it in 1985. The lifetime of the bogs in that area is approximately 20 years.  This is one of the most efficient turf-burning stations in the country.  The cost of generating one unit of electricity is 4.36p per unit.  That compares with 4.27p in Tarbert, an oil generating station and 1.90p in Aghada, the gas generating station.  The Minister should let the ESB know of the social consequences of any attempt at closing a peat-burning station with that reserve of energy left in the area.  I repeat again that this will be resisted and will be opposed by the people in the county <i>en bloc</i>.  This decision will not be accepted.</P>
    <P>The fact that the former head of Bord na Móna entered into this on a radio programme some time ago caused quite a lot of ripples on the water also.  When this man was in charge of Bord na Móna he could have looked at this, because against the last two Governments he refused point blank to allow any private development to take place in the west which could compete successfully and on which there were independent assessments carried out on the viability of its prospects.  It could compete more than favourably with Bord na Móna.  It is deplorable for the former head of Bord <Col N="919" /> na Móna to enter into this matter the way he did and to politicise this whole matter.</P>
    <P>The contributions made by the Opposition Members are very fair and very relevant.  They understand the significance of what is happening and appreciate the difficulty the Minister is in.  The Minister has faced up to the reality of the situation.  He has brought the heads of the semi-State bodies together and told them to get their houses in order.  When he asked for an inquiry into the cost of electricity he was given a very abrupt answer.  I assume he has rejected this out of hand and that he has sent it back to the ESB.  I hope when the time for decision comes that any proposal to close peat-burning stations, in particular the Bellacorick station with the reserves it has, will not be accepted by the Government. The Minister has made it clear that no decision whatever has been made on this by the Government.  He has repeated that in various statements issued by him during the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>The ESB plan contains a foreword by the chief executive officer.  In large writing on the first page there is a reference to &ldquo;the change to improve prices&rdquo;.  We all understand that.  At the end of the foreword he says that it is necessary that there be a full realisation at all levels of the scale of change necessary in the ESB. He further states that it will be necessary for the ESB to have the courage to take unpalatable decisions which are unavoidable and he also says there is a need for radical thinking and innovation.  There is, but that is no reason for the head of any body like the ESB to attempt to think of closing down a source of power like fuel-burning stations with a reserve of energy left in them.  We all understand the need for change, the need to improve efficiency and technology, but there are other ways of doing it.  There is no need to sign very large contracts for the importation of oil or coal when we have an indigenous source of energy under our feet, which is not yet entirely used up.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley very rightly referred to this point in his contribution last night. It was a very fair and competent contribution and it hit the nail on the head so <Col N="920" /> far as that point is concerned.  In the months ahead, the time before a decision is made on this, other contributions will be made by Deputies here and by various organisations.  We all understand the need to have the cost of electricity reduced for the housewife and for the industrialist, but there are other ways of doing it.  If it took Government initiative some years ago to give a price increase to Bord na Móna, then let us have Government initiative now to reduce the price of milled peat from Bord na Móna to the ESB, and there will be a consequent direct reduction to the consumer and the industrialist, which is what we all want.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the ESB proposal, which should have been rejected by the Government as soon as it was read.  I agree with Deputy Kenny that the necessity for this debate would never have arisen if that had happened. I am very interested in the proposal by the ESB to close down the generating station at Cahirciveen.  I cannot understand the thinking behind it.  There are 20 employees in this generating station but, more important, there are 250 turf producers who produce turf to keep this generating station in operation.  They supply 17,000 tonnes of turf per annum. We can imagine the amount of activity which this generates particularly during the summer and autumn months. Approximately 1,000 people will be immediately affected by the closure of this generating station.  Apart altogether from the income for the turf producers, great employment is provided in the summer months for the sons and daughters of the turf producers who use the money they get from this work to enable them to remain in third level education during the following year.  If this generating station closes it will mean the loss of £1 million per year to the economy of the Iveragh Peninsula.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a further spin-off which must also be taken into account in respect of the maintenance of the machinery for cutting turf as the maintenance of the turf generating station itself.  We must view all this against the background of <Col N="921" /> the social and economic problems in the Cahirciveen area and in the Iveragh Peninsula which embraces the whole area from Caherdaniel around the Ring of Kerry as far as Glenbeigh.  This area has seen a decline in population during the period from 1971 to 1981, when practically every other area in the country witnessed a substantial increase in population. This is another reason why that station should be kept open.  It is fundamental to maintaining high morale in that area.  There has been emigration from there for quite a long time.  The home won peat and the turf production should get first preference in this area because it is the major industry there.  This turf generating station was built as a result of Fianna Fáil policy and planning at the time.  I remember on a previous occasion in 1967, when the ESB proposed closing down this station, I immediately brought it before the then Fianna Fáil Government and the whole proposal was scrapped at once.  That turf generating station not alone kept the economy in that area ticking over since then, but it helped the ESB significantly to maintain their power and capacity for generating electricity.  Had that been closed down in 1967 the ESB would have had to do something else in the intervening years to replace the loss of power which would have occurred after the closing down of that station.  Cahirciveen and the Iveragh Peninsula constitute an area of social and economic deprivation, and I say to the Government and the Minister for Industry and Energy, &ldquo;Whatever else you do, hands off Cahirciveen and that area.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind the fact that bog and peat land kept people of such areas moving and alive during the war years in particular.  It would be sad, particularly in a recessionary time such as the present, should the Government decide to close down these turf generating stations and give permission to the ESB to import materials for the generation of electricity. The Government should look at other areas of home-produced generation of power.  A closer look should be taken at biomass and the use of timber waste which is helping to make small timber mills viable.  Waste timber is being used in <Col N="922" /> some small stations and to use it in those stations is good economy because there appears to be no other outlet for it.</P>
    <P>For the reasons outlined I am particularly interested that the generating station in Cahirciveen should be retained. The people in south-west Kerry are adamant on this.  When I heard of the ESB proposal I brought a deputation from south-west Kerry to the Department of Industry and Energy where we expressed our concern and our complete and utter disagreement with the proposals.  Kerry County Council discussed the matter and passed a resolution asking the Minister to keep that station open and I know they have sought from the Minister a meeting with their deputation.  This proposal has come as a great shock to the people of south Kerry and throughout the whole of Kerry and their question is, if such a proposal is even tolerated in respect of an area like south-west Kerry what would happen in respect of a similar proposal or a more serious one in other areas of the country?</P>

      <P>This peninsula is a remote, isolated but beautiful area because of its scenery.  The turf generating industry is the bread and butter of the area and information that it was to be closed would be the most depressing news possible for the people there.  I am convinced that we must go back again to the bogs and ask for greater production of turf by private enterprise.  If more areas were producing turf as Cahirciveen is producing it, the ESB would not have many of the problems they face today. Smallholders with access to peat and bog-land should be able to avail of schemes under the Turf Development Act, 1980, and apply for and get the grants necessary to enable them to produce more turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad that we have an opportunity of debating this proposal.  This debate should be unnecessary but had it not been granted I have no doubt that people would be marching from the country and on the streets of Dublin to Leinster <Col N="923" /> House.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;so that we can debate this.  The plan is very comprehensive and wide-ranging.  I disagree totally with some matters in it to the extent that I intend to oppose it at every opportunity. I intend to take an active part in leading opposition to some of the proposals in this plan.  Nevertheless, some ideas and proposals in it are worthy of comment and we should be given the opportunity in this House of looking over them and discussing them in a detailed manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember some years ago a plan by Irish Life to install imported furniture in their offices and the objections raised at the time as a result throughout the length and breadth of Ireland.  There was widespread uproar and disapproval.  Now one of our semi-State bodies appear to be about to adopt a policy of using imported means to produce energy here instead of our native resources.  We as a House must oppose this.  The preface to the plan states that the ESB intend to introduce a corporate strategic plan concerned only with the achievement of one objective, that is change to improve price.  That any semi-State body would say that this is their only objective merits serious disapproval. There are two separate issues here.  One is the economics of the ESB, and every effort they can make to reduce costs and get their economics right is important.  However, as a Parliament, as a Government and as a country we must raise our sights a little higher than just the one criterion of the economics of the ESB.  We must look at the question of national economics.  Are the ESB to use imported coal and imported oil to fire their generating plants instead of using <Col N="924" /> native turf, milled peat, gas, coal and water?  If the ESB decide to use imported energy, this House must say a very emphatic and definite &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  Unfortunately, we in this House under existing regulations and laws cannot give directions to the ESB.  However, if the necessity arises and if the ESB continue to plough ahead with these plans to use imported fuel, this House will have to bring in legislation changing the law which allows the ESB to use imported fuel and energy rather than our native supplies.  Emergency legislation will have to be brought in, if necessary.</P>
    <P>On page 12 of the ESB submission there is mention of the number of stations which are going to be decommissioned, as they put it.  I work out the total to be put out of work or affected in one way or the other as 1,460.  Three of these stations &mdash; Portarlington, Ferbane and Rhode &mdash; are in my constituency and that will have profound and serious implications for the county of Offaly.  In plain language, when the ESB talk about decommissioning these stations they are talking about making 1,200 to 1,400 people redundant and that will be fought at every possible level by every democratic means at our disposal.  This would have a devastating effect on County Offaly and part of County Laois.  The county of Offaly in which I grew up had widespread unemployment and widespread emigration. The majority of my school friends had to leave Ireland to find employment around the world.  The county has made very considerable progress and we are proud of our achievements as a county and of the way in which our economy has grown. I will not stand by and let anybody sound the economic death knell of County Offaly and that is a message which Mr. P.J. Moriarty and everybody else should bear in mind.  I will do all in my power to ensure that that does not happen.</P>
    <P>Towns like Ferbane, Birr, Kilcormack, Tullamore, Rhode, Portarlington and Edenderry are dependent upon the ESB and Bord na Móna for the economic existence of their people.  The Minister must remove immediately this frightening economic threat which is hanging <Col N="925" /> over the midlands and the west of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At peak times Bord na Móna employ approximately 6,500 to 7,000 people. Last year they sold approximately £47 million worth of turf and milled peat to the ESB.  If the ESB decide to spend that £47 million in providing employment in American and Australian coalfields that will be a national scandal and this House will have to seriously consider asking for the resignation of senior management who would make and proceed with such a decision.  They are talking about letting go roughly 1,200 in the ESB and if that £47 million is no longer of benefit to Bord na Móna perhaps 3,000 more working in Bord na Móna will also be let go.  That means approximately 4,000 people's livelihoods being affected, in the long run, by these proposals.</P>
    <P>Consider the redundancy money and unemployment benefits which will have to be paid to these people, bogs lying idle and our native resources left lying fallow while men in American and Australian coalfields are put into well-paid employment. I would hope that the House would be serious enough in its endeavours to give good example to our people and our semi-State bodies, that we be Irish, buy Irish and use Irish material.  That is what we should be doing.  If a semi-State body gives the bad example of using imported instead of native materials, there is something seriously wrong which cannot be countenanced.  Our semi-State bodies should be giving us good example in utilising our own resources, but that is not the effect of the ESB report which must be opposed.</P>
    <P>The cost factors involved are what the ESB are considering.  They are saying that the use of imported gas, oil or coal would be more economical for the ESB. It would be marginally so for the ESB themselves, but the overall cost to the nation would be much more expensive. That was why I originally referred to national economics.</P>
    <P>I ask the ESB to reconsider this matter because the use of milled peat and turf would be more beneficial to the nation, which is the important thing.  We must <Col N="926" /> ask the ESB to withdraw those proposals and the Minister to reject them.</P>
    <P>To conclude, the cost of turf purchased by the ESB is too high and Bord na Móna should be asked to reduce this because it is part and parcel of the ESB's problem. This would make the use of turf and milled peat more economical.  The ESB should also seriously look at improving some of the existing generating stations in which turf and milled peat are used. Many of these plants need improvement. We must continue to use turf and milled peat in our stations.  It is essential that we do so.  It would be economic madness for us to use imported fuels when we have our own native fuels.  When we have our own materials they should be utilised.</P>

      <P>The number of Deputies offering to speak on this motion is an indication of how seriously it is being taken by Members on both sides of the House.  It is also an indication of the importance of this proposal for the entire community.  I want to add my voice to the voices of Deputy Connolly and Deputy Cowen and also Deputy Flanagan and Deputy Enright from the Laois-Offaly constituency.  In that constituency we are not prepared to take lying down the proposal the ESB have put to the Government to close down the peat generating stations in the Laois-Offaly area in particular.  Anybody who knows anything about the structural composition of the midlands region recognises that the bogs and ancillary industries are the main base on which the economy of that region has been built.</P>
      <P>We were always extremely proud of the fact that the Bord na Móna and ESB developments &mdash; and I do not want to make a political point &mdash; were brought about by Fianna Fáil Governments.  We were pleased that those important decisions helped to maintain the economic viability of the midlands region.  Therefore, it is quite understandable that regardless of our political views we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the ESB workers and the Bord na Móna workers to ensure that this economic madness will not be introduced by the Government and the responsible Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="927" /> This proposal came as a very great shock to all the people living in the region.  It was a shock to the workers and the families of the workers directly involved in those two major industries. Naturally the people employed in the ESB generating stations panicked at the very prospect of the proposal being implemented.  Likewise the many workers employed in the Bord na Móna bogs in the region were worried about their future employment.</P>
    <P>More important perhaps in its own way is the effect the proposal would have on the economy of the region, the effect it would have on the towns and villages in the area, dependent as they are on the people employed in our main industries. All the people in the region will be demanding very clearly an early decision by the Minister to reject this mad proposal.</P>
    <P>I would like to share the confidence expressed by previous speakers that the Minister in his wisdom will decide to reject it out of hand at an early date.  I am sure there are many other areas within the ESB operations where they could look more credibly for the economies the Minister rightly requested from them.  There are many areas within their operations where these economies could be found.  I would not like to think the ESB deliberately created a situation to make the Minister's task impossible, that they deliberately threw back the Minister's request into his face because they were not prepared to look at areas within their operations where genuine and credible savings could be made.  They said to the Government.  &ldquo;The only proposal we can put forward to meet your request is to close down the peat generating stations.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It could be justifiably argued that you could make a case to provide our electricity requirements from a nuclear station outside the country.  That is not beyond the bounds of technical possibility. Of course it would be a daft proposal. The people responsible for this proposal were not prepared to consider any option other than to close the stations.  The ESB made that proposal because they knew <Col N="928" /> that people in this House who are concerned about the future of the workers would be put in an embarrassing situation.</P>
    <P>The proposal indicates a total lack of a social philosophy or a social commitment on the part of a national board which is financed by this Parliament.  In their proposals they should take into consideration national objectives, and our main national objective at the moment is to retain employment and where possible to increase it.  In this callous, cowardly proposal, they are prepared to throw at least 4,000 people on to the scrap heap with no alternative proposal for their employment and without expressing any concern for their future well-being.</P>
    <P>Before any decision is made on this important matter the Government should instruct the ESB to continue with their present operations, to continue to use the existing peat resources which we all know will be available for ten, 15 or 20 years.  These resources should be used to keep the existing stations in operation and to maintain the existing level of employment in those stations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me an opportunity to raise this very important issue.  I intend to divide my 20 minutes between Deputy Kitt and myself.</P>
      <P>The proposal to impose a super-levy on milk within the EEC is potentially the most dangerous proposal for Irish agriculture in the history of this State.  The present proposal has directly arisen from instructions given to the Commission by the European Council at Stuttgart which was attended by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs last June, and is greatly at variance with the statement made by the Taoiseach in the Dáil and reported at column 2687, Volume 343 of the Official Report of 22 June 1983:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and I, with gratifying <Col N="929" /> support from colleagues, were successful in preventing damage to Irish interest in the Common Agricultural Policy. In fact, a comparison between the proposal circulating recently on that subject and the conclusions of the Stuttgart Council will show a really remarkable degree of understanding and support for the basic principles of that policy....</P>
    <P>He went on to say that the outcome of that particular meeting was strikingly positive and that the impulse towards the maintenance and development of the Community and its policy was strengthened.</P>
    <P>In the past month the Minister, Deputy Deasy, said that only two countries within the EEC were supporting Ireland's case, but at the weekend he said he had no support whatever.  The Taoiseach's statement of 22 June and the statements made by the Minister in early October and over last weekend are certainly not consistent.  First, the Taoiseach said he was successful in preventing damage to the Irish interests with gratifying support from colleagues; now the Minister says he has no support whatever.  Who is telling the truth?</P>
    <P>The Government's handling of this whole affair has been haphazard, unco-ordinated, a complete shambles and, to say the least of it, misleading.  Let us examine the whole issue of the levy, how it will affect Ireland and why the Government must adopt a stance of total rejection of the proposal.</P>
    <P>Part of the European Commission's plan for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy is the proposed introduction of a super-levy or a tax on milk production. This tax, according to the Commission, would mean that milk producers would have to pay for the entire cost of disposing of milk surplus above a given quantity.  The super-levy would be additional to the co-responsibility levy of 2 per cent on milk production introduced in 1977.  This new tax would apply at a rate of 75 per cent on all production over 101 per cent of the 1981 figure.  It is estimated that the overall effect of the super-levy, if introduced, would be to <Col N="930" /> reduce the gross national product in Ireland by at least 1 per cent and the cost of the super-levy to Ireland would be £146 million in the first year.  In effect, the super-levy would be nothing more than the imposition of a quota on Irish milk production which would mean a complete blockage in the expansion of our dairy sector.</P>
    <P>Let us not forget that Ireland has one of the most undeveloped dairy sectors in the Community, and is the one most dependent on the milk sector.  Over 53 per cent of Irish farm families are dependent on milk production; the EEC average for farm holdings with dairy cows is 35 per cent.  Over 85 per cent of Irish dairy farmers have less than 30 cows, compared with 46 per cent in the Netherlands or 35 per cent in the United Kingdom. A most important statistic to remember is that 80 per cent of all beef produced in Ireland comes from the dairy herd.</P>
    <P>On the employment situation, it is estimated that the super-levy, if it were to be introduced, would put 14 per cent to 15 per cent of Irish milk producers out of existence with serious consequences for employment.  In 1960 there were 390,000 full-time farmers in Ireland; in 1970 there were 283,000; in 1980 there were 220,000.  The figures for 1982 are not yet released, but Deputies can be sure they are considerably lower than the 1980 figure.  In Ireland 18.9 per cent of the entire work force are employed on the land; the Community average is 8.2 per cent.  26 per cent of those employed in agriculture in Ireland are under 25 years of age.  There are 11,000 people employed in the dairy processing industries, while 6,000 people are employed in beef processing.  There are thousands of Irish men and women employed in the food processing industries and in agri-related businesses.  In a nutshell, up to 45 per cent of our entire work force are employed in agriculture, either directly or indirectly.</P>
    <P>Agriculture accounts for 14.2 per cent of our gross national product.  This compares with 1.9 per cent in Germany, 2.1 per cent in the United Kingdom and 3.7 per cent in the Netherlands.  Milk production <Col N="931" /> accounts for 33 per cent of gross agricultural output and 4.5 per cent of the Irish gross national product, and dairy herds account for 80 per cent of our total cattle breeding herd.  Milk output is six-and-a-half times more important to the Irish economy than in the overall economies of the member states.  I make these points to prove that Ireland is a very special case.  Milk and beef output is 7½ per cent more important to Ireland than to the overall economies of the member states.  It accounts for 9.61 per cent of GNP in Ireland, .79 in Germany, .8 in the United Kingdom and 1.4 in the Netherlands.</P>
    <P>Ireland's average milk yield of 680 gallons compares with yields of 1,001 gallons in the Netherlands, 1,040 gallons in Germany and 962 gallons in the United Kingdom.  Ireland's share of total EEC milk production is 4 per cent compared with 24.2 per cent in France, 23 per cent in Germany and 15 per cent in the United Kingdom.  Germany, Holland and the United Kingdom accounted for 50.3 per cent of the total EEC production in 1981. The Netherlands and Germany account for 70 per cent of total imports of cereal substitutes while Ireland, France, Italy and Denmark account for 55 per cent of total agricultural production.  They import only 12 per cent of all cereal substitutes, and twice the total forage acreage is imported from outside the Community to boost artificial milk yields.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that 20 million tonnes of animal feeding stuffs are unnecesarily imported into the Community and that 10 million tonnes are used as dairy feeding which, in turn, is responsible for producing an extra 20 million tonnes of milk. New Zealand's share of the United Kingdom butter market has risen from 25 per cent in 1974 to 34 per cent in 1983.  This affects Ireland and Denmark whose traditional market is the United Kingdom. I was interested recently to hear that the Minister intends to force a situation in which New Zealand's share will drop significantly.  The Minister must also take into consideration the 10 million tonnes of feed imported from outside the EEC and used for the dairying industry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="932" /> Quite obviously Ireland's case is genuinely a special one.  Our partners in the EEC must be told in no uncertain terms of the special nature of the matter in relation to Ireland.  They must be convinced that, as far as Ireland is concerned, this is a national question and not a sectional interest one.  They must be made aware that all farmer organisations and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are unanimous in their total rejection of this proposal.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been consistent in their stance in relation to any such proposal. Deputy Ray MacSharry, as Minister for Agriculture, succeeded in keeping a similar proposal at bay in 1979.  This latest proposal was put before us in June, shortly after the Taoiseach told us he had prevented any attack on our interests.  I wonder did he attend that meeting at all? We in Fianna Fáil have indicated our full support for the Government for a total rejection of the super-levy.  We say again that we support the Government in anything positive they do.  But we must know where the Government stand on this issue.  Are they prepared to stand alone against this proposal?  The weeks ahead will be a true test of their patriotism.  I say let Ireland be first and if the Minister does not intend to do this then he should, as in a code of sport with which I am not terribly familiar, apply for a transfer.  I might ask the Minister also if he noticed over the weekend that in the Taoiseach's address to the Fine Gael Ard-Fheis little attention was paid to the Minister's Department whereas he went on at length about other Ministers and Ministries. This battle can be won only by men of conviction who are prepared to show that they are better Irishmen than Europeans.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed miserably to put a strong case for Ireland to the member states.  This was clearly indicated to me in a letter written by Mr. John Taylor, MEP, in answer to a request for support from Wexford County Committee of Agriculture when he stated categorically that the United Kingdom would not subscribe to anything less than the super-levy.  Obviously no attempt had <Col N="933" /> been made to educate Mr. Taylor as to Ireland's special case.</P>
    <P>I say this evening that it is not too late for the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture to undertake a tour of European capitals to convince their respective counterparts of Ireland's situation and to plead for support.  In itself such a tour would demonstrate the conviction of our Government, if they harbour such convictions. It would also direct attention to the cause.  Such a tour was engaged in prior to our accession to the EEC.  This issue is of similar importance.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat that this is a national issue, one which has attracted the concern of everybody, of farming organisations, of trade unions, all of whom are opposed to the proposed milk levy.  The nation is looking to the Government for leadership.  Leadership is about attracting support, being decisive and, above all, being consistent and effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join Deputy H. Byrne in calling on the Government to reject categorically these proposals for a super-levy.  Deputy Byrne referred to the European Council meeting at Stuttgart last June.  I might point out that, after that Council meeting, the Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign affairs appeared to subscribe to the conclusions of that Summit which gave the EEC Commission the authority to put forward proposals for the super-levy on milk.  As a result of that, the confidence of farmers in their judgment and their negotiating ability must have been considerably shaken.  I recall that in London, after the EEC Summit of November, 1981, the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, said that the super-levy was dead.  Now we find it is very much alive and we hope the Government will fight strenuously to oppose it. What has really infuriated Irish farmers is the basic unfairness of these proposals. We are talking about a situation in which Ireland produces no more than 4½ per cent of the Community's milk supplies. On top of that our dairy farmers receive a price for their milk which is far below European standards.  I note that the June publication of An Foras Talúntais states very clearly that the figures for percentage <Col N="934" /> of target price achieved show that Ireland is well behind her EEC partners. The House can imagine how disastrous it would be to have a super-levy imposed on milk in this country while we lag behind our partners.</P>
      <P>Certainly it would be most unfair that such a proposal would come forward at a time when there is such unemployment here, and which would add further to the unemployment problem through the loss of thousands of jobs.  There is also the fact that the super-levy on milk will cost Ireland £146 million in one year.  When one considers the total Commission package probably one is talking of a figure closer to £200 million.  We are concerned that such proposals be fought strenuously by our Government.  It must be remembered that the average yield per cow in this country is far behind the European average or that of the Netherlands where the average yield is 1,000 gallons.  All these points should be put very strongly to our partners, as we have already called on the Taoiseach to do today.  If such proposals were implemented it would constitute complete departure from the terms under which we joined the EEC.</P>
      <P>I am somewhat disappointed also that the case of the western farmer has not been made more strongly by the Government. It must be remembered that our smaller farmers in the west were advised to go into dairying.  They invested quite an amount of money in dairying and it will be seen that they have increased their production.  I have figures here showing that, in the province of Connacht, the production will have risen by 12 per cent since 1981, which is not far behind the national average.  We must take into consideration also that much of that area is classified as being severely handicapped by the EEC.  Yet we have had encouraging results there with regard to milk production.  This levy of 70p on the gallon would have a drastic effect on farmers there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government must communicate clearly to our EEC partners that we will not allow a vital national interest to be damaged and that we shall have no hesitation in using the veto should it come to that point.  I hope this issue of national <Col N="935" /> importance will be fought by the Government, that there will be no compromise and that they will state unequivocally that we are against these proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, let me say I am pleased that the debate has been orderly and reasonable. This is a time when we must be completely responsible in Ireland, because we are facing up to a very important debate, probably the most important national issue facing us since our EEC accession.</P>
      <P>Therefore, hysteria or point scoring or opportunism in any form would be highly detrimental to our case in Europe.  I reject out of hand allegations that these negotiations are not being carried out with the utmost care and skill.  In the past three months there has been a definite appreciation throughout the EEC of Ireland's special case, that it will have to be taken and treated as special, quite separate from the position of the nine other countries.  However, the support our negotiators have had from the trade unions and the various bodies representing industry and commerce here, has been most reassuring.  It has helped us considerably.  At all levels we have got the message home in Europe that the milk super-levy proposal is not acceptable to us in any form.</P>
      <P>I am confident that we will evade the harsh measures proposed by the Commission in regard to the milk super-levy. It is very important that we be guarded in what we say at all times because we are facing two further months of negotiation. They will be extremely critical and we want unanimity at home if we are to do the maximum good for the country in Europe.  By and large our people have responded in a very responsible manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will make a few points in reply to the two Deputies who have spoken.  Deputy Byrne quoted me as having said last week that we did not have any support whatever in Europe.  I did not say that.  I said that all the other EEC members, in some form or another, have accepted the principle of the super-levy.  Initially, some of them did not: they had counter-proposals <Col N="936" /> but after considerable negotiation their counter-proposals were not accepted.  By and large there is acceptance of the super-levy by the other nine.  Some of them would even go further: they would go for a direct price reduction, a considerable one, which would even be worse because some of them do not think the milk super-levy goes far enough.  Some of them were even thinking of a variation of the co-responsibility levy.  However, that proposal was put forward in a halfhearted, lukewarm manner.  They have almost given up that argument without too much of a fight.</P>
    <P>We are on our own in our outright opposition to the Commission's proposals on milk.  We have said it is not acceptable, that they can forget about it, from the Irish point of view.  Notwithstanding, it would be wrong to say we have not got support.  I think the majority of the member states have a clear understanding of our predicament.  A majority of them feel we have a special case.</P>
    <P>The super-levy is one of a number of proposals made by the Commission for changes in the CAP.  Negotiations on various proposals have been going on at official and ministerial level since last August.  It is the current aim of the Presidency to reach a decision at the European Council meeting in Athens in December.  I am more hopeful now than I was two weeks ago that there will be a decision in December because, though it may not have any great significance to Ireland, a major decision was arrived at in Luxembourg last week when the price support system for Mediterranean produce, involving fruit, vegetables and olive oil, was agreed on.</P>
    <P>People will ask what the blazes that has to do with Ireland.  Perhaps it has very little significance directly but that had been one of the great impasses involving the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community.  The French and the Italians were very concerned about a decision on a regime in regard to this produce as there is in regard to milk, beef and cereals, before the accession of Spain and Portugal who have very high efficiency, particularly the Spaniards, in the growth <Col N="937" /> and marketing of Mediterranean products.</P>
    <P>That agreement leaves the way clear for the member states to concentrate on the Commission proposals on milk in particular. It also leaves the way clear, if agreement can be reached on milk, for general agreement on an increase in regard to own resources in the Community from 1 per cent of VAT receipts to 1.4 per cent.  That is a very crucial matter because as we all know the Community has run out of money.  Therefore, it is quite likely that we will have a speedier solution of the milk problem than was thought a few weeks ago.</P>
    <P>Here I come to a very significant point. Comparisons have been made between the previous milk super-levy proposals and the present one.  It is not possible to make such a comparison because on the previous occasion the Community was not on the verge of bankruptcy.  At that time the proposals slipped into obscurity. This time there is a definite financial crisis in the Community.  We all know that something will have to be done about surplus production of milk.  What we here are saying is that the countries who created the problem should be the countries who should suffer the consequences. That has been our argument from the beginning and we intend to maintain it.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a cutback on milk production but it should have been done years ago.  Now it is like closing the stable door when the horse has bolted.  If corrective measures had been taken at the proper time we would not now be faced with this dreadful situation in the Community. <Col N="938" /> It has been apparent for years that the increased importation of cereal substitutes would promote factory-type farming, resulting in huge surpluses of milk.  That is what has happened and that is why we have this enormous problem today.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go into very great detail because tomorrow I will be making a speech on the matter during the economic debate.  Deputy Kitt raised an important question.  I have not made a separate argument for farmers in the west of Ireland, for a very significant reason. Milk is too important to our economy as a whole and therefore we cannot differentiate between small, medium and large producers, no matter which part of the country they come from.  This is a matter which affects our whole economy and I want to ensure that we will get a settlement based on our total milk production. I do not want to be taken up wrongly when I say that.  I sympathise with the plight of our small farmers throughout Ireland, but particularly those in the west, but I am taking the entire milk problem and I do not want to see any division, any breaking of ranks.  I do not want to have people suggesting that we should differentiate between the small and large producers.  It is too important a matter for the country.  We want an exemption from the super-levy for all our milk, not just portion of it.</P>

If the Deputy would indicate a short recent period in respect of which information would be of assistance to him I will be glad to have it compiled as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>In general these allowances have been adjusted regularly by reference to such factors as changes in social welfare payments and rises in the cost of living.  However, due to financial constraints, the Government directed in October 1982 that adult trainee allowance rates be retained at their existing levels until they equate with unemployment benefit levels. For the same reasons, increases were not granted in meal allowances in 1983.</P>

      <P>The information available to me relates to jobs filled through the National Manpower Service.  However, employers are not obliged to notify their vacancies to the National Manpower Service and in fact the majority of vacancies are filled through other means.</P>
      <P>Up to the end of August 1983, 22,137 vacancies were notified to the National Manpower Service and 17,868 were filled.  Given the priorities of the service in submissions for vacancies, the majority of these jobs would have gone to the unemployed, viz, those on the live register and first time job seekers.  The National Manpower Service handles all types of vacancy from unskilled up to managerial level so the jobs filled would extend over a broad range of occupational groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constant change in the composition <Col N="815" /> of the live register of unemployed, despite its continuing rise, indicates that in 1983 up to 15,000 people left the register each month and it can be taken that the vast majority of these had found employment through various means.</P>
    <P>Given the concentration by the National Manpower Service on the unemployed, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to employers to make greater use of the service when recruiting workers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Proposals have been put to the North Eastern Health Board for the rationalisation of maternity services in the area.  In the long term the proposals would envisage the location of such services in Cavan, Navan and Drogheda.  There is, however, major building work involved in such a programme of rationalisation and I do not foresee that the maternity section at Dundalk will close in the next five years.  However, maternity services at Louth County Hospital are provided <Col N="827" /> by the consultant physician at the hospital. During the physician's recent absence on a fortnight's annual leave the North Eastern Health Board were unable to arrange for maternity cover at consultant level for the unit.</P>
    <P>The board accordingly decided that in the best interests of mothers and babies scheduled deliveries should be transferred to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Drogheda.  Twenty-five mothers were referred to that hospital during the period of the physician's absence.</P>
    <P>On my direction discussions are being held at present by my Department with the North Eastern Health Board and other interested parties in an effort to achieve a satisfactory and viable solution which will enable the unit to continue.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance from <Col N="831" /> 30 June 1983 at the weekly rate of £27.95 being the maximum rate £28 less means £0.05.  Following an investigation of his case him means were assessed at £6 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in his parents home.  He was accordingly paid unemployment assistance at £22 weekly from 28 September 1983 increased to £23.40 from 5 October 1983.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and in the light of his contentions made by him in support of his appeal his case was reconsidered by a deciding officer and he was assessed with nil means with effect from 28 September 1983.  He is accordingly qualified for the maximum rate of unemployment assistance £28 from 28 September 1983 and £29.40 from 5 October 1983. An adjusting payment representing the arrears of unemployment assistance due, £18, will be made to him this week in addition to the current payment of £29.40.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 17 April 1978 to 18 April 1983.  Payment was disallowed after that date following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and, in connection with his appeal, he was examined on 27 May 1983 by a different medical referee who also considered him to be capable of work.  His case was then referred to an appeals officer who held an oral hearing of his case on 25 August 1983.  Before making a decision however, the appeals officer wishes to consider the result of an independent specialist examination arranged for the claimant on 8 November 1983.</P>

      <P>Application for transport to Kilbeg national school was made on behalf of the children concerned at the end of September, about one month after the commencement of the current school year. The present transport routes to Kilbeg national school were organised on the basis of applications received before 31 August 1983.  No spare accommodation is available for those children at present because the service in question is catering for a capacity load of eligible children.  I understand that accommodation may become available for one of the children after 1 January 1984.  To cater for them immediately would necessitate the operation of a special trip of a mini-bus which could not be justified on grounds of expense.</P>
