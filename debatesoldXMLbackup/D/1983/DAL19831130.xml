      <P>Because of the extraordinary meeting arranged in a most unusual way between the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Prior, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, would the Taoiseach let us know whether he proposes to make a statement in the House today on that meeting?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach care to comment on the meeting or tell us anything about it because there is a great responsibility on him to let us know why this emergency meeting took place, what was discussed at that meeting and what assurances, if any, were sought or given?</P>

      <P>When a matter like this is raised it is not a question of whether the Taoiseach or a Minister wishes to comment or not.  It is either in order or not and if the Chair were to run the business of the House on those lines it would be impossible to say what was or was not in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Taoiseach any proposals to bring a Bill before the House <Col N="631" /> in this or the next session regarding satellite television?  This is a very important development and it is appropriate that a proper Bill should be debated in this House before we embark on this very important step.  It is a very costly exercise &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, from my experience in this House it has always been in order to ask the Taoiseach about his proposals for the legislative programme in this House.  I remember you asking such questions &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in order to ask about proposals for legislation on the Order Paper.  It is also in order to ask about legislation that has been promised in the House by the Government but not beyond that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What you have just said about legislation which has been promised in the House reminds me of the question I put to the Taoiseach if he is satisfied that the Minister concerned should have made a statement about this very important matter outside the House at a time when the House was sitting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It does.  If the Minister makes announcements about very important proposals outside the House, according to your ruling Deputy Leyden or any other Deputy has no right to raise it here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If legislation is promised in the House, it is quite in order to ask when will it be ready, but I am following a ruling made by my predecessor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>If important statements are made outside the House which would involve legislation, perhaps you would consider providing some means to us to raise that matter?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the way questions are these days it might be months before it was answered.  In this case the Minister made a very important statement outside the House about a matter which will involve legislation.  Your ruling is somewhat anomalous.  If the statement had been made inside the House Deputy Leyden could have asked the Minister about it, but because it was made outside the House he may not ask about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is financial loss incurred by the manufacturer or the potential exporter, is it not reasonable and equitable that there be some framework whereby restitution can be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, a prohibition on the export of any commodity would be determined in the main by our international obligations and also in the context of any material being strategic, not strategic necessarily in the military sense but in the industrial sense such as scrap metal, the exportation of which would be regarded as being against financial interest.  The only exceptions would be in the event of certain national emergencies such as an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease when the Minister for Agriculture would prohibit the shipment of cattle.  There has never been any provision so far as I am aware for the payment of any compensation in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind the question of the exportation of technological instrumentation. If an operator here devised a technological advance that was capable of being exported and sold to another jurisdiction, one that might not be favoured by our Government, with the result that a licence to prohibit the exportation would be issued, there could be serious loss of revenue to the developer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances outlined by the Deputy would arise only in relation to our international obligations &mdash; for instance, conforming with a UN resolution which would prohibit the export of certain materials to a particular area &mdash; but such a situation should be well-known to anyone engaged in that type of industry.  Therefore, I could not foresee arising the circumstances the Deputy has outlined unless there was a deliberate attempt on the part of the person <Col N="637" /> concerned to try to evade responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not press the matter further except to say that at the time of the enactment of the Principal Act in 1956 our technological advance had not started.  In this new era of technological advance the sort of situation I have outlined could arise.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) provides for consultations with the Minister for Foreign Affairs concerning the export of certain materials to specified destinations. Would the Minister indicate how may times since the original Act was enacted has the Minister for Foreign Affairs sought licences to be issued for particular material exports and what kind of destination has he had in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the detailed information that the Deputy seeks but, as I have said previously, obviously they would be destinations which would be covered by European resolutions or other international agreements and also destinations of particular material where, because of our membership of the EEC, an EEC agreement had been reached with regard to the supply to or withholding supplies from particular destinations. The ones that come to mind I know about offhand would be the case of Iran and also the former Rhodesia.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point of view.  A situation could arise in so far as our obligations to the EEC are concerned that would be concerned only with maintaining supply stability in the EEC itself.  It is a pretty global arrangement that a business puts a request to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and if he wishes to maintain his good standing in the Community he could bring about a situation where a licence could be granted to prohibit certain exports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <P>Subsection (4) concerns the amendment and revoking of orders.

      <P>On reflection the Deputy may not wish that to be the case since for business reasons industry or business might not wish that kind of information to be made available.  The question of licences as granted will be treated as a matter of confidence by the Department for the reason I have stated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I see the point but I cannot see what difference it would make.  If somebody is refused a licence to export particular material to any country I would expect that other exporters would get a similar refusal.  Consequently I see no reason why a register of all licences sought, granted or refused could not be held in a place for public inspection.  This has been common in the granting of licences under other headings and I see no reason why the Minister would not agree to consider it here.</P>

      <P>On the question of transport to other countries, I take it that a licence may be granted for that also and the material does not have to originate in this country, it could be transported through this country and a licence could be issued for that type of operation.  Is there provision in the Department to control the methods and conditions applied to any licences?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A section in the Bill deals with goods that would be just in transit through the country.  Reference is made to that in the Bill to ensure that we are not used as a base for bringing it and routing it out to an undesirable destination. As regards monitoring of it, a copy of all documents with reference to the particular commodity or goods is sent to the embassy abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned goods that might be of a particular nature going to an undesirable destination and the goods might not have originated in this country.  Do I take it that that material, strategic or otherwise, would be trans-shipped through this country and stop over here and that we have no particular <Col N="641" /> interest in the country that provided it other than that the servicing or refuelling of its transporters, would be subject to a licence being granted?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Trans-shipment is covered in the definition of &ldquo;exportation&rdquo; in section 1.  This means that goods landed at an Irish port for loading to another ship for another destination are under customs control which includes strategic export control.  Strategic export control has been applied to Shannon free airport since 1976 by way of an order made each year by the Minister for Transport applying control of export orders to Shannon free airport.  That is taken into account.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (5) concerns the fines that may be imposed.  While £10,000 sounds a considerable amount, I do not think that sum is prohibitive considering the value of the metals and the technical instrumentation involved.  I have no objection to the limit of £10,000 but I ask the Minister if he regards it as adequate considering the vast increase in the value of this type of goods?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>What is stated in the subsection is &ldquo;...£10,000 or three times the value of the goods ... whichever is the greater&rdquo;.  It also stipulates that there could be two years imprisonment, that both or either could be applied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (9) causes a great deal of concern in that it is a change from what has been regarded as traditional and I should like the Minister to give the House a good reason for altering what had become established practice since the last century.  It is proposed now that one can prosecute and follow a prosecution two years after the alleged offence has been committed.  In the general interest of the public that needs to be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most desirable change.  As I explained earlier in reply to another matter the Deputy raised, a licence can be granted on the basis of false information and that may not come to <Col N="642" /> light until the period of six months has expired.  Because of the nature of the business, the documentation and the ramifications of the export market, it has been found that it is very unlikely to come to light within a period of six months but is more likely to come to light after that time.  I am sure the Deputy and the House will agree that where, due to a technicality, people are getting away with this, the law should try to remove that escape hatch from people who are wilfully contravening the law.  It would apply only in cases where a deliberate false statement had been made to secure a licence.  Quite honestly, I consider this is a most desirable change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I have no objection in the circumstances as it involves this kind of operation, I would regard it as an undesirable trend if it were applied to any other prosecution situation.  I can see the justification in this case, that it would not readily come to the notice of the Department, but I should not like this to be established as a precedent.  The Petty Sessions (Ireland) Act, 1851, has served well and its provisions should not be lightly set aside.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate the type of situation that might arise where he would consider it desirable to transfer the powers in this Bill to a fellow member in the Cabinet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>For instance, if the matter concerned agricultural produce it might be more effectively exercised by the Minister for Agriculture.  It has been the normal practice that the Government can designate a particular Minister to <Col N="643" /> deal with a particular commodity in certain circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill does not cover agricultural or fishery products.  If all the exports that might be considered under this were covered I could see the reason for transferring powers to the Minister for Agriculture or to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry but as they are excluded specifically I cannot see any good reason why the Minister should seek this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>With the exception of some agricultural products the Bill is all-embracing.  There may be circumstances where the export of a certain commodity can be best monitored by a Department directly involved with that commodity and I give the example of agriculture.  If the issue arose, for a limited period, pharmaceuticals might be better dealt with by the Department of Health because of their in-depth knowledge of the whole range of pharmaceuticals. For that reason this provision has been inserted in the Bill and to ensure that in the event of certain circumstances arising the most effective arm of Government would monitor the situation for a period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That relates back to the fundamental question I raised under section 3.  I can accept the Minister might have the personnel and expertise in his Department to monitor any particular schedule of conditions that might be attached to any licence he would grant but if he transfers the power, and obviously it would not be a temporary transfer&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Even in a temporary capacity if power is transferred to another Minister that Ministry might not have the same kind of expertise in the control and monitoring of a licence.  It is an inherent weakness in the Bill.  It removes from the Minister's Department the supervisory <Col N="644" /> control that one would normally expect to be on a continuing basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give one example to illustrate the point.  In the event of foot and mouth disease, that could be best monitored by the Department of Agriculture. We wish to have the most effective way of implementing any decision that may be taken in the national interest. That is the overriding consideration. While we issue licences so far as exports are concerned, the matter is monitored by the customs people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it extraordinary that the Minister keeps referring back to agriculture because that is not covered by the Bill.  It was made abundantly clear in the Principal Act or else on Second Stage when the Minister spoke that this Bill was concerned mainly with strategic materials, scrap metals, ammunitions and technical instrumentation.  I should imagine the Minister for Agriculture would have a rather scarce input into that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an earlier Act &mdash; the 1947 Act &mdash; which deals mainly with agricultural matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

      <P>In that event, the title of the Bill which is &ldquo;...to provide for the control of the exportation of goods other than agricultural and fishery products...&rdquo;, would seem to be misnamed. However, that may be a matter for another day.  I expect it would be only in the most extreme circumstances that the granting of licences for the export of any materials would be transferred to other Ministers.  I take it the Minister's nod of approval indicates the agrees with that?  The Minister will agree with me that agriculture and fishery products are not covered specifically except by reference.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Trustee (Authorised Investments) (No. 2) Order, 1983,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 26th October, 1983.</P>
      <P>The investment powers of trustees are set out in the Trustee (Authorised Investments) Act of 1958.  They may of course be modified by the terms of the instrument setting up the trust.  The chief purpose of the legislation is to protect the interests of the beneficiaries of trusts by providing trustees with a range of suitable investment outlets.  The Minister for Finance is empowered under section 2 of the Act to amend the list of authorised investments by order.  Before an order may be made, a draft must be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and each House must pass a resolution of approval.  The present draft order has already been approved by the Seanad.  It is the second draft order to be laid before the House this year and, if approved, will mean that, in 1983, six additions will have been made to the list of trustee authorised investment.</P>
      <P>In the present Order, I propose to authorise trustees to invest trust funds in interest-bearing deposit accounts in the following licensed banks:</P>
      <P>(a)  First Southern Bank Limited,</P>
      <P>(b)  Credit Finance Bank Limited,</P>
      <P>(c)  Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These three banks have been recommended for trustee status by the Central <Col N="646" /> Bank, the banking supervisory authority. First Southern Bank and Credit Finance Bank have been in operation for several years, providing a wide range of banking services.  The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has been operating in Ireland for the last four years and is a member of one of the largest banking groups in the world.</P>
    <P>The 1958 Act requires that the following referees must be consulted about the terms of the draft order before it is laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas:</P>
    <P>(a)  A Judge of the High Court nominated by the Chief Justice;</P>
    <P>(b)  The Governor of the Central Bank;</P>
    <P>(c)  The Public Trustee;</P>
    <P>(d)  The Chairman of the Irish Banks' Standing Committee;</P>
    <P>(e)  The President of the Incorporated Law Society of Ireland;</P>
    <P>(f)  The President of the Stock Exchange &mdash; Irish.</P>
    <P>All of the statutory requirements have been complied with and the referees are in agreement with this draft order.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the banks named in the draft order provide suitable investment opportunities for trust funds.  I therefore commend the motion for approval by the House.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State clarify the position with reference to the continued monitoring of the institutions involved?  I need not go into detail about the experience of investors in one building society because the matter is well known.  What is the monitoring procedure carried out to ensure that these companies continue to deserve trustee status?  I am particularly concerned because of past experience where institutions have accepted funds from small investors and these investments were subsequently dishonoured.  The nest eggs investors were putting together were frittered away.  Could I ask the Minister to emphasise the importance of proper control by the Registrar of Friendly Societies, Building Societies and the Central <Col N="648" /> Bank with regard to institutions deserving of trustee status, institutions which accept funds from the general public?</P>

      <P>I can assure Deputy Burke that the institutions on the list I read out are continually monitored by the Central Bank in the case of banks and by the Department of Finance in the case of building societies.  No institution with trustee status has been in any trouble.  Any organisation named in this order is continually monitored by the Department of Finance or the Central Bank.  Banks are continually monitored and have to be passed as sound by the Central Bank before they are put on this list, and their names have to come before both Houses of the Oireachtas before they are put on the list.  There has been a case where private individuals invested their funds and the organisation got into trouble, but in such cases there will always be risks.</P>

But once the referee has authorised that this order should be made, does his responsibility cease or has he a continuing responsibility to see that the criteria are being lived up to?

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>When moving the adjournment of the debate yesterday evening I was making the point that this Bill gives the House the opportunity to emphasise to the Government the importance of expanding our export effort in order to tackle our national unemployment problem.  It is not being too dramatic to say that the message must go to the Government and to all manufacturers that it is a question of export or die for most companies.  Because of our small but very important domestic market and the recession, it is vital that companies look to foreign markets in the United Kingdom and the rest of the world and that they use the good offices of CTT to provide markets for their products not just in Ireland but worldwide.</P>
      <P>This is an opportunity for this House to strengthen the hand of the Minister in his negotiations at Government level at the time the Estimates are being prepared. It is an opportunity for the House to help the Minister to secure from the Government funds for our export effort. Our unemployment problem must be tackled by our manufactures with the help of CTT.  CTT schemes have not been operating properly since last May because they ran out of funds.  We want to see the Minister getting extra funds next year to enable CTT to operate properly, getting extra money not only for existing schemes but for new ones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that CTT should look at their role and title.  Instead of being known as the Irish Export Board they should broaden their scope and become an Irish trade board in amalgamation with the Irish Goods Council, using the expertise of both organisations for the benefit of Irish industry in the marketplace at home and abroad.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on the importance of our agricultural exports effort. In my view there should be greater liaison <Col N="652" /> between our export efforts in the industrial and agricultural sectors.</P>
    <P>The scope for improvement in our exports to Great Britain was dealt with in the management report.  It is vital to our export effort that the Government and the Department should concentrate on the recommendations of that report.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The Bill also includes a provision regarding remuneration, allowances and terms and conditions of employees of Córas Tráchtála.  This is to update existing provisions in the Export Promotion Act relating to these matters and in order, at the behest of the Minister for the Public Service, to bring them into line with standard provisions being inserted, as the opportunity arises, in the legislation governing all other State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>I was a member of a Government which included similar provisions in similar types of legislation but I wonder whether we are going too far and damaging the whole principle behind the original setting up of semi-State bodies.  They were established to fill a gap in our economy and they were to be engines for growth responsible to the Government, operating on the broad principles laid down by the Government but independent of the normal controls of the Civil Service.  They were to provide services and in some cases to undertake commercial operations where there was a void in the existing structures.</P>
    <P>The trend in recent years has been for the control of the semi-State sector to pass back to the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service, thus negativing the basic principle underlying the establishment of the semi-State bodies.  It must be more than an coincidence that since the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service have succeeded in establishing more Government control over the operations of the semi-State bodies the performance of many of those organisations has left a lot to be desired.  The dead hand of the Department of the Public Service is being laid on their operations. <Col N="653" /> That was never intended and the whole idea was to get away from such controls.  I am not saying that the semi-State bodies should be totally without control but there should be broad policy guidelines laid down by the Government within which the boards should control and the management should operate, leaving room for initiative.</P>
    <P>We should be able to attract to the semi-State sector the very best people in the country.  Such people will not be attracted if we impose on semi-State organisations the salary structure of the State sector under the control of the Department of the Public Service.  This makes it impossible for organisations such as CTT to attract and retain the services of the people they need.  Everybody in this House and in business generally knows the damage caused by the Devlin Reports in discouraging the people who have most to offer to the semi-State sector.  Many of these people are refusing to apply for positions because of the ludicrous salary levels. There is no incentive for them.  Because of these controls, many good people are leaving the semi-State sector, even at this time of recession, and they represent a major loss to our national effort.</P>
    <P>Instead of including a section such as this, we should be looking in a different direction and considering the idea of giving chief executives of semi-State organisations five-year contracts which would be subject to renewal by their boards. During those five years they should be given a fairly free hand and paid salaries commensurate with their ability.  There should be bonus schemes and the normal incentives which are available in the private sector.  Instead of giving this kind of encouragement we are moving backwards towards the kind of situation from which our predecessors broke free.  We are moving back towards direct State control of the operations of semi-State bodies.  I got the impression from the wording of the Minister's speech that he was not in favour of this and I would welcome his views.</P>
    <P>The semi-State sector has much to offer the economy but it needs encouragement. Those involved need incentives <Col N="654" /> and not the dead hand of the Department of Finance and the Department of the Public Service.  From a national point of view we also need a greater export effort than the one being made at the moment. I appeal to the Government to provide the funds in 1984 to allow our exporters and industrialists to take advantage of the services and expertise of Córas Tráchtála.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make two points arising out of this Bill.  The first bears on a matter which I raised by way of Dáil Question a couple of weeks ago, namely, the scheme which goes back a couple of years for the subsidisation of the recruitment and initial employment of marketing executives permanently, or mainly, based abroad.</P>
      <P>Irish industry which depends so heavily on exports is at the wrong end of the list in the European league, having the smallest number of permanently foreign based marketing executives.  In other words, the number of Irish firms who sell their products through a sales operation run by a man, or more than one man, permanently or mainly based outside the country is the smallest per any standard you like to take in the entire EEC area. An incredibly tiny number of Irish firms, export dependent though most of them are, keep permanently based anywhere outside the country somebody whose only or main occupation it is to market their goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This lack has been pointed out frequently by the Confederation of Irish Industry and others.  It was recognised by Córas Tráchtála.  About two years ago, before I was in the Department of Trade, an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement was made under some tripartite arrangement in the last days of the Fianna Fáil Government which went out of office in 1981, whereby some support was provided for the recruitment of marketing executives.  I do not mean to draw any sort of invidious comparison; I recognise that the scheme started before we arrived.  It was put on a somewhat sounder footing in my time. It was not I personally who made that possible &mdash; it was an initiative which came from Deputy Bruton as Minister for <Col N="655" /> Finance &mdash; but I was very glad to take it up and make the most of it.</P>
    <P>A lump sum of £1 million was provided for this specific object, over and above the grant-in-aid which Córas Tráchtála received.  That was at a time when, as you, Sir, will remember, because we both had the honour of taking part in those back-breaking estimate-cutting exercises, economies of the most brutal kind were being made all around, and when the Government room resembled a field operating-theatre in some primitive war, with severed limbs, abandoned schemes, and so on, lying around in large heaps.  Nonetheless the Minister for Finance of the day saw the importance &mdash; and I was glad to agree with him &mdash; of trying to support the marketing effort by this means.  At a very difficult time for him and the Government, he made available £1 million which we were able to use in the Department of Trade in order to pay 50 per cent of the cost for the first year of keeping stationed abroad marketing executives for Irish firms which previously had no such person.</P>
    <P>That scheme was taken up eagerly by Irish industry.  Córas Tráchtála, who handled the scheme for us, had a large number of applications.  Something like 50 marketing executives were subsidised in their employment for the first year in firms who formerly employed no such person.  That has been a great success. Córas Tráchtála did a survey after the first year, and reported that almost all the firms who had been assisted in the recruitment and employment of a marketing executive in the first year had kept that man on in the second year out of their own resources.  The State element of support dropped away like a spent booster rocket.</P>
    <P>There is a much greater potential for the expansion of a scheme like that which we were not able to satisfy with £1 million. Unfortunately the budget for this year &mdash; needless to say, I am perfectly well aware of the difficulties the Minister for Finance has &mdash; did not provide £1 million, but I think only half of that sum. It was not a separate allocation but merely a sort of earmarked or tagged <Col N="656" /> portion of the general grant-in-aid.  Effectively the impetus which that scheme had developed has slackened in this year, I am afraid, although there is absolute unanimity that the scheme is extremely productive.  For a very small investment the State can earn a very large return both for itself and the economy generally. It was computed that each of these marketing executives on average was worth about £350,000 worth of business to the firm under whose flag they were sailing.</P>
    <P>All Ministers are under ferocious pressures from every quarter and everybody is anxious to make a special case for his own pet scheme, but this is a case in which a strong plea should be made to the Minister.  I hope it will reach him, and that he will make sure that whatever else comes or goes in the Córas Tráchtála grant-in-aid next year &mdash; obviously it will be greater in money terms than it was this year &mdash; the integrity of this scheme, the advance of the scheme and the allocation of more money to it, will be decided before anything else is decided.</P>
    <P>I do not presume to lay down a sequence of priorities for Córas Tráchtála; they know their own business best.  They appear to think very well of this scheme, as do the Confederation of Irish Industry.  To me it makes sense.  I remember very well the enthusiasm and the gratitude of the industries who availed of the scheme at the end of 1981 and the beginning of 1982 when we were getting it going.  It would be a great pity if the potential of a scheme like this were to be unsatisfied, and the State did not do what it could to support it and extend it with a relatively small amount of money.</P>
    <P>The second point I should like to make is not quite so detailed.  I should like to be allowed to speak in general terms about the exporting process in terms, no more general than those which Deputy Burke and other Deputies were allowed to use in this debate so far.</P>
    <P>The problem is that, notwithstanding the very rapid growth in exports and the marvellous performance which the export sector has been turning in in recent years, against what might have been thought to be every possible kind of <Col N="657" /> tide, we are not really export-minded. We are not really product-minded.  We have not got a mercantile sense.  It is not part of our racial makeup to have the anxiety and the drive to put something together, some kind of product or service, and go out and sell it.</P>
    <P>Some nationalities are terribly good at that.  The Greeks are good at it.  All the Semitic people are good at it.  Many people outside those categories are good at it as well.  We are not good at it.  Less of this is heard these days, but when I was a child we tended to pat ourselves on the back for our &ldquo;spiritual empire&rdquo; and our &ldquo;rejection of materialism&rdquo;.  Even as a child, I was repelled by what seemed to me the falseness of the idea that is showed any spiritual quality to be backward and poverty-stricken, hereditarily so, as it seemed at one time.  Even as a child I could not share that point of view any more than I share the point of view that the Protestant ethic is one which particularly encourages or is favourable to material advancement or the greater prosperity of people in a material sense.</P>
    <P>Our problem is partly the product of a very long period of backwardness and poverty wished or forced upon us from outside.  It is partly also the product of the geographical and subsequent cultural isolation of which we could not but be the victims, however history had turned out.  If one compares us with the people next door one finds that the factors which make the difference between British and Irish history in material prosperity have nothing to do with what happened in the Ice Age, as though injustices began even then with a gigantic piece of ice scraping off all our coal and leaving it down in England&mdash;that is the kind of stuff we were taught as children.  I do not say that it was thought of as a form of injustice, but it was portrayed as one of these pieces of misfortune with which we had to contend or, perhaps, even resignedly accept. One of the reasons for the British doing well materially over the centuries and continuing to do so, even though with hiccups, is that they were geographically and ethnically a little luckier than we. They had a series of invasions.  There is nothing racially pure about the British <Col N="658" /> and any people who boast of racial purity would be a very backward people who, metaphorically speaking, still have bones through their noses.</P>
    <P>The people in the neighbouring island endured wave after wave of invasion and were able to absorb them.  I do not know who the proto-inhabitants of the country next door were, but the island was settled by Celtic peoples around the time that our island was settled by Celtic peoples. Thereafter, they had invaders who stopped short at their shores and came no further.  They had Romans, Saxons, Danes, Normans&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make the point that if the British have been fortunate over the centuries in having been able to absorb large influxes of mixed people, we have had bad luck in that respect.  We have not been able to absorb our invasions, not assimilated anybody properly&mdash; because of reasons on which I know the Chair would not allow me to lecture the House&mdash;since about the year 1600.  We have not had the same happy contact with the outside world&mdash;and heaven knows the English, even with all those advantages, are isolated and insular enough in their own minds.  We, however, are far more isolated and insular and tend, for reasons which are again historically explicable, to take our standards from the British and look no further afield.  Even here we have been the victims of misfortune, although it is perhaps not seen as that.  An example is the foundation of Maynooth College.  I hope that I shall not <Col N="659" /> be misunderstood or misrepresented, but I am so frequently misrepresented that I have almost despaired of anyone even wishing to report accurately on a point like this.  The foundation of Maynooth College was in one sense a misfortune, because it deprived the Irish of a leadership in contact with the outside world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair knows that the Constitution would not permit us to apply funds being voted under this Bill towards Maynooth College.  Therefore, I do not think that is relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It meant that in the formative period of modern Irish history&mdash;in the lifetimes of our parents and grand-parents&mdash;the natural leaders of the people, parish by parish, were people who had been trained in a college funded by the English Government for the very purpose of orienting them towards English standards and keeping their eyes off the Continent, albeit only Salamanca, Rome, Louvain and whatever other centres they congregated in.  But there, at least, they were able to pick up at least a whiff from behind the seminary walls of what the outside world was like.  Bad luck deprived us even of that.</P>
      <P>The whole question of trying to export some product to the outside world presupposes a knowledge of the tastes and standards of the outside world and the kind of products it wants and needs.  It was and is futile to suppose that just because we produce something which is unique in its own way, like báinín tweed, the rest of the world will beat a path to our doors and buy and wear it.  They will not.  The basis of the disadvantage which I am trying to outline is that we suffer from this isolation which others have also suffered from but managed to overcome for commercial reasons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I shall mention just three peoples in the modern world, two of them industrially very potent forces, the other not so much so, who also suffered from being a peripheral people culturally and economically. The Russians in the time of Hugh O'Neill and for 100 years after that were <Col N="660" /> an incredibily backward people, industrially and in every other way.  Peter the Great recognised that.  He had enough gumption, basic literacy, intelligence and training to see that his country would never get anywhere industrially&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because we do not speak out on occasions like these and do not try to examine the underlying substrata of our bad luck and bad performance that we do not really set about improving matters.  The Czar of Russia went to western Europe and worked as a shipwright in the Netherlands and learned something about western technology. When he got to western Europe he was more ignorant that the humblest of Dutch citizens.  He humbly recognised that fact, and threw open his country to western technology, inviting and encouraging the immigration of German and Scottish engineers.  He did not worry about racial purity, or whether these immigrants were going to be able to speak the language, or anything of that nature.  He threw down the walls which geography had placed around his country and, although we still think of Russia as backward and although the dreadful political system there forces upon them a society in which industry is inefficient and does not deliver to the consumers what they want, even as long ago as the outbreak of the First World War the Russian industrial economy was number six in the world league.  That was no mean place in 1910 or 1914.  They ranked only behind the United States, Britain, Germany and probably France and Italy. They were miles ahead of other countries which might have been thought of as more advanced industrially.  That was done by a conscious policy of trying to overcome the effects of isolation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Japanese are a much more familiar example.  They deliberately decided in the middle of the last century that they could not go on living in a medieval feudal society, and went about a process of <Col N="661" /> modernisation which perhaps many now romantically regret.  They deliberately copied western modes, producing initially very shoddy copies of western products.  I remember as a child, and the Chair will too, that Japanese was a byword for something shoddy&mdash;a toy which would smash the first time you tried to play with it.  All Japanese articles were then cheap and poor, but they were on their way.  Perhaps there are Japanese who now wish that they had not come so far so fast, for reasons of environment, cultural alienation and so forth.  Industrially, they have come a huge distance, by doing something which did not come naturally, which necessitated departing from age old modes of thought, dress and production, in giving the world what the world will buy.</P>
    <P>The Turks are the third example.  They are not a great industrial power, but who can tell if they are not on the way to being one?  Half of the factories in western Germany are half-manned and staffed by Turks.  The Turks were under the disadvantages, as their great leader, Ataturk, saw it, of being culturally and economically peripheral to Europe.  He made them scrap the Arabic writing which they used for their language, he made them scrap their veils and their fezes, making them dress like western Europeans.  That was, I suppose, a brutal thing to do to people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The point that I am trying to make is that we suffer in a diminished degree, or it is not perceived as being anything but a diminished degree, because of a common language.  We suffer from a comparable cultural and economic peripherality, if there is such a word, with that suffered by Russia and Japan in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  It is disguised from us because we wear collars and ties &mdash; at least people of my generation do &mdash;and because we use the English language.  But in our minds there is peripherality.  Most of us do not have a clue about the standards <Col N="662" /> applied and which come naturally to products, time-keeping, standards of work and methods of management in a country as near to us as Belgium or Holland. We are as cut off from the standards of Belgium and Holland as Peter the Great was from the standards of England in the time of Queen Anne.  We scarcely know more about it than that.</P>
      <P>We have a dim idea that the continentals work very hard.  we can see for ourselves on our rare visits there that the traffic rush in the morning starts about an hour earlier than it does in Dublin.  We can see all that in a general sort of way, but we have not really got through our heads what it is the foreigners are about, what it is the people further away from us than the British &mdash; we have a dim notion of what the English are about and their standards nowadays are not very great &mdash; are all about.  We think that if we can achieve 70 per cent or 80 per cent of the British scale we are doing very well.  We are not doing well enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have said this in an educational debate, and I am saying this now in the notional presence of the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, who is not present at the moment.  It would not be beneath the Minister or beneath his Department to see if they can, between themselves and the Department of Education, contrive some pattern in Irish education which will oblige the coming generations to be more conscious of the outside world, to be able to deal with them linguistically and to be at home in it in a way in which Irish people are not now.  The reason I feel I can speak on this with a little authority &mdash; I do not say I have much authority &mdash; is because I spent about eight years of my life abroad, about five years in England and three or four in Germany, and I believe I know a fair bit about the standards of both countries.  It is on the basis of that that I say that we are trying to export Irish industrial products when our knowledge of, acquaintance with, feeling for and capacity to be at home in the outside world is so limited.  I say that naturally with regret, and with very great gratitude to the university whose scholarship allowed <Col N="663" /> me to spend a good and formative part of my youth on the Continent.</P>
    <P>I believe the advantage a young person has from that, whether he goes on a scholarship or is forced to do so by the kind of things that compel him, emigration or anything like that, is enormous.  The advantage for the country is enormous also.  The advantage which would be derived here by a deliberate programme run by this Department, with or without the Department of Education, to improve linguistic capacity among Irish people, to direct language teaching and training among our people with the specific purpose of providing a pool from which people can sell and push Irish products abroad would be enormous.</P>
    <P>I have said in this House before and I want to repeat this briefly now, that I remember when I was Minister in this Department receiving a deputation of Japanese businessmen from a body called Keidanren.  It is a sort of national chamber of commerce; as far as I could grasp, that is what it was about.  These 20 gentlemen came to the Department and we sat about and talked about Irish and Japanese trade.  My Department, as always, had briefed me very well and I naturally raised the question of difficulties Irish exporters experienced in trying to penetrate the Japanese market.  The Japanese spokesman said, with the inscrutable politeness for which the people of the East are famous, &ldquo;Of course, just to take one simple instance, how many of your exporting businessmen are able to speak Japanese?  I know it is a very difficult language, but it is just as difficult for us to learn English.  We do it because we have to do it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>One of the things which is holding us back is that we have a very low absurdity threshold, we are inclined to laugh very easily at something which may be put in an amusing way but is no joke at all.  I am not suggesting that there should be any sort of compulsory training in Japanese. I am not so absurd as to suggest that, but I suggest that there should be some thought given officially to enable us to turn out year after year a number &mdash; I do not say thousands &mdash; of commercially <Col N="664" /> oriented young people who are able to speak that language.  What is so ridiculous about it?  Where is the absurdity of it?  The same goes for Arabic and Russian and the same goes for the other languages of the Far East, Chinese, Malay and other languages which are spoken by hundreds of millions of people.  If we are sitting at the fireside with a cap over our ear laughing toothlessly at a suggestion like that, we are absolutely doomed industrially, and no amount of talk about State job creation, or the super-levy will make any difference to that.  If we think it is beneath us or beyond us to do things which we have never attempted to do before and to think in terms of force &mdash; I am speaking in the sense of force as one forces a plant and I do not mean forcing in relation to an individual's free choice &mdash; unless we can force-grow, capacities and skills of that kind we will not really make an impact, let alone do what everybody here wants to do, try to make some permanent dent in the unemployment rate.</P>
    <P>When we look at the returns for the Department of Education we find that they show that far more children take French in the leaving certificate than take German.  I believe the ratio is six or seven to one.  That ratio shows the opposite of the relative importance of these two foreign economies to us.  The German one is the more important to us.  We have had far more industrial investment from Germany and we sell the Germans more of our goods.  I do not complain about it, in fact I respect it, but we have the classical tradition of academic freedom. People can learn what they like, the human personality must be allowed to unfold in a way which is most suited to itself and that implies allowing people to take whatever subjects they feel fitted to take in school.  But that is not the reason why German is behind French here.  It is because of a tradition going back to the same tradition which produced French-speaking governesses in the last century. It was the polite language in the eighteen thirties, forties and fifties when secondary schools were getting going here.  It was the language of diplomacy, fashion, politics and so on.  Before anybody <Col N="665" /> thought in terms of marketing things abroad it was the natural language to teach the children of people who were able to afford to send them to the Sisters of Mercy or the Holy Ghost Fathers here. It is no longer the natural choice except, perhaps for literary reasons, but most certainly not for economic reasons. When we find something like that happening we should be able to take that problem by the scruff of the neck and do something about it.  The same goes for the non-existence of language teaching at secondary level in virtually any language outside the four or five leading European ones.  Even as between the European ones there are other discrepancies I could go into.</P>
    <P>That attitude is perfectly appropriate to an inconsiderable province of a larger economy in the central parts of which the main decisions were made about prosperity; but it is quite out of place in a country which depends for its economic life on making goods and providing services which the rest of the world want and will buy.  We must think in terms of ensuring a certain number of our young people going abroad as much as possible, even for holiday jobs to which they have to hitchhike.  I do not mind at what level they go, but the more we can make sure they get acquainted with the standards of work, production, punctuality, management and work practices on the Continent and elsewhere, and the more they familiarise themselves, perhaps for economic reasons, with foreign languages, particularly those that are significant to us in the modern world, the quicker we are going to make headway in this export area.</P>
    <P>A system of education, and a general mental outlook such as I have described, is the biggest single handicap CTT have. It is like a millstone around their necks. They are trying to sell the products of a people who are not educationally, racially or spiritually disposed to understand what the big outside world is all about and to want to do business with it with their heads up, on equal terms, eye-ball to eye-ball, speaking the other man's language, going into the other man's office <Col N="666" /> and talking to him across a desk in his language.</P>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála have to deal with businessmen 95 per cent of whom are not able to do that.  If they go as far as Cologne or Frankfurt they are at the mercy of whatever grasp of the English language their German business partner there has. That is a hopeless handicap.  An economy which depends on exports is handicapping itself out of the race unless it recognises that.</P>
    <P>Although it was a depressing thing to read of the Irish potato producers who went to the food fair in Cologne last month and left dejected and downcast, it was something to know that, even at this late stage, they had got to grips with what people in that gigantic and rich market will buy and are being offered by others. The potato growers returned home from that fair dejected, and said that Irish vegetable growers &ldquo;had not even arrived at the fair&rdquo; let alone be in a good position to sell a beast.  That recognition is worth tons of Ministerial scripts.</P>
    <P>They paid their fare out of their own pockets, but it was worth the money to travel there to see what the rest of the world is able to produce and take for granted in terms of standards, cleanliness, grading, presentation and the other things that are important in the food business. I was sorry that those grown men had been permitted by the State to reach adulthood, many of them maturity, without knowing the standards that exist abroad or the standards that are expected in the markets we are trying to reach. That is a sad reflection on us all.  The Minister, present in spirit in the Chamber in the friendly but substitute embodiment of Deputies O'Brien and Barrett, would be doing the country a great service if he put his mind, if necessary in conjuction with the Minister for Education, to answering the question, how can we make sure that Irish school-leavers, instead of pitifully queueing up by the tens of thousands for clerkships or junior jobs in the public service, get into a frame of mind that will drive them out to sell something which perhaps nobody else has thought of making.  That is what we need for our economy.  The talk about <Col N="667" /> the State investing huge sums of money in this and that can be left until later.</P>
    <P>We must provide first the disposition, mental capacity and educational ability to do this, and then we can talk about where the funds should be put.  Some weeks ago Deputy Mac Giolla spoke about Irish products, about the failure of but agree with him.  He referred to our pitiful range of cheese products compared to what can be seen in countries where cheese is popular.  The fault for all this lies in the fact that Irish people do not know what other people take for granted, want and will buy.  Deputy Mac Giolla's prescription is different from mine.  He feels the State has not put enough money into this; but the State could pour hundreds of millions into this, and if the money is controlled by people whose own standards are no more instructed than the standards of those who have been in the food business up to now, the money will be wasted.  While Deputy Mac Giolla's recognition of the ills is accurate, I would not support his cure, which is a long way down the road and at present would not represent a cure at all.</P>
    <P>I do not have any fault to find with the Bill and I should like to thank CTT for the happy months &mdash; I wish I could say years &mdash; I spent in partnership with them. I wish CTT every success in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Our marketing arrangements, particularly for horticultural produce, are not successful. The arrangements have been haphazard and our farming organisations must accept some blame for this.  Some citizens hold the view that the State should provide money for everything but I do not agree with that.  The State could pour millions of pounds into promotion work but if the produce is not up to standard, that would represent a bad investment. Our embassies abroad could do a little more to promote Irish goods.  I do not wish to criticise all embassies but some companies have informed me that they did not get much co-operation from some <Col N="668" /> embassies.  Many embassies are very helpful and in any dealings I have had with them I found them very co-operative but some exporters feel some could be more helpful in regard to contracts and so on.  Export markets are tough today and there is no charity to be had on them. Lest anybody might think that we can export anything to such markets I should remind them that they are wrong, that we are in for a rude awakening in that respect.</P>
      <P>We have not handled our food products very well on such markets to date.  It is indeed regrettable that vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and so on have to be imported when we have an enormous tract of land on which these can be grown.  The grading of our horticultural products leaves a lot to be desired.  I have seen instances of producers putting the larger potatoes on the top and the smaller ones on the bottom.  I should remind them that they will not get away with such practices; that is not on. If they get away with it once they will not a second time.  Whether it be on the home or foreign markets I warn people that they will not get away with that kind of thing.  We should implement proper grading practices.  What we produce we should do well, exporting to foreign markets attractively prepared and packaged products making them attractive in turn to foreign purchasers.  It should be remembered that in many foreign countries their marketing is done in a very elaborate way.  I contend that many of our products are much better than theirs but that the way they prepare them, or perhaps &ldquo;gloss them up&rdquo; is the term to use, is superior and renders them more attractive to prospective purchasers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Córas Tráchtála Teo. are doing a very good job but they need the back-up of our embassies.  Indeed, many of our companies here are seeking markets beyond Europe.  In my constituency there are steel companies with markets in Saudi Arabia and Nigeria and doing very good work there.  As other speakers have said, many of these companies are in need of help because of our lack of proficiency in their languages and that is precisely where we need the back-up and help of <Col N="669" /> our embassies in conjunction with CTT. I am led to believe that many other countries' embassies abroad have their contact men at airports so that when their businessmen arrive &mdash; perhaps businessmen employing 200 or 300 people &mdash; they know they are arriving, they know the terrain intimately, they know what that company needs, what they hope to erect or whatever; they know what it is all about.  We should be doing likewise but, in many cases, we are not.  I do not want to be critical but many of our embassies take the view that theirs is merely a PRO exercise on our behalf to ensure that everything is in order.  It must be clearly emphasised that our embassies, in conjunction with CTT will have to play a larger role in export promotion in the future.  I am thinking here particularly of countries such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria and others where it is difficult to arrange and establish contracts.  Here I must congratulate some companies in my constituency who have arranged millions of pounds worth of contracts but they must receive the necessary back-up and aid.  If it has not already been brought to the notice of our embassies that they must play a more important role in the future helping us out in this important exercise it should be because undoubtedly our exports will play a most important part in our economy in the future.  Products such as beef and agricultural products generally have been the mainstay of our economy for many years.</P>
    <P>Our work practices must be the subject of some criticism because our behaviour in the worker-management relations field has not been the best of late.  When we win contracts in any of these foreign countries we must be able to supply goods, erect buildings or whatever by the prescribed deadline and if we are unable to do so when it comes to a renewal of a contract there will be a question mark over such companies and they will not win a second contract.  Such companies may lay the blame on whoever they like but it must be remembered that it is a combined effort, workers and management alike, everybody is involved, including the trade unions.  There will have to be more cohesion amongst these <Col N="670" /> groups with regard to such foreign contracts ensuring that we are able to fulfil them on target, that we are able to meet the deadline laid down and that, above all, we do and are seen to do a good job. If there happens to be a dispute taking place at home or elsewhere and we are unable to fulfil such contracts, then I warn the House there will not be a repetition of such contracts because it will be seen that we let them down, that we did not complete the job, which will operate as a major disadvantage to us.  Our competitors in the sale of produce and contracts understand all this.  Therefore, it must be brought home to all of us what we must do, because if we do not wake up it will be too late.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the CTT officials for their help to me over the years and I should like to extend qualified thanks to our embassies.  However, I would be slightly critical of some of our embassy staffs.  Instead of sitting in their offices in the various countries to which they are assigned, they should be at the airports to meet our company representatives to whom they should give every help possible. Many of our embassy staffs have been assigned to particular countries for some years and they should be there to meet company directors and sales people to render any necessary help so that we can secure contracts of benefit to our country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, which will increase the total amount of money made available to the board from £90 million to £160 million.  The figures in the Minister's speech indicate the need for a support programme, considering that the total value of our exports in 1982 reached £5,688 million and that we expect further increases of from 18 per cent to 20 per cent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>CTT are not by any means the worst of our semi-State bodies.  They have the confidence of our people, particularly the business community.  It is important to note that the management of their resources can be controlled readily, because we can see details of their expenditure on promotional and advertising. <Col N="671" /> Some of our State bodies have not got that kind of control.</P>
    <P>I should like to point to some recent criticism of alleged political or Government interference in the State bodies. This criticism has received a considerable amount of publicity.  Many of the semi-State bodies have complained about such interference.  In the magazine <i>Irish Business</i> for October last an interview with the chief executive of CTT appeared.  It referred to &ldquo;the shadow of Government control&rdquo;.  The article stated that behind the £1 million contract, the international trading fairs, the trade missions, and &ldquo;the jet jumping freedom associated with an export board there is a growing shadow falling over CTT&rdquo;.  The article referred to faceless civil servants who have been gaining steadier footholds in the working of the export board.  It referred to the &ldquo;campaign of sinister control&rdquo; which was threatening to swallow CTT autonomy and to exchange it for sub-sector status within central Government.</P>
    <P>This worry which semi-State bodies and the public might have from interference by politicians should be examined, for obvious reasons.  I am not criticising for the sake of criticism but to clear the air so that attention will be paid to the concern expressed by those people in high positions in these bodies.  They are people who have responsibility to perform to the satisfaction of the taxpayers whose money they are entrusted with.</P>
    <P>In the article I have been referring to the CTT chief executive said he could name five or six other executives who would back up what he was saying.  He said that the autonomy given to CTT when it was founded was real in the seventies, &ldquo;but it has been gradually eroded by successive administrations&rdquo;.  That is a very serious accusation.  Recently, because I dared to question whether one of our semi-State bodies was being monitored sufficiently closely, I was vilified, in the past few weeks.  It is coming to the stage when politicians should not dare to interfere, that is if politicians want to interfere.  It is fairly evident from the Minister's speech that politicians have no intention of doing that.  I was encouraged <Col N="672" /> when I read in the article&mdash;this was also stated in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 2 October &mdash; the words &ldquo;successive administrations&rdquo; in the previous five years.</P>
    <P>This always seems to happen when Labour-Fine Gael come into power: suddenly everybody says &ldquo;Hands off, we do not want political interference&rdquo;.  Because the two articles referred to interference over the years by successive administrations, and to civil servants, they may not have been referring to political interference but one must ask questions in this respect.  I am sure the Coalition do not want to interfere, indeed they should not interfere, in the running of these bodies, and therefore the chief executives of these bodies should be very careful that they do not interfere in the political process. Apparently they do not take that into account and they should be reminded of it: they should stop telling us not to interfere.  We were elected to do a certain job.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Independent</i> article stated that the politicians are elected to make the policy decisions, and the boards are appointed to implement the policy.  Is it wrong to question £1,600 million of borrowing by semi-State bodies?  Is there anything wrong in politicians asking if that expenditure is warranted?  Is there anything wrong with examining a body that is granted £230 million in one year, asking if the money is being spent wisely and if the organisation is efficient?  We were elected to be watchdogs over these organisations and I do not make any apology for asking these questions.  I am putting the organisations on notice that I intend to ask more in-depth questions in the future.  I do not believe in interfering with the running of these bodies but I am concerned about their performance, whether they are using their best efforts in the most efficient manner and whether the huge amount of moneys involved is being properly spent.  We have had examples in this House during the last few weeks of tremendous stress, argument and discussion over trying to raise maybe as little as £1 million to try to keep an industry going which employs 200 people.  If we are expending billions of <Col N="673" /> pounds and handing out budgets of hundreds of millions of pounds to these bodies, we have the right to monitor them.  We do not want to look over their shoulder, but we have the right to check that they are doing their job properly.</P>
    <P>The chief executive in CTT complained that accountability for that organisation has increased considerably because they are reporting on their activities almost monthly to the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  He quoted from the Act that CTT was set up &ldquo;to promote, assist and develop exports in any manner the board thinks fit&rdquo;.  Are chief executives of bodies telling us that they can do what they like with the money that is granted to them?  Are they saying that we have no right to check and approve of what they do?  Indeed, we do not do that very carefully in the case of Estimates which pass through this House. It is about time politicians stopped nodding through staggering amounts of £80 million and £120 million and people saying they need £60 million or £70 million for a particular venture.  Aer Lingus lost £20 million on the North Atlantic route; yet they expect to be subsidised further and nobody asks what is wrong.  Up to now the Estimates debate has been an irresponsible practice and the Estimates must be examined in greater detail.  I believe in free enterprise, mixed economy, <i>laissez faire</i> and getting on with the job, but in every phase of business people have responsibilities.  Managing directors have the responsibility for running their companies and if those companies do not perform properly they go out of business.  These bodies should be examined in the same businesslike manner.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the accessibility of business here to the CTT enterprise. In regard to other bodies, I have mentioned how difficult it is for indigenous businesses.  They have tended in the past to try to attract large foreign companies to the virtual exclusion of business people here, small businesses in particular.  CTT are not accessible to small businesses or to people in businesses who are not aware of the export opportunities or indeed could not afford to export.  It is very easy <Col N="674" /> to see why that is so.  There would be very costly travelling expenses involved in going abroad in search of markets.  Usually this is done on behalf of the business but I believe that the best people to sell are the people who are in the business and they should be given more opportunities to do that.</P>
    <P>If this five-and-a-half billion pounds of exports is attributable to the success of CTT then they should be very strongly supported.  It is assumed, because of rising exports, that a large amount of the credit is due to CTT.  The Minister referred to CTT's ability to adjust and adapt their approach to the changing needs of exporters and to the requirements of the trading environment in which exporters operate and that that has characterised the board's approach over the years.  I should like to emphasise that any semi-State body should not be afraid of scrutiny and I do not mean interference. The Minister said that the grant-in-aid provision to be made in each financial year will continue to be submitted to careful analysis and scrutiny before being included in the annual vote for his Department.  I am glad he said that because I do not think he is too sensitive to hear what I have to say about it. Anybody who has witnessed the Minister's handling of his portfolio believes that that will be done and that we will get value from his Department in the expenditure of moneys.</P>
    <P>In the last year, we have had about 2,400 companies exporting from this country, but I believe that that pool must be enlarged.  Many people do not know that they have exportable products and they need help in identifying markets from a body such as CTT to introduce them to these markets and to help to get established because, for every job that is created by importing, three jobs can be created by exporting.  This is an area to which CTT should give special attention. I do not think there is any substitute for visits to foreign markets by the personnel of the companies themselves.  Nobody knows better how to sell a product than the person who is involved in the business. There are criticisms levelled at civil servants, who are specialists in their own <Col N="675" /> jobs, by the chief executive of CTT, but CTT are using employees to do the selling and open up the markets for businessmen. The same analogy can be adopted. Their criticism of civil servants can equally be made of their employees when they do not allow or do not encourage people to make these trips themselves in the search for business.  I would urge a review of the existing forms of assistance in the context of establishing the needs of Irish business.  This body should have a special section whose task would be to encourage Irish businesses to export as opposed to the situation where perhaps 100 per cent of the staff concentrate on markets abroad.  Just as the IDA seem to have ignored the home market, CTT appear to ignore it also.</P>
    <P>Apart from the criticism in this article by the chief executive, there are some constructive suggestions that should be listened to.  He refers to the understaffing of CTT, to the lack of international marketing expertise in Irish firms and to protectionism. He refers also to the introduction of an employment support scheme whereby 93 firms were approved in terms of going abroad and getting the best personnel available.  He refers also to the attraction of the 10 per cent tax concession in terms of foreign manufacturers operating here and he expresses concern at the clawbacks by other means. These other means are taxation and the high cost of living.  The result of this is that Irish businesses as well as foreign businesses operating here are suffering badly.  On the one hand we are trying to create jobs while on the other hand we are taxing businesses to such an extent as to force them to close down.  We cannot have it both ways.  We cannot create new jobs if we continue to close down companies. In terms of the restraints on our economy now, that is a factor that cannot be ignored.  It has been brought to the attention of the Government by businesses and by individuals who are crying out for help, but they are being told that nothing can be done to help them.  We cannot go on squeezing the private sector to such an extent that it is not worthwhile even thinking about going into business. <Col N="676" /> One would want to be almost mad to consider starting a business in this country in the present situation.  Apart from being hounded in respect of taxation, a businessman is also given the unsolicited task of tax gatherer on behalf of the Government.  These problems must be faced up to because they are damaging our economy.</P>
    <P>Well-deserved credit is due to CTT for the job they have done, but let us not assume that all is well.  We must be prepared to re-examine their role.  We should increase the aid to this body if it can be proved that they can match extra allocations with growth in exports, because exports are the lifeblood of our economy.  The budget of £13.74 million in respect of CTT is not sufficient.  A prestigious and much-praised body of this kind should have sufficient moneys at their disposal to put on the right kind of show when bringing people from abroad to this country.  They should have the right type of accommodation in a central part of the city.  If one compares their budget to the £24 million that Bord Fáilte receive, one realises that the CTT budget needs to be re-examined.</P>
    <P>On the attitude of &ldquo;hands-off the semi-State bodies&rdquo;, I do not think it is the intention of this Government to interfere with these bodies.  This has been demonstrated by the various Ministers in their statements and it has certainly been demonstrated by the Minister for Industry and Energy in his dealings with the semi-State companies.  But we must have the right kind of people at the top in our semi-State bodies, people with drive and energy.  Conversely, we must reward them adequately.  Many of the people in charge of our semi-State bodies are capable of running businesses for themselves. In order to retain the best people in bodies such as CTT we need to reward them at perhaps even higher rates than they would command elsewhere.  There is a good deal of poaching of the best people in CTT.  This is because of their experience and because of the excellent work they have been doing.  They are sought after by people in industry.  We are talking of a specialised area and many of the people involved in sales and marketing <Col N="677" /> with CTT are capable of earning much higher rewards in private enterprise. That is a factor to which we should pay attention.</P>
    <P>The smaller indigenous businesses, those employing from 50 to 100 people, are crying out for opportunities.  There should be a section within CTT to help and encourage such concerns.  I know that the IDA are involved in this area but I am thinking in terms of exports.  It is in this area that CTT can play a major role in so far as making Irish people aware of what is involved in terms of exporting. People who are responsible and who are anxious to export should be encouraged in every way possible.  That is why increased aid to CTT is needed.  They should be in a position to help smaller business particularly to become involved at every level in so far as exports are concerned.  Deputy Kelly in his contribution said that experience gained abroad is invaluable.  Our business people need to have experience abroad but the small businessman cannot afford to go away on junkets.</P>
    <P>The Minister tells us that there are indications of enormous potential for the export of service activities particularly to areas such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries.  CTT will have a vital role to play in this field.</P>
    <P>How do you get to Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Middle Eastern countries?  How can small businesses even afford to go there?  You are depending on the officials of CTT to shake up those markets for you. If you are invited out there you must pay your way and that is extraordinarily expensive.  An air ticket would cost about £1,500 and you need another couple of thousand pounds for expenses.  It is the business of CTT to support those who are now not exporters here but whom we want to make into exporters.  A huge pool of revenue can be earned by doing that. Many successful small businesses all over the country have able people in them and if they were given the opportunity that would represent a tremendous return in jobs and revenue earned.</P>
    <P>The fine out-turn by our exporters of this £5.6 billion in the previous year is <Col N="678" /> attributed by the Minister to three things. These are (1) a growing awareness of the importance to Irish industry of developing new markets, (2) a growing and more professional marketing effort by Irish exporting firms; and (3) better support and assistance provided by CTT.  Those three factors are very weak.  A growing awareness in Irish industry of developing new markets supposes action which does not necessarily follow.  It is not necessarily a contributing factor.  I do not see anything concrete in that.  The second, a growing and more professional marketing effort by Irish exporting firms, raises the question: how professional is &ldquo;more professional&rdquo; when we do not measure the professional in the first place?  If in the past year, for example, we had used this professional marketing as a comparison with certain other countries' performance then we would have a barometer, but there is no barometer in here.  These are the three main reasons given for this rise to £5.6 billion, but to me it indicates the enormous amount of work and research that need to be undertaken. In this body a tremendous amount is taken for granted.  I am certain that a big contribution has been made by CTT in this £5.6 billion, but there is an assumption that they are responsible for achieving it by themselves.  If they are responsible for achieving that, then they are not being supported sufficiently in their allocation. Because of the enormous number of jobs that this £5.6 billion is contributing we should increase the budget, double it, treble it, find out what we can do with it.  If we can double that figure it will give us tens of thousands of jobs.</P>
    <P>The third point mentioned is the better support and assistance provided by CTT. These are contributory factors but as provided in the Minister's speech they are: (1) advice, (2) basic market information, (3) market research, (4) incentive grants for individual exporters and (5) organisation of national stands at international fairs.  On examining those five factors one finds that the first is weak.  The second, market information, is a strong point for an exporter.  The third, market research, is also a very strong point.  The fourth, <Col N="679" /> incentive grants for individual exporters, is helpful but limited, and cumbersome because it is very selective.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I would not give it a very high mark.  CTT personnel travel at ease and it is very difficult for individuals and members of businesses to get assistance for themselves from CTT to go travelling. CTT people travel freely and at ease and have a budget which enables them to do that &mdash; I am not saying that it is abused in any way &mdash; but that is a big limiting factor for anybody in business who is just ticking over or making a small profit and has not other people working for him.  He may long to get to such and such a place and export his products to such and such a country but he cannot afford to pay £5,000 out of the kitty to do that.  This is where CTT can contribute.  The fifth point, the organisation of national stands at international fairs, is strong, but our standards have been badly shown up at international fairs and exhibitions.  I have visited many of them around the world and I have found that very often we rate about tenth.  Now and again we rate first, but frequently we come off very badly in our displays and presentation, which Deputy Connolly has mentioned.</P>
    <P>I would like to add some points to show that I am being constructive.  To the above I would like to add contacts, introductions. Deputy Connolly also referred to this.  It is desirable that when you go to a foreign country you are met by somebody who knows people there.  Earlier this year I went to Saudi Arabia and I was met by the Irish Ambassador at the airport although I had not asked him to meet me.  I told him what I intended to do there and the next day his embassy had prepared information on all the places I intended to visit, the people I was going to see and the strength of their businesses, and provided the contacts and information.  That is exactly what should be provided.  I must say that Mr. O'Toole is an outstanding ambassador as is shown by the tremendous effort he puts into his work.  I had a similar experience in Greece where the ambassador met me and did the same for me as the ambassador in Saudi Arabia.  That is <Col N="680" /> much more valuable than a certain amount of money spent and a PR exercise. I have 25 of these brochures from different bodies&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that we get in here. That is to prove how good a job they claim to be doing.  I have said recently about another body, the IDA, that they are responsible for their PR.  They have their own huge PR programme and they can produce this stuff which says, &ldquo;Look, we are doing a great job&rdquo;.  That is not what we want.  If a person goes on a trip for a week or two, well prepared about the product he is selling, with contacts lined up and possibly with the help of the ambassador or, his staff, I should be very surprised if he does not get some business as a result.  That is the kind of job I should like to see CTT do.  It is only in the past few years that the IDA have woken up to the fact that we have been ignoring our own people while going after the multinationals.  We incur enormous expense in bringing those firms into Ireland.  We set up industrial concerns, as for instance, Ferenka in Limerick and Fieldcrest in Kilkenny, where 500 or 600 people are employed.  Everyone settles down in those areas, takes out a mortgage for house purchase and sends their children to school but a few years later the whole thing collapses.  The people are shattered and the place is devastated.  It is far better to go down the country, to take ten or 20 business people, find out what they can do and find markets for them and bring them to the markets.  The vital matter is contacts with those who may be able to help such business people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each year the various agencies cost hundreds of millions of pounds.  People have told me in the past few weeks that as a public representative I should not dare criticise the various associations and organisations.  If one organisation is given £230 million per annum to spend, surely we are entitled to question whether they are doing the job in the proper way?  We are the elected representatives.  My colleague beside me, Deputy Mervyn Taylor, and I have been trying to save a <Col N="681" /> prime industry established in our constituency. We have been fighting for two years for it and I am thankful that now it has been saved.  We have been criticised for our actions.</P>
    <P>A sum of £67 million was spent on advance factories last year but they are empty.  A sum of £78 million was spent the year before and those factories are also empty.  We were looking for a paltry £1,500,000 to employ 500 people and keep an entire town going.  The various organisations and agencies should adopt a business-like approach.  We do not want to interfere but we must be sure that the organisations are run properly.  They want us to be like a quiet, submissive wife.  We cannot stand by when things are not done in a business-like way.  The politicians must know how the semi-State bodies perform.  They must make sure that those bodies do not go down the tube, or take the country down the tube.</P>
    <P>That is the answer we must give to the chief executive in this case, in the case of the IDA, NET, CIE and the rest of them. If we could take £500 million from the billions of pounds given to the semi-State bodies it would help our budget arrangements considerably.  Enormous sums of money have been spent on semi-State bodies and this matter will have to be examined.  I should like those organisations to remember that.</P>
    <P>I referred to three factors: first, the growing awareness of the importance of Irish industry and the development of new markets; second, a growing and more professional marketing effort by Irish exporting firms and, third, better support and assistance on the part of CTT.  We live in an open economy but we have many restrictions.  We have crippling taxation and business is being squeezed.  Business firms are tax gatherers. They did not ask for the job but if they do not do it efficiently they are crucified. We have a begrudging attitude and, most of all, we lack the work ethic. Let us encourage and support each other. Let us cheer success and even reward it. Success has been a dirty word in the past and we have not rewarded it.  Who will strive for success if we do not reward it? Perhaps it is better for us all to sit at the <Col N="682" /> fireside, as Deputy Kelly said, with our cap on, no teeth and with a pipe in our mouth.</P>
    <P>Incentive, reward and satisfaction are necessary if we are to help our economy. We also need a certain sense of pride and there is opportunity here for the semi-State bodies to give that pride to Irish people.  We have a young educated population who need encouragement. During the 1970s senior politicians bragged that we had the youngest population in Europe and that our greatest asset was our youth.  However, they did not prepare for them in the 1980s.  Nowadays we hear nothing about our young people being our biggest asset.  The way we have handled the situation they are now our biggest liability.  We have not tackled the problem.</P>
    <P>Yesterday we had in this House the National Youth Council of Ireland.  They told us they represented 350,000 young people.  Those voluntary organisations are doing the job for us.  We are not tackling the problem seriously enough. Let us redress the balance between the public and the private sectors.  The private sector is crushed while the public sector is protected.  Let us tackle the problem of youth unemployment and the lack of opportunities for them.  Let us hear answers and not hope for a solution. Otherwise, the next Bill before this House will be the Youth Export Promotion Bill and CTT will be given grants to help emigration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála have done an excellent job promoting exports and reference was made in the Minister's opening statement to the fact that our exports have risen to £5.68 billion over 1982.  However, before we get too euphoric about that figure there are two things we must consider.  First of all, we must consider the level of unemployment which is running at 200,000.  The fact that our export figure may be high does not help to remedy the one crushing problem facing us at the moment where unemployment is concerned.  That unemployment figure increases apace.  Many of the unemployed are young people who find themselves in a situation in which they <Col N="683" /> have no prospects, no future, no likelihood of employment in our present economic situation.  It is of no value to them that our exports have increased to £5.6 billion with the possibility of rising again next year.  That does them no good.  It is of no assistance to them.  It does not help them one iota.  None of that money will go towards helping them.  That is the first point we must consider before we become too euphoric.  We live in the cold chill of 200,000 unemployed, the figure increasing apace and no prospect of any slowing down.</P>
      <P>The second point is that one wonders exactly how much of that £5.68 million remains in the country at the end of the day.  How is that figure disposed?  Is it not a fact that a very large proportion of it represents the profits made by the big foreign combines which have come in here with the aid of massive grants from the IDA, massive tax consessions from the Department of Finance and the profits they make as a result of those grants, loans and tax concessions exported back to the owners of the multinational corporations which take advantage of what we have to offer so long as it suits them and then take out the profits made while the going is good?</P>
      <P>It would be be a mistake to think when one sees an astronomic figure for our exports that the country is benefiting.  I wish it did.  The truth is that a very substantial proportion of that money is just passing through the tax free profit mechanisms of the multinationals, out the backdoor to headquarters elsewhere, to be disposed of and dealt with elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now that is not to say I am necessarily criticising the particular method of operation. Obviously the IDA have an important role to play but the emphasis in the past in bringing in foreign multinational firms at enormous cost to the taxpayer to finance them, plus money borrowed abroad for the same purpose, resulted in the setting up for the most part of capital intensive industries which require a great deal of capital to establish themselves but not much in the way of employment to service them.  The emphasis there has gone wrong.  We need an urgent change <Col N="684" /> of direction.  The objective of Córas Tráchtála is to promote exports.  They do valiant work in that connection.  They organise exhibitions of Irish goods abroad and so on.  That is all very important and most essential; but all the CTT promotions in the world, all the exhibitions and all the literature will avail nothing if the products being promoted are not competitive.  I have a strange feeling that if goods are competitive one will sell them abroad, promotion or no promotion. If they are not competitive no promotion will sell them.  If the man next door produces the same goods and makes them available at a lower price not all the glossy magazines in the world will sell the dearer product.</P>
    <P>This Government must implement a policy designed to ensure that conditions are such that Irish manufactures with a high labour content will sell successfully in foreign markets.  Indigenous Irish manufacturers should be encouraged and facilitated in the production of goods which will be competitive abroad.  The Government must direct their economic activity to the end that they do nothing to penalise, complicate, make difficult and more expensive the production of manufactured goods.  We rely on manufacturing industry to provide employment and so manufacturing industry should be facilitated and encouraged to provide employment, producing goods at a competitive rate to bring money into the country, money that will be retained here and used for reinvestment here to create more jobs.</P>
    <P>Looking at Government policy, not only the policy of this Government but that of previous Governments as well, one asks oneself have they directed themselves towards bending over backwards to ensure that Irish manufactured products will be competitive.  I am afraid not.  The thrust has been altogether in the opposite direction.  The thrust has been to make things more difficult, more expensive and the goods produced more expensive than they ought to be thereby helping our manufactures to price themselves out of the market, thereby ensuring that additional employment will not be created while, at the same time, week <Col N="685" /> in and week out existing employment is put at peril.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made here and elsewhere to various factors the Government control.  Reference has been made to the unnecessarily high cost of postal and telecommunications services and so on.  Most important of all is the cost of energy.  The cost of energy here is the highest in Europe.  That single factor is in my view responsible for the massive measure of our economic ills.  That single factor contributes to our unemployment figure of 200,000 unemployed, which is still rising and if something is not done, that figure with go on rising.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in regard to a number of recommendations made by a Cabinet sub-committee questions of security are involved.  It would be inappropriate to publish such sections of a report because it would alert criminal elements to what <Col N="690" /> we might intend doing.  Decisions of that nature will not be published but I should like to assure the Deputy that proposals in relation to amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act and the Criminal Justice Bill, before the House at present, the establishing of treatment centres in Jervis Street or James' Street and a whole range of other measures are being implemented. I have received additional resources from the Government to enable me to implement the various recommendations.</P>

Early in 1983 we made arrangements for a special training course in Trinity College for social work counsellors and gardaí and that course will commence on 1 January next.  We set aside, out of this year's resources, a special allocation to enable that course to commence.  My Department have had detailed discussions with the authorities at James' Street hospital with a view to setting up a treatment centre there.  Many other measures, such as amending the Misuse of Drugs Act, are ongoing and I imagine that by the end of 1984 a great deal of legislative and administrative work will have been completed.</P>

The Galway Social Services Centre in Francis Street provides a service for homeless women, with or without children by day.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul are also very helpful to homeless women who wish to obtain alternative private accommodation.</P>

      <P>My question refers to the problem faced by homeless women between 8.30 a.m. and 8.30 p.m. when there are no places for them to go.  Will the Minister indicate if a temporary facility will be provided by the Department? It is likely that the purpose-built facility he mentioned will not be ready for use for up to 18 months, assuming planning permission is granted.

      <P>There is a problem in relation to homes for elderly people and the regulations introduced in 1966 about this problem are vague and imprecise.  Is it the intention of the Minister to specify standards for such homes such as the type of bedding, fire regulations and the number of nurses to be provided or will the <Col N="693" /> Minister leave the regulations vague as they are?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The greatest need is to introduce a registration system for private nursing homes.  To do that we will have to amend the Health (Homes for Incapacitated Persons) Act, 1964.  I am preparing an overall hospitals Bill and I propose to incorporate changes in legislation dealing with private nursing homes in that.  I can assure the Deputy that I am concerned that full registration, including the control of standards, is incorporated in that legislation.  As the Deputy knows, in July 1982, the Eastern Health Board produced a report on the needs in terms of long-stay accommodation provided by private nursing homes and voluntary bodies.  My work is based on that report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be feasible at present to amend the existing regulations rather than await the possibility of an amendment of the 1964 Act?

I am particularly anxious that they should be registered &mdash; under a formal system of registration.  Under the regulations I cannot include registration.  I must amend the Act in order to have registration of the nursing homes.  As I am at present working on a Hospitals Bill &mdash; on which a great deal of work has already been done, I think it best to incorporate into that Bill the registration process and indeed to incorporate into a statute minimum standards.  It would be better to do a comprehensive job on it and a good deal of the work has already been done.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister intend in any way to effect alterations in the type of residential care available because he must be aware of the fact that most of these buildings are quite old fashioned, were designed more for the poor law type of health care which obtained many years ago than for the present day? <Col N="696" /> Is he further aware that many of these patients have no privacy, that they are literally institutionalised in the residential care homes in which they are accommodated at present?

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have menticned a particular number.  I might advise the Deputy that a review of residential care for the physically disabled began in July 1980.  A survey found that there were 1,482 people with a handicap which substantially affected their mobility in no less than 137 institutions throughout the country.  Excluding those whose primary condition was mental illness or mental handicap, who were better cared for in mental hospitals or mental handicap centres, this left 802 people whose primary handicap was physical.  Many of these appeared to be inappropriately placed.  For example, 28 per cent of them were in geriatric institutions, even though the survey was confined to people under 65 years of age, and a further 20 per cent were in mental handicap centres.  Therefore, there is a great deal of work to be done.  Perhaps we could do it were we to close down a couple of mental hospitals and spend the money in that other direction.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Cheshire Homes have done quite exceptional work.  I opened a substantial home in Bohola in County Mayo.  They are a voluntary organisation, with an enormous capacity to accumulate substantial sums of money to spend on their services, and my Department certainly look with considerable favour on their capital works and particularly on the extent to which they are able to administer their affairs, availing of the enormous goodwill there is in the country for voluntary work within such homes.  As the Deputy well knows, <Col N="697" /> the cost of employing fulltime health board nursing staff in such institutions is of great dimension.  Therefore I assure the Deputy that I look with great favour on the work being done by the Cheshire Homes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I think you will agree, Sir, that this is a vitally important issue. Is the Minister aware that all statutory and some voluntary agencies in Ireland do not draw a distinction between people being ill and in need of medical treatment and those who are physically disabled and, therefore, in need of a home with home supports?  Is he further aware that, consequently, many disabled people who are in need of a home are hospitalised for life?  Since the Minister himself has just admitted that it is a source of shame that so many of our disabled people are in mental institutions, what measures does he intend taking in the immediate future to resolve that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The first method I propose is a draft Green Paper on Services for the Disabled.  Inherently in that Green Paper there are proposals for additional capital allocations into this area.  I would make the point that if the Opposition and indeed members of the Government for that matter, insist that I should spend about £40 million a year capital on acute hospitals and not permit me to divert resources into the area of greatest need, namely the area raised by Deputies, that of the disabled, both mentally and physically handicapped, it will not be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The incessant pressure is for £50 million hospitals all over the place.  As a consequence, in recent years I estimate that we have spent £300 million to £400 million on acute hospital capital works when at least £30 million of that would have transformed the situation I <Col N="698" /> have referred to.  Psychiatric patients, disabled people, mentally handicapped people, do not have much voting power, not as much as consultants, doctors and nurses in hospitals.  Politicians, regrettably, have responded in the wrong direction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has conceded the deficiencies that exist.  Therefore, as a <i>pro tem</i> procedure, would he allow increased vocational training in these institutions so that the people in them can be treated in a more humane manner, so that they will have a better insight into the possibilities around them, so that they will not be treated as sick people who are just physically disabled but not sick.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out that a number of Ministers, notably two former Ministers of the Deputy's party, committed capital funds in some cases in irreversable directions, because the contracts were signed.  As a consequence, we now have examples, like Beaumont, where we have a £55 million hospital unopened.  It is arguable that we could have a much better facility if a substantial proportion of that money had been diverted.  We had a major expenditure of £40 million in the Mater and as the Deputy, as a member of a health board, should know it is not the Department who are at fault but Ministers for Health promising hospitals all over the country and major extensions with more beds, when that money should have been spent on the provision of the facilities the Deputy is talking about.</P>

      <P>The level of the present subvention for patients in private nursing homes is such that in many cases old people have had to give up their entire pensions to pay the balance due to the homes leaving them no money at all to provide clothing for themselves.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know that the provision of such care is very costly.  In long-stay geriatric hospitals the cost is about £27 per day and in the health board welfare homes it averages about £14 per day.  I agree that many old people in private homes have very limited means, although the charges in some homes can range upwards from £90 per week.  A contribution of £5.25 per day is made by the health boards for <Col N="700" /> category C homes and £5.15 per day for category D homes.  Undoubtedly in the case of some patients this leads to hardship and that means there must be special care in the matter of allocations by the Department.  The contribution was increased in July 1982.  A number of people put their parents or other relatives into such homes.  Admittedly those people give up their pensions, but very often thereafter they are not seen by those who put them into the homes.  In a country that professes outstanding Christianity I have received a substantial volume of representations about people who are not prepared to make any contributions towards the mother or father or brother or sister who is in such a home. They expect the Eastern Health Board to bear the whole cost.  I make a plea to such people to make some kind of contribution towards the care of the elderly, the disabled and the handicapped.  It cannot be a total health board responsibility. Unfortunately, people are left in such homes and even if they will not pay, their relatives might at least visit them.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, plans for a major rationalisation of hospital services in the Dublin area have been agreed and are being implemented. These plans involve the amalgamation of services provided at present by a number of voluntary hospitals into new and developed hospitals.  This amalgamation necessitates a review of the legal issues including charters of the hospitals involved and this is being carried out at the moment.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that a young lady, a constituent of mine, had an application for employment turned down on the basis of her religion because the Dublin hospital concerned said that their charter prohibited them from giving her an application form because of her religion?  Will the Minister undertake to ensure that that hospital will have its charter changed forthwith? I raised this matter with the Minister by way of letter and I tried to raise it in the House on a few occasions.  It is a very serious matter for the young lady concerned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am acutely aware of the points made by the Deputy.  The amendment to the charter of that hospital was approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas in 1980 but that did not alter the statement of fundamental principle that the hospital should &ldquo;remain an essentially religious and Protestant institution&rdquo;. The authority of the hospital consider that they are acting within the terms of the charter in relation to the recruitment of student nurses to their nursing school.  They have made the point, as a matter of some sensitivity, that certain elements of nurse training vary between different denominations, particularly in the area of ethics.  The Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, states that the Central Council of the Federated Dublin Voluntary Hospitals, of which this hospital is a member, shall take no action which operates to interfere with the autonomy of a nursing school attached to a particular hospital of a particular denominational character. <Col N="702" /> There are major implications in what I have said in the context of amalgamation. There will be an examination of the legal issues involved, including the charters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inclusion of asthma in the prescribed list of conditions covered by the long-term illness scheme is under constant review in my Department.  This would provide drugs free of charge to children and adults not covered by medical cards.  It is estimated that there are some 60,000 persons in this category. <Col N="704" /> Because their needs very considerably, it is impossible to give an accurate statement of cost.</P>
    <P>At present persons whose expenditure on a month's supply of medicine exceeds £23 may recover the balance over that amount from the health boards.  If only a quarter of asthma patients regularly expend that amount, the yearly cost of supplying them would exceed £4 million. The cost of supplying the others could be of the order of £3 millions, giving a total estimated cost of £7 million.  Unfortunately, the present financial circumstances do not permit the expansion of the scheme on that scale.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has stated that the inclusion of asthma in the prescribed list of conditions covered by the long-term illness scheme is under constant review in his Department.  When is he likely to make a decision on allowing this to be categorised as a long-term illness? I have no doubt he is aware that many children under 16 years of age have very severe bronchial asthma which, without wanting to sound alarmist, can be a life-threatening illness.  It is essential for them to have the necessary medications available but many cannot afford them because of the very high cost of these preparations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of including asthma in the list of prescribed illnesses is regularly before us.  As the Deputy is aware, asthma is probably the major condition which is not covered by the scheme.  Lest the Deputy should be under any illusions, however, the cost involved is considerable and I do not have any money &mdash; nor am I likely to have any in 1984 &mdash; for extending the scheme.  A very large number of people suffer from asthma and the cost of catering for it would be very considerable.</P>

      <P>When was the last addition made to the list of prescribed illnesses?

      <P>The position is that 39 per cent of the population are covered by medical cards.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of bronchial asthma, which has killed many people, will the Minister allow more flexibility to members of health boards to exercise their discretion in allowing medical cards to be supplied to patients under special circumstances? These special circumstances forms are sent to many applicants for medical cards and are filled in appropriately by patients and their doctors but it seems to take a long time before any response is obtained from the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of adoption law reform, I urge the Minister to regard this matter as urgent in light of the fact that as a result of the reduction in the number of children available for adoption there are many couples who seek to adopt children outside the State but who are uncertain as to the legal position and as to legal rights between them and any children they might adopt.</P>

In these cases the Adoption board effectively examine the matter as if it were an initial application for adoption under Irish law.  However, I accept the point made by the Deputy because at the moment there is no general statutory provision for automatic recognition of foreign adoption orders.  I share the Deputy's concern and also the concern of the Adoptive Parents Association of Ireland, some of whose members have adopted abroad.

This is one of the reasons for the delay in the publication of the Bill but I would be somewhat loath to commit myself at this stage to the publication of the review report.  The Deputy will be aware that in the area of adoption there are matters of considerable confidentiality and sensitivity which can give rise to major fears on the part of parents who have adopted children or who are contemplating adopting, or on the part of children who have been adopted.  In these circumstances I cannot commit myself to publishing the review committee's report without having seen it, having brought it to the Attorney General and to the Government.  I assure the Deputy that there will be no question of trying to suppress the review report, a report that should be of major public interest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned for lunch I was dealing with the question of the necessity for manufacturing industry to be maintained in a fully competitive way so that it would be enabled to compete with manufactured products from other countries.  I referred to the fact that if that competitive edge was not there, all the promotional work undertaken by CTT would be to no avail.  The Government recognised the need for our industry to have that competitive edge because in their statement issued from the Government Information Services on 16 June 1983, a statement on the NESC Report No. 67 on an analysis of job losses in Irish manufacturing industry, they said: &ldquo;The Government's view is that competitiveness in the widest sense is the key prerequisite for the expansion of manufacturing industry.&rdquo;  What have the Government done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have taken that key prerequisite factor in the costing of manufacturing goods, namely, the cost of energy, and they have made that the highest in Europe and the highest among all our competitors in manufacturing industry. In January of this year the cost of energy to industry was already 25 per cent higher than that pertaining to our competitors. Yet, in the budget in the middle of the year, solely as a result of impositions voluntarily imposed by the Government and the ESB, the cost of energy to manufacturers was increased by a further 10 per cent.  There is little point in the Government making a statement pointing out how vital a prerequisite is the <Col N="758" /> competitiveness of our manufacturing industry when, by their own act, they take a very serious step to render it uncompetitive.  If that course continues, the money expended on CTT is money wasted.</P>
    <P>CTT do a magnificent job but they will be unable to promote our products abroad unless the price is right.  The price cannot be right unless the ingredients that go to make up that price, a key factor of which is energy costs, are at least comparable with those of our manufacturing competitors in the EEC and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Earlier today I made reference to the fact that in the past over-reliance has been placed on the multinationals.  The Telesis Report indicated there should be a change of emphasis in the manufacturing context to smaller indigenous firms and the Government undertook to accept the report and implement a switch in emphasis to smaller indigenous firms.  I wish they would indicate when they propose to do that.  It is most important that they do it if we are to make any dent at all in the horror of the unemployment figures we have and those in prospect. The need for Córas Tráchtála to place particular importance on the smaller indigenous firms is vital.  The multinationals have their own marketing arrangements.  They have their markets readymade and they use the facilities provided for them here &mdash; massive grants from the IDA, tax concessions and so on &mdash; as a vehicle for their profit expansion and they duly export those massive profits when they earn them.</P>
    <P>I want now to turn to another aspect of the work of Córas Tráchtála and I must express some surprise at finding there is no reference to it in the Minister's opening statement.  One of the key problems surely that Córas Tráchtála must be faced with in trying to promote goods of Irish manufacture abroad is the wall of protectionism thrown up in Europe and elsewhere against our products.  The growth of this development must be very seriously hampering the development of our industry, causing us many thousands of jobs and serious losses in earning resources which we would enjoy were these walls of protection not there.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="759" /> The extent of the problem was examined in a report of the Council of Europe, Document No. 5052, published on 19 April 1983, an excellent report put together after extensive examination of the situation by teams of experts under the auspices of the Council of Europe Executive in Strasbourg.  The report notes that the volume of international trade levelled off in 1981 and went down in 1982.  Its resolution noted also that in its view additional non-tariff barriers to trade were largely responsible for this situation and, despite appeals by OECD and GATT, the international trading system is becoming less liberal and more protectionist.</P>
    <P>Again, at page 19 of the report, after an exhaustive review of the extent of the protective measures thrown up in the field of international trade, the report came to this remarkable conclusion: in world terms between 51 and 55 per cent of total imports are subject to restrictions. That will give some indication of one key problem facing our exporters and facing the work of Córas Tráchtála. What are these measures that are thrown up?  They list some of them at page 20 of the report.  They talk about administrative harassment, health regulations, industrial standards, legal obstacles, economic and commercial sanctions, and they go on to say that in a recent survey the GATT secretariat identified more than 600 non-tariff measures.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not refer to this problem in his opening statement but Córas Tráchtála published an article on this subject in their magazine &ldquo;Export Review&rdquo; in volume 2, No. 2 of June 1983.  They pointed out at page five that the momentum towards further trade liberalisation appears to have been dissipated with the conclusion of the prolonged and exhaustive Tokyo round of GATT negotiations, 1973-1983.  Their assessment of the extent was that protective action relating to more than one-fifth of world trade manufacturers have been taken since the conclusion of the Tokyo round.  They said that, despite the Tokyo agreement, there is increasing resort to non-tariff barriers to provide protection for home industry. <Col N="760" /> They are particularly important in the EEC context where tariff and quantitative restrictions are generally prohibited by the Treaty of Rome.  They refer to bureaucratic delays and bottlenecks and customs documentation and give as a simple example the shortlived French requirement that Japanese videos should be processed through the little known customs post of Poitiers.  They refer also to the requirement to use indigenous language and packaging as being another favourite ploy.</P>
    <P>There are ploys in plenty and they are no joke.  They are not funny where our industries are concerned, where our employment is concerned and where our prospects for the future are concerned. They point out that even West Germany is not above giving under-the-counter protection to its home industries particularly through the extensive network of technical standards administered by laboratories controlled by the German industry in question.</P>
    <P>Here then is the problem with which Córas Tráchtála are faced in promoting our industries abroad.  The reports indicate how widespread this is and it must surely be taking a drastic and very serious toll of our potential to manufacture and export.  Where are the indications of our response to that situation?  Where is the indication in the Minister's opening statement and Government statements generally of the urgent and vital action that must be taken if we are to have our industry, burdened as it is by over-high energy costs, survive faced with the unfair competition to the extent I have outlined?  I have seen statements from time to time that representations are being made at various levels.  The Taoiseach and the junior Minister in Foreign Affairs raised it at a conference in, I think, Munich, but there is no indication that there is any let-up in this wall of protection facing our exporters with which Córas Tráchtála has to contend, with which Irish industry has to contend burdened as it is by the weight of excessive energy costs, excessive postal and communications charges.  The burden is too great.  Is it any wonder our industries are falling by the wayside like skittles. <Col N="761" /> Not a week passes but one, two or three industries fall, factories close, more go on the dole, more prospects are gone, more homes are broken up.</P>
    <P>It is time that the Government and CTT indicated to those EEC countries and others who put up these protections that enough is enough, that a halt is now being called, that two can play at that game, that for too long we in this country have been the good boys of Europe in the field of trade, that unless there is some indication of faith on their part and a genuine liberalisation of the movement of goods and free trade we will be left with no choice but to examine ways and means of ensuring some measure of protection for our own weak industries.  Let us not under-estimate the purchasing power at home.  It is substantial in many fields but in some areas we have no capacity to manufacture goods we urgently need such as paper, for example, although I hope that situation will be remedied before too long.</P>
    <P>These are reasons which are contributing to the 200,000 people on the dole queues.  That is the task facing Córas Tráchtála.  Now is the time for action.  Let us bring our industry up to a competitive level as a prerequisite and let us bring our energy charges at least to a state of parity with those of our competitors. When this matter is raised the Government say that reliance is placed on the ESB as a revenue raiser but this is a grave and serious mistake which is counter-productive and does not achieve that object. The effect is to reduce the competitiveness of our manufacturing industry. Some companies are unable to compete and many go to the wall.  The additional revenue temporarily raised by the increased cost of energy is immediately lost in redundancy and social welfare payments. The maintaining of the competitive edge of our industry produces wealth through exports as a result of which employment is maintained and tax is collected from the workers and from the companies.  The net effect of high energy charges is a loss of revenue, not a gain.</P>
    <P>Immediate and urgent action is required to break down the wall of protection against our industries and if these <Col N="762" /> matters are not tackled we will remain at the top of the unemployment league.  It can be said that top of unemployment league equals highest energy costs equals protection against us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity provided by this Bill to say something about our exports.  At a time when the country has been experiencing so many difficulties the overall performance of our export industries has been against all the trends and has provided a life-line to an otherwise ailing economy.  Any study of the export figures conveys a pattern of striking achievement and for that we have good reason to be grateful to the exporters themselves and to the supporting State agencies, particularly the IDA and CTT.</P>
      <P>Although this background of achievement is impressive and provides a firm base for future development, it should not be regarded as more than a kind of launching paid from which to go forward rapidly.  There are still enormous and largely untapped resources in our export drive.  Unlike some other countries, exports are not for us a luxury or a means of disposing of surplus production but an absolute imperative, central to our whole future economically.  While our home market is relevant, we cannot ever hope to absorb anything like our potential production. Our manufacturing and service industries cannot grow and provide increased employment unless to they can sell more and more of their products abroad.  That is what the Bill is designed to assist and as such I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Export growth and job creation are synonymous and there is no alternative which provides the remotest prospect of offering a gainful and fulfilling future to the legions of the unemployed and the rapidly expanding young work force.  We either export or die.  That is the challenge and how we meet it will affect the future of every family.  Our standard of living depends on the level of exports and this is not always understood.  What are we going to do about it?  There are two matters to which I will address myself.  One is the question of getting our house in order at home.  If we are to use and <Col N="763" /> improve the marketing skills of CTT we must be sure that we have a product which is acceptable and saleable in world markets.  Irrespective of ideologies there is no escaping the view that there are some basic imperatives.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to competitiveness.  What does that mean? It means some unpalatable choices and some decisions to which we have not been accustomed.  It means moderate inflation and high productivity.  We must give a continuing and higher priority to education and training.  Education is always a soft target during a recession but I hope that the area of education for employment will be seen as untouchable in regard to expenditure cuts.  It is an absolute prerequisite for the new type of industrial development.  We must go for the best and latest technology and not be afraid of it.  We must get over the notion that technology is to be feared because of the immediate job losses it sometimes gives rise to.  That has always been the case since the time the plough was invented and it has always been wrong. We must have enlightened, firm and fair management that commands respect and is seen to get results.  We must have better industrial relations and eliminate restrictive practices particularly where they lead to cost increases.</P>
    <P>We must do something better about our design.  We need better design comparable to the best in world markets and we need impeccable quality.  It is important that we try to equate Irishness with quality and excellence.  The Government, and some of their agencies, must be got off the back of industry, as mentioned by Deputy Taylor.  In that regard I should like to refer to the crippling effects of personal taxation at all levels. It is killing incentive and the reasons why people take risks and work hard.  The cost of energy, and some other State services, is placing exporters at an impossible disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> their competitors. The Government must address themselves to those matters.</P>
    <P>We are expecting the Government to produce an industrial policy shortly and <Col N="764" /> I hope it looks carefully at the impact of the present levels of taxation and the on-costs that have been piled on to industry for energy, postal services and a range of other services.  If the plan does not deal with those we will be blowing against the wind and spending money through CTT and other agencies when we cannot succeed.  We must get the product right and competitive.  We need to rediscover the work ethic and get again some sense of the dignity of work.  We must develop some sort of national consensus and a sense of purpose on what we are about. That is the key to everything else and is a challenge to leadership, politicians and others.</P>
    <P>The matters I have outlined may seem to represent an impossible dream but I have not mentioned anything that has not been done by another island nation at the other end of the world, the Japanese. They succeeded in more trying circumstances. We are not looking to the nation to do something that is not on.  We are looking to it to do something that others have done.  In our predicament we have to do those things.</P>
    <P>Parallel with those moves we need to give a higher priority to the place of marketing in our export effort.  We need to have a whole new approach to marketing, giving it a greater priority at Government and company levels.  Despite the impressive record of many Irish export companies in recent years we have largely failed to create any broad international awareness of Irish products.  I accept that there are notable exceptions to that general statement but they could be counted on the fingers of one hand.  We must ask ourselves why.  My view is that we have given insufficient priority to the subject of marketing and, as a consequence, there has been a lack of investment in it and in the incentive to so invest.  We need to alter those priorities to give marketing of our exports a higher rating.  It follows that marketing will have to get a greater allocation of available funds from the State and individual companies.</P>
    <P>Where is the money for such high risk to come from?  Marketing is implicitly a high risk business because if the strategy fails the total marketing investment is <Col N="765" /> always lost.  We are talking about very sizeable figures.  I should like to quote an example which was referred to by the most successful Irish marketing wizard of all, Dr. Tony O'Reilly.  In the course of a speech in Dublin recently he said that no product, concept, country or service could achieve national consumer recognition in the United States without an expenditure on marketing totalling approximately $100 million over a five to seven year period.  That puts the whole matter into perspective.  It goes without saying that only the large multinational companies here could contemplate expenditure of that order.</P>
    <P>How do we deal with this?  Small countries have a problem in international market places and big countries have an enormous advantage in that they have huge home markets, big company structures and large marketing budgets.  We have a relatively tiny home market and we must export to survive.  It is because we are at that disadvantage that we must look at this as a national question.  However, we can do certain things.  We spend in total, between the IDA, AnCO and CTT, sizeable sums of money and it should be possible, if national priorities were reordered somewhat as they should be, to give greater emphasis to grant aid for marketing and less in grants for fixed assets such as buildings and machinery. That ought to be considered in the new industrial policy and debated in the House.  It is not too difficult for potential industrialists to borrow against fixed assets.  Any lender, given a reasonable proposal, would be happy to lend against the security of buildings and machinery but few of them would be willing to lend money against a marketing programme because the repayments of any money lent would depend solely on the success of the marketing project.</P>
    <P>Even in present financial circumstances we should consider injecting greater funds into this sector even at the expense of other desirable State objectives.  In addition to straight financial aid the State should also consider loan guarantees and interest subsidies to companies borrowing for approved marketing schemes.  If a marketing scheme is successful a problem <Col N="766" /> does not arise and there is no good reason why the State should be expected to cough up the greater part of the cost. However, the State should consider giving a proportion of the cost and, in addition, give some loan guarantees against loss in the event of a marketing strategy failing.  I am referring to a professionally prepared, well researched and agreed strategy.  If that went wrong it is reasonable that the Government, instead of giving larger grants, should consider providing loan guarantees and interest subsidies.  That idea was referred to recently also by Seán Condon of CTT in a paper which he read at UCC and is worth considering.</P>
    <P>The question of tax arises again, the need for greater tax incentives both in respect of marketing schemes for companies and at the level of personal taxation with regard to marketing personnel. In the latter case consideration might well be given to offering some tax exemption, or reduction, to individuals related to the number of days spent abroad each year marketing Irish products.  If we expect people to travel abroad, go away from their families, live out of suitcases, stay in different types of accommodation, rush from plane to plane and be subject to such pressured conditions &mdash; it is not a glamorous business; it might be for the first month but people soon tire of it &mdash; it is reasonable that they and their efforts be recognised within our tax system.  They are doing a job certainly for themselves but a massive one for the whole of the country if they do it well.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer now to some ideas the Taoiseach himself mentioned on a number of occasions in the past and to reactivate them.  He spoke a few times about national economic planning, the need to make it a really meaningful rather than an academic exercise.  I agree with that sentiment.  He went on and talked about setting up what he referred to as sectoral committees to be placed under the direction of a Minister of State in each case with the object of ascertaining directly what people in the field are thinking and what they want by way of support of their own and State effort.  In the field <Col N="767" /> of marketing I suggest that that process should begin sooner rather than later, that the economic Departments of Government, together with the other relevant semi-State agencies, should be sitting down now with exporters to agree and co-ordinate a new upgraded marketing strategy for our exports.  We always seem in this country to be one plan away from action.  There is no need for any more planning.  We know what is needed. We need highly sophisticated, upgraded international marketing strategy to assist companies in the most constructive way possible.  The best way is to sit down and talk to them about it, then develop our strategy and get on with it.  Irrespective of what proves to be our policy or economic planning in the years ahead, everybody is aware that we must continue to radically and rapidly expand our exports. Therefore, we should get on with that.  It should be remembered that marketing exports is an expensive and high risk activity.  The stakes are high in every sense but so also is the prize.  In simple terms that prize is this: success in this field offers the only real prospect of breaking the vicious unemployment spiral and of providing a prosperous and stable economy in the years ahead.  That is the measure of the challenge: to rapidly and radically develop what I believe to be the enormous and, as yet, untapped potential of exports.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is one worthy of considerable thought and is certainly one in which people throughout the country will be interested.  It increases the statutory limit on funds to CTT for the purpose of enabling them perform their export promotion functions.  Córas Tráchtála are performing a very difficult job selling our products throughout the world.  Unless we as a nation are fit to export our products then we shall be unable to survive economically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many fields have been opened up to us since our entry into the EEC.  We have made some significant inroads in some new markets available to us.  But we must examine closely whether or not we have utilised fully the opportunities for exporting <Col N="768" /> that have been presented to us.  I have no doubt but that we have not achieved some of the enormous potential benefits obtaining.  In this respect I am not blaming this or any other Government.  As a nation, over the past five or eight years we have allowed ourselves lose our competitiveness <i>vis-à-vis</i> neighbouring countries. That fact has become obvious to most people.  Our cost price factors are such that it is very difficult for our industrialists to survive the cold winds of competition.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill should prove of some help and benefit to Córas Tráchtála.  I applaud their efforts in the difficult task of obtaining markets and selling our products throughout the world generally.  However, improvements could be effected at the CTT level.  But the basic fact of life is that we as a nation must endeavour to render ourselves positively competitive.  This can come about only through determined effort by the Government, employers, trade unionists and all involved.  In many respects our costs are higher than in many of our neighbouring competitor countries and this is hampering our exports.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I hope for a very determined effort by all involved to try to reduce our costs.  We have very little room for manoeuvre unless we do this.  As a small nation on the fringes of Europe we have certain attractions to offer to outside industrialists to come here to manufacture and to export their products. However, we should constantly be looking at markets for our own produce which, as I said, are being hampered by our costs.  We must face up to the fact that we are not competitive <i>vis-á-vis</i> our competing countries in regard to similar goods.</P>
    <P>Many of our industrialists, particularly those in the textile trade, engage in importing goods for processing and reexporting. They face enormous customs clearance problems and delays not only in respect of goods clearance but in the matter of taxing.  There is too much red tape and bureaucracy involved, with consequent lengthy delays.  Indeed sometimes such exporters get the impression that instead of working with and for <Col N="769" /> them, the State bodies concerned are against them.  We all know that is not so but people are so frustrated by this that they are suggesting a big effort should be made to cut down on bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I have done some limited travelling overseas.  Some years ago in Europe and in other parts of the world one came across such products as Kerrygold butter, Irish cheese and other dairy produce in shops, hotels and restaurants.  In those years I felt certain we would succeed in finding many markets abroad for these products.  Bord Bainne had laid the basis for expansion.  In the meantime we have not continued to find new markets.  We have not exploited the potential markets available to us.  Therefore, there must be more determined efforts to spearhead a new campaign of sales for our dairy produce because we have not availed of opportunities open to us to sell abroad our excellent produce which looks so attractive in overseas supermarkets where they are sold at the moment.</P>
    <P>We will be lost if we do not succeed in selling our produce in the major European capitals for a start.  CTT have been making significant efforts but they have much leeway to make up.  I compliment the Minister for Agriculture in this respect but much more needs to be done in the exports sphere.</P>
    <P>On the other hand it is most discouragain to visit our supermarkets here and see on their shelves imported dairy products from Britain and other European countries.  We see imported biscuits and many other imported household items.  It is frustrating when one thinks of our excellent products for which we are not finding markets abroad.  We should be large exporters of these products instead of importers.  There is something seriously wrong and we must examine our consciences.  As I have said, we have not availed of or exploited foreign markets, particularly in relation to beef, lamb and pork.</P>
    <P>We must get our farming organisations, our trade unions and different Government bodies together to take a major initiative in the matter of finding foreign markets for our produce.  The <Col N="770" /> opportunities are there if we exploit them.  If we continue to import items which could be produced at home there is little hope for our export campaign. We must get our act together; we must try to create the climate for exports.</P>
    <P>Another field crying out for attention in the matter of exports is Irish whiskey. There are also the Guinness products, plus Irish gin and other spirits, and there are potential markets available for them. We have not succeeded in benefiting from the market for so many items that are available to us in the exports of Irish whiskey, Irish creams and gin.  Some years ago, these items were more freely on sale in Britain and Europe than they are now.  I do not know if we are even retaining the existing market but, from visiting different countries, I feel we are slipping in this respect.  There is scope for enlarging our exports of items produced by Irish Distillers, Guinness and others.</P>
    <P>There have been some commendable efforts.  Bailey's cream has got a major hold on the European and American markets.  Irish Mist has also made an impact in these markets.  However, these are the exceptions rather than the rule and there is potential there if the proper marketing effort is made.  Córas Tráchtála can improve their efficiency and export promotion efforts in that field.</P>
    <P>We should put a stop to the smuggling of spirits, beer, bottled stout, ale and so on.  These items are coming in by the lorry load and, on occasion, by the boat load.  They are harming our markets and causing a problem for people who do not wish to buy products that are brought in illegally.  We have many difficult problems facing us at present.  The efforts made in the area of exports promotion are welcome and must be assisted in every respect if a greater effort is to be made to sell our products overseas.  There have been significant improvements in our balance of payments in regard to imports and exports over a number of months and it is important that these figures are maintained.  We must provide the necessary capital to enable CTT to continue their work for the development of our export markets.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="771" /> I wish the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Industry and Energy well in the difficult task they are facing.  The two Ministers concerned are facing many difficulties now but they and their Ministers of State have initiative, enterprise and foresight. They have overall responsibility for the policies and duties of these export promotion bodies and I am sure they can get us out of the difficulties which we are now facing and restore a proper balance in which we will have a major increase in our exports over the next couple of years. I wish them well in their efforts and I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): I welcome the opportunity of making a few comments on this important Bill for two reasons.  First, it gives us the opportunity of pointing out the good work being done by Córas Tráchtála and it gives me the opportunity of pointing out a few factors which will help to lift some of the doom and gloom hanging over us at present and which some people seem to have a vested interest in seeing continues to hang over us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have made tremendous strides over the last couple of years through the good work of CTT and the IDA.  The fruits of that work are now seen in the recent figures produced by the Central Statistics Office.  Last month exports amounted to £660.5 million compared to £520.3 million in 1982.  For the 12-month period ending in October 1983, our exports amounted to £6,619.9 million compared to £5,542.7 million last year. We are up £1,077.2 million in exports this year.  This shows tremendous hope for the future and we are capable of producing items that we can export and which can compete in the world markets despite the many criticisms that are levelled at Irish industry.  It also highlights the wise policy adopted by the IDA over the past couple of years.  They have attracted industries here which are now beginning to produce goods which can be exported and which can be of benefit to the nation. However, I do not think we should be <Col N="772" /> complacent because we are passing this Bill giving more assistance to CTT to continue the work of promoting, assisting and developing Irish industries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> I should like to say to the Deputy that I do not regard this as a party issue and I think he had some positive things to say.  We should all boost our country at a time when people are on their knees.  It is not good enough to get your books right; it is important to motivate people and to give them some hope.  We tend to ignore the good things that are happening, which will eventually bring back the level of decent employment to a stage where the vast majority, if not all, people will be doing a day's work.  I do not think we can take these matters in isolation. There is a long way to go and the Government have a duty and responsibility in explaining to the public what our economic policies really mean.  It is not just a question of balancing books.  It is a question of cutting out waste and cutting back on expenditure which we cannot afford.  In doing so, we will bring back some incentive through our tax system; we can reduce the level of personal taxation so that people will have an incentive to work if work is available in the form of overtime or weekend work.  Our taxation system must be equitable and all people must pay their fair share so that the PAYE sector will not carry the full burden.  All this is relevant to the Bill we are debating because we cannot expect Córas Tráchtála and the IDA to perform miracles.  If we are not competitive we cannot export because we cannot produce the items we can sell abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to our education system we must ensure that the necessary changes are made to gear people to the modern world and to give them the skills that are necessary to manufacture those goods we can sell abroad.  Marketing is one area in which we have made some effort, albeit belatedly, to improve our education system but if we are to compete in the wide world outside we must also have regard <Col N="773" /> to the quality of the items we produce. We must ask ourselves if we are paying sufficient attention to quality whether in the area of foodstuffs or in any other area.  We must ask ourselves whether we are giving value for money.  Too often I have known of industries where there was a tendency in good times to increase profit margins instead of maintaining a level of viability and of profit that would make the goods produced attractive in terms of price either on the home market or abroad.  We have an educational problem in that area and this has manifested itself not only in the building industry but in many other industries where the situation of supply and demand dictated the prices that were charged for the products. Sometimes this resulted in exorbitant profits because for short periods the demand was such as to enable various industries to sell their products easily.</P>
    <P>This Government will approach all these aspects in the coming years in a positive and constructive way.  It is essential that in putting forward our economic policies we explain them and the reason for them to the public so that they will be aware that there is some positive end to the road we are taking.  We must ensure that the goods we produce are competitive and that there is the incentive for people to produce such goods.  This is the kernel of the problem facing us now and the major factor in that problem is the level of taxation.  Down through the years we took the short cut instead of having the guts to cut expenditure and to become more efficient.  We tended to make up the balance by increasing taxation instead of taking the harsh decisions that were necessary in regard to the level of expenditure.  We should have cut out much of the waste that took place down through the years, thereby ensuring that we were getting better value for the money we were spending.  I am confident that in the coming months the Government will bring forward an educational policy designed to gear us not only to the latter part of this century but to the early part of the next century.  We must have an education policy which will ensure that people are geared to the jobs that will be available instead of providing an education <Col N="774" /> which leads to a situation of increasing numbers of educated unemployed.</P>
    <P>All of these aspects are tied in with the Bill before us because CTT are playing their part.  But we have a part to play too, in ensuring that there are produced quality goods which we can sell with confidence abroad.  We must also ensure that there is value for money in terms of the goods which we sell on the home market because in that way we can reduce imports.  As Deputy Enright said, there is no reason for our having to engage in such high levels of imports in the area of foodstuffs.  Before the summer recess I answered a question in relation to the value of potato imports.  The figure I gave in this regard was of the order of £25 million.  It is absurd that we should be importing such large quantities of potatoes when we are capable of producing good quality potatoes at home.  That is only one example of the level of imports of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>We must congratulate the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for the steps taken earlier in the year in bringing forward the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act which broadened CTT's area of responsibility to include the promotion and development of a wide range of services exports. This is an area in which there are tremendous prospects, but one that we have ignored for too long.  We have a young and well-educated population and, as the Minister said, we are capable of exporting services to the middle-eastern countries. A good deal of revenue could accrue to our economy by way of the export of services.  In this respect we can compete with the best in the world.  We have the best qualified engineers in the world as the ESB have proved by the contracts they have won abroad in the area of services for hospitals and so on.</P>
    <P>The main reason for my speaking to this Bill is that I regard it as a sign of hope for the future.  This is the type of thing that we should spend more time debating, thereby giving hope to people instead of burdening them with facts and figures.  When something is done well, we should not be afraid to congratulate those who on our behalf have been responsible <Col N="775" /> for the achievement.  The figures I have quoted in respect of exports are something for all sides of the House to be proud of.  The fact that exports are up by more than £1,000 million on the corresponding figure for this time last year is an achievement which must bring further employment and greater opportunities for everyone.</P>
    <P>I join with other speakers in wishing the Minister well in his responsibility, especially in the area of exports.  I congratulate him on the work he has done so far &mdash; on this Bill and on the Export Promotion (Amendment) Act and also on the Insurance Act which permits the provision of export control insurance facilities in support of the activities of people involved in exports.  I hope that all of this heralds the beginning of the constructive aspects of Dáil Éireann whereby people can come in here and not be afraid to point out some positive happenings in the country, whereby we can be seen to act as a Parliament though we may have differences between one side of the House and the other.  There are other matters, too, in respect of which we can work together in helping our agencies who are doing such great work for us abroad, I hope that all of these efforts will lead to greater prosperity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity of making a brief contribution to this very important Bill.  I accept what Deputy Flynn has said about our not exactly handing this amount of money to CTT to help them with their export promotion business.  I understand that CTT are in the process of preparing their budgetary allocations for the different regions and that that budget will in turn be presented to the Minister who will have the responsibility of seeking at the Cabinet table the amount of money that he thinks the organisation will require to enable them to discharge their functions effectively in the coming year.  All of us here should give the Minister every encouragement in that task.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very simple for all of us as politicians to come in here and promote every good cause, all legislation for the benefit <Col N="776" /> of every sector regardless of the sum of our advocacy.  When the Minister has looked at the budget they presented to him and has examined the workings of the organisation to ensure that he is satisfied about their efficiency and what they are doing, I will support him if he says that this is the price we must pay for financing an organisation to sell our goods abroad and this is where we must make cuts in order to provide the money for this expense.  It is a vital area of operation. If we are to succeed in creating higher standards of living and giving work to those who have not got it, this is the area where we must look for the expansion of the prosperity that we have here at present.</P>
    <P>The whole question of how we can expand our economy arises.  We can do that by expanding the home market by consumer growth.  This has been done in the past.  For all the reasons which have been stated by the previous speaker and others, that option is not open to us at the moment.  We have not the resources. We can neither borrow nor raise through taxation the money to pump into the economy in order to create a greater consumer demand.  Experience in the past has been that if we did that we might just succeed in creating those jobs in the more competitive economies who produce consumer goods seemingly more efficiently than we can do so here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We can talk about the old hobby-horse that most of us ride from time to time of cutting down on imports and replacing them and this is a very obvious way to create more employment, but it is a different subject.  Today we are talking about exporting.  When we talk about exporting we must take into consideration the sort of protectionism and markets in which we operate and the way those markets are controlled within the EEC and further afield.</P>
    <P>In the EEC at the moment we are said to have a free trade area.  Many people in Ireland say that this creation of a free trade EEC and our participation in it has created for us some of the problems that we have today.  I do not accept this.  To begin with, we had embarked on a free trade agreement with the British before <Col N="777" /> we became a member of the EEC when probably Britain were the strongest industrial economy in Europe.  At that time our leaders, wisely foreseeing that we would have to go out into the world, grow up and learn to compete with industrialised nations if we were ever to achieve their standards of living, took that courageous step.  There is no point in saying that because we extended that into a European Economic Community and got in return more advantages from it than we did from our free trade agreement with Britain &mdash; we got the CAP, the Regional and Social Funds, interest subsidies and all the other aids &mdash; nevertheless we went into that Community on the complete understanding that this was a free trade area.  We went out and sold the Irish environment as a location for investment by foreign industrialists on the basis that that free trade area was and would be open to them for the sale of the goods manufactured in Ireland.  We have an obligation as a member of the EEC to ensure that we do everything possible for an Irish Government to ensure that that area will be a complete free trade area.</P>
    <P>Of the many instances of protectionism the most blatant is that of the French setting up the customs office in Poitiers. That was against the Japanese rather than against Irish or other European manufacturers, nevertheless the prompt action by the European Parliament, Council and Court of Justice has shown that national governments who engage in this sort of protectionism can be brought to heel. The people of Ireland complain, rightly, about the amount of protectionism that is creeping in and the deterrent that this will be to the establishment of foreign industry in Ireland and we have already suffered considerably.  After I first came into this House two years ago I told how I had been approached by the president of a multinational organisation in Strasbourg who, knowing that I was from Ireland and having an interest in a company operating here, had said that this protectionism was at that time already costing us the prospect of future jobs.  If you have protectionism in Europe the smaller economies will suffer.  The bigger economies such as France, Germany, <Col N="778" /> Britain and Italy can protect their own markets against exports from small countries like ours, and if there is a fear of protectionism against our goods in Germany or France it is quite natural that the multinational company looking at the situation will establish in a country which will have a big domestic market rather than in a country with a small one.</P>
    <P>We should make more definite progress towards the opening up of European borders to complete free trade.  It has been estimated by a committee of the European Parliament that a hidden barrier to trade within this Community cost manufacturers and industrialists in the ten states of the EEC £12 billion last year. That is almost as much as the entire cost of the European budget which is thought to be the financial implement by which the convergence of economies, the CAP and the Social and Regional Funds can be financed.  Therefore, the cost to European industrialists of the non-tariff barriers that exist within the EEC is considerable and immense savings and an immense increase in the standard of living for the peoples of Europe can result from a dismantling of these barriers.  We say that we are the good people of the Community at the moment.  Unfortunately, we cannot afford to be anything but good in this situation because we are the most vulnerable.  I say to everybody concerned, industrialists, sales organisations, CTT and politicians, that wherever we find these barriers and wherever practices which are against the free movement of goods within the EEC come to our notice, we should not just throw up our hands and say that nothing can be done about it.  We have a Commission whose duty is to guard the Treaty and we have a court of justice whose rulings have never yet been defined by any member state.  Admittedly, these processes are slow, but they cannot be brought to a conclusion unless they are initiated.  We should be extremely vigilant and prepared to use the system against any country or organisation that we find adopting practices contrary to free trade.</P>
    <P>This debate has gone on for so long that most of the points have already been raised.  One which comes to my mind is <Col N="779" /> an instance in which perhaps our internal policies can operate against our own manufacturers.  It is well known that because of our system of income tax and the high cost of energy in Ireland arising out of that system of taxation, wages in labour-intensive industries and overheads, interest rates and so on, mean that our costs are higher by comparison with some other countries, particularly non-European countries.  I do not want to generate again an old debate on the whole question of tax or VAT on clothing but &mdash; the Minister may have adequate answers to this &mdash; I see an area there which could perhaps be looked at.  We allow people to export their goods into this country and they are sold in our shops without the imposition of VAT.  If through a better form of taxation we could reduce the overheads on our own labour-intensive industries and give some relief there and collect the equivalent amount of money in VAT, we would not increase the cost of those goods to the consumer but would put the goods imported into this country at a comparitive disadvantage.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider that situation.  In the past we tended to shy away from labour-intensive industries and to regard them as industries in which there was considerable exploitation of labour.  It is true that some industries have exploited labour in underdeveloped parts of the Community and in this country. Nevertheless, labour-intensive industries can serve a useful role in creating opportunities for unemployed young people.  I know some young people who ten years ago would not have considered taking a job in a clothing or footwear factory but who would be prepared to take that kind of work today.  If we carried out some readjustments to our taxation policy we might be able to create more jobs in labour-intensive industries and to give them some advantages against imported manufactured goods from cheap labour areas.  I should like the Minister to consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>At the moment we spend considerable sums of money on training schemes. <Col N="780" /> There are vast numbers unemployed in the building construction industry but yet there are courses in progress teaching young men block-building, construction work and so on.  Similarly, in other areas for which there are no immediate prospects of employment we have training schemes in operation.  While it is better to have people in training schemes rather than doing nothing, I suggest that we may be putting the emphasis on training at the wrong end.  Perhaps more money could be diverted towards research and development to help us to develop our technology, or to the sales area to teach people languages.  Perhaps money could be allocated for crash language courses for business people to help them to sell their goods abroad or for training courses for university graduates who might wish to move into the area of export promotion, whether for CTT or private companies. I should like the Minister to have more money to spend in those areas because that is where the opportunities exist.</P>
    <P>A comparison has been made between the number of Japanese sales people in Europe and the results they get and the number of European sales people in Japan.  We could make a comparison so far as training, research and development is concerned.  The countries that invest most in research and development succeed in getting and holding their export markets.  There is a tendency to blame technology for many of our unemployment problems.  However, the United States and Japan have had a more rapid technological advance than countries in Europe but their unemployment figures have not risen to the same extent and they are not forecast to rise to the same extent in the year ahead.  The best hope of expanding the European and Irish economies lies in the development of new products and obtaining markets for them.</P>
    <P>Someone said that we need to encourage the young people.  I travel to European cities fairly regularly and sometimes in the evening I look at the shop windows. I compare the prices of goods, such as a suit of clothes or shoes, with the prices in Dublin or other provincial towns and I always get the impression that prices are <Col N="781" /> considerably higher in Europe for quality goods than they are here.  There must be enormous opportunities there for our consumer goods.  If the ordinary producer of goods in Ireland knew the prices consumers in Europe pay it would be an encouragement to him to look very carefully at the European market.  It is possible for us to compete there.</P>
    <P>It is probably wrong to say that the increasing cost of labour here has affected severely our competitiveness. Our wage costs are still quite reasonable although they may have risen fairly rapidly in recent years.  We must stabilise wages.  At the moment we cannot expect the kind of increases we got before. Where we will make real gains is in improving efficiency, recognising that high standards must be attained and that a certain unit of production must be got from a day's work with the benefit of modern technology.  We cannot blame our workforce and say they are taking too much money.  If anything, our standards have not always been what they should have been.  Anyone who tries to do business with continental buyers or with American buyers must realise that delivery dates must be kept.  This is most important and considerable credit is given by European importers to the manufacturer who delivers on the due date.</P>
    <P>The dairy industry is most important to this country.  Of late we have been selling considerable amounts of dairy products into intervention.  This is disappointing because some seven or eight years ago, when there was a butter mountain in Europe, we were able to say we did not contribute to it.  We could say we were selling our products straight from the manufacturer, that we were finding markets for them and were not burdening the EEC with intervention.  At the moment we are selling into intervention and that is a pity.  The reason is that we have not diversified sufficiently.</P>
    <P>Very generous grants have been available from the EEC through FEOGA funds in order to develop facilities to process and sell our goods.  It is disappointing that so much of the money that has been allocated to Ireland has not been collected.  The relevant figures were <Col N="782" /> published recently.  We have not been collecting the money for many reasons, among them high interest rates and the fact that manufacturers, processors and co-operatives are over-stretched at the moment.  We should use the assistance that is available to make our dairy sector more competitive.  As Deputy Enright said, it is very disappointing to go into attractively stocked delicatessen shops in France, Germany and elsewhere and not to find Irish goods.  Whisky from Scotland, patés and cheeses and other processed foods from England are available &mdash; all of these goods from a country that is not yet self-sufficient in food.  On the other hand, the Irish economy is so dependent on agricultural products and is producing a surplus amount but we are failing to get into these markets with our own brands.</P>
    <P>We must be conscious of our obligations to industry not alone to buy Irish but to help to protect the good name of Irish goods.  Recently I was disappointed to see across the front pages of all our newspapers a story about antibiotics in Irish dairy products.  There are problems. There will always be problems as science and technology develop.  It is always possible some new compound or drug will come on the market and create a difficulty. Within our own system, however, we have a sufficient number of personnel plus all the machinery necessary to prevent any abuse in the use of drugs, antibiotics, or whatever.  There is no reason why any health hazard should occur in food production and processing.  We do not add anything to the protection of health by scare headlines which will we read abroad and can result in giving a bad name to Irish products.  We have an obligation to ensure our products are produced in a responsible manner.  We have an obligation to ensure that drugs and antibiotics are handled very carefully. But we also have an obligation of loyalty to our own industry particularly at a time when it runs the risk of being restricted by European legislation.  We should be kinder to our industry than we have been.</P>
    <P>We have a very good example of an industry which has succeeded in producing competitively.  Irish dairy products <Col N="783" /> are produced competitively.  Irish farmers get the lowest price for their milk of any country in Europe.  They have increased production more rapidly than any country in Europe.  If we have failed to be more competitive on European markets it is because of the European system and the MCA in addition to our own taxation system.  A very thorough study has been done recently by the Irish Agricultural Institute which clearly indicates that within our taxation system the efficiency of the food processing industry and a combination of MCA plus the advantages which the Irish farmer gives to the factory of the Danish pig in the form of a cheap product has not succeeded in creating a competitive product on international markets.  That is one area where we can say the primary product is being produced more competitively.</P>
    <P>I said I would support the Minister in whatever money he seeks for the promotion of exports and the financing of Córas Tráchtála provided he is satisfied it is working efficiently.  I will assist him to make whatever cuts are necessary since I know we cannot have increased taxation in areas that are less important so that this money can be made available. Someone in manufacturing industry coming back from abroad recently after trying to sell goods said that the market is more important than he thought.  He said a good marketing system is like a good drawing chimney.  If the chimney is right the draught will keep the fire alight.  If our marketing and our sales efforts abroad are right, that will result in helping to create the jobs we need.  I congratulate Irish workers, the economy and everybody concerned in the 25 per cent growth we achieved last year in exports. I think the real figure is 9 per cent.  In manufacturing goods we increased by 9 per cent last year.  That is probably without parallel.  It was one of the factors which prompted a national financial journal recently to comment that the Irish economy was the most rapidly improving economy in the world.  This gives hope to all who are unemployed because this is <Col N="784" /> one area in which we can succeed in creating jobs in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey) Frank Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to thank Deputies on all sides for the very constructive and positive debate.  I have followed with much interest the various points made and, overall, what has impressed me most was the clear recognition displayed of the important role which exports have to play in our economic recovery and the critical role which CTT have to play in this process.</P>
      <P>Deputies are quite right in saying that our export growth rate has been exceptional &mdash; it has been well in advance of the EEC average and of the showings by other major economies.</P>
      <P>It is also true that our global export figures &mdash; highly impressive as they are &mdash; are buoyed up by very good showings from new technology firms which have set up here in recent years.  I suppose it is not too surprising that firms attracted to Ireland in recent years are, pound for pound, contributing more to our exports drive.  After all they were selected on the basis of what they could contribute to economic development and one of the considerations must have been their impact on local industry.  To the extent that they were export-orientated, these newer firms did not have implications for native Irish firms and were all the more welcome on that account.</P>
      <P>In the same way official IDA policy was to concentrate on attracting new firms from abroad.  I have no doubt that this was a correct policy to pursue during the period in question.  But just as all policies must adapt to changing circumstances, so too have the IDA widened their focus of attention to include Irish entrepreneurs setting up and developing local opportunities.  I have no doubt but that in due course these small, newly emerging native enterprises will prosper and will make their own important contribution to our export drive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies also touched on the question of co-ordination of effort between such bodies as CTT, the IDA, the Irish Goods Council, Kilkenny Design Workshops and others.  They also talked about <Col N="785" /> rationalisation of the activities of various export promotion agencies such as CTT, CBF, BIM.  The question of expanding CTT's role to give it a function in relation to the sale of goods within the country was also mentioned.  I would agree that all of these points are highly pertinent.  It is essential that Ireland puts its best foot forward when we are out in foreign markets selling our goods and services.  We must have the best possible support and services consistent with the economic constraints we all have to contend with. There is already a high degree of co-ordination and consultation between the various State agencies concerned but I am also convinced that this can be improved upon.  Indeed these are some of the matters which are being considered and which will be resolved in the context of the forthcoming White Paper.  There is an absolute need to avoid overlap or duplication of the efforts of the various State agencies.  I believe the country is too small to be able to afford the luxury of triplicating the expertise, the network of offices and the other infrastructure necessary to promote sales of Irish goods abroad and that this question must be squarely faced up to.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the general sentiments that we cannot sell from behind our desks at home here and that increasingly exporters must get out into those market-places where their goods are being sold and maintain a permanent presence there.  But as one speaker said in the course of the debate we are talking about highly skilled and highly sought after specialists to bring their considerable experience and expertise to bear on local market situations.  I would have considerable misgivings about the suggestion that this process could be materially assisted by having Irish embassies abroad act as post boxes in relation to detailed selling operations.  Face to face dealings and point to point contacts are what make deals.  There are already enough middlemen and we should not do anything to extend the communications chain.  Foreign buyers who know precisely what they wish to buy want to have dealings directly with the people supplying the goods and the more middlemen and generalists <Col N="786" /> we have between the buyer and the seller the greater the risk of the potential buyer being put off and valuable contracts put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>I was heartened to hear reference to the downstream benefits which can accrue to Irish manufacturers from the consultancy work done abroad by Irish firms.  This is something we have recognised for some time and this is why I brought in amending legislation earlier this year to allow CTT to become involved to a much greater extent in promoting services overseas.  I made an order under this amending legislation extending the legislation to agricultural development and processing resources, construction-related services, medical services, training services covering all activities, technical and general consulting services, including commercial laboratory services and research and development services, international financial services, public administration services and media recording and publishing services.  There is no doubt but that there is a huge area to be tapped by our consultancy services sector and I know that CTT, with my encouragement, are putting staff and resources into this area to open it up and develop it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with Deputy Flynn that we must recognise, and realise as far as possible, the opportunities which lie at our feet in the form of the natural resources we have at our disposal.  Our tourism endeavour, our beef and dairy industry, food processing and fishing are all examples of areas where the potential is there waiting to be fully harnessed.  We must not knock ourselves too much however. Sometimes I think we can go too far with self-criticism.  It is fine if it is constructive and designed to get things going, but sometimes it is so negative that it can sap the will of workers and management trying to cope with the problems of the day and the net result is that matters are just worse, not better.</P>
    <P>However, as Deputy Flynn said, competitiveness is so essential to the success of our efforts in selling our goods and services abroad.  As one deputy said, foreign importers do not owe us a living.  We <Col N="787" /> must win business by our own efforts and put our products before their eyes.  What matters in many of these deals is design, price, delivery and aftersales service which best meet their requirements.</P>
    <P>I also agree with the Deputy who said we have an adaptable workforce.  Despite the stories which sometimes grab the headlines, our workers have been one of our greatest assests down the years in attracting foreign industry.  In an era where work practices and procedures are changing all the time and indeed where old industries are running down and new ones taking their place, either producing the same goods with more modern process or engaging in entirely different activities, Irish workers have shown a resilience in being able to adapt to change.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see a much greater awarness developing of the need for more marketing executives to get out into the markets where the business is lost or won.  Exporters must learn at first hand to develop a proper sense of what the customer needs.  In this respect I am also pleased to see a trend developing, with official encouragement, for smaller companies in the same product area coming together on a co-operative basis to share the overheads of maintaining a presence in our overseas markets.</P>
    <P>It is incorrect to say that the employment support scheme was suspended last May.  The reality is that CTT, with my full encouragement, have been so successful in getting across the message to exporters that they need to maintain a presence overseas, that CTT had used up their full allocation for the year by the end of May.  There is always a critical decision to be made on how best to deploy funds as between different competing demands.  CTT judged that a better return would be secured by maintaining funds in the other areas to which they had been allocated and I respected CTT's decision.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Yates that our export performance has been quite outstanding and, while CTT have played a crucial role in bringing this about, I think it would be unfair to attribute the success <Col N="788" /> exclusively to them.  The other factors which the Deputy instanced all played their part.  Indeed I think it would be an unhealthy sign if all credit was due to CTT because it would suggest an over-reliance by Irish exporting firms on the board.  Irish export firms are displaying the self-starter qualities which are necessary for firms competing on the international scene with the best that other countries can provide.  I believe the CTT success story has been in providing a solid core of basic help and assistance which Irish firms can use as a launching pad for getting into their market places.  They complement the efforts of the established firms by making contacts, opening doors, providing market intelligence, etc., and in the case of industries coming on to the market for the first time they offer necessary reassurance and support in the critical early periods.</P>
    <P>I do not think anybody would want a situation where Irish industry was totally dependent on CTT to provide all its marketing and to do all its selling for it.  That is not the function of CTT.  Their essential role is to enable Irish industry to realise its own potential in the export field and the degree of assistance and support given in particular instances will vary from sector to sector, from market to market, and from product to product.</P>
    <P>Deputies were very complimentary of the efforts of CTT staff in bringing about the fine record of achievement in exports. I would like to join with Deputies in congratulating staff.  One of my functions as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is to meet the staff and managers of the overseas offices at the beginning of each year and it is one of the pleasures of my office to be able to meet these staff and to tell them of the Government's and the country's appreciation of their efforts and to urge them on to greater achievement. But I would also like to thank every other individual engaged in exporting, from the marketing manager down to the dispatcher, for their efforts on behalf of Irish exports.  I would also like to pay tribute to the staff in the International Trade Division of my Department for their efforts in this area of export drive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="789" /> It has been long-standing Government policy to get statutory control of pay and conditions of staff in non-commercial State bodies whenever the legislative opportunity has presented itself.  The non-existence of statutory controls makes CTT virtually unique among such State bodies.  Provisions inserted are standard control provisions for such bodies.</P>
    <P>I would assure Deputy Ray Burke that I do not have any fears that any undue interference in the internal running of CTT affairs will result.  Because of the high level of co-operation which exists between CTT and my Department already, I do not see this clause as presenting any difficulties.</P>
    <P>Many areas of our exporting endeavours were raised by Deputies.  I thank those who contributed for a very constructive and enlightening debate on what I regard as a major success story in the Irish economy.  It was not achieved without a great deal of thought and effort by many people and the support, assistance, and encouragement which the staff of CTT have given to Irish exporters. One has to witness Irish exporters in the international field to appreciate the efforts they are making.  They do not sit back and say we are experiencing hard economic times.  They put every conceivable effort into marketing, maintaining their existing contacts and markets and developing new ones where the opportunities present themselves.  I have had the opportunity of being with them on some trade missions and assisting in some measure in their efforts.  I was full of admiration for the way they tackled their job.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the fact remains that while some undoubtedly have realised the importance of marketing expertise the message has not got across to all firms engaged in or contemplating getting involved in the export market.  There must be a recognition of the supreme importance of marketing if we are to be successful in our export endeavours.  CTT have preached this over the years and some firms got the message.  The success of those firms can be seen in the increase in the volume of our exports.  I hope other <Col N="790" /> firms will take this message to heart.  It may be possible to survive and make some showing in international markets when the economic climate is good but it is not possible to do so in an economic climate such as exists today.  That fact must be recognised by all Irish firms wishing to engage in the export market.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputies for their constructive approach to the debate.  I should like to thank all those concerned with export promotions for their endeavours which have proved so successful.  They have managed to create one bright spot in an otherwise fairly gloomy economic climate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I dealt with the contributions made by some of my colleagues on this subject.  The way we conduct our debates disappoints me. Holding a debate on different days is detrimental, particularly when we are discussing important issues.  I accept that under present procedures we cannot have continuity and that other matters must be dealt with, but issues like the Bill under discussion do not get the importance they deserve because they are postponed from one day to another and allocated a couple of hours here and there.  It is not an appropriate way to discuss important legislation. No other subject has been debated more here or at public meetings than the law and order issue.  Any attempt to crack down on the spate of violence in our streets will get the support <Col N="791" /> of the public.  Our people have been subjected to an enormous increase in crime in recent years.</P>
      <P>A recent well-publicised survey indicated that people living in the Dublin area can expect to be the victim of some type of crime once in every three years. Such statistics make people like myself receptive and responsive to the needs and wishes of the community.  Last year's rise in crime of 9.2 per cent cannot go unnoticed by legislators.  However, I contend that the Bill, although I welcome some of its measures, will make little or no impact on our current rate of crime.  I am not pessimistic but I believe the fight against the criminal and our anxiety to rid our streets of vandalism and crime must go further than simply giving extra powers to the Garda.  I hope the Minister accepts my remarks as being sincere because I do not share the view of other Deputies that this is the right approach.  I was happy to note that Deputies Molony, Shatter and Allen, expressed reservations about the Bill, as did some of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil.  The sincerity of all Members in regard to doing something genuine to help our people cannot be questioned. We differ on the approach that should be adopted.</P>
      <P>I was disappointed that some Members referred to those who make speeches like mine as liberals or do-gooders.  That type of emotive reaction to the sincere remarks of Deputies is not the right approach.  Without exception we all want to see criminals getting the appropriate medicine.  The power we give the Garda, the authority we give our courts and the way we protect civil liberties here is what makes us a democratic and free society and different to a totalitarian regime. Our attitude to civil rights is important and we must go beyond all possible doubt to protect the civil liberties of our citizens. I do not want measures introduced that will affect innocent people and I believe the provisions of this Bill will.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed that this debate is taking place in the absence of a White or Green Paper or an overall review of the cause, effect and our approach to crime <Col N="792" /> in recent years.  We are approaching the subject in a piecemeal way and that is not adequate.  It is an appalling reflection on us all that every few years we pass legislation and leave it until other measures are required.  That type of approach will not help to solve the problem.  It is not a question of which Government is tough or soft on criminals.  On occasions harsh measures lead to more serious problems. We must concern ourselves with the effectiveness of any measures that are introduced and whether they are well received by the public initially is not important.  I am aware that when the Bill was first published it received wide support. It seemed to be the type of measure that we needed; but many prominent people, experienced lawyers and others, after closer examination drew attention to some loopholes in it.  If the rise in crime continues at its present rate our people will not thank us in six years' time for this legislation.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister recognised that the most important thing in relation to crime was detection.  Unfortunately, our ability to detect criminals has changed radically.  In the sixties we had a 60 per cent detection rate and I understand that has dropped to about 30 per cent.  The challenge facing politicians is to find a way to reduce the level of crime and ensure the detection rate is improved.  We must not make any irresponsible promises or raise public expectations.</P>
    <P>I have great respect for the present Minister for Justice; he is doing a fantastic job.  But I was disappointed to hear him promise people, in the course of the recent by-election campaign, that he would make their homes safer.  He could promise that he would endeavour to make their homes safer, that the Government would introduce any necessary measures, but it cannot be guaranteed that this Bill will go in any way towards making their homes safer.  The Minister is as aware of that as I am.</P>
    <P>The problems inherent in our society are far more fundamental and warrant more action than simply giving extra powers to the Garda.  Behind the rhetoric, the good speeches, the television <Col N="793" /> broadcasts, we must make every effort to go to the very root of the problem and sort out the many social problems existing in our community.  No matter how many measures this House passes there will always be a number of people in our society, whether motivated by anger, greed, illness or whatever, who will always fail to live in harmony with their fellow citizen.  That is the reality of life; we shall never have a situation in which there will be no crime much as we might like that to obtain.</P>
    <P>The fact that this Bill is before the House is indicative of the fact that all of the measures introduced in the past have failed to come to grips with the problems now confronting us.  I do not accept, as do many others, that it is a fact of modern society, of a materialistic world, that we should live in a situation in which many people are now the victims of crime.  In a small island country like ours with a very low population there is no reason our crime rate should be as high as that obtaining in America or elsewhere.  Yet the figures compare most unfavourably with those of most other countries.  We must take an honest look at ourselves and ask: why is this the case?  We must ensure that our public have confidence in their legislators to introduce the kind of measures and engender the type of approach that will render people happy and confident to live in their homes and walk our streets.</P>
    <P>The survey to which I referred earlier indicated, I think, that 46 per cent of Dubliners were afraid to walk within a mile of their homes at night alone.  It is appalling to think that in this capital city so many people would be afraid to walk within a mile of their homes at night without being accompanied by another person.  These are the kinds of things we must examine in our serious effort to crack down on the criminal and make our streets as safe as they were in the past.</P>
    <P>I am not the type of person who believes that social progress alone will lead to elimination of crime.  But I believe it can have a great impact on our current wave of crime.  Whether or not we like it the vast majority of people in our prisons come from deprived or disadvantaged <Col N="794" /> backgrounds.  Very few come from the more privileged sections of our community. In this context it would be good that we would all examine our definition of crime and ask ourselves: are we treating all criminals fairly?  How many people who have evaded paying their proper share of taxes are in our jails?  How many shopkeepers or traders who have overcharged are in prison?  Yet I was horrified recently to hear of a juvenile offender sentenced to one of our institutions for having stolen a pair of gloves worth less than £2.  How many developers who have left young couples paying £30,000 or £40,000 for their houses in appalling living conditions in many of our housing estates are in our prisons?  The reality is that there is white collar crime in this country.  We do not hear very much about that.  We do not see many of them in the statistics placed before us all the time.</P>
    <P>It is time we redefined our approach to crime and ascertained who exactly are the criminals in our society.  Apart from having special enactments dealing with subversive crime, on three occasions only in this House have we introduced Bills dealing with this subject.  They were the Courts of Justice Act, 1924, the Criminal Justice Act, 1951 and the Criminal Procedures Act, 1957.  There have been major changes in both the structure of our population and the demographic balance within the country.  For example, in 1926 25 per cent of our population lived in urban areas; in 1983 65 per cent of our population live in urban areas and it is estimated that, by the year 2000, 80 per cent of our people will live in urban areas. We know also that the change from a rural way of life to an urban one in itself has had a major impact on the escalation of crime.  Equally, we are aware of the fact that 55 per cent of our population is under the age of 30 and constitutes a factor because unfortunately, most of the people involved in crime are those in the younger age groups.  Yet we have never really fundamentally examined our penal system, our courts system, the method of recruiting of our Garda Síochána or their training or promotional prospects.  All of these are fundamental to a proper approach to crime and vandalism and <Col N="795" /> ensuring that justice and fairness are seen to be done to all citizens.  There are many archaic pieces of legislation on our Statute Book &mdash; for example, the Vagrancy Act of 1824, the Larceny Act of 1916, the Forgery Act of 1913, the Offences Against the Person Act of 1891 and the Children Act of 1908, all of which seem to pre-date even the foundation of the State.  Is that not an appalling reflection on all of us in Dáil and Seanad Éireann that we have never made any effort to try to tackle or update this fundamental legislation?  But, no in a piecemeal way, every couple of years, we introduce measures, such as the Bill before the House at present hoping that by so doing the problem will go away.</P>
    <P>I was happy to read recently a remark attributed to Derek Nally, the retiring General Secretary of the Garda Sergeants' and Inspectors' Association. Indeed, I believe he is retiring today and I should like to avail of this opportunity to pay tribute to the work he has done for that association.  He is a man of the highest integrity who has given a very human face to the Garda Síochána.  He said that, while strongly advocating effective changes in the criminal law to give the Garda a better chance of tackling crime, he had always believed that this should never be done either in isolation from other necessary organisational changes or to the detriment of the basic citizen's rights.  I would maintain that this Bill very much contravenes the views there expressed by Derek Nally.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the £250 million to which the Minister referred in his opening remarks &mdash; the figure it is costing the taxpayer to fight crime in the current year and protect our citizens, which, I believe, does not include other moneys spent in the form of education and within the Department of Health &mdash; is being effectively and appropriately spent?  Are there not more efficient and effective ways of spending such an amount of money that would lead us into a safer situation than obtains at present?</P>
    <P>The only way we will get answers to these kinds of questions is to carry out a proper investigation, as I said earlier, in <Col N="796" /> the form of a White or Green Paper into the cause of crime, and the effect of our response to crime.  Only by talking to all the relevant people, social workers, gardaí, lawyers, prison officers, will we achieve the kind of approach I believe to be relevant to the problem of today.  We are still reacting year by year to crime and vandalism rather than devising some sort of preventive method deterring people from involving themselves in crime.  For example, between the years 1972 and 1981 our overall crime rate rose by 127.8 per cent.  Yet in the same period the detection rate dropped from 43.4 per cent in 1972 &mdash; I might add it was about 60 per cent in the sixties &mdash; to 36.6 per cent in 1981.  In our laws is it not the case that property is held almost more sacred than is human life?  How many people who have left so many of our young couples living in appalling conditions in various housing estates &mdash; some in my constituency and others elsewhere &mdash; have ever been put in jail?  How many shopkeepers or traders who have overcharged have ever been put in jail?  Likewise how many people who have not paid their adequate share of taxation have ever been put in jail?  Yet I repeat that a juvenile, for stealing goods to the value of as little as £2 can often get a sentence in an institution.</P>
    <P>Is it not strange also that in this year in this country it is still a crime to be homeless? There are no official figures available but those supplied by the Simon Community indicate that there are 3,000 people homeless in this year in this country. Of course, these people are not even entitled to bail.  What have we, as Members of the Oireachtas, done about the plight of these people?  Have we done anything to increase the age of criminal responsibility?  Is it not strange that a seven-year old child can be deemed to be a criminal?  Despite the Kennedy Report of 1970 and the Task Force Report of 1981 on the welfare of children in our society we still have not brought forward a Bill in respect of children's rights.  Instead the rights of parents take precedence.</P>
    <P>The Minister may say that measures to deal with these matters are necessary. We have an obligation as the people <Col N="797" /> charged with running the country to bring in the social reforms that can make the lifestyle of many of our people much better, which may ensure that young children, as young as nine, ten and eleven, do not get involved in crime.  The Minister said that the majority of people living in poverty are never involved in crime. That is true, but the majority of those involved in crime come from poor circumstances, from disadvantaged homes. They live in bad housing conditions; they have poor education.  They come from homes in which either or both parents, or a brother or sister, have been in trouble with the law.  It is no wonder that many of us canvassing in Dublin's inner city in recent weeks could see the desolation in which many people have to live their lives &mdash; the tenement blocks in which many young couples have to bring up their children. They are absolutely appalling conditions.</P>
    <P>Is it any wonder that children from these backgrounds see no future, when there are no jobs, when there is only poor education, but to get involved in crime? Is it not strange in 1983 in Ireland that we see young children begging in the streets trying to get a few pence to bring home to their parents?  Later I will deal with the responsibility of parents.  The fact that 33.1 per cent of those involved in crime last year were juveniles is a sad reflection on parents.  It is time we looked at the possibility of making parents responsible for the supervision of the activities of their young children.  It horrifies me to see in my constituency and elsewhere very young children out very late at night without parental supervision. Many of these parents are often in pubs and could not care less about their children.  It is time they were made responsible for them.</P>
    <P>Lack of parental supervision has resulted in many of those young children being involved in joyriding, etc.  They have taken the lives of some people and seriously injured others.  Particularly in Tallaght and Clondalkin in my constituency, many young children are now able to steal cars and use them to destroy property and human lives.  I am glad that <Col N="798" /> the Bill introduces stricter penalties in cases such as this.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Government have a task force to look into the drugs problem, and in this connection I congratulate the Minister of State at the Department of Labour who is a member of the committee. We have a major drug problem and there can be no doubt that the drug culture is part and parcel of our crime problem. I was saddened to see a recent BBC programme which estimated that 10 per cent of young children in inner city Dublin are heroin addicts.  That is a frightening figure.  We must tackle that problem in a serious way.  Deputy Woods suggested that it should be made a specific offence to push or to distribute or to be involved in the distribution of drugs.</P>
    <P>We cannot underestimate the impact the drug culture is having on the rising rate of crime.  No Government Department have bothered to investigate the reasons why people involve themselves in crime.  I will refer, however, to two surveys in 1979 by the Prisoners' Rights Organisation.  One is a survey of 50 children living in inner city Dublin who had delinquent records; the other is a record of 200 adult offenders.  In both it was indicated that those people were born in slums, came from large families in which the parents' income was very low.  In many cases unemployment was the norm. The surveys indicate that in 20 per cent of the cases one or both parents had been involved in crime and one-third of those involved were illiterate.  Is that not an appalling reflection on our educational system?</P>
    <P>The surveys also indicated that the pattern of criminal behaviour began in childhood: 51 per cent of those ex-prisoners had first been convicted when they were between the ages of 11 and 15 years; 24 per cent were first convicted when they were between the ages of 16 and 21.  It is frightening to realise that crime has its beginning almost in childhood.  Crime is growing faster in deprived areas and a small number of people are involved in many crimes &mdash; as many as 40 or 50 people can be involved in a series of crimes.  We will have to do something about that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="799" /> Yesterday I was very pleased to meet in Leinster House representatives from the National Youth Council of Ireland which comprises many youth organisations who do excellent voluntary work in youth activities.  I pay a tribute to Deputy Birmingham who is charged with youth affairs for the work he is doing in this area.  Those young people are working with 350,000 youngsters throughout the country.  They came here yesterday to lobby politicians, to ask for a mere £2 million from the budget next year.  It is a small amount for those volunteers who look after so many young people throughout the country.  They and the many affiliated organisations, such as the Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides and others are helping to keep many young people from very bad homes out of crime.  I hope the money requested yesterday will be granted.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister dealt with detection.  I agree with him that speedy detection is fundamental in the fight against crime.  Subsequently, the Minister said it is important to have a deterrent. Though we appreciate that a deterrent is very important in the fight against crime, the official figures do not bear this out.  For example, the Annual Report on Prisons for 1979 indicated that of the 2,025 committed on conviction in that year, 50 per cent had already served previous sentences.  In the case of males, 58 per cent had served previous sentences and 41 per cent of females had done so. Twenty-five per cent of males and 18 per cent of females had served between one and five sentences, and 34 per cent of men and 23 per cent of women had served between five and 20 sentences already. Between nine and ten per cent of both sexes had served 20 sentences before. Does that indicate there is any deterrent in putting people into prison or institutions? I suggest it does not.</P>
    <P>In the fight against crime detection is very important.  It is important that they be detected young because many people start their criminal activities at a very early stage and then go on to serious crime.  In a country where we are told that 40 per cent of all crimes are not even <Col N="800" /> reported to the Garda, it is not any wonder that the detection rate is not high, because 40 per cent of crimes cannot be detected because they are not reported.</P>
    <P>We must ask ourselves why people do not report crime.  It may be suggested there is lack of confidence in the Garda. I say that we can be proud of the Garda. However, many of my constituents have told me they did not bother to report crime because when they would ring them up, because of the demands on their time the Garda very often might not be able to come for some time when they are told of a burglary or some other such crime.  Many Deputies have reported such matters and they have been investigated. We hear from local residents' groups that they do not bother to report crimes.  That is a pity and we must seriously examine it because if crimes are not reported the detection rate cannot be high.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that 33 per cent of people involved in crime in Ireland last year were under the age of 17 years.  That is an appalling reflection on parents, many of whom are totally irresponsible in regard to the rearing of their children.  Parents have an obligation, and should have this obligation enforced by law, to look after and supervise the activities of their children. We cannot fail in our responsibility to help in fighting the crime rate.  Parents, teachers, priests, politicians and Garda have a responsibility to fight the crime rate and, in so far as parents have a contribution to make, it is in the proper rearing and looking after of their children.</P>
    <P>I was happy to read a speech recently which the Minister gave to the annual conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  In referring to crime in general, he said that it is the family who are best placed to set standards of behaviour and to exercise control. Unless parents accepted this responsibility and acted accordingly, the involvement of young people in crime would continue to increase and the best efforts of the Garda would be futile.  I agree with the Minister, and I think the time has come when it should be a criminal offence <Col N="801" /> for parents in certain circumstances to fail to supervise or look after their children. It is not good enough to have very young children wandering the streets at night, some of them begging for money to bring back to their parents.  That is not good enough and the parents must be held responsible.</P>
    <P>In relation to our drugs problem, I was very happy to see one of the People of the Year awards given to Denis Mullins, head of the Garda Drug Squad.  He, among others, has spearheaded a campaign to try to rid the country of a problem which is slowly creeping up on us.  There are no official figures available on how many drug-related crimes are committed &mdash; in other words, how many people commit crime in order to pay for drugs.  When you hear that some people need £100 per day to supply them with drugs, you must be under no illusions as to where most of them get that money. They get it by committing serious offences in the form of robberies and so on and the time has come to set up a proper system for dealing with drug offenders.  It is an appalling reflection that we have no proper residential facilities for young offenders.</P>
    <P>We heard recently that prisons are now becoming major centres for drug pushing. Prison is not the place to deal with drug addicts.  With the exception of the Coolmine centre, we have no proper residential institution to deal with young drug addicts and that is no longer good enough in a country that has a major drug crisis.  I hope that the task force which the Government recently set up to examine our drug problem will come up with the kind of solutions that will provide young people who drift into drugs with some form of residential care where they can be helped with their problem and rehabilitated.  It would be worth while, through our educational system and the showing of video cassettes and so on, to make children aware of the seriousness of drug addition.  Recently I watched such a film &mdash; I think it was on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo;&mdash; and, although it was sensational and may have frightened many people, it is a very serious problem and it is as well to show it to our young people <Col N="802" /> at a very early age before it is too late. Prevention is better than cure.</P>
    <P>Last year, for example, 1,593 people were found in possession of drugs, an increase of 26.83 per cent on the previous year.  There were 1,873 seizures, a remarkable increase, and I congratulate the Drug Squad on the increase of 55.56 per cent in seizures.  However, there is a need for better equipment and facilities to be given to the Garda Drug Squad. From available statistics, 25 per cent of those involved in drugs here are women and yet there are only two ban-ghardaí in the Drug Squad.  That is totally inadequate and I hope that the Government will soon give an increased allocation of ban-ghardaí to the Drug Squad.  Deputy Woods referred to the need to introduce in the list of scheduled offences under the Offences Against the State Act an offence for the pushing and distribution of drugs and it is high time that was done.</P>
    <P>Earlier, I referred to the fact that our courts, penal system and our method of recruiting, training and promoting members of the Garda Síochána had not changed much since the foundation of the State.  In many cases our courts are in an appalling condition, especially many of our District Courts.  There are no basic facilities, not even toilets, in some of our courtrooms.  Clients have to see their legal advisers outside the door, in a car or in a local pub.  It is an appalling reflection that we have not done something to improve our courtroom facilities and make them adequate for presentday demands.  The length of time it takes in very many cases from the time somebody is prosecuted until the case is either brought before the court or finalised is far too long.  In the case of the District Court, it is no longer appropriate that the Garda should bring their own prosecutions. They are there to detect crime and perhaps to act as witnesses.  In very many cases the Garda fail to get convictions simply because they are not as well versed in the law as solicitors or barristers.  As a result of Garda prosecutions, many people are getting off.</P>
    <P>It is also no longer appropriate that gardaí should have to witness the signing of unemployment forms.  This is taking <Col N="803" /> them away from the real work of detecting crime and patrolling the streets.  We are fortunate in having a Garda force of the highest integrity.  They command the respect of the public and it is important we ensure that this continues.  Bills such as this may well lead in the future to public confidence in the Garda being brought into question, because I believe the success of the Garda force relies to a very large extent on the kind of confidence and respect which the public have in them.  In the 60 years or so since the Garda Síochána were formed there have been no changes in structure, recruitment or training.  Is it appropriate that only 22 weeks of training is given?  It is appalling that the training period is so short and that there is no practical training given on that course.</P>
    <P>Our Garda force now numbers 11,000 and we must be one of the most policed countries in Western Europe.  They must adapt to the changing circumstances and environment which now exists.  The majority of people now live in urban areas.  Problems related to urban development are very different from when the Garda force were formed early in the century.  It is time we looked into the matter of selection of our Garda recruits. We must also look into their training and promotional prospects and ensure that that is done by an independent board. We must also ensure that they have the facilities and equipment that will allow them to fight the crime rate.  There is no point in giving the Garda powers if they do not have adequate facilities.</P>
    <P>There are about 60 gardaí assigned to the Tallaght Garda station.  I have been endeavouring for some time to have at least one female garda allocated there.  I was told it is not possible to assign a female garda to that station because the proper facilities do not exist there for her.  This is appalling in an area where nearly 70,000 people live.  The Tallaght Garda station is virtually the same now as it was in the early sixties when Tallaght had no more than a few hundred people. If we are sincere about fighting crime we must provide the Garda with the proper <Col N="804" /> facilities, equipment and conditions in which to carry out their work.</P>
    <P>It is time we turned our attention to the criteria for the selection of gardaí Without casting any reflection on the force, about 20 per cent of those serving now are under the age of 25.  Are these young men and women, who have spent all their lives up to now in a rural environment and who have had only 22 weeks of training for the Garda, equipped properly to be put into an urban environment where there is rampant crime?  I suggest that those young gardaí are neither trained nor equipped to be in control of the sort of situations with which they must deal in this city.  They are faced with problems that are totally new to them.  A 22-week training period is totally inadequate. In a recent edition of the <i>Garda Review,</i> the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors recommended the introduction of a psychological assessment test for persons joining the force. Such a test would be ideal in terms of measuring the suitability of people for the job.  It would measure their emotional reaction in certain situations and would give an indication of their level of integrity and so on.  It is time that this sort of psychological test were introduced.</P>
    <P>In regard to motivation within the force, it is fundamental that the Garda be allowed, without political interference, to have people of the highest integrity and people best suited to the job promoted to the important positions.  Some years ago the Ryan Commission of Inquiry reported on conditions within the force in regard to promotions.  That report indicated that a minimum of 15 years elapses before a garda is promoted to management level.  Those posts above the rank of superintendent are still filled by the Government.  That is not sufficient in this day and age.  It is time to have a proper independent promotions board within the Garda.</P>
    <P>Again, on the question of training, a garda who has been in the force for some time would need retraining programmes from time to time; but, with the exception of one course organised by the NIHE and which 14 gardaí are attending voluntarily, there is no other retraining course available <Col N="805" /> for members of the force.  In Britain, for example, the situation is totally different. There ought to be a different method employed, too, in relation to people entering the force.  In other countries people with certain professional expertise, particularly in the area of detective work, may enter the police force even if they are not very young. There is a need, too, for us to recruit people who have expertise in specific areas, who have experience that they could not have had on joining the force at an early age.</P>
    <P>If we as legislators are to introduce the kind of measures that will deal effectively with the crime rate we must ensure that we have the most efficient Garda force possible.  It is for that reason that I stress the importance both of the training of gardaí and of the conditions in which they must work.</P>
    <P>The retiring secretary of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors, Mr. Nally, outlined recently his wish for the introduction of a police declaration. He, together with others, was responsible for the agreement between various European countries of a declaration for police. This would allow a garda to have proper safeguards in relation to the carrying out of his duties.  It would ensure that gardaí who do their work with integrity and in an impartial manner would be afforded every protection in resisting those who would have them act otherwise.  Members of the Garda must be beyond all possible reproach.  Unfortunately, as Derek Nally has said, Ireland, in common with other European countries, has been very reluctant to introduce this code of professional conduct.  The Council of Ministers has failed so far to sign an agreement in this regard which was agreed four years ago by the Council of Europe.  It is important that we outline this clearly, that we leave no ambivalence, in so far as the rights, the duties and the obligations of our Garda force are concerned.  That is why a declaration for the Garda would go a long way to allaying public fear in respect of the measure that is going through the Dáil now.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Association of <Col N="806" /> Garda Sergeants and Inspectors recommended in a very fine document the introduction of community policing.  Unfortunately, that document got very little attention in this House.  This is the way in which the Garda force of the future must develop.  There must be a two-tier structure whereby Garda will have very close contact with local communities and where somebody who would be responsible for a particular housing area would work with the various agencies working within that area &mdash; with police, teachers, doctors, social workers and so on.  This would allow the Garda to have a more personal relationship with the people they are supposed to patrol.  It would allow them to have first-hand experience of the kind of problems being experienced in any area.  Our present system does not allow the Garda to patrol areas adequately because of the demands on their time.  Many of them are involved in prosecutions in court while others must witness the signing of unemployment forms and so on.  This involves a lot of time, particularly in the large centres of population.</P>
    <P>Having praised the integrity of our Garda Síochána and the work they have done, I am disappointed in relation to this Bill that the Minister did not see fit to introduce either first or at the same time a proper and comprehensive complaints procedure.  In his opening speech he said that a complaints procedure will be established.  I am happy to hear that. The Minister has said that the complaints procedure may not involve legislation but he has given an assurance that at least there would be debate on the issue in both Houses prior to the establishment of that procedure.</P>
    <P>Before we can discuss this Bill adequately it is important that we know who will be responsible for appointing the complaints board; how they will be appointed; if they will be appointed, as I think they should, by the courts or by the Chief Justice; to whom they will be answerable; and also what kind of people will serve on the board.  We should know whether they will hear oral evidence and whether they will meet in public or in private.  Also, we should be told what <Col N="807" /> action they will take against any garda who breaks the law.  These are all fundamental questions that must be answered before we can pass a Bill of this kind.</P>
    <P>There have been cases in which gardaí have been charged with criminal offences. There are some such cases before the courts at the moment.  In any group of 11,000 people there are bound to be a few who will engage in criminal activity. In a recent edition of <i>Magill</i> magazine I read an article entitled &ldquo;The Seeds of a Police State.&rdquo;  It was alleged in that article that Oscar Breathnach, Nicky Kelly and Brian McNally were ill-treated by members of the Garda and that no investigation of any kind was undertaken into the evidence that this had occurred.  Articles of that kind do untold damage to our Garda force.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that we will have a complaints procedure in due course.  It emerged in a recent case that was heard in the Special Criminal Court that a garda had invented a statement in which it was alleged that an arrested person had committed a certain crime but that that person had not made any such admission. There may be such allegations against only a very small number of gardaí but these do serious damage to the morale of what is a very respectable and honest force.  Unless the complaints procedure is introduced forthwith, allegations of this kind will increase with a corresponding decrease in the confidence that the public have in the Garda.</P>
    <P>No fight against crime will be successful if in the first place the people do not have confidence in and respect for the Garda. In October 1977 the then Government established the Ó Briain Committee for the purpose of recommending certain safeguards for persons in custody and for members of the Garda.  The Ó Briain report came to the conclusion that the protection of a person in Garda custody and the protection of the Garda from false allegations are two sides of the same coin.  It is as important to protect people in custody as it is to protect the good name and reputation of the Garda. Despite the fact that that report was made some years ago we have done virtually <Col N="808" /> nothing about it and this Bill does nothing to introduce many of the reccommendations of the Ó Briain Commission.</P>
    <P>Our legal system has one very good provision, that is, that a person is innocent until proven guilty.  That is fundamental to our legal and judicial process. I am disappointed that in this Bill we see an erosion of this principle.  We will be virtually switching, from the courtroom to the Garda station the trial of a suspected person who has been arrested and charged.  I am disappointed about that.</P>
    <P>I welcome measures in the Bill, particularly that in relation to the notice of an alibi, which is long overdue.  Equally, I welcome the decision to introduce majority verdicts in criminal trials and the provisions in relation to bail and stiffer penalties for those involved in car stealing and so on.  However, I am disappointed that the Bill contains no provision in relation to handbag snatching which has caused great distress to many female members of the population.  Many women have suffered quite severe injuries at the hands of criminals involved in this type of activity.  Picking pockets and similar crimes are not mentioned in the Bill.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill gives the Garda powers to detain a person suspected of having committed an offence worthy of five years or more imprisonment and it gives them extraordinary powers to take that person in and question him for some time.  Many may say that there is nothing really wrong with that, and maybe it is the price we must pay in order to make our streets safer or to fight the criminal. If it is the price we are all prepared to pay it, but as we are paying the price we are entitled to get value for our money.  We are entitled at least to have access there and then to a legal adviser.  This measure gives the Garda only the responsibility to inform the person of his right to consult a solicitor and, following that, to inform the solicitor as soon as is practicable.  We do not know when &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; might be; it could be hours.  That is not good enough.  The duty must rest on the garda in question to inform the solicitor within, say, two hours and that may be too long <Col N="809" /> in some cases.  Some people will ask where you can get a solicitor at a particular time.  We could have available a panel of solicitors who would serve on some kind of rota basis and would be available at all times to be consulted by persons in detention.  Because of the serious changes being made in these measures in the Bill it is absolutely fundamental that a solicitor or legal adviser be there when the person is answering questions.</P>
    <P>Equally, it is not good enough that the garda must inform either the next of kin or the named person as soon as practicable. If a person is arrested and taken in, being suspected of having committed a crime, the wife, husband, mother, father or whoever the person wants to be notified is entitled to be notified.  I can envisage very many people staying up for many hours waiting for husband, wife or whoever to come home not knowing where the person is.  It is not good enough to inflict that kind of punishment on people in custody who may well be innocent or on their families.  This Bill should provide for an obligation on the Garda to inform the next of kin or named person within a specific time.  Regarding juveniles, it is not right that any juvenile should be questioned and detained by the Garda in the absence of a parent.  It is of paramount importance that the parent or guardian be informed forthwith of the juvenile's detention and the juvenile should have the right to have the parent or guardian there.  It is equally important to have a solicitor present.</P>
    <P>This section will militate particularly against the less well-educated.  Most people, particularly ordinary Irish people, never come into contact with the law.  If a person is suspected by a garda &mdash; who has to have only reasonable grounds for suspicion; he does not have to tell the person so and it appears there is nowhere to record what the reasonable grounds are &mdash; when that person is taken into a Garda station he will probably react in a very strange way as most people do because they are not accustomed to being in a Garda station.  It is of paramount importance to the impartiality of what is being conducted and for the rights <Col N="810" /> of the individual that he has present his legal adviser and his parent or next of kin.  I am appalled that that provision is not included in the Bill.  What are we afraid of?  I can see many court cases leading to swearing matches as to who said what.  The garda may say one thing, the citizen may say another, with no independent person there.</P>
    <P>The punishment for committing a crime must be given only after a court has properly and fully decided that that person is guilty and if there is any doubt as to his guilt then no punishment should be inflicted.  In this Bill punishment will be inflicted before we even know if the person has committed a crime.  That is an appalling loophole in the legislation.  In 1981, for example, 2,303 people were arrested in Ireland and only 323 of that number were subsequently charged.  In 1982 the number arrested was 2,308 and only 256 were charged.  In 1982, in other words, eight out of every nine people arrested were innocent.  If these figures are to apply after this Bill is passed, are we to assume that eight out of every nine people who will suffer as a result of these measures will be innocent and will be held in a Garda station without a solicitor, parent or the next of kin, for many hours?  We must look seriously at what we are passing here because it will create enormous problems for us and for our Garda force.  I want to quote the remarks of Sergeant John O'Brien in relation to the first few sections of the Bill as published in the <i>Garda Review</i>.  He said:</P>
    <P>Criminal trials are an exercise in semantics with elaborate games being played with the rules of evidence and particularly the law on the admissability of evidence being the main target. I believe that the above-mentioned matters &mdash; sections 3, 4 and 5 of the Bill &mdash; are likely to make this situation worse.</P>
    <P>I am worried about section 5 particularly since I am one of the few women Deputies in this Dáil.  When I contradict an official statement issued by the Minister of State with responsibility for Women's Affairs I do not do so with any disrespect to her.  I have great respect for Deputy <Col N="811" /> Fennell.  I saw fit at the weekend to outline my reservations about the powers being given to the Garda in relation to strip-searching.  It is not good enough that a male garda under the direction of a superintendent can strip-search a female if he suspects her of having explosive weapons on her person or being in possession of drugs.  A strip-search examination can be a very intimate internal examination.  I made those remarks and they were reported in Monday's <i>Irish Press</i>.  In response to those remarks Deputy Fennell issued the following statement which I will read into the record of the House:</P>
    <P>Deputy Mary Harney is reported in today's <i>Irish Press</i> as having said that Section 5 of the Criminal Justice Bill, 1983, would allow male gardaí to strip-search female suspects in a most intimate way.  That is not correct. There is no question of a person being strip-searched except by a member of the Garda of the same sex.  The existing instructions issued to the gardaí make it clear that any search of a female person must be carried out by a female and, so far as the Minister is aware, there has never been any complaint that these instructions are not strictly adhered to.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State continued:</P>
    <P>What the Bill in fact does is to prohibit strip-searching except where there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that drugs or explosives are concealed. Even then, it can be done only on the authority of a superintendent.  At present there is no statutory prohibition on strip-searching so that in this respect the Bill provides an additional safeguard to detained persons.</P>

      <P>It was an official Government statement on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Justice and <Col N="812" /> was issued on Monday, 28 November. That statement worries me.  In the Bill there is no statutory provision that a female has to be strip-searched by a ban-gharda.  All we have to rely on, as the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, said, are the internal rules of the Garda where they indicate that they would not allow that to happen.  That is not good enough.  We must write it into the legislation so that it is beyond all reasonable doubt.  As I indicated earlier, in Tallaght there is no female garda and this applies to Garda stations in many parts of the country.  How will it be possible to get a ban-gharda to do the strip-search?  Unless this provision is written into the Bill and the law copperfastened, I will not be happy.</P>
      <P>Irrespective of party politics, all Deputies, in particular female Deputies, owe it to the women of Ireland to make sure this provision is included in the legislation. Where it is suspected that stolen money or weapons that may have been used in a murder are in the possession of a person, I wish to know why such cases have been excluded.  There have been cases where people have been able to conceal on their body weapons used in a murder, or stolen money.  Yet the Garda have not been given authority in such cases to strip-search a suspect.  It is not good enough that it can be done only in the case of drugs or explosives.</P>
      <P>I am happy to see a change in the provisions regarding bail.  There was growing public dissatisfaction with the fact that while on bail many people committed further crimes.  It is time consecutive sentences were given.  The length of time from when a prosecution is brought until the case is eventually finished or dismissed by the court is too long.  The reason is a lack of adequate court facilities. It was reported that of every ten crimes brought before the courts in a year only one was cleared in that time by the courts.  In other words, the long delay in clearing cases leads people while on bail to commit further crimes.  Side-by-side with giving consecutive sentences, it is important to speed up the court process that will allow the cases to be heard much more quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="813" /> Sections 14 and 15 create new offences in regard to the withholding of information regarding firearms, ammunition and stolen property.  Nobody could disagree with that.  I find it strange that if somebody co-operates with the Garda, if they give a full account of where they got the stolen goods, such account is inadmissable in evidence or in any proceedings taken against them or their spouse. In other words, if a person gives a full admission to committing a crime it is not admissible, and I find that extraordinary. I cannot understand the reason for this measure.  I wish the Minister were here so that he could explain it in due course.</P>
    <P>Given that there will be a change in the law in relation to the right to silence, I am disappointed that adequate provision has not been made in section 26 to have a full verbatim report where a suspect is being questioned in a Garda station.  The proceedings should be properly and adequately recorded.  Since this evidence will be fundamental in any subsequent trial and can be of paramount importance in deciding whether a person is innocent or guilty, the legislators have a duty to ensure that a proper account is given of what the person said in the Garda station. Since there will not be an independent person there, since there will not be a verbatim report or any recording, how can we know what happened?  We will have to rely on the integrity of the Garda as to what the person said.  However, since a garda does not have to write down what the person tells him, how can we know who said what when the case comes before the court six months or 12 months later?</P>
    <P>Since this Bill can inflict a sentence of many years, can send people to a penal institution and make a dramatic change in their life, it is fundamental to the development of the democratic principles and civil rights here that no innocent person is ever convicted as a result of this legislation.  In the absence of a proper recording or verbatim report or of an independent witness such as a solictor, how can we know beyond all reasonable doubt what somebody admitted?</P>
    <P>Many of the lawyers in this House dealt very adequately with the technical matters <Col N="814" /> in the Bill, particularly in relation to sections 16, 17 and 18 &mdash; these are the sections relating to the inferences from the failure of the accused to mention and account for certain matters.  As I said earlier, many people, particularly those who have never been in contact with the law, have a fear of the Garda Síochána. This is a fear many Irish people have and it is based out of respect for the Garda and it is unfortunate that many young people do not have that same respect. However, out of this fear which is born of respect many people behave in a strange way when they go to a Garda station and have to answer questions. People with legal experience are well aware that many cases have been dismissed simply because the only evidence was that given as a confession in the Garda station on the night the person was arrested.  Many courts have seen fit to dismiss such evidence and they have done so for a number of reasons.  For example, in the case of the Sallins train robbery two of the three people convicted were freed by the Court of Criminal Appeal despite voluntary confessions in a Garda station on the night in question. Does that not bring home the importance of this section?</P>
    <P>What are illiterate persons to say or not to say in a Garda station?  They are told they must answer questions and must satisfy certain measures.  We are not told what are the measures.  How are they to know what is important to tell the Garda and what is not important?  It will be very difficult for people who have little education and who have not a solicitor to help them.  This section will apply to minor offences such as parking offences, not just to the more serious offences. Some prominent lawyers have written in newspaper articles recently that this measure will apply across the board: according to one lawyer, it will apply even in the case of a parking offence.  I find that situation very strange.</P>
    <P>For a will to have the full force of law it has to be witnessed.  Is not a person suspected of criminal activity and who is charged with a criminal offence entitled to a witness being present, to know what <Col N="815" /> questions are asked and what answers are given?</P>
    <P>As a result of this and other measures, our court cases will develop into swearing matches as to who said what.  It will lead to further allegations against the Garda and a loss of public confidence in the force.  That will be a pity.  The 11,000 gardaí in the country have served the country well.  They have worked in difficult circumstances and some have lost their lives in the course of duty.  If, as a result of the Bill they are subjected to people questioning what they said, I do not think that is good enough.  It is not good enough in a free democratic society like ours that has always cherished civil liberities, where our constitution provides that we cherish all citizens, that we do not introduce in this legislation adequate safeguards and precautions.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the vast majority of people are in sympathy with the principles in this Bill.  The Bill is designed to bring justice to criminals, to bring peace back to our streets, to give the Garda what many of them believe are necessary powers.  It has support and it may do a great deal of good.  But equally six months, or five years, or whatever from now, if our crime rate continues to rise beyond the level it is, the Irish people will not thank the Members of Dáil and Seanad Éireann for bringing in this kind of legislation in 1983.  Will the mother or the child killed as a result of joy riding, the person who has been the victim of serious crime, thank us if adequate precautions and adequate measures are not taken?</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, we cannot isolate the social problems that bedevil our society as a result of the crime rate we currently have; but the fact is that the majority involved in crime come from poor, disadvantaged areas.  Their standard of education is low.  Job opportunities are almost nil.  In the inner city area almost 75 per cent of the population are unemployed.  What chance have young people growing up there?  What chance has the young person the victim of a broken marriage, the father an alcoholic who beats up the mother, what chance <Col N="816" /> has he got?  What chance has a young child sent out to beg on the streets to bring back money to his or her parents. These are the people who are at risk. There are very many families living below the poverty line who are at risk.  I know some of them myself.  It saddens me to see the like in 1983.  The reality is they look to Dáil Éireann and to the Government, to the people in the political parties, to provide the kind of solution that will rid them of their poverty.</P>
    <P>Have we, I wonder, responded well to the needs and demands of these people? Should we not be introducing a far more radical and far more in-depth study of the whole crime problem?  Is it not time, as I said earlier, that many of the fundamental pieces of legislation like the Vagrancy Act, which still makes it an offence to be homeless, were examined? Is it not time to have an adequate Bill brought before the Oireachtas to give children adequate protection before the law?  Is it not time we defined what we really mean by crime?  Is the young child, the young juvenile who comes from a disadvantaged background who stole a pair of gloves worth less than £2 and was sent to an institution to serve a sentence, is he more of a criminal than a man who does not pay his taxes, the trader who overcharges or the developer who leaves the housing estate in an appalling condition having taken the money from the people who bought the houses?  White collar crime is rampant in this city and it is time we tackled white collar crime as well.  Unless people see us, the legislators, responding to all the injustice and unfairnesses in society we cannot expect families who are at risk to have any respect for the law.  Respect for the law can only be engendered if people adhere to the letter of the law and if people live by the law.  Only in that way can all our citizens truly have the constitutional guarantees of equality of rights and equality of opportunity.  Can we expect those who are at risk, who live in social deprivation, the 3,000 or so that we are told are homeless, to have respect for the law if they see us ignoring the very many serious offences that are committed and yet are not classified?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="817" /> The fact is that there are various reasons, causes, types of crime.  There are many in our society who, irrespective of the laws, irrespective of social environment, irrespective of their education, will continue to break the law.  We will never rid our streets totally of crime but the fact is that we have a responsibility to introduce the kind of measures which will live up to the changes which have taken place in society.  We have the responsibility and we have the power.</P>
    <P>The Ireland of 1983 is very different from the Ireland of 1926.  In 1926, 25 per cent of the people were living in urban areas.  Today 60 per cent live in urban areas.  Since most of the crime is concentrated in areas of dense population 60 per cent of crime is committed in the Dublin city and county areas.  Is it not a fact that the serious changes that have taken place in both the structure of our population and in the urbanisation and ruralisation of the country alone require us to look in new ways at the kind of measures we introduce?  Is it not an appalling reflection on all of us who have responsibility to legislate that many of the Bills fundamental to this whole question have been on the Statute Books since before the foundation of the State?  The Offences Against the Person Act, the Children Act, the Larceny Act, the Vagrancy Act &mdash; all these pre-date the foundation of the State.  That is an appalling reflection on us.</P>
    <P>Recently we set up an all-party committee to look into crime and vandalism. It was an excellent idea to bring together the expertise and the talent of the different Members who make up Dáil and Seanad Éireann.  That committee has brought together people of different political views.  Political differences are irrelevant and I hope that some of the reservations which I and my colleagues on this side of the House and, indeed, on the Fine Gael benches, have &mdash; reservations based on my perception of the person's civil rights, civil liberties &mdash; will be taken in all sincerity by the Minister because they are meant in all sincerity.  I have as much a desire as anybody else here to see our crime rate lowered but equally I want to see an Ireland more <Col N="818" /> caring and pluralistic, an Ireland that looks after its young children at risk, looks after the young family compelled to grow up in appalling conditions, young people who may come from homes in which the father and the mother may have served terms of imprisonment. These children are at risk and they will get involved in crime, as the figures have indicated, unless we do something about their plight.  We have a responsibility for them.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity now, and hopefully over the next few months on this all-party committee we will look in depth at the problems.  Consultations will take place with the Garda authorities. Consultations will likewise take place with the social workers who day in and day out work with these young people. Some of the teachers in my constituency have told me they can know as early as six or seven if a young person is going to be involved in crime at ten or 11 years of age.  They saw these at an early age at risk and there was nothing they could do about it.  There seems to be no mechanism to look after these children and take them out of the kind of environment in which they can only drift into a corrupt way of life.</P>
    <P>This Bill this year, perhaps another Bill in two years' time, more powers here and there &mdash; it is not as simple as that.  Many people in our society who commit crime are never detected.  Many who are victims of crime do not report that crime.  Our gardaí have to work in many cases in appalling conditions.  Some of our Garda stations are a disgrace to the nation.  The Tallaght Garda station is basically the same now as it was in 1960, although it now serves almost 70,000 people.  We must provide the Garda with back-up facilities in the form of equipment and manpower to enable them to carry out their duties.</P>
    <P>There must be a reappraisal of the method of recruitment to the Garda.  The association representing Garda sergeants and inspectors recommended that psychological assessment should be part of that recruitment procedure.  I fully subscribe to that idea.  In many cases gardaí deal with toughened criminals and they <Col N="819" /> need to be the kind of people who will have the correct emotional response under pressure.  Proper recruitment procedures must be adopted and adequate training must be given.  A course lasting 22 weeks is not adequate.  A young man or woman who grows up in a rural village in County Kerry or County Cork, joins the Garda and then spends 22 weeks in Templemore is not adequately equipped to patrol the streets of Tallaght or Finglas. More comprehensive training is necessary.</P>
    <P>I began last week by quoting the remarks of Senator Edward Kennedy who said: &ldquo;You did not make the world you live in but you have the chance to change it, to leave it better than you found it&rdquo;.  We in Dáil Éireann did not create the country we live in; we did not create the present crime wave, but we have the power and the opportunity to bring about the kind of changes that can leave this country better than we found it.</P>
    <P>We will be failing in our duty unless we bring in the necessary measures.  I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister and of the Government.  On all sides of the House the principle of this Bill was warmly welcomed.  Very often it is only after a couple of years of practical experience that we can know how effective a measure is.  In regard to this Bill, suffice it to say that many experienced lawyers have grave reservations.  Many people to whom I have spoken, social workers who work with criminals and those involved with the law, say that the answer is far more fundamental and that far more radical steps are needed than simply giving extra powers or removing the right to silence in certain cases.  These things may be necessary but they will not go any way towards solving the real problems unless we bring about the kind of social changes which will give some hope to the children at risk and the families who might drift into crime.</P>
    <P>The people involved in drug pushing and those who are the victims of drugs need to be helped by us and it is time we gave the necessary support to the Drugs Squad to allow them to fight the problem <Col N="820" /> in a realistic way.  We do not have the proper residential facilities for young drug offenders which would allow us to deal in a preventive rather than a curative way with drug problems.  We must ensure that our young people are adequately educated regarding the seriousness of getting involved with drugs.  It is to our shame, particularly the shame of those of us in Dáil Éireann, that a programme recently broadcast by BBC indicated that 10 per cent of young people in an inner city area of Dublin are heroin addicts. Some of these people are as young as ten years of age.  It is an appalling reflection on us and it is time we realised the extent of the problem.</P>
    <P>I wish to have the opportunity on Committee Stage to move some amendments on the more serious aspects of this measure. I hope that nobody will doubt the sincerity of all in this House in fighting the criminal and bringing down the crime rate.  The challenge which faces all of us is to do something effective about the crime problem.  We have an obligation and, irrespective of our party allegiance, we must come together to fight this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend in the course of my remarks to make a few general comments on the growth of crime and our approach to it and then to look at the two most contentious areas, namely, the new power of inference from the silence of persons in custody and the new power to detain people on suspicion of being involved in serious crime.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that crime has become a very sophisticated business.  A close look at the 1982 crime statistics testifies to that fact.  In 1982, 98,000 indictable offences were committed, more than twice the level of ten years ago.  The detection rate has fallen from 50 per cent ten years ago to about 33 per cent.  The value of stolen goods is about £29 million and only 8 per cent is recovered.  Perhaps the most worrying feature is that one-third of persons apprehended for indictable offences are juveniles. These figures testify to the growth of the problem of crime which has affected each of us in some way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="821" /> It must also be pointed out that the law enforcement arm of the State has grown enormously and the cost of law enforcement has risen in real terms from £136 per family to £300 per family within ten years.  This means that every family must find £300 to finance the Garda, prison officers and courts.  Our response to the growth in crime has been largely to throw more money and personnel at the problem. Garda numbers have increased from 8,000 ten years ago to 11,500.  For every 80 families there is one garda.  That is a level of policing which seems enormously high.  The position in regard to prison officers is even more startling.  In ten years the number has gone up fourfold from 400 to 1,600.  One of the worrying features is that the cost of keeping a person in prison is about £30,000 per annum.  For that amount one could employ a chief executive in one of our semi-State bodies.  It is a truly amazing figure.</P>
    <P>I question our approach as a community to the problem of crime in that we have concentrated on putting more manpower and money into solving this problem.  At the same time we discover that there has been no analysis of the background of those who engage in crime.  It startles me to find in the Report of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors on community policing that they did not have access to the background research of those engaging in crime.  We must question what has been done about crime if we are to come to grips with this growing blight on our community. There must be serious misgivings about how we organise the resources in the law enforcement services.  I doubt if the organisation of gardaí and prison officers is up to the proper standard in terms of management of resources in order to get proper results.

      <P>Last night Deputy Molloy said it was a sad spectable to see <Col N="823" /> old people being brought through the court system and we all agree with that view.  That was one of the reasons why the original Bill was dealt with as a matter of urgency in the House last July.  Deputy Molloy last night levelled some criticism at the Members of the Labour Party for their lack of concern.  I do not accept that criticism.  Deputy Quinn in the last Dáil, when Deputy Burke was Minister, highlighted the plight of the tenants affected by the legislation.  When he was appointed Minister of State he succeeded in putting amending legislation through the House.  Fianna Fáil co-operated fully in July and for that reason I was surprised that they proposed an amendment to the Bill.  On 7 July, in the course of the debate on the original legislation, Deputy Molloy said:</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party give a wholehearted welcome to this Bill.  The Minister need not offer an apology for the short period allowed for the debate. We recognise the time restrictions on the Minister and we thank him for having ensured that this legislation was finally brought before the Dáil in this session.</P>
      <P>It is amazing that a few months later Deputy Molloy is moving an amendment to the legislation.</P>
      <P>We all agree that some of the people who were brought through the courts were completely at sea and in surroundings that were alien to them.  The Government were advised that it would be unconstitutional to introduce retrospective legislation and that is why some people had to endure the hardship of going through the court system.  It is significant that the Fianna Fáil speakers last night, Deputies Molloy and Tunney, did not offer any criticism of the tribunal.  I accept that the tribunal have only heard 14 cases to date but I thought we would be trying to improve the system and, if necessary, introduce changes to make it more humane and acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will refer to some of the shortcomings of the tribunal system later.  Some of the valuers appearing before the courts and the tribunal are doing irreparable damage <Col N="824" /> to their profession.  The behaviour of some of them does not do them any credit.  They are applying a system of market value to houses and that is wrong. Some families have lived in their houses for more than 80 years and they cannot be compared with short term lettings as valuers have been doing.  I would have thought Deputy Molloy would have put forward suggestions to improve that and accept the advice of the Attorney General and his predecessors that such cases cannot be removed from the court unless by mutual consent.</P>
    <P>Many people feel aggrieved that proof of ownership is not established under the current system.  In some cases there is not proper title to the property.  Owners have died and over many years agents have collected the rent.  This problem should be tackled and proper title should be proved.  There has been a suspicion in many cases in Cork city that the person claiming the increase in rent is not the rightful owner and there is a fear that the age and condition of a house is not taken into consideration.  When the original legislation was introduced in July many Cork Members contributed to the debate.  That was not surprising when one considers that this is a major problem in Cork city.  In that debate the point was made that most of the houses were given to tenants in a poor state of repair.  As a result they had to spend substantial amounts rendering them habitable which they feel was not taken into account. There is then the cost of the solicitor and the valuer.  In the few short weeks of the tribunal's existence we have had a situation in which people in receipt of social welfare have had to bear costs amounting to over £200 if they were to defend their cases.  This is something which will have to be tackled under the courts' system, when the cost was actually borne by the landlord.  A person on a low income at present is very vulnerable and cannot afford the best advice of a solicitor or valuer if they are to emerge with a fair rent.  It may seem rather extraordinary that a Government party backbencher is suggesting these changes.  But in the light of the working of the tribunal and its <Col N="825" /> close monitoring by various tenants' associations, these points have arisen.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that there was not sufficient time in the setting up of the Rents Tribunal to appoint a rents' officer in the various local authorities and that there were certain problems with regard to reaching agreement between the various trade unions involved.  This matter should be attended to immediately.  In so doing it would remove the matter from the courts' system and from within the jurisdiction of the Rents Tribunal as well as which agreement might more easily be reached between tenant and landlord without going to the expense of a court hearing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Another flaw that crops up in the system is that the Rents Tribunal do not have power to force a landlord to carry out repairs to a property. This may be a legal entitlement.  But there should be some mechanism available to the tribunal which would permit them to compel a landlord to carry out such repairs where necessary.  There is then the question of assessment of the rent.  Gratuities, retirement pensions, lump sums, payments of this nature should not be taken into account.  Here I am referring to lump sums paid to former employees, perhaps the equivalent to one-and-a-half year's wages on retirement and which should not be taken into account in assessing their rent.  This practice should be discontinued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is need also for the appointment of rents tribunals at various centres, perhaps in the major urban areas.  It would add considerably to overall costs if the tribunal have to travel from Dublin and there would be the inherent danger also of a backlog of cases to be heard in various centres.  Such rents tribunals, if operating at local level, would be familiar with local conditions and local effective market values of properties.  At present a valuer can strike any figure he wishes. Granted there can be a margin of error <Col N="826" /> on either side but the behaviour of valuers today leaves a lot to be desired.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed to say the very least that the Fianna Fáil Party felt compelled at this early stage to seek an amendment knowing full well what was involved and that the advice of the Attorney-General was not heeded.  We all share that concern. This concern manifested itself earlier on the introduction of the Bill by the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, who at all times has shown his concern for the people who will be affected by this Bill. It was accepted in July.  Now, five months later, I fail to understand why there is an &ldquo;about turn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In the very short time in which the Rents Tribunal has been in operation I should have preferred that we would have continued to monitor its operations, hoping that we would devise a system more equitable than that at present obtaining.  At present it is far from satisfactory. Perhaps that is understandable because it is the first of its kind, there are no precedents, people have had little experience in this field and it would take time to overcome the various teething troubles involved.</P>

      <P>I find this a very curious legislative provision before us.  I found speeches made on it yesterday by Members opposite even more curious.  The reason I find this whole exercise exceedingly curious and peculiar is that the rents legislation with which we are concerned, the primary legislation, was that passed by the Fianna Fáil Government through this House in the spring of 1982.  This <Col N="827" /> Government subsequently amended that legislation by providing for rents tribunals.</P>
      <P>The Bill before us now seeks to enable those cases that are heading into the District Courts, which had been set down here in the District Courts prior to the recent legislation about rents tribunals, to be sent on to the Rents Tribunals at the request of one party to the proceedings. It was explained yesterday evening that there might be, there appears to be, or the Government have been advised that there is a constitutional difficulty with that Bill.  I do not know personally whether or not there is a constitutional difficulty in transferring this jurisdiction in this way.  The Government are advised that there is &mdash; there could be differing views on that &mdash; but it appears there may be a problem.  We had Members opposite yesterday evening shedding crocodile tears for the difficulties being experienced by many people, particularly elderly people, who found themselves in the District Court unable to cope with or understand what was taking place.</P>
      <P>The reason this is a curious legislative exercise for Members opposite is that, when the original Bill was tabled by the Fianna Fáil Government, it provided for the District Court to deal with these matters. When that Bill came before this House on Committee Stage I formally tabled amendments on behalf of the Fine Gael Party to provide for, guess what &mdash; the establishment of rents tribunals.  That Bill enacted by that Fianna Fáil Government had, on Committee Stage, a very comprehensive amendment tabled by the Fine Gael Party to provide for the immediate establishment of rents tribunals which, if passed, would have ensured that none of these cases ever found their way into the District Court, that no elderly people would have been subjected to the more formal courtroom procedures than they would have experienced appearing before tribunals.  That would have prevented any difficulties such as those arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in the spring of 1982? Deputy R. Burke, the then Minister for the Environment, said he did not really <Col N="828" /> feel at that stage that rents tribunals were appropriate.  The Workers' Party, who had got round to tabling amendments in favour of rents tribunals, retreated to a spectacular attitude and the then Minister, Deputy Burke, appealed to the Workers' Party not to vote for rents tribunals because the Government might be defeated on the issue.  The Workers' Party looked into their navels, examined their social conscience and joined the Fianna Fáil Party to vote against the establishment of rents tribunals, while Fine Gael and Labour voted in favour of them.</P>
    <P>This exercise here yesterday and today is one of the sickest pieces of political posturing I have seem in my time here. Have Fianna Fáil suddenly discovered they have a social conscience?  Where was Deputy Molloy, who tabled this Bill, when Deputy Burke, the Minister, introduced the original legislation and opposed amendments to establish rents tribunals?  Was Deputy Molloy protesting? Did he suffer a pang of conscience? Did he feel he should vote against it and vote in favour of rents tribunals when the original legislation was before the House?  Has Deputy Molloy a greater social conscience than Deputy Burke?  Is that why they have changed places, with one now assigned to the wilderness?</P>
    <P>On a personal level I have great regard for both those Deputies but I must say that the attitude taken in this House on this legislation is an example of the type of thing that results in people outside the House viewing our behaviour here with a measure of utter and complete contempt. The problem that now exists has been created solely by the party opposite, but now they are shedding crocodile tears for the difficulties they themselves created for many elderly people, in Dublin and Cork particularly.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for the sudden metamorphosis that has resulted in Fianna Fáil realising there is a need for rents tribunals?  There are two reasons.  The first is the Dublin Central by-election when members of that party discovered many elderly people who were experiencing difficulties in the District Court. Of course they won that by-election.  Is <Col N="829" /> the appearance of this legislation the result of a pang of conscience all of a sudden, with Fianna Fáil saying: &ldquo;<i>Mea culpa</i>, we will go in to confess our sins. We have realised we should have done it in 1982.  We have suddenly seen the light&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of course it is not.  This is about playing party politics.  They have put the measure to the House in the hope that it will be voted down and that they can troop around to doors in their constituencies saying: &ldquo;Did you see the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party voting against rents tribunals&rdquo;?  They know that is arrant nonsense.  I deplore that kind of political opportunism.  It does not lend anything to the legislative process and it does nothing to help those people whom the party opposite are allegedly trying to help by this legislation.  It would have been considerably more responsible and credible if they had accepted the original legislation and if they had not voted against the establishment of rents tribunals. Let us not have further displays of hypocrisy by members opposite blaming this Government for the difficulties being experienced by elderly people who find themselves before the District Court to deal with their rents problems.  Their difficulties are due to one thing only&mdash;failure of Fianna Fáil when in Government to allow their own legislative provisions to be amended to permit the establishment of rents tribunals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been told that the only objection from the other side of the House is a constitutional one.  We have been told that constitutionally the Bill may not be right, but we have been told that it is constitutionally possible to put this Bill through the House.  Many thousands of cases had been lodged for hearing in the District Court before 2 August last.</P>
      <P>I will give two typical examples of landlords taking advantage of the situation. One involved an elderly lady.  We know that extortionate rents are being charged by the landlords following District Court hearings.  We may have the same situation when tribunals have been established but the tenants will be given an opportunity to present their cases there.</P>
      <P>I will cite two cases.  With some of my colleagues, I attended a District Court sitting to hear rent cases.  The first concerned a lady of 82 years who had been a tenant since 1962 at a rent of £8.62 per week.  The house was in a shocking state of repair.  The first floor where she lived overlooked a car park on one side and a corporation laneway with houses off it on the other.  There were no facilities for storing refuse or fuel &mdash; such items had to be stored within the flat.  The valuer accepted that the roof, the windows, the landings and the paint work were in very poor condition.  The faulty roof had enabled pigeons to gain access to the attic.  The tenant had complied with the agreement to maintain the interior of the flat.  The justice sought clarification on the repairs required in order to justify a rent of £130 per month.  On being made aware of the work involved, he fixed a rent of £126 a month and refused a stay pending completion of the repairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That case seemed bad enough until we came to the second.  It involved a lady born in 1898 with an income of £80 per week from a Posts and Telegraphs pension. She was living in a three-room self-contained flat at a rent of £1.21 a week.  In the previous year she had spent £800 on necessary replacements of a bath, a w.c., an immersion heater and a <Col N="831" /> water tank, as well as sewerage repairs. The landlady offered a refund of £170 against that outlay.  The flat had major defects in the roof with consequent dry rot in the floors and the skirting.  These conditions were extremely dangerous for an old person.</P>
    <P>That type of court, though intended to be informal, is intimidating for the elderly who make up the majority of the people involved.  We seek in the Bill to give the same rights to the tenants that the landlords have.  Tribunals will be somewhat more informal.  The landlords have a very powerful lobby but the tenants have nobody to represent them.  We want to give them some protection.  For that reason, we have submitted this Bill. Even if the Minister feels it is unconstitutional he should accept it and send it to the President who may refer it to the Supreme Court at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the real reason for the introduction of the Bill.  Did it stem from a general concern for the elderly or poorer sections of the community who might be in decontrolled rented dwellings and who might be liable to be subjected to the rather rigid harassment of court proceedings to attain their rights?  Was it introduced for mischievous reasons to which Deputy Shatter has already alluded?  Deputy Molloy indicated last evening that it was introduced for a genuine reason and that the Government had only responded to Fianna Fáil promptings originally when we had included a provision for tribunals.  Who responded to whom when the original Bill was introduced?  Were it not for a decision of the courts the legislation would not have been introduced in the first place and I think it was the Minister who said that perhaps legislators do not respond quickly enough in introducing legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Molloy questioned the validity of the legal opinion which was available to the Government which suggested that it might be unconstitutional to withdraw the cases which are now before the courts and to bring them before the tribunals. He went on to suggest that perhaps there <Col N="832" /> was more eminent legal opinion available to the Opposition.  He went further and said that the Government appeared to be backing the landlords and that people on this side of the House had a vested interest in opposing this Bill.  That amazes me because I thought that Members on the opposite benches would surely include people who were representative of landlords and speculators.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney presented a very constructive appraisal of the situation.  He seemed to be very familiar with the subject and probably has ample experience in this field like many other Members of the House.  He saw difficulties from the point of view of poor and elderly people who had lived for a great number of years in a dwelling suddenly finding their rents jacked up by a decision of the courts. This could also happen if a decision was taken by the tribunal.  Those of us who have attended oral hearings on planning matters know full well the expertise, power and persuasion that can be drawn upon by powerful groups, usually speculators or vested interest groups.  The tenants would not necessarily be able to call on the same expertise and would find themselves at a decided disadvantage when being cross-questioned by the landlords' representatives in the circumstances to which Deputy Tunney referred.</P>
    <P>I do not see how this amendment will change one iota of the <i>status quo</i>, for the simple reason that regardless of whether the decision comes before the courts or the tribunals, more or less the same procedures will be gone through.  The case for and against will be made and, without a shadow of doubt, the more powerful group will always be able to present the more convincing argument.  They will have the time, money and expertise to do the research necessary to make a very careful presentation of their case to ensure that from the point of view of the person who has to adjudicate, they will have at their disposal convincing information which will ensure that the powerful group will win.  Unfortunately, this Bill will not change that position.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see, the Bill was introduced purely for mischievous reasons in order, as Deputy Shatter indicated, to <Col N="833" /> show to the unfortunate sector of the electorate that there is a genuine effort being made by Deputy Molloy and others to alleviate their situation.  That is what brings politics and politicians into disrepute because people will ultimately see that their hopes are being dashed once more.  The unfortunate poor and old citizens have, up to now, seen Deputy Molloy as their champion, the man who is going to fight their case for them and ensure that they will get fair play.  The Bill does nothing to help these people who would normally be housed in the rented dwellings to which the Bill refers. For that reason the Bill can only have been introduced, as I said, for mischievous reasons.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy queried the validity of the Attorney General's advice.  It does not seem to be a very good idea to have an Attorney General if the Government do not have regard to his advice.  That does not necessarily mean that we should not listen to other advice but it is the job of the Attorney General to advise the Government.  He does so and I have heard no argument put forward by the Members on the opposite side of the House which would indicate that his advice is invalid, that he has not considered the situation fully and that they have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy said that they have a considerable body of legal opinion who think otherwise and perhaps it is good that people like that are in opposition.  There is provision in the original Bill to ensure that the tenants are supported by the social welfare rent allowance scheme and that their interests will be protected.  Deputy Tunney said that it appears that we would be subsidising the landlords but we must ask ourselves whether we are prepared to subsidise the tenants.  Maybe, in the final analysis, that goes into the landlord's pocket but if we do not do that the alternative is that the rent will be increased and, as a result, the tenants will be poorer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to what was said previously <Col N="834" /> when the original Bill was going through the House I cannot understand the reason for the introduction of this Bill now.  I can only conclude that it is being introduced for mischievous reasons because it can not do any possible good.</P>

      <P>Tá díomá mhór orm nar ghlac an Rialtas leis an mBille seo. Léiríonn siad nach bhfuil siad réidh aon faoiseamh a thabhairt don chruatan agus don imní atá ar dhaoine i lár na cathrach agus ar fud na cathrach go léir.</P>
      <P>I am extremely disappointed at the attitude of the Government in relation to this Bill.  I am disappointed, too, that Deputies of the calibre of Deputy Shatter would come here and utter what was cynical mumbo jumbo and political point scoring in an effort to confuse the issue. He, together with the Tánaiste and the other Members of the Cabinet, has been unable to grapple with the question of doubt as to the constitutionality or otherwise of this Bill.  That is the fundamental point of difference.  According to the Minister for the Environment last evening it would seem to be the one fundamental point of difference between both sides in relation to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I heard Deputy Shatter refer to the question of the constitutionality of the Bill, I was hoping that he would make direct references to the Constitution based on the best advice available from the Attorney General.  Instead, all we heard was a lashing criticism of Fianna Fáil for what they did in 1982 when they failed to take up what Deputy Shatter recommended then.  If the Deputy were as serious this evening as he was supposed to have been in 1982, why did he not stay on and put forward a serious, comprehensive legal argument against our Bill? All he did was to chide us and reprimand us for not accepting the decision of the Attorney General.  As a Member of this House I take grave exception to any Deputy telling me that I should accept without question the decision of the Attorney General.  In saying that I mean no disrespect to his Office.  He is appointed by the Government of the day in their wisdom.  His office must be respected but any time I consider that <Col N="835" /> there is doubt in relation to any decision of the Attorney General, I will consider it my duty to express that doubt.</P>
    <P>Even if I, as a backbench Deputy with no legal experience, were to allow for the doubt that the Minister continued to express during his 40-minute contribution last evening, I fail to see how, on the basis of that doubt alone, he could reject our Bill or reject suggestions from us that we were prepared to co-operate regarding any amendment the Government wished to bring forward which would enable victims of the present system of processing cases in the District Court to have some kind of redress.  I am very disappointed that the Minister for the Environment failed to address himself to the question of the constitutionality of what we are proposing, with the exception of saying that the Attorney General expressed a doubt about it.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Minister failed to deal with the issues involved in the District Court in regard to the cases that are being processed there.  I shall not delay too long in outlining the hardships, the fears and the difficulties being experienced by those people who have been called before the courts but I speak from personal knowledge, having spoken with at least 30 such people in a certain area of this city.  I do not wish to be dramatic or in any way to use the hardships experienced by these people to illustrate what is a very fundamental difficulty but I consider myself compelled on the basis of approaches made to me to quote at least two examples.  One concerns a case in Aberdeen Street in which a lady died within days of receiving a valuation drawn up by her landlord or by a company acting on his behalf.  I have been told by her doctor that the fatal heart attack she suffered could be attributed directly to the shock she sustained on receiving that bill.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other fundamental issues in relation to this whole matter.  Briefly I wish to refer to the manner in which Folio Homes notified the tenants of their intention to process the claims through the court.  The House will recall that the Housing (Private Rented <Col N="836" /> Dwellings) (Amendment) Bill, 1983 became effective on 2 August 1983.  On July 1 Folio Homes decided to process in excess of 300 cases.  This was four days before the Bill was circulated.  The properties in question were formerly the property of Dublin Artisan Dwellings.  Section 12 of the Act requires that no landlord can make an application to the court unless he has notified the tenant a full month previously of the intention to lodge the application.  On the basis of the evidence available to me from the people who have been brought before the courts already and from those who have been notified of the landlord's intention to bring them before the courts, it seems to me that Folio Homes made a concerted effort to circumvent section 12.  Admittedly the applications for hearing were lodged with the District Court on 29 July 1983.  That was a few days ahead of the legislation but the notices of intent were not posted to the tenants for a couple of months later.  In other words, these notices were dated 1 July 1983 and were lodged on the 29th of that month, but the tenants did not receive them until months afterwards.</P>
    <P>If this is deemed to be legal by the justices who are processing these cases, the whole thing smacks of legal fiction.  If the landlords, especially Folio Homes, have to resort to this kind of manouvering, the whole operation must be suspect. On the basis of the evidence available to me I am demanding that the Attorney General be called in to investigate the cases that have been heard already and to refer them, as a matter of priority, to a higher court.  I will not accept the suggestion from any source that the tenants should be asked to take this course of action.  The basic objection to that would be that the costs would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the manner in which the valuers operate.  They were the firm of Sherry FitzGerald and Partners. I do not know of any relationship between the FitzGerald part of the company and myself but perhaps the Government side would indicate if there is any connection in so far as they are concerned. I have reliable information to <Col N="837" /> suggest that the Taoiseach could identify those valuers.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister to enable the next speaker from that side of the House to take up this issue seriously. I have gone through the Constitution and on the basis of legal advice available to me today on Articles 34 to 37, there is no evidence that this Bill of ours is unconstitutional. If the Minister has this evidence then let him produce it in this House before 8.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to belittle or even discuss the other side's motives in bringing in this Bill.  I am going to make every assumption in their favour and I will make them a present of the fact that I have had plenty of complaints about the way the existing situation works and I and my colleagues on this side are as conscious of it as are the Deputies who have spoken.  Since this side of the House has been more or less invited by Deputy Fitzgerald to say something about the constitutional dimension of this Bill, I propose to stick to that.  I will not be <Col N="838" /> categorical about it because anyone is foolish in making a categorical statement about a legal point not vet decided, but the weight of the authorities is against the validity of Deputy Molloy's Bill and I will explain briefly why.</P>
      <P>It is not an absolutely clear case as it would be if, for example, Deputy Molloy's Bill proposed compulsorily to transfer from the jurisdiction of our courts an ordinary case in some traditional area of law such as an action for damages for negligence or personal assault.  That would be an absolutely clear case.  If anything is clear about this Constitution it is that when somebody has what is called a justifiable controversy &mdash; a controversy of a type traditionally dealt with here in the form of a court action &mdash; once he has begun a court action he has started a machine moving which must be allowed to move on without interference to its conclusion unless the plaintiff gives up and says that he does not want it to go to a conclusion, in which case the court will be very glad to make an order disposing of the thing by consent.  Otherwise it cannot be removed forcibly from the court's jurisdiction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is as clear as anything can be and has been since 1947 when the Sinn Féin Bill, which was brought in by the Fianna Fáil Government with the best of intentions, was shot down by the High Court and subsequently by the Supreme Court, both courts largely staffed in those days by judges &mdash; if it is not disrespectful to say it &mdash; of the Fianna Fáil persuasion. As commonly happens with people when they are put in an independent position they behave like independent men and put their affiliations behind them.  I mention the point not in any sense to cause acrimony, far from it, but in order to say that, notwithstanding the political background some of these judges had on their appointment, they did not hesitate in shooting down that Bill although it was brought into this House with the best of intentions, namely to prevent a relatively small fund, the Sinn Féin fund which was the butt end of a fund collected during the years of the national struggle before the split, from being frittered <Col N="839" /> away in litigation and eventually ending up as lawyer's fees.</P>
    <P>That was a laudable intention but they went about it in a ham-fisted way.  In trying to stop an action which was disputing the ownership of the funds in mid-stream, they passed a Bill which was intended to force the High Court to dispose of the action in a particular way by making an order.  Mr. Justice Gavan Duffy, who had been appointed by the Fianna Fáil Government, and the Supreme Court most of whom had been similarly appointed, would not have it. They said: &ldquo;This Constitution [Mr. de Valera's Constitution, the Irish people's Constitution] confides and entrusts to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts this kind of controversy and neither the Oireachtas nor anybody else has power to wrench it out of their hands and give it into the hands of some other person or to tell a court how it is to decide something.&rdquo; That goes for the humblest parking prosecution in the District Court as much as it goes for a big case of, as it must have been seen in those days, £50,000 or £60,000.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not be as categorical about this Bill as anybody would have to be about an action of the kind the Sinn Féin Funds Act tried to stop in mid-stream. This is a different kind of Bill.  It is trying to regulate a special statutory procedure which did not exist a couple of years ago which was called into existence by an Act of this House and the other House and which is not part of the ordinary common law.  In other words, it is trying to regulate a statutory procedure which has created, so to speak, a new set of rights side by side with the ordinary common law of the land.  I cannot and will not be categorical about that.  The judicial function here, even when mobilised and deployed in response to a special Act of this kind in order to operate a special scheme of this kind, confers on the operations of that scheme &mdash; I hope I am not being absurd in using an expression <Col N="840" /> like this &mdash; a certain chemical quality. If I may borrow a phrase from the world of theology, a certain transubstantiation takes place in the dispute.</P>
      <P>I am trying to express in a couple of words the way I imagine the majority of legal opinion would see this.  Once you entrust something to a court you have done something which is in a sense irrevocable. You have converted the dispute from being an ordinary dispute such as one of us might have across the House, with one's wife at home, with one of one's children or a policeman at a street crossing, into something of quite a different quality.  That quality is in the realm of judicial independence and cannot be interfered with even by the Oireachtas let alone by a Minister or anybody else. To that judicial independence and the untouchability, integrity and immunity of the judicial process from interference even by the Oireachtas everybody in this country ultimately owes his freedom.  It is a thousand times more protection than anything anyone in this House, the other House, the President or anyone might wish to do.</P>
      <P>This point has never yet been decided but a point very like it arose just 40 years ago in regard to an Act passed in consequence of a fire in the Athlone Woollen Mills but it was never litigated.  The question of whether the Oireachtas was competent to stop in mid-stream particular litigation or a whole stream of litigation and transfer it to a different tribunal has never been finally decided.  Therefore, I will not be categorical about it but my opinion is that the trend of opinion here in regard to the judicial function and process as such would be to the effect that once you have, rightly or wrongly, entrusted a function to a judge in a court you must let him do it.  It would be quite all right if Deputy Molloy's Bill were to provide that as from next month or next Monday any fresh application of this kind which one may wish to bring must be brought before this new tribunal.  That could well be done.</P>

      <P>I do.  I have spent most of my ten minutes accepting that.  That is an element which separates it to some extent from the Sinn Féin case.  Even despite that difference I am inclined to think that the quality of the judicial function here on the basis of the authorities which we are able to study is seen as something which makes a dispute entrusted to them it special.  Once it is entrusted to them it cannot be taken out of their hands until the court itself has decided it.  My last point is a small debating one which I hope will not be thought contemptible.</P>

      <P>Considering the high legal opinion which is available on that side, Deputy Molloy's phrasing is abominable. Although the section as it would stand if Deputy Molloy's Bill were passed talks about a landlord or tenant making an application, either of them could withdraw the application.  Suppose the person who wants the application put an end to is not the person who made it, how do you speak about the respondent, the defendant withdrawing an application? He did not make an application.  This is a small drafting point, one which would be worth spending time on here if this <Col N="842" /> was a Bill arising here in some other context in Private Members' Time.  I only mention the point in order to show that not much legal skill has been expended on the drafting of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not my intention to speak on the Bill but because of the hypocrisy from the Government benches I must say something.  Deputy Shatter and Deputy Durkan criticised this side of the House, but when the legislation was put through the House last July many of the speakers from the Government side were not present.  They did not contribute to the debate at that time.  I ask, who are the hypocrites in this House tonight?  The Public Gallery is full of people who have had to listen to the hypocrisy of Members on the opposite side but those Members had not the decency last July to contribute or to listen to the debate.  Deputies from Cork from all sides of the House put pressure on the Minister before the summer recess to bring the legislation before the Dáil.  That was the reason it was introduced.  In Opposition we are quite entitled to act in the best interests of the people.  We will continue with our work of helping them.</P>
      <P>Last night the Minister for the Environment expressed surprise that we were discussing the Bill.  He was very saddened with the proposal of Deputy Molloy.  If that saddened him I should hate to take up too much of his time.  Fianna Fáil are very concerned that people of nearly 80 years are being taken to court to have their rents assessed.  Many of them had never been in a courtroom before but now in the twilight of their lives they are being taken to court and their rents are being assessed by people who have had no contact or involvement with them and who have no understanding of their background.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The fears expressed last July are still relevant today.  Fianna Fáil are convinced that cases can be transferred to the tribunal. I attended the courts in Cork and I saw what people had to go through. They were afraid to open their mouths even to their own solicitors in case they might indict themselves in some way. <Col N="843" /> Fianna Fáil have nothing to be ashamed of.  This Bill is in the interests of those who will be affected and the majority are elderly people.  They have worked all their lives for this country and they are entitled to the protection of the legislators.</P>
    <P>We have had the matter investigated by our legal advisers and where one party agrees to bring the case before the tribunal we believe that should be done. The Minister and the speakers opposite should know that we are bringing forward this Bill for the benefit of the people.  The other side of the House should stop the nonsense that we are only doing it for political reasons.  In July last we did not obstruct the passage of the legislation. Members opposite who spoke in the debate tonight did not even have the courtesy to wait in the House until the debate was finished.  They were only interested in getting their contribution into the papers tomorrow.  They were not here last July when we dealt with the matter in detail.  The hypocrites are not over here but they are certainly on the opposite side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In making a contribution to the debate I do not propose to discuss the motives of Fianna Fáil in bringing in the Bill or of the Government in opposing it.  There is a much more important constitutional angle to the whole area of rented dwellings.  I refer to the seemingly overriding rights of property over the interests of ordinary people. I made this point in 1982 when the original Bill was brought in and also in 1983 when the amendment introducing the tribunals was introduced.  I should like to see in the lifetime of this Dáil the Government &mdash; of which the Labour Party are a part &mdash; bringing in amending legislation to enable the whole question of property rights to be teased out, to ensure that the common good is served by the Constitution, not just the interests of those who own large areas of property or who choose to speculate in property.  The difficulties of people in rent restricted property arises mainly because there are elements in our society who insist on <Col N="844" /> speculating and making large profits from the need of ordinary people for homes and for a roof over their heads.</P>
      <P>In his contribution Deputy Shatter made a number of accusations against The Workers' Party in relation to the Bill when it was introduced in 1982.  If the Deputy had checked the Official Report for that period he would have to admit he presented a distortion of the facts.  The Labour Party at the time withdrew an amendment to introduce the tribunals. The Fine Gael Party did not move their amendment and, in the interests of providing protection for tenants, The Workers' Party also withdrew an amendment seeking to introduce tribunals into that Bill.  It must be borne in mind that the Bill was brought in a day or two before the Dáil went into recess.  The most recent Bill introducing tribunals was brought forward late at night and was pushed through in a matter of hours.  It must be a fair criticism of this House that we seem to deal in an emergency fashion with very important legislation.  We allow emergencies to develop and we restrict ourselves in terms of time to deal with important legislation while other items are discussed at length which could be dealt with in a matter of a few hours.</P>
      <P>The main point that must be made in regard to existing legislation is that this and the previous Government have failed to implement it.  On a number of occasions I have raised the question of the implementation of section 26 of the Act which has not been implemented a year and half after its passage.  This prevents tenants from ensuring that the houses for which they are paying a market rent will be maintained by the landlord.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have raised this a number of times and we received assurances a number of times but still these regulations have not been introduced.  I would appeal now to the Minister to ensure without any further delay that the Act is fully implemented so that the tenants, who have little enough rights as it is, can avail to the full of the right this House intended them to have.  I would also ask him to insist that those who are going before the courts at the moment have a rent established <Col N="845" /> which is a fair rent, as was intended by the Act, and not the market value.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  The reason we support this Bill and are pushing it so strongly is that since the Rent Restrictions Act was found to be unconstitutional by some well-known business people in this House, people who are presently trying to find other legislation unconstitutional, there has been what can only be described as severe harassment of old people by professional classes who have made financial gains for themselves in quite massive proportions.  Since then over the past 14 or 15 months both in Opposition and in Government this party have tried to the best of their ability to provide protection for old people who are, in the main, those on fixed rents in accommodation they have occupied for many, many years.  Landlords have been awarded by the District Courts increases in rents for this accommodation to the tune of 2,500 per cent.</P>
      <P>We have said all this before and the first Act passed was supported by both sides of this House.  It had to be brought in quickly because the Rent Restrictions Act was adjudged to be unconstitutional. Following on that the tribunals were set up here between 10 p.m. and midnight just before the recess.  At the time we clearly stated the reason why we thought this was dangerous.  We were going into the summer recess and the property owners, valuers, speculators and the likes of Folio Homes and others would use the opportunity during the summer to list their cases and then do nothing.</P>
      <P>I will spell out simply what we are asking.  We have had a dose of legality from a few people here, people very eminent in legal matters.  What we want is that the cases listed on the calendar, cases pushed through on to the calendar in the 48 hours before the tribunal legislation was enacted, that the tenants in those cases be allowed to opt.  The landlords are allowed to opt.  The tenants should equally be allowed to opt for the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I heard the Minister say it was unconstitutional and I would be very grateful if he would let us know why. <Col N="846" /> Attorneys General have been wrong in their advice in the past.  Indeed, that is how the whole thing started with the Rent Restrictions Act.  What we are asking is something very simple.  If our phraseology is not up to Deputy John Kelly's standards we are sorry, but I think everyone understands the point we are trying to make.  The by-election is over and we cannot be accused of doing this for political gain.  We allowed the legislation through before the summer recess.  The Minister is now in a position to do a great deal of good for the 48,000 old people who are having sleepless nights, who have been 30 and 40 years in the same accommodation and who now have their rents increased by 2,500 per cent.  What more deserving case could be brought before this House?  Anyone who argues this is a political gimmick just does not understand what is happening.  I know the Minister does understand and I am sure he will accept our Bill.  He can subsequently test whether or not it is constitutional. Let him give an answer now to these people who are totally unreasonable, totally unfair and do not give a damn about the old people in this city and in the rest of the country.  Let him show that politicians are not prepared to join in what is nothing but an unseemly racket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague in making a very special plea for this Bill. I do so to emphasise our unanimity on this side of the House about this matter. I have a very special interest in this whole issue because many Members now in this House would not be aware that it was I who brought in the 1960 Act which was subsequently struck down by the Supreme Court.  I maintain that that Act stood the test of time for 20 years.  It worked quite satisfactorily and I cannot understand why it should ever have been struck down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In connection with the recent amendment to the Constitution we were told we could leave everything to the good sense and mature judgement of the Supreme Court.  I shall never understand why an Act which stood the test of time and seemed to give reasonable satisfaction to <Col N="847" /> both landlord and tenant should have been found unconstitutional after 20 years.  If it had been struck down some time in 1961 or 1962 I would, perhaps, have understood.</P>
    <P>I am coming into this debate, and I say this with the utmost sincerity, because I am shocked to the core at what I see happening in Dublin city today and I understand the same situation prevails in Cork and elsewhere.  I have seen for myself at first hand a situation with which no reasonable person, particularly no reasonable public representative or legislator, can be satisfied.</P>
    <P>To some extent we are all to blame because we passed this legislation but I submit we were forced into passing it by the decision of the Supreme Court.  We had to deal with that situation and we passed an Act.  We did not anticipate, and we could not have anticipated, the way in which the Act is working.  Let everbody in this House understand it is working disastrously.  It is inflicting unacceptable hardship &mdash; I go so far as to say cruelty &mdash; on a very large number of old and defenceless people.  This is not a situation from which we can stand back. It is not a situation we can tolerate.</P>
    <P>This Bill will not solve that but it will do something towards solving the appalling situation that presents itself to us. The District Court is totally incapable of dealing with the situation.  It is a slot machine.  You have these slick, clever, professional people and they have worked out a formula.  It is an ignoble, unworthy process.  The ordinary tenant going in there has no hope of getting justice.  Dreadful things are happening.</P>
    <P>Whatever else we say about the legislation or the situation, we must accept that the District Court has not measured up to the task we, as legislators, gave it in regard to these rent cases.  That is why we, in some attempt to ameliorate the situation, have put forward this Bill.</P>
    <P>This business of unconstitutionality is all eye-wash, absolute rubbish.  When one does not like some legislation the simplest thing and the easiest thing is to jump up and say: &ldquo;I am a professor of <Col N="848" /> jurisprudence and this Bill is unconstitutional&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not trying to be unfair to the Minister but, if it is in order, and we know it can happen, that a criminal case can be transferred by an administrative act from one court to another, and from a superior court to another, surely a mere rent case, which has no legal or constitutional implication, could be transferred from the most minor court in the land to a tribunal specifically set up by this House to deal with a particular situation.</P>
      <P>I have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that this argument about the unconstitutionality of this Bill is spurious.  It is merely a device used by the Government to avoid acceptance.  Now I would make a very special appeal to the Minister personally at this stage.  It is late in the day but hour by hour and day by day the tragedies in this city continue.  I make a very direct personal appeal to the Minister to accept this Bill and so provide some amelioration of this appalling situation and then go on from there and tackle the situation on a much broader basis.  If he does that he will have the full co-operation of this side of the House. We will facilitate him in every possible way.</P>

      <P>We are dealing here with human tragedy that continues to be enacted in the courts of our country week after week.  The people who are entangled in this tragedy and the people who are, according to the law passed in this House, obliged to deal with these cases cannot themselves make any change in the law to alleviate hardship caused to those caught in this net.  The only place a change can be made is in this House and we in Finna Fáil have taken the only step open to us when, due to the failure of the Government to act in this matter, we have come forward with a Private Members' Bill.  It is a shame on the Government that they have not moved before now to correct a serious wrong which is being done to hundreds of <Col N="849" /> elderly citizens week after week in our District Courts.</P>
      <P>At the end of my speech in the debate last July I asked the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Quinn, to go back to the Attorney General and get more detailed legal advice on whether our proposal was constitutional. I do not know if he did so but certainly we have heard nothing from him since then.  We asked him to come back to us having made further inquiries as to the legal difficulty with which he said he was confronted.  We do not accept that this legal difficulty exists.</P>
      <P>I said last night that the legal advice available to us is that this measure would not be unconstitutional.  The only response from the Minister was that he was advised by the Attorney General.  He did not quote any precedents or give any cases.  He could not substantiate the argument that this Bill would be unconstitutional. It was a most unsatisfactory reply, especially considering the advantage the Minister has over a person such as myself in that he has the benefit of being in the legal profession.  One would have expected a detailed argument from him but he left if hanging in the air, acting at the whim of an Attorney General whose advice has not always proved of great merit, as this country knows.</P>
      <P>I quoted the Sinn Féin case in support of part of my argument.  In reply the Minister stated:</P>
      <P>The Deputy would be well advised to read the Sinn Féin case in detail because my advice and my own reading of it is that the case would back up the constitutional right of the citizen as interpreted under our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not rely on my own reading of this case but the legal advice available to me, including the opinions of senior counsel is to the effect that the principles in that case do not apply to this Bill.  The fixing of rents is not a matter in the purely judicial domain.  It is largely an administrative matter and the transfer of these cases to the tribunal would not deprive the landlord of the right to have his rent <Col N="850" /> fixed: it would merely change the forum in which it would be fixed.</P>
    <P>Article 37 of the Constitution clearly enables such matters as these to be regulated outside the formal court structure. Article 37 states:</P>
    <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall operate to invalidate the exercise of limited functions and powers of a judicial nature, in matters other than criminal matters, by any person or body of persons duly authorised by law to exercise such functions and powers, notwithstanding that such person or body of persons is not a judge or a court appointed or established as such under this Constitution.</P>
    <P>Article 37 does not impinge on this Bill. The fact that an application has been forwarded to the District Court does not of itself give constitutional rights to a landlord to have an administrative matter such as the fixing of rents dealt with by the court.  The landlord or other applicant will still have power to refer questions of law to the High Court under section 13 of the 1983 Act.</P>
    <P>During his speech last night the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>What the present Bill would purport to do is put a person, who has properly applied to the courts in accordance with the statutory right given to him in the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, to have his case determined, in the position of having his case struck out retrospectively, and thus his statutory right denied, by the person who is the opposing party to him in the case.</P>
    <P>This, I submit, is a wrong interpretation of the Bill.  It is not intended to have the matter struck out retrospectively.  What is involved is merely a transfer of forum. As matters stand, legislative powers exist for matters to be remitted from one court to another.  This is in essence what is intended in this Bill.  If the Minister wants the Bill further clarified I will be happy to receive any amendment to ensure that the effect of any application under this Bill will be automatically to transfer the <Col N="851" /> adjudication of rent to the tribunal.  The statutory right referred to is the right to have rent fixed.  This Bill in no way denies that right.</P>
    <P>No Attorney General can claim infallibility in the matter of legal opinion.  As I have stated, I have had the benefit of substantial legal advice to the opposite effect of that received by the Minister. The whole matter of the unconstitutionality of Rents Acts arose through erroneous legal opinion held by lawyers.  The Supreme Court must be the final arbiter. The present Attorney General, Mr. Sutherland, advised the Government in regard to the first Bill passed in 1981 which was found by the Supreme Court, on reference by the President under Article 26 of the Constitution, to be in conflict with the Constitution.  Surely the Attorney General and the Minister must realise, notwithstanding their opinion, that they may be wrong.  I am not saying that the advice I have received is any more infallible.</P>
    <P>I stressed last night that I would welcome the referral of this Bill to the Supreme Court to test its constitutionality. I do not intend to turn this Chamber into a court of law by indulging in legal debate.  All I say is that genuine legal differences of opinion exist which should be resolved by the courts.  The legislative will of this House should not be frustrated by differences of legal opinion.  Doctors differ and patients die but there is no reason why, if lawyers differ, this Bill should die.</P>
    <P>The Minister has asked me to advance legal opinion to him.  Unlike the Minister, I am not a qualified lawyer.  However, I have had the benefit of the best legal advice and it conflicts in a fundamental way with that of the Minister.  I ask the Minister to seek independent legal advice before cutting short this Bill.  No applicant has a constitutional right to have these cases heard before the District Court.  That seems to be the basis of the Minister's argument.  The constitutional right is to have the rent fixed and this right is not affected by the Bill.  If it were, things would be different.  Similarly, no constitutional right exists to have appeals <Col N="852" /> heard by the Circuit Court.  It is merely a statutory right which the Oireachtas is perfectly entitled to terminate.  These statutory rights in no way affect the property rights vested in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>We have received legal advice to the effect that this Bill would solve the problem of the tragedy befalling so many of our elderly citizens in the courts.  We make a final appeal to the Minister and the Taoiseach and all those who claim to have shown concern for the plight of these unfortunate people.  We plead with them to accept the Bill and let its constitutionality be tested in the proper forum, the Supreme Court.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given permission to Deputy O'Malley to raise on the Adjournment the agreement it is proposed to make between Bord Gáis Éireann and the Dublin Gas Company and which requires Government approval.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter of considerable importance on the Adjournment.  The Chair referred to the agreement it is proposed to make between Bord Gáis Éireann and the Dublin Gas Company but, in fact, the agreement was made on 9 December 1982.  The point of my raising the matter relates to the fact that while the agreement was made between the parties that long ago, as a result of the failure of the Government to take the necessary steps to implement it in the 11½ months that have elapsed the Dublin Gas Company have been put in a serious position.  That has culminated in the last few days in the chief executive of the Dublin Gas Company writing letters to the two main contractors who are doing work for the Dublin Gas Company in connection with the conversion to natural gas and the extension to new large industrial customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Deputy sought permission to raise this matter there was one part of his question in order, the part the Chair read out.  The section of his question dealing with contractors is part of the day-to-day running of the Dublin Gas Company and is not a matter over which the Minister has any control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will seek to demonstrate that the Minister is the cause of the letter having to be written to the two <Col N="854" /> contractors in the last few days.  It was an extraordinary letter because it stated that the company were not in a position to pay the contractors under the contracts. The reason the company were not in a position to pay them was that the Government have failed for 11½ months to implement the agreement, to give it final approval or sanction, to enable it to be put into effect.  At the same time that the agreement was signed by the parties on 9 Decemeber 1982 I understand a further supplemental agreement was initiated on the same day by the parties.  On 19 December 1982 natural gas flowed to Dublin for the first time.  At that time, in accordance with the provisions and spirit of the supplemental agreement, the payment of a subsidy which amounted to about £5 million per year to the Dublin Gas Company ceased.  In January 1983, again in accordance with the provisions of the supplemental agreement which the Dublin Gas Company, not unnaturally, expected to be put into force by the Government straight away, the company reduced the price of gas to their consumers of whom there are 110,000.  To their amazement no effort has been made within that 11½ months to implement the agreement to make the arrangements which were arrived at in relation to the Government's shareholding in the company, in relation to their sharing in the distribution of profits, in relation to the new arrangements for the price of gas and the other matters covered in the agreement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consequences of this for the company have been extremely serious, particularly as far as their cash flow is concerned. The company lost £5 million straightaway due to the withdrawal of the subsidy which they welcomed at the time because they understood that the agreement would be implemented by the Government.  It was part of the agreement that the subsidy would be withdrawn because the price of gas would be much lower.  The company also suffered severe difficulties in that although the agreement was not implemented by the Government they had reduced the price of gas with the result that their cash flow position became serious.  Their short-term <Col N="855" /> borrowings in the banks have increased from their limit of £8 million to a figure in excess of £15 million.  Within the last two or three days the chief executive of the company took the unprecedented step of writing to two major contractors carrying out two contracts and saying that the company cannot pay.  The letter did not suggest that the contractors should stop work but that the company cannot pay because the Government will not act.</P>
    <P>The chief executive of the company took that action because he realised what the financial situation of the company was.  He realised his own potential liability if the company continued to trade in circumstances where they were unable to meet their liabilities.  In writing that letter, which was unusual, he acted properly from his point of view as a director.  I understand that a board meeting of the Dublin Gas Company is due to be held within a matter of days to examine the position.  Of course, as the other board members become aware of what the chief executive was forced to do they will have to consider the steps they must take to ensure that they will not be personally liable if the company continue to trade. It is perfectly obvious what steps they will have to take in the absence of the Government making up their minds and honouring the agreement after 11½ months.  They will have to invoke the protection of the Companies Act, 1963. We all know what that means.  It will mean either an application for the appointment of a liquidator or an application for the appointment of a receiver. It seems to me that they would have no option in the circumstances but to do that.</P>
    <P>In the meantime the whole conversion programme in Dublin has not gone ahead at any proper pace.  The new large industrial consumers who were due to be connected to natural gas in the spring of 1983 have still not been connected.  In fact, one of the contracts is pipe laying in connection with bringing it to them.  The significance of those new industrial consumers to the Dublin Gas Company can be demonstrated when I say that one of <Col N="856" /> these alone would use as much gas as is used in the entire Dublin Gas Company system.</P>
    <P>Therefore one can imagine how vital it was and is from the point of view of the company that these matters be expedited but they were unable to implement them. The State, by common consent, is getting a good deal for little or no investment in the arrangements being made.  Of course the State is giving considerable rebates and so on.  But the amount of actual cash investment that had to be raised is modest, to say the least of it, when the size of the project is taken into account.</P>
    <P>I understand that a financing package has been put together with a consortium of banks in the figure of approximately £65 million on a project financing basis to which the States's contribution is fairly small, if anything.  Indeed, what the State does put up is repayable to the State by virtue of the fact that it takes the form in large part of participating preference shares, redeemable also.  The State is guaranteed over a particular period of years a very large figure in dividends.</P>
    <P>It cannot be seriously suggested that this deal is so bad that it took 11½ months to consider it, particularly when the damage being done to the company is so very obvious and great.  Therefore, the position is that the company is facing the possibility of liquidation or receivership. It was with that in mind, with all the consequences for the 1,300 people directly employed and the 1,000 or so indirectly employed through contractors, the losses to industry, the losses in our balance of payments which we could have saved over the past year had this whole matter been implemented, that at 3.30 in this afternoon I gave you notice, Sir, here in the House that I intended to raise this matter on the Adjournment this evening. Lo and behold, if ever there was justification for the parliamentary institution of raising a matter on the Adjournment, the company concerned received a telephone message at 5 o'clock this afternoon telling them that after 11½ months the Government had agreed.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in one sense, this debate here this evening is not necessary because what I wanted to achieve I achieved at <Col N="857" /> 3.30 this afternoon.  It is amazing that what could not be done in 11½ months was done in 90 minutes in this House this afternoon.  All I have to say about what was facing the Dublin Gas Company now happily I can put in the past tense, because I believe the danger is now over. It is no thanks to that Minister sitting across there, who shilly-shallied in a most disgraceful fashion, could not make up his mind, brought in consultants to look at it, and consultants to look at the consultants, changing the mood forward, backward and sideways for 11½ months, but because I stood up here in this bench this afternoon&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we suddenly had action and at 5 o'clock the whole thing was over.  The Government had at long last approved and implemented the agreement of 9 December 1982.  They did it at 5 p.m. on 30 November 1983.  Had I or nobody else stood up here today we could have been another 11½ months waiting; well, we would not have been because, in that case, the Dublin Gas Company would have been gone within the next week or two.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second example we have had in this House in this country within the past two weeks of the appalling danger of allowing this Government to dabble in the commercial affairs of companies. We have seen the consequences of it in County Clare.  We have only just now averted the consequences of their dabbling in the commercial affairs of the Dublin Gas Company.  The consequences in County Clare are very serious, not just for Clare but for the country as a whole. The consequences in Dublin would have been immensely more serious.  This company is perhaps £15 million, perhaps £20 million, worse off now than they would have been had that agreement been implemented on the kind of timescale one would have expected.  Also our balance of payments &mdash; in terms of the oil that had to be purchased which could have been substituted by gas during the <Col N="858" /> past year in Dublin &mdash; amounts to approaching £200 million.  Considering that, hopefully, we are facing a deficit of approximately £400 million, or perhaps even a bit less, in our balance of trade for this year, that figure could have been 50 per cent lower but for the silly lack of activity, this inability to make a decision, this constant questioning of everything that arose, reaching the stage at which everybody concerned was virtually driven mad by the incredible indecision and inability of the Minister to make up his mind.  I suppose the matter must have gone to the Government on a number of occasions; but the Government, as a whole apparently, were equally unable to make up their minds.</P>
    <P>This must be one of the very few times that the raising of any matter on the Adjournment, or the giving of notice in relation to it in this House, has had such an extraordinary, rapid and beneficial effect.  Perhaps it is a pity in ways that we have three Adjournments only in the week.  If we were to get one in 50 of them that proved as valuable as today's the country would be very well served.</P>

      <P>I have to disappoint Deputy O'Malley.  The decision on this matter was made by the Government before I or any other member of the Government had obtained any information to the effect that he was going to raise the matter here in the House.  I am sure the Deputy was quite well informed as to the day he chose to raise the matter. Obviously, he was in good contact with the people in the Dublin Gas Company, who also knew quite well the timing of the various meetings by the Government on the matter and the deadlines involved. Rather than raising the matter last week or the week before, Deputy O'Malley, from the point of view of making this wonderful statement that he has made about his massive powers of raising matters on the Adjournment, chose the day on which he raised it with consummate political care without any great regard to the effect he would achieve by so doing. <Col N="859" /> I can tell him that the decision was taken by the Government without the knowledge at all that we were going to have the benefit of Deputy O'Malley's oratorical peregrinations on the subject&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that I am rather surprised, Sir, that Deputy O'Malley, whom I recollect here in the House when we were discussing the Electricity Supply Board recently, talking about his concern about projects and saying that the worst decision he had made in his political life &mdash; and I do not believe he made too many bad decisions &mdash; the worst one he believed he made was when he failed to stop a project because he was told it had gone too far.  I do not propose to make the same mistake that Deputy O'Malley so honestly accused himself of making in the particular instance to which he was referring.  I want to make it absolutely clear that this project involves very substantial capital investment.  This Dublin Gas Company project will be the largest ever capital project being undertaken in the gasfield in this country.  It will be perhaps the largest single initiative that will have taken place here in this decade, with the exception of the Money-point generating station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputy O'Malley and the entire House would agree with me &mdash; Deputy O'Malley in more reflective moments than those through which he now appears to be passing &mdash; that the Government and the Minister should have examined all of this properly. Deputy O'Malley rather blithely suggested that there was no Government involvement of any consequence in this, that there were only some minor rebates in prices given which did not really matter. In fact the rebates being given are very substantial.  In the initial stages of the project, the Government will be getting a price from Dublin Gas which will represent a very valuable national asset, <Col N="861" /> namely natural gas.  The price to the gas company will be much smaller than the price to other people.  Failing to obtain a price for a valuable product which is in scarce and limited supply, namely natural gas, is the same as giving a subsidy or a grant.  There is no real difference.  The difference is only in the way in which it is expressed.</P>
    <P>The State investment in this project is very large.  The company are quoted on the Stock Exchange with a value of not more than £1.2 million, yet that very small company, in terms of its capital base, are carrying out a massive capital investment project with very little equity. It is a very highly geared project in the sense that the company have a large amount of debt, a large amount of investment and a very small equity base.  Therefore, any deviation up or down on the projected performance of this company could have disproportionately large results in terms of losses for the company in a way that would not happen if this was a highly geared project with a large equity base.  If there were to be any deviation from the projected sales target it would become known very soon.</P>
    <P>To be viable, this project must provide a sevenfold increase in the volume of gas sold in Dublin.  Therefore, the Government were right, considering they are putting a very substantial amount of money into this project, to ask whether the project or plan is capable of increasing sales sevenfold.  If it does not achieve that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the company do not <Col N="862" /> achieve this projected increase they, and the State which is involved so very heavily, will have to face serious financial difficulties.  Therefore, it is right from every point of view that the Government should examine this matter properly so that they will be satisfied they are making the right decision.  The decision of the previous Government, to which Deputy O'Malley referred, was taken on 9 December by a Government who had been rejected by the people, a Government who were on the way out.  They rushed into taking this decision: information about the decision was only conveyed to the gas company on the day when the present Government took office.  In such circumstances &mdash; I do not suggest there was anything unusual about that &mdash; it was appropriate that the new Government should examine this matter properly.  We have done that.  We have done it well and have come to the right decision.  In his more reflective moments I am sure Deputy O'Malley will come to see that we were right in adopting the approach we did.</P>
      <P>I thank Deputy O'Malley for giving me the opportunity of avoiding the ire of his esteemed leader who has been complaining in the House about Ministers making announcements outside the House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will explain how in the midst of a large force of Garda and Army personnel a prisoner could escape from Mountjoy prison, Dublin, and return at will when the prison officers were reinstated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): This escape took place at approximately 10.15 p.m. on 15 November last.  The prisoner, despite the efforts of the Garda, remained at large until he surrendered himself on 17 November, while the Garda, contrary to the Deputy's assertion, were still on duty in Mountjoy prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The escape occurred when the prisoner, <Col N="711" /> a trustee, slipped away unobserved from an Army party with whom he was working on the boilers of the prison and successfully scaled the boundary wall. There was only a small party of Garda and Army personnel on duty at the prison at that time because most of the prisoners had been locked in their cells for the night.</P>
    <P>I think it is unfair of the Deputy to impute fault to the Garda and the Army for this escape.  On any view, they responded extremely well to the damands made on them when they had to take the place of prison officers.</P>

      <P>The total receipts of local authorities from differential rents in 1981 and 1982 were £24.3 million and £30.5 million respectively.  Receipts for 1983 are estimated at £31 million.  At this stage it is not practicable to give a reliable estimate of the level of receipts in 1984. A breakdown of estimated receipts for each local authority area for 1983 is not yet available.  The rental receipts of each housing authority for the years 1981 and 1982 are set out in the following table.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 299 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>The provision of a pedestrian crossing is a matter for the road authority concerned. In November 1982 Galway County Council indicated that the estimated cost of providing a controlled pedestrian crossing at this location was £5,500.  I understand from the council that on 24 November 1983 they placed an advertisement in the public press seeking tenders for the provision of the pedestrian crossing.  The cost of the work falls to be financed from the council's own resources, supplemented by the block grant allocated annually by my Department.</P>

The county council were requested by letter of 6 January 1982 to indicate the priority rating of the scheme on the council's priority list of water and sewerage schemes in planning and have been requested in discussions with the Department's inspector to indicate if all necessary sites and wayleaves for the scheme have been acquired.

      <P>Approval to the preliminary report and to the preparation of contract documents for phase 1 of stage 2 of the Knocknacarragh sewerage scheme issued to Galway County Council on 6 July 1983.  It is now a matter for the county council to prepare and submit contract documents for this scheme to my Department for examination and approval. Approval to proposals for an advance section of stage 2 of the Knocknacarragh sewerage scheme to facilitate building development in the Knocknacarragh area issued to the local authority on 18 October 1983.  A Local Loans Fund loan application of £80,000 in respect of the work is being processed at present.  The sections of stage 2 which have been approved are considered to be adequate to meet the demand for sewerage facilities in the Knocknacarragh area for the next 15 to 20 years.</P>

Approval to these bye-laws has not been possible pending the resolution of a number of outstanding issues relating to the finalisation of a draft which will serve as a model for traffic and parking bye-laws for County Galway and other areas throughout the country.  I recently received the advice of the Attorney General, who was consulted on these issues.  I now hope to be in a position to reach a decision on the draft bye-laws within the next three to four weeks.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 365 and 366 together.</P>
      <P>I assume the Deputies are referring to the possibility of any losses by depositors being made good by State funds.  It is not proposed to take such action.</P>
      <P>In considering the question of depositors' funds, regard must be had to the very clear warnings repeatedly issued over the years to depositors with industrial and provident societies engaged in &ldquo;banking&rdquo; activities.  The concern of the Oireachtas about such societies was demonstrated with the enactment of the Industrial and Provident Societies (Amendment) Act, 1978, the preparation of which was commenced in 1976. The main feature of this Act was the requirement that societies wind down their deposit taking activities within a period of five years.  Before and during the enactment of this legislation, Ministers and others drew public attention to the dangers of investing in societies of this kind.  The 1978 Act itself, especially the five-year winding down period, was taken by the public at large as a warning by the Government and Oireachtas about the risks involved in doing business with entities of this kind.</P>
      <P>The Act of 1978 also declared the position of the Registrar of Friendly Societies to be an independent office to ensure that there would be no interference with the exercise of the various powers given to him by the Oireachtas.  In exercise of those powers, the registrar took action to prevent the society in question from advertising for deposits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The constitutionality of the legislation <Col N="741" /> was challenged by the society in question in the High Court and the Supreme Court, challenges which the members of the society must have been aware of.  The judgment in both courts found in favour of the Act.  The Supreme Court judgment, which was issued in May of this year, included a restatement of the earlier High Court judgment, in justification of the Act of 1978, that the general public who placed money on deposit with societies of this kind were at risk.  This statement was given widespread publicity at the time.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: Questions Nos. 394 and 395 will be answered together.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the concern which has been expressed on this matter both here and in many other countries.</P>
      <P>I am having the adequacy of the law for the control of such video films examined as a matter of urgency so that decisions can be taken on new legislation or administrative measures to be taken to deal with the problem.</P>
      <P>I should mention that recently there have been some convictions for the display of uncensored video films in public places.  I am also aware that the customs authorities have succeeded in preventing a considerable number of objectionable video films from being imported into the State.</P>

      <P>The Middle-Level Technician Training Programme of the Department of Education is aided by the European Social Fund.  Under this programme, which is conducted in the colleges of technology and regional technical colleges, a limited number of training places is made available each year.  Demands from the colleges exceed the number of places available annually and, accordingly, it is necessary to determine priorities as between these competing demands having regard to the overall European Social Fund criteria for the funding of such courses.  It was in this context that it was not found possible to include the one-year course in sales promotion/advertising in the College of Commerce, Rathmines, in the 1983-84 list of approved ESF courses.</P>
