As the Deputy is aware, the date of the by-election has been fixed so that it will not <Col N="1324" /> intrude in the period of parliamentary time up to the deadline for the passing of the Second Stage to ensure maximum time for that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: In view of the fact that 16 constituencies now contravene Article 16.2.3º of the Constitution and following the recent publication of the census figures, will the Taoiseach state what action the Government intend taking to ensure that constituencies comply with the Constitution?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I must correct the Deputy.  There is no constitutional decision as to what the tolerance should be. The constitutional decision was that a particular proposal introduced by Fianna Fáil, which involved a tolerance of 20 per cent, was unconstitutional.  Subsequent to that Governments acting on their own account in reviewing constituencies adhered to a 5 per cent tolerance.  A commission was established by Fianna Fáil and produced a scheme with a larger tolerance which they felt would be acceptable within the constitutional limits set by the Courts if challenged. As we do not know what those limits are, nobody can say how many constituencies are outside, but it is clear that at least one constituency is outside and that a revision is necessary.  Accordingly, the Government will be announcing the establishment of a review commission in accordance with previous practice with a view to carrying out a review of the constituencies which is necessary in at least one case.  I must correct the Deputy's suggestion that there are 16 constituencies outside any possible constitutional norm.</P>

      <P>: On a number of occasions recently Deputies, such as Deputy Gallagher and myself, had parliamentary questions refused on the grounds that the subject of the question was more appropriate for the budget debate.  This seems to be a new device to prohibit Deputies from raising matters which are of serious concern.  I wish to ask if it is incorrect for <Col N="1327" /> the Chair to make this judgment or whether it could be brought to a committee of the House to decide whether your interpretation of this matter is justified.</P>

Therefore, will the Taoiseach give details of the committee, if indeed he has set up such a committee?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>A White Paper dealing with community service was published in June 1981. A Private Member's Bill introducing community service was presented to this House on 16 June 1982.  The following day a Government Bill which also provided for the introduction of community service was presented to the House.</P>
      <P>Before going on to talk about the Bill itself, I should like to refer to one or two problems which face us in dealing with offenders convicted by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first is that the courts do not always have available to them appropriate sanctions to suit individual cases.  For example, case arise where the courts for one reason or another consider, even where the offence may be a serious one, that a sentence of imprisonment or a fine is inappropriate but yet feel that the <Col N="1329" /> offender should repay society in some way for his wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>In some of these cases community service may well be the answer.  However, community service apart, I would favour giving the courts as wide a range of sanctions as possible &mdash; provided always, of course, that they are of a practical nature.  I am open to any proposals in this regard, particularly to any proposals which would operate as an alternative to a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the second problem which I should like to mention, namely, the difficulties being encountered in providing adequate accommodation for those offenders committed to custody by the courts.</P>
    <P>The choice of sentence in each individual case is, within the parameters laid down by the law, a matter for the courts. To that extent, therefore, the number of offenders committed to custody is determined by the courts.  The number of offenders being committed has risen over the past decade or so but the increase has not been significant.  I want to make it clear that in referring to this matter I do not imply any criticism of the sentencing policy of the courts.</P>
    <P>Unlike prisoners in many other countries in Western Europe, most of our prisoners enjoy the relative comfort of a cell each.  It may not be possible to allow this situation to continue.  Deputies will be aware that it has been necessary in some instance to release prisoners back into the community before their normal release date.  Usually prisoners who are released prior to their normal release date are released under the supervision, sometimes under the intensive supervision, of the Probation and Welfare Service.  In cases where prisoners have been released because of lack of accommodation it has not been possible to provide this supervision.</P>
    <P>However, I would hope that the accommodation problem will ease soon. Loughan House will shortly be reverting to usage within the prison system and the second wing of Cork Prison will also be coming into use fairly soon.  Apart from this extra accommodation, community <Col N="1330" /> service should help to ease the problem. I would be cautious, however, about any suggestion that community service will bring about a reduction in the prison population but it should at least help to contain any increase in the numbers likely to be committed to custody.</P>
    <P>Now I return to the Bill itself.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide the criminal courts with a further sanction which they may apply in appropriate cases. Stated very briefly, the Bill provides that when a person is convicted of an offence for which the court considers that in the ordinary way the appropriate sentence would be one of imprisonment, the court may, with the offender's consent, instead order him to perform a specified number of hours of unpaid work.  The work contemplated is work of a kind that will benefit the community but that people cannot readily be got to do in the ordinary way for pay.  It will generally have to be performed within a period of 12 months from the date of the order.  The work will be done under the general supervision of the Probation and Welfare Service of my Department.</P>
    <P>First of all, let me say a few words about the origin and background to community service as a court sanction.  The idea of making a wrongdoer compensate his victim or, indeed, the wider community is a very old one but the concept of community service as a requirement of an order of a court is relatively new.  As far as I am aware, Britain was the first European State to introduce community service as a requirement of a court order, in 1973.</P>
    <P>It was introduced there following recommendations made by a sub-committee of the Advisory Council on the Penal System, a body concerned with the penal system in England and Wales.  That sub-committee of distinguished lawyers, academics, sociologists and public servants considered, for four years, what changes and additions might be made to existing non-custodial penalties, disabilities and other requirements which may be imposed on offenders.  The committee reported in June 1970 and legislation was enacted in 1972 to introduce community service and re-enacted in 1973.  Community service was introduced in particular <Col N="1331" /> areas on a pilot basis and has been extended since to the whole of Britain. Since its introduction there it has been very carefully monitored and there appears to be general satisfaction with it, though there have been some difficulties. I make these comments because I think it is important for us to see the care with which this new idea was introduced in another country.  This Bill which we are debating here today coincides, to some extent, with the relevant British legislation although the opportunity has been taken to improve where possible, in the light of British experience on the corresponding British legislation.  Community service legislation was extended to Northern Ireland in 1976 by an Order in Council which came into operation there three years later.  It has been introduced also, or is about to be introduced, in a number of other European countries as well as in the United States of America, Canada and New Zealand.</P>
    <P>In fact, in one sense we have had a type of community service in this country for the past decade. Prisoners are released under the control and guidance of prison officers to do work for the community which would not otherwise be done; examples of the kind of work which prisoners have done are the construction of a scouts' hall in the Dublin area and the refurbishing of a centre in Dún Laoghaire for the treatment of persons with alcohol problems or alcohol-related problems.</P>
    <P>Although the number of prisoners released under this scheme is small in the context of the whole prison population, nevertheless the results have been encouraging and the public reaction to it has been very favourable.  The Bill, of course, deals with offenders at the other end of the spectrum, that is, pre-prison stage, since one of its aims is to keep out of prison offenders for whom custody is not essential.</P>
    <P>Community service as a court sanction has a number of advantages.  For example, it is of advantage to the offender since the making of the order will require his consent and thus he will be given a say in the way in which he will repay the community for his criminal activity.  As <Col N="1332" /> the order will be non-custodial the offender can continue with his education or employment while fulfilling the obligations of the order in his spare time. There will be the minimum disruption of the offender's family life and if the order is used as an alternative to a custodial sentence it should keep the offender from associating with experienced offenders.</P>
    <P>There is the advantage to the community in that the community service order will provide an opportunity to have useful work done which might not otherwise be done.  When I say that only work which would not otherwise be done will be undertaken I mean work which cannot be done because of lack of funds.  It is certainly not the intention that work which would otherwise fall to be done by a paid work force would be undertaken. The committee to which I shall be referring shortly may be given a role in seeing that appropriate work is made available.</P>
    <P>As I see it, examples of the kind of work which would be involved would be helping the disabled and the old with some of the problems which they have to face in dealing with their incapacities, or helping organisations both voluntary and statutory which provide assistance for those people.  Other examples of the kind of work which could be undertaken under a community service order are set out in the White Paper to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>There is also the advantage that the courts will be provided with an additional power of dealing with offenders by providing for a sanction suited to the crime. In some other jurisdictions rather striking use has been made of the principle.  For example, state and municipal courts in the United States of America order traffic offenders to carry out work in hospitals and in the Federal Republic of Germany juvenile courts can order young offenders with alcohol problems to help in homes for inebriates.  However, the success of community service orders does not necessarily depend on any such close connection between the nature of the crime and the punishment.  Finally, there is, of course, the important advantage that, applied as an alternative to a custodial sentence, community service <Col N="1333" /> orders should slow down the rate of increase in the number of offenders being committed to custody.</P>
    <P>New ground is being broken here in many ways, not the least of which is that the community is being given an opportunity to involve itself in dealing with its members who step out of line.  The Bill will not achieve its purpose unless the community is prepared to play its part.  I can appreciate that some people may be apprehensive about offenders being put to work in the community, particularly since it may involve them, for example, in working in people's homes.  In the Bill I have tried to achieve a situation, so far as this can be achieved, where there is little or no risk to the ordinary members of the community by reason of the fact that offenders are sent to work among them.</P>
    <P>First, community service will not be an option in respect of crimes for which the law has provided a mandatory sentence. This excludes offenders convicted of murder.  Secondly, the judge dealing with the case is required before making his decision to satisfy himself that the offender is a suitable person for community service and for this purpose to consider a report about the offender prepared by a probation and welfare officer. As I have already mentioned, the offender while doing his community service will be under the general supervision of a probation and welfare officer. I believe these safeguards are adequate and should allay any fears which people might have on this aspect of community service.</P>
    <P>I might add here that it is a matter for the Probation and Welfare Service to satisfy the court that arrangements can be made for the offender to perform work under a community service order.  Once the order is made the service will have the responsibility of ensuring that the offender carries out the work.  It may be necessary for the service to employ people either on a paid or a voluntary basis to supervise the actual performance of the work.  Ideally, these supervisors would have some expertise or experience in the performance of the type of task involved.  In those circumstances, apart <Col N="1334" /> from providing necessary supervision, those supervisors should be able to ensure that a reasonable standard of work is maintained.</P>
    <P>In both Britain and Northern Ireland there are committees or boards vested, to varying degrees, with responsibility for community service.  The Northern Ireland Probation Board, of which there is only one, is somewhat similar to the British committees.  Our situation is, of course, different from that obtaining in either of those jurisdictions.  Our Probation and Welfare Service is organised on a national basis and is directly under the control of the Minister for Justice, always bearing in mind, of course, the individual probation and welfare officer's responsibility to the courts in matters pertaining to the courts' functions.</P>
    <P>However, with a view to involving the community in the operation of the scheme here, I am considering the feasibility of establishing a committee to monitor the operation of the scheme and to advise on any problems which may arise in that regard.  They would also advise on possible improvements to the scheme. The committee, if established, will be representative of the various interests involved, for example, the voluntary and official social aid groups, Judiciary, the trade unions, employers, and so on. Indeed, I am happy to say that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have already indicated to my Department their general approval of this scheme.  In the course of implementing the scheme I expect it will be necessary for the Probation and Welfare Service to have further consultations with the trade union movement particularly at local level.</P>
    <P>An important aim of the Bill is to try to ensure that compliance with the community service order does not jeopardise the offender's employment or his availability for employment or unduly disrupt his family life.  The Bill, therefore, provides that directions as to the times at which an offender may be required to do the work shall, so far as practicable, avoid any interference with times the offender normally works or attends school, and the Bill is framed on the basis that the work will be carried out in the District <Col N="1335" /> Court district where the offender resides. If he fails to comply with the order, proceedings may be taken against him for failing to comply with the order without reasonable excuse and he may be fined up to £300 without prejudice to the continuance of the order.</P>
    <P>There is the alternative method, of course, of dealing with the offender for failure to comply with a community service order: he can be returned to the court which made the order and dealt with there for the original offence.  The court to which he is returned may revoke the order.  This might be appropriate where the offender had almost completed the order but for good reasons could not complete it.  On the other hand, if the offender refused to do his community service the court could revoke the order and deal with him for the original offence as if the community service order had not been made in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The Bill also provides that if the offender moves from one part of the country to another &mdash; for example, in the course of his employment &mdash; the community service order may be amended to allow him to do his community service, as I have already stated, in the area to which he has moved.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides for a review of the community service order where circumstances have changed since the order was made and the interests of justice dictate that it ought to be reviewed.  The review will be carried out by the District Court in the area where the offender resides. An example of where an order might be reviewed in the interests of justice could be where the offender, because of deterioration of his health or for family reasons, was unable to continue with the work.</P>
    <P>Before I finish, there are perhaps a couple of provisions of the Bill which I should specifically mention because they seem to draw most reaction from those consulted on the proposals.</P>
    <P>It is a requirement of the Bill that the offender must have consented to the making of an order.  It has been suggested to me that, that being the case, few orders are likely to be made.  Let me explain <Col N="1336" /> why this requirement has been included in the Bill.  First, it would be highly unlikely that an offender would comply with the order unless he accepted it in the first instance.  Secondly, it is important that we do not breach even the spirit of International Conventions dealing with forced labour to which we have subscribed. I believe offenders will consent to the making of community service orders: after all, the alternative is imprisonment or detention.  I believe offenders will see the positive aspect of community service as against a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>It is also a requirement of the Bill that the maximum and minimum periods of work under community service orders shall be 240 hours and 40 hours respectively. These might be thought to be arbitrary figures.  When the British sub-committee considered this particular aspect of community service they recommended a minimum of 40 hours and a maximum of 120 hours.  However, in the course of the passage of the Bill through Parliament there the upper limit was raised to 240 hours.</P>
    <P>It is the view of many observers and, indeed, of practitioners involved with community service there that offenders put on very long hours tend to break down and end up in prison anyway.  An order requiring very long hours could influence an offender as to whether he should continue to comply with the order.  Furthermore, supervising officers tend to make unjustifiable allowance for offenders who just cannot complete their long number of hours.  Some offenders would, no doubt, prefer a short sentence of imprisonment to a community service order which would require them to work all their spare time over a long period. However, these time limits are not sacrosanct and there is, as far as I can discover, no real scientific basis for them.  I am, therefore, prepared to consider any constructive suggestions in regard to them.</P>
    <P>Finally, the Bill provides that it shall come into operation on such day as the Minister for Justice by order appoints.  The selection and necessary training of staff for this new scheme and the making of <Col N="1337" /> necessary rules and regulations will take some time but I can assure the House that there will be no unnecessary delay in bringing the Bill into operation.</P>
    <P>On this basis, I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: Quite naturally we welcome the Bill as a useful measure as we introduced it and we were in favour of this kind of action.  On Committee Stage we will deal with it in greater depth but our questions at present relate not only to the detail in the Bill but to the general matter of law and order and the effect this Bill may have on the problems facing the community.  When the Minister came to office there was on his desk a draft of a more major Criminal Justice Bill and presumably he is still examining that. That Bill would have a major effect on the state of law and order.  It is somewhat disappointing it has taken the Minister so long to bring in what is a relatively simple Bill, one that we consider could have been brought in during the first month in office of the new Government.</P>
      <P>We must recognise that people outside are extremely agitated, frustrated and anxious about the whole security question. The country is facing a breakdown in law and order of unprecedented proportions. Mugging, housebreaking, car stealing, assault and drug abuse are commonplace, particularly in the major cities and the urban areas, but are also widespread throughout the country generally. I was struck by comments made recently at a youth conference that the problems which we have come to associate with the major urban conurbations are becoming commonplace in rural areas.  One person said that people were mugged when they went into the streets and thus it was dangerous to be in the streets but if they stayed at home their houses were broken into and he asked where were people supposed to go.  We are quite familiar with that situation in the cities but I was surprised to see that it existed in country areas.  It rings a warning bell that the problem is widespread and action will have to be taken to deal with it on that basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What people want is urgent action <Col N="1338" /> from the Minister and the Government. I say this in all sincerity.  People are genuinely frustrated at the inability of the total system to handle the situation.  They are looking for urgent action.  They want resources committed to solve a rapidly-growing problem.  They want legislative and administrative action, and they want it in a hurry.  There is no great reason why such action cannot be taken.  I can assure the Minister he will have our full co-operation in passing this Bill quickly or in passing any other Bill relating to this problem.  He will have our support in taking any action relevant to dealing with law and order in our society.  Within the administrative area there are a considerable number of actions which the Minister could take.</P>
    <P>I am a little disappointed at the approach of the Government in recent times.  Deputy Gregory raised a question this morning about a new Cabinet committee to deal with heroin.  As far as the public are concerned this is good news and they are delighted to see something being done.  Recently the newspapers published a story dealing with this problem but when I read it through I found that all it meant was that two sections will co-operate to a greater degree in the hope that better results may be obtained.  However, that kind of action is not adequate in the present circumstances.  As a Government we took definite administrative action to deal with the drugs question. Before we left office we introduced a new chief superintendent with the specific purpose of bringing the power and intelligence of the serious crime detection section to deal with the problem of drugs. We tried to upgrade the whole approach and we provided additional staff for the Drug Squad.  It may be that more staff is needed here but any administrative action in this area will be supported by us.</P>
    <P>Urgent action is required at this stage. One of my concerns is that the man in the street is becoming increasingly frustrated about the present state of affairs.  At public meetings and elsewhere I find it difficult to explain that this Bill is an important facet of the total approach.  The man in the street cannot see it doing anything <Col N="1339" /> urgently and he wishes for more vigorous action.  In view of all the discussion and concern about this matter I am afraid that the citizen may consider we are bringing forward a very minor measure.  I hope the Government have not expended all their energy on this Bill because it is only a small part of the total problem.</P>
    <P>People no longer feel secure and safe in their community or in their homes. They see thieves and vandals flouting and laughing at the law and those who have to enforce it.  They see vigilante committees set up to defend themselves and punishment squads carrying out their own forms of rough justice.  It is an extremely serious situation.  This kind of action is taking place in my area and also in the centre city areas.  I have been involved in late night sessions with vigilante groups where they were literally physically protecting themselves and their homes.  I have had to try to defuse situations that were becoming very nasty because, I believe, if vigilante committees continue in the way in which some of them started it will lead to serious problems.  It is important to realise the urgency of the situation, not to complain about these people doing what they have done to try to defend themselves but to support the people in the community and have a situation where they will not need to act in the way they have been acting.  I will come back to that matter later.</P>
    <P>What we need urgently is an emergency programme to combat crime, but it must be comprehensive.  It is only on that basis that I would fault the Minister's move here today: I would not fault it in itself as a move.  He has taken an important and valuable step but if it is not accompanied by an emergency programme to combat crime we will not succeed and we will be faced with serious problems.</P>
    <P>Unless we look at the matter comprehensively we will not realise the reality and extent of the problem.  I have difficulties in talking to people about this matter because they are so upset about it.  Many people have had the privacy of their homes invaded, they have been mugged and their cars have been stolen <Col N="1340" /> or vandalised.  Schools have also been vandalised.  Because of all this, the reaction of many people is one of bitter frustration and they are not inclined to look at the nature and the causes of the problem. They want immediate action and suggest various types of action which are fairly widely publicised.</P>
    <P>As regards the components in the programme, one must face the reality that if employment and involvement are not created for young people we will not overcome problems regarding crime, certainly not in the short term.  When I say that to people at meetings or otherwise, they tell me that in the past if you had not a job you did not steal or rob cars. However, there is no point in talking about the past because many circumstances have changed over the years.  I do not broadcast this because I want rather to help the communities than broadcast their problems in the media, but I am very familiar with the situation in the small hours of the morning, my own area having one of the highest crime rates in the country.  On checking the position, over 90 per cent of those involved in crime who have been apprehended are unemployed.  This gives an indication and a very serious warning of the underlying problem.  We can theorise as much as we like that we personally would not steal, rob or vandalise because we had no job. The reality of the present economic situation is that if we do not provide jobs or give employment, we will find ourselves in difficulties.</P>
    <P>In one area with which I am familiar, 26 per cent of those between the ages of 16 and 25 are unemployed.  That is one of the reasons for my being concerned about the overall action of this Government. As is evident from the budget, budget debates and discussions, the Government are not providing an atmosphere of hope in relation to job creation or the provision of funds to provide the necessary jobs for our present particular and peculiar circumstances.  One element is the question of the whole atmosphere and environment being provided. Another element very directly related and relevant is that of sports and recreational facilities.  Most of the youth <Col N="1341" /> involved generally in sports or in clubs of one sort or another do not become involved in crime.  Those who do become involved in a very minor fashion and have help in sorting themselves out very quickly.  It is evident that involvement in sports and recreational facilities has a major part to play in relation to youth, but the present economic thinking has led to cutbacks in the national programme for their provision.  This is a wrong policy, particularly in relation to youth crime prevention.</P>
    <P>A third element about which one might not think a lot but which is particularly important in dealing with crime on the streets is the community infrastructure, which we have not needed to examine previously.  There are two small points which are extremely important.  One is money being made available to close up laneways for security reasons.  We have closed off a lot of laneways with tremendous benefit to the population generally and a lessening of attack on parked cars and so on.  This must be done and generally speaking the community are very anxious to see it done, but the problem is getting the necessary funds.  The Minister might consider this for his community service orders, if the money is not being made available elsewhere.  There is little cost involved.  Another question in that infrastructure area is that of lighting generally.  Dark patches and the delay in repairing lighting create serious problems in communities around Dublin.  People are frightened because of the lack of attention to these matters.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside these general underlying problems, we come to the question of crime prevention and detection.  We believe very firmly that gardaí on the beat are a major bulwark against crime and its development.  They are the most important deterrent and preventive measure and it is particularly important that gardaí be available in the community and on the beat.  In our period of office, we increased the number of gardaí by 2,000, some of whom are still being put through their training.  It is an on-going programme. That was regarded as a very dramatic measure.  I was present at the meeting at which that decision was taken and it was <Col N="1342" /> a decisive administrative action taken because of the reality of the position on the streets.  Obviously, it was expensive but at an earlier stage in the development of this country there were far greater numbers of gardaí, without going back to the days of the RIC, when the numbers were very much larger again.</P>

      <P>: It is relevant to say that we have provided extra police.

These members may well be in the probation service which is relevant to this Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: These people must go back into the community.  The Minister has stressed that if staff are not available in the community these people will not be able to do so, in any event, which means that additional members must be provided in these services.  If they return to the community they will be under these orders and we are concerned with these orders.  The Bill is the Criminal Justice Bill, a subsection of which we are dealing with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: Well, if one tries to treat this situation in isolation I believe one will find that one will not be successful. In dealing with criminals involved here it must be remembered that they are at present subjected to a system which involves prison sentences, apprehension by police and being dealt with by probation officers. I must say I see the relevance of the prison system to this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: It would be quite in order to compare the prison system with the system proposed here &mdash; that is quite in order &mdash; but to date the Deputy has been dealing almost exclusively with the detection of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: If you will allow me, a Cheann Comhairle, to proceed I shall do <Col N="1344" /> my best to deal with the problem.  But I must make it clear that I am conscious that here today we are putting a very small part of the Criminal Justice Bill outside this House on to the streets. People are extremely frustrated.  If the Minister does not indicate to them very clearly that this constitutes a small part only of a major attack he plans making on this area, then there will be additional frustration.  That is basically the point I am endeavouring to make.</P>
      <P>I mentioned the question of vigilantes in crime prevention.  In this respect we must look urgently at the provision of crime prevention committees within the community and community relations gardaí.  I believe such provision could offset the effects of what has been happening, could provide the kind of relationship within which the measures proposed here today could be effected satisfactorily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I raised already the question of the Minister bringing forward the major Criminal Justice Bill.  This is urgently needed and I hope he will come forward with this Bill very quickly.  The public want to know what the Minister is going to do about such matters as giving more power to the gardaí to question and arrest suspects in regard to serious crime.  They want to know if he will introduce mandatory minimum sentences for mugging elderly people, for house-breaking, robbery with violence and assault.  They want to know if he will crack down with penal servitude and perhaps have mandatory sentences for the unlawful possession of firearms and explosives.  They want to know if he will tighten up on the conditions of bail and provide for consecutive sentences.  At present the public see too many crimes being committed by people out on bail or some other form of release and they are concerned that this situation be tightened up urgently.  The public also want to see a crackdown on loitering, particularly in groups.  More parents are claiming that parents generally should be held responsible for the vandalism and crimes committed by their children.  For instance, in many cases cars are stolen around 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. at which time <Col N="1345" /> naturally parents should know where their children are.</P>
    <P>In that sense the community want to see that the punishment fits the crime and is seen to fit the crime.  At present they see too many criminals getting off too lightly, too many being released too soon with no room in our prisons to contain those people who should be contained there.  The Minister made reference to this.  Indeed he said this Bill would not ease that situation all that much. Obviously it will remove from the prison system some of the people who should not really be going into prison at present. I am familiar particularly with many of these young people who require a form of corrective action which is not imprisonment. At least the provisions of this Bill will provide one or a number of these forms of action.</P>
    <P>When we look at what is happening to our prison service we see the need for some action such as is proposed in this Bill.  I was concerned at the statements of the Minister in this respect.  He said there would be some easement of the position within prisons as a result of some completions expected, one in Cork.  Then he continued to say:</P>
    <P>However, I would hope that the accommodation problem will ease soon.  Loughan House will shortly be reverting to usage within the prison system and the second wing of Cork Prison will also be coming into use fairly soon.  Apart from this extra accommodation, community service should help ease the problem.</P>
    <P>I examined the capital situation to ascertain what the Minister is doing more generally. Here I found the position somewhat frightening.  For example, on capital services I ascertained that the 1982 outturn was £16.5 million.  The estimate we were planning to provide for this year in that respect was £18 million.  I find then that the Coalition's estimate is down to £11 million.</P>

      <P>: I am endeavouring to keep to the question.  The present reality is that the Minister is not providing the places in which to confine people who need to be confined.  The prison system is in a state of chaos at present.  We need places for criminals because the punishment, whatever it is &mdash; in this case we are talking about a new form of punishment &mdash; must be in accordance with the different categories of people who have to be confined.  For instance, we have the psychopaths, long-term criminals, subversives, <Col N="1348" /> medium-term criminals and those involved in petty crime.  We must have institutions and methods to cater for such people.  The Bill provides for alternative sanctions, to perform work to benefit the community.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to ensure that suitable offenders carry out unpaid work for the benefit of the community instead of another sentence if required to do so by court order.  The Minister made clear the way that will operate.  I welcome the fact that the sanctions will take into account the position of offenders so that their education or employment is not disrupted. It is important to have flexibility. Gaoling is expensive and in some cases unsuitable.  It is important also that offenders are seen to repay the community. The Minister dealt with the situation in the UK where such measures were introduced in 1973.  I recall when in Finland in 1964 seeing a local bank manager painting railings at the airport for an offence. Obviously this type of measure has been in operation there for some time.  I do not know if the Minister has that type of measure in mind or if we will see that here.  I do not know if consent would be forthcoming in that case.  The Minister mentioned that the ICTU have generally approved the scheme.  We are all aware that work is scarce and that the Minister for the Environment did away with 370 environmental works jobs under Dublin Corporation.  Obviously this will all lead to difficulties because on the one hand the Government cannot be seen to be cutting down on badly needed environmental works and at the same time introducing works suggested by the Minister for Justice.  It must be remembered that many young people were usefully employed in the environmental schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is little indication of the type of work that will be involved and it is obvious that the Minister will have to depend on the probation service, in conjunction with the committees he proposes establishing, to arrange the work schemes.  That is satisfactory provided the Minister recruits adequate staff in the probation service to supervise the work. Those involved in that service are under considerable pressure at present.  I should <Col N="1349" /> like to know if the Minister for Finance is agreeable to providing adequate staff for this.  Does the scheme represent the view of the Department of Justice only or has it been adopted by the Government? If the staff are not provided the scheme will not work.  Has the Minister for Finance agreed to recruit extra staff?  Has the Minister for the Environment agreed on the type of work that will be involved?</P>
    <P>There is no great need for us to go through the Bill in detail because it was prepared and introduced by Fianna Fáil. We welcome the flexibility which the Bill will provide.  It is important that the Minister indicates, in conjunction with this measure, that he intends introducing a comprehensive emergency programme to deal with the crime situation.  The Government have a duty to support the Minister in his attack on crime.  We will be demanding action on the Criminal Justice Bill during this session.  There is no reason why that Bill cannot be brought before the House because the draft was in the Minister's possession in December. While I appreciate that the Minister, and the Cabinet, may want to include other matters nevertheless it should be possible to bring the Bill before the Dáil soon.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have another look at the question of finance for our prisons, particularly the probation service.  The Minister has told us that the terms of the legislation will come into operation when he introduces an order and I hope that will not be delayed by financial considerations. He hopes there will not be any unnecessary delay but I am concerned about the question of staff and whether the necessary finance will be provided. Very often business people tell us that cutbacks are necessary in the social area and that there is need for investment in economic development but privately those people emphasise the need to protect homes and look after law and order. The community in general will support the allocation of resources for this because there is a realisation that we need to root out the godfathers of crime who have developed in our community, those who operate protection rackets and control the pushing and supplying of drugs. We will give our support to the Minister <Col N="1350" /> in his efforts in that regard and we hope the Government will provide him with the necessary resources.  It is important that we support those who stand up to the criminals.</P>
    <P>The situation in our prison system is bad.  Some of the Juvenile workshops in St. Patrick's have been closed.  I understand that inmates have been sent to look at videos for longer times during the day and that sort of thing.  Early releases are being forced which are not related to the offenders' readiness for release.  Holiday breaks of up to 14 days have been introduced for a person on a one-year or two-year sentence.  This is a good measure provided it is used for the right reason.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>Unlike prisoners in many other countries in Western Europe, most of our prisoners enjoy the relative comfort of a cell each.  It may not be possible to allow this situation to continue.</P>
    <P>That is an indication of the pressure in this area.  About 50 people each week are committed to Mountjoy and St. Patrick's Institution and the complement is a little over 600.  Obviously it is not possible to keep people there for the right length of time and they will be released for the wrong reasons.  A rough calculation shows the average stay to be about 12 weeks, although some will be there for much longer periods and others for much shorter periods.  I believe that Loughan House is now empty and I am glad the Minister has confirmed that it will continue to be available and may ease some accommodation problems.</P>
    <P>There is much talk about tax offences and the need for imprisonment but I would suggest that community service orders might be more appropriate in some of these cases, although in some instances committal to prison may be the only proper measure.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill, although I do so with some trepidation.  I have talked about these measures at many meetings in the community but people become entirely frustrated and want to deal with <Col N="1351" /> the immediate problems.  The Minister must devise a more comprehensive programme. However, he will have our full support in putting this measure through the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  I believe it to be essentially a good measure.  There is an obligation on all of us to ensure that the proposal before us, which has been nudged along by a number of Ministers for Justice, should not be misinterpreted or in any way politically abused.  It is clear that this measure is a part of a necessary progressive programme to deal with crime and the manner in which people in custody must be treated.</P>
      <P>There are few greater scourges than that of lawlessness.  I would strongly assert that this Bill is in no way to be interpreted as a less than fulsome response to that problem.  There is a very great need for a determined attempt by the Government and all in positions of authority and influence to see whether we can turn back this enormous tide which threatens to engulf us.  In my constituency I am mindful daily of the increasing tragedy of a society in which people are unable to live in any kind of security.  I am convinced that any Government would be concerned to do something about this problem and I am assured that fundamental consideration is being given to this need.</P>
      <P>One should not damn this Bill and there was a hint of condemnation in the remarks of the previous speaker when he implied that this was the Government's answer to the problem of crime.  That is not so, but it underlines the courage and the vision of the Government and the Minister in seeking to introduce a measure which is reforming and progressive in nature at a time when if we were to play to the gallery much more repressive, superficial and emotive measures might be introduced.  Certainly tough measures will have to be taken but I would hope they would be part of a measured and thought-out policy rather than an emotive response to the problems of our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1352" /> This measure is undoubtedly very timely and will afford us an opportunity of focussing on some areas of the criminal justice system which until now have received scant attention.  The answer to crime is rarely as simplistic as it might appear.  It is not merely a question of bigger doors and locks and more prisons. If this were the case the problem would have been solved long ago when people were hanged for stealing sheep.  It is not that kind of problem.  Our efforts must be channelled into the preventive area and dealing with the catchment areas of crime, tackling the real causes of crime which in many cases are social and economic. That is the real challenge but it is not an area which is likely to pay immediate dividends.  It is not seen to be politically attractive and on occasions is seen to be politically risky in terms of the public perception that a person who advocates that line is somehow &ldquo;soft&rdquo; on crime.  That is a risk which people who believe in a principle must run.</P>
    <P>There is no mystery about crime.  I could today put into an envelope and hand to the bank manager painting the railings in Finland, to whom Deputy Woods referred, to be locked in the vault if he is back in his job, the names of people not yet out of primary school who will one day be in prison.  It is as predictable as that unless we intervene at a fundamental level.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister and his predecessors on bringing this Bill before the House.  It is clear that the courts system and the prison system need more flexibility, more capacity to respond to the specific case and the needs of the individual.  It will allow us for once to focus if not on the victim at least on the community to whom injury has been done.  No matter how repressive the legislation, no matter how tough the measures or how long the sentences, none has done or will do one iota to make reparation to the broken bodies or the robbed communities who have been injured by crime.  I am often struck by the fact that so little consideration, analysis or investigation is given to what happens to the victims of crime.  I know people who take it as the normal part and parcel of daily <Col N="1353" /> life to be robbed or mugged.  I have constituents who were robbed on six occasions in one week.  I can point to a shopkeeper whose shop was broken into on six occasions in one week.  I can point to people much closer to my home who have been robbed four times in one week, occasionally with violence and &mdash; this is a reflection on all of us &mdash; who have given up hope that any of us will do anything about it and in some cases do not even bother reporting these crimes any more.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Community Service Bill may afford us an opportunity of insisting on reparation and restitution being made to such people because it is a Bill which allows us the opportunity of meeting two needs, neither of which has been dealt with as well as it might have been up to now.  One of those is the undoubted need to try to ensure that we can, if possible, convert people whose lives are pointing towards a life of crime into useful members of the community. That can only be done by a sensitive, humane, and, where possible, individualistic type of approach to the people involved.  Secondly, this Bill will enable us to do justice to the people on whom the crimes have been committed.  Up to now we have had a relatively inflexible prison system and no consideration whatever given to the victim.  Obviously, in those circumstances neither the needs of the criminal nor the community are being met.  It is not surprising that the prison system at the present time is failing us and has been doing so for some time not merely for those reasons alone.</P>
    <P>Surely, it is not too much for us to ask to what extent we should see convicted people as a potentially useful resource? The great platitudes in this area about rehabilitation are that people have an essential goodness, that we should seek it out and should develop it so that the incipient crime orientation will be overcome and that those people will once again become useful members of the community.  There was an article in a magazine called <i>Contemporary Review</i> of January 1976 by Martin Wright, who spoke at the fifth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Treatment of Offenders in Geneva.  He said <Col N="1354" /> that every day some ten million humans are imprisoned.  He also said that in this statistical age we do not even know the actual number.  He asserts that prisoners are commonly either exploited or under-employed and in the latter case the slack institutional tempo incapacitates them and by the time they are released for normal work, which the prison stigma makes still harder to obtain, they find it even more difficult to adjust to the normal day to day routine.  That is an essential difficulty for somebody involved in an attempt at prison rehabilitation.</P>
    <P>How does one reconcile the concept of trying to train or develop people for life in a normal community while that training has to be done, quite naturally and understandably, almost completely in a closed institution?  If we can think in terms of convicted people as a resource, as people who are part of the latent potential which the country has to offer, and even though that resource has to be handled with great delicacy and sensitivity and in most cases in institutions of one kind or another, surely it is wrong for us to assume that no good can come from such a resource?  This Bill puts the foot in the door of opening to us access to that resource so that we can help the people in prisons to rediscover what the essence of rehabilitation is, the discovery of meaning in their lives.  There is no point whatever in us assuming that some form of chemistry takes place within the four walls of a prison cell and that by some extraordinary process people discover this kind of meaning in their lives and are turned into good citizens.  It does not happen like that.  It is only if people are afforded the opportunity of meaningful or useful work or educational access or some way in which their lives once again rediscover dignity and status that they will get off the treadmill of crime.</P>
    <P>I do not want to overstate the potential in the Bill but the Community Service Bill points us towards a situation where the criminal may become decriminalised by the process of dignified and useful contact or work in or with the community and will also restore some of what has been stolen from the community.  I am mindful of the fact that there are always <Col N="1355" /> difficulties in any such proposal but it strikes me as being an opportunity not just for the Department of Justice but for the trade union movement to become very much involved.  There can be no doubt but that ample work needs to be done which will not be done in the normal productive sector, which will not be done in the semi-State sector and which will not cause difficulty for trade unions who are obviously concerned at the moment about the unemployment effect on their members.  I would like to ask the Minister to consider involving the trade union movement in co-operation with the Department in seeking out appropriate avenues which could be explored for the purposes of this Bill.  From that type of approach we are likely to get much more satisfactory results.</P>
    <P>It is well that we have an opportunity to learn from the experiences of other countries.  It happens that we have in this House regularly, and in some cases almost inevitably, to adopt what happens in Britain.  Once again this is reflected in this Bill but that does not in any way make it essentially regrettable or bad. We should look a little beyond that offshore island off the coast of Europe to continental countries where similar schemes were instituted many years ago. If we do that we will see that we can learn from the lessons learnt, for example, in Sweden or even in Germany.  They have instituted such alternatives to imprisonment with success and yet have managed to convince the electorate and the public, because the political consideration must not be obscured either, that this is a true answer to crime, not some kind of soft option which can be interpreted as being soft on criminals but the way to deal with the human problem which, in the immediate and long term, is the right form of investment for many people in our prison system.</P>
    <P>In an interesting article in the <i>New Statesman</i> of 19 September 1980 the Governor of Winson Green Prison in Birmingham gave his views, which are appropriate. He did a computer analysis of 4,093 people who had passed through his prison <Col N="1356" /> between the beginning of July 1979 and the end of June 1980.  The Governor, Mr. Roger Attrill, said that of these 2,071 people, that is 50.6 per cent, were in his eyes as a governor of long experience unsuitable for that type of imprisonment. From my experience as a member of a prison visiting committee and having had a long time interest in this area that profile of unsuitable prisoners is mirrored by the situation here.</P>
    <P>The governor gave figures to illustrate the sentences given to these people.  Of the 2,000 plus people I referred to, 360 were serving sentences of a week or less; 275 people were serving one to two weeks; 90 were serving two to three weeks; 392 people were serving three weeks to 30 days; 348 people served one to two months; 276 served two to three months and 319 served three to six months.  In many of these cases there were few and sometimes no previous convictions. The nature of the crime for which these people were imprisoned was not such as would put the public at risk in any serious way.  I do not want to make light of the crime involved but as the governor said:</P>
    <P>It is absolute economic nonsense to put a man inside for fourteen days for not paying a £50 fine when it costs £240 a week to keep him there.  This is compounded by the fact that shortage of resources and work facilities mean he is fed, clothed, locked up for 14 days and probably spends them lying in the cell doing nothing.  If it is not possible for him to work off his fine by community work then we should be told why.</P>
    <P>That is the experience of an English prison governor.  I have spoken to governors here and know they share the same view.  The difficulty for politicians is to convince the public.</P>
    <P>What we are attempting to do in the Bill should not be misinterpreted as being something else.  It is clear that the wastage of resources in having a large prison population locked up in some cases for 23 out of 24 hours a day, is an admission of defeat by us all and particularly by the Department of Justice.  I am glad an <Col N="1357" /> attempt is being made to try to redress that situation.  However, I would enter many notes of caution.  There is no point in welcoming this measure unless we also accept that the greater flexibility involved and the &ldquo;out of institution&rdquo; situation which will apply to people assigned work under the Bill will involve some mistakes. I recall occasions on which we were asked in the wake of people who absconded while on parole whether parole should be done away with.  It is clear that it should not be and that there is a great deal of good in having such a system which goes unsung.  Just because people abscond&mdash;in most cases they are caught or come back voluntarily&mdash;does not mean we should overturn the whole system.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said there would be close supervision and selection of prisoners so I am hopeful that there will be few if any errors.  However, there will be some and we must accept that as the price of progress.  If the selection and supervision process is done correctly those assigned such work will not put the public at any significant risk.  We should pay tribute to people who have done work in this area already.  I know that in the Kilmainham District Court years ago District Justice James O'Sullivan was able to sentence two teenagers to repair a roof they damaged at Drimnagh CBS. I know other judges have used their discretion and sentenced people to do work of a similar nature.  The Minister referred to that when he spoke about prisoners presently released under the control and guidance of prison officers who do work for the community which would not otherwise be done.  He gave examples of where prisoners have constructed a scout hall in the Dublin area and have refurbished a centre in Dún Laoghaire for the treatment of people with alcohol and alcohol-related problems.  The natural instinct of judges&mdash;who have given outstanding service to the country in the difficult demanding job of full-time contact with people who are unfortunately the epitome of unhappy aspects of society&mdash;has been to do something better than lock people up.</P>
    <P>The Bill the Minister introduced formalises that and will give power to the <Col N="1358" /> courts to propose alternative sanctions. It will have to be monitored very carefully but it is essentially an enlightened measure. I hope at an early stage the Department of Justice, in conjunction with other Ministers, will deal with the fundamental areas which give rise to criminality among young people.  These are urban deprivation, jobs and lack of education.  Most of the prison population are virtually illiterate and that is not a coincidence.  I hope this Bill will be part of a series of measures brought before the House.</P>
    <P>We can learn from the experience of other countries.  In Sweden the national Swedish council for crime prevention have produced numerous reports to see whether the traditional prison system&mdash; locking someone up for a definite period and then releasing him&mdash;can be improved on.  A prison sentence is usually the last thing to be resorted to by any judge. No-one wants to put a person behind bars if there is an alternative.  The Probation Act, which is well-intentioned, is often applied misguidedly.  If a person was dealt with firmly but compassionately on the first occasion he erred that might solve the problem.  The truth is that our natural reluctance to put someone behind bars means quite often that people involved in criminal acts come into contact with the guards and the courts on a number of occasions before they are ultimately given a sentence.  At no stage was the error of their ways brought home to those people.  We must develop the prison system as a more flexible weapon in social engineering.  There is no reason why people who commit certain offences should not serve very brief sentences in prison.  One of the disadvantages of the prison system is that a prison sentence ruins people.  It effectively destroys them and there is scant hope, except for the most courageous and resourceful, of rebuilding their lives after a prison sentence. In many cases it is a sentence of death in terms of the person's development, fulfilment, career and family.</P>
    <P>On the question of drunken driving, I see no reason why there should not be a mandatory jail sentence, made up of one or two weekends in prison, and in certain types of vandalism this approach could <Col N="1359" /> also be adopted.  There is a very interesting experiment being carried out at present in Germany where young people are being dealt with in this fashion and the indications are that it is successful.  The short, brief sentence gives the offender a clear indication of what the loss of liberty is.  It is a very short, sharp, traumatic and effective deterrent because it will not happen again.  It also avoids the present excessive loss for a first time offender, who in most cases loses his job and in many cases his wife and friends and public esteem.  There is no reason why anybody should know, except the person involved, about such a sentence.  I am convinced that that is an option open to us which should be used in relation to dealing with vandalism, using the prison as a much more flexible, innovative and sensitive instrument than the blunt one of being sent down for three months, which inevitably has the repercussions to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I hope that the State will take on its full responsibility with regard to finding employment for people who have been in prison and playing their full part in schemes such as this.  I mentioned earlier on that somebody who is convicted of an offence loses their job in the State service.  There was a case recently where a chap who was convicted of assault, involving a fist fight, automatically lost his job in the Army.  The fact that he was told by his solicitor to plead guilty is neither here nor there, but it is another interesting comment on what is happening at present.  Over the years I have asked in this House how many people who had been convicted of an offence are at present employed in the vast and burgeoning State service.  I would like the Minister to tell me whether there are any such people, because the best information I could get from his predecessor was that there was none.  I do not want to know who they are or where they are employed.  I am not interested in ferreting out such information but I am interested in the State playing its full part in this kind of scheme and not throwing the responsibility on to the private sector.  It is wrong that somebody should automatically <Col N="1360" /> lose their job in the public sector because they are guilty of an offence of this nature.  I can understand how a young man could lose his job in the Army if he was convicted of an arms offence or a breach of security, but for a young lad to get drunk, have a fist fight, be convicted and thereby lose a promising career is quite wrong.  There is no point in the community at large, presumably the private sector, being expected to afford work opportunities under this Bill or other measures if the State does not carry out its responsibility too.</P>
    <P>Very good and sensitive work is already being done in this area.  The juvenile liaison officer scheme and the heartening report of the probation and welfare service shows that this kind of flexible, sensitive approach to crime is going to pay dividends.  Obviously, it will not help in relation to the professional criminal, the godfather of crime or the group of families who are at present campaigning strongly in the Dublin city area and possibly around the country to subvert our young people by injecting drugs into people as young as 11 years old.  The Bill was never meant to deal with such people; other types of measures, which will leave them in no doubt as to where we all stand, will have to be introduced to cope with these gentlemen who at present seem to be able to waltz through the law, either on technicalities or for other reasons.  However, the Garda are to be congratulated on their efforts in the drugs area.</P>
    <P>It will be noted from the 1981 report on the probation and welfare service that the total number of new cases that the service dealt with was 1,909 compared with 1,712 in 1980 and that that increase is reflected also in statistics under the aegis of the juvenile liaison officer scheme, the purpose of which is to deal with young people prior to the courts dealing with them.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be widely welcomed because there have been demands for such measures over the years from a variety of bodies.  I have in front of me, for example, a memo from the Irish Association of Social Workers who were campaigning for such a measure.  They <Col N="1361" /> put forward a comprehensive document in relation to the needs here also and the Minister has met many of them.</P>
    <P>This House is faced with a very great challenge in trying to deal with the problems of crime.  I wonder whether we should make some attempt to work structurally on an all-party basis to deal with the problem in some respects because there is a temptation for politicians to exact the last political ounce out of any opportunity that might present itself.  I was struck by what Deputy Woods said earlier on.  He is not here now but I thought he left himself a little open to criticism.  He referred to spending long evenings with vigilantes.  I gathered from what he said that he was trying to dissuade them from actions they were going to take.  Two other Deputies on the far side of the House have recently become embroiled in that area also and I thought Deputy Ahern was unjustly dealt with in the interpretation of his remarks.  I heard the interview and I felt that the interpretation of his remarks was that he favoured vigilante groups.  Perhaps Deputy O'Dea should explain further his reported remarks of the weekend but, apart from that, I know of nobody else in this House who would give any comfort, encouragement or succour to vigilantes of any shape, form or kind.  The mentality of the vigilante is that of incipient criminality because it is to take unto oneself the obligation and the right to enact justice. That is not to say that one does not understand frustration but we must clearly distance ourselves from any such proposal or thought.  However, we cannot merely do that.  There will, inevitably, be much greater recourse to such illegal measures unless the Garda and those of us engaged right through the system in dealing with crime are more successful.  The challenge is fundamental and I know that the Garda are very frustrated at present at the way they have to carry out their work but, despite the difficulties and the growing lawlessness on the streets, the response to that must be a formal, legal response, not an arbitrary, vigilante type response.  We have enough incitement and inducement to law-breaking relating to fiscal matters at present <Col N="1362" /> from people who should know better, without taking guns, knives and other weapons into our hands to deal with crime on our streets.  That cannot be tolerated and it is incumbent on all Deputies to say clearly that they have no interest whatever by implication or otherwise in giving such support.</P>
    <P>Another reason why the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill is right and proper and will work relates to the present policies on fines.  It is fundamentally unjust that the present sentencing policy inevitably means that either one pays a fine of a specified amount or goes to jail for a period if one cannot or will not pay the fine.  The inevitable result is that the poor person has a far greater likelihood of ending up in prison.  As I have said, it is only the poor who are in prison, relatively speaking.  The number of people in other walks of society who end up in jail is very small and if by some mischief they slip through the mesh they will not stay there very long.  Therefore, if a person genuinely cannot pay a fine &mdash; and last week at one of these infamous clinics which politicians are forced to hold a young woman came to see me and her husband had the previous day started 12 months in jail because he could not pay a £750 fine, he had not got the money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Deputy listens to me he will know that it is not relevant to the point I am making.  I am not trying to indicate in any way that the man should be let off but if he was the son of a wealthy man he would not be in jail.  That is the point.  He should be punished certainly but he should not be punished also <Col N="1363" /> because he is poor.  The reason he is in jail is not that he committed the offence, it is because he committed the offence and could not pay the fine.  How could he pay?  Legions of people cannot pay and will never be able to pay unless we change the basic economic system here.  I oppose a system which does not take into account inability to pay.  A fine of £50 to one person is a fortune and to somebody else it is meaningless.  That is injustice, and what can we expect from an unjust system but further injustice?  Also, such fines should be index-linked because the fines limit we set in these Bills are meant to be just in the social and economic context of the day, week or month in which they are set.  By the nature of this House and the nature of our legislation it will be very many years before we come back to them and therefore in regard to some crimes there is a positive incitement to go on breaking the law.

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will not go on with this at any length but I want to make the point&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is getting away from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: I accept that, but earlier here Deputy Woods spoke on every wavelength but the Bill.  I submit that 90 per cent of my remarks are on the Bill.  I want to make the point that fining policy should be just and relevant.  A man who comes before a court, is given a sentence and cannot in the normal course of events pay a fine is now afforded the opportunity of giving that which he has, his time and talent however limited they may be.  At least that means we are dealing in some small way with this other compounding injustice of prison sentencing affecting adversely particularly the poor class. Obviously in those circumstances that would not be an argument.  The gentleman who is at present doing 12 months for the £750 is doing a term of imprisonment <Col N="1364" /> which is of no benefit to him &mdash; the social service must look after his wife and two children &mdash; and it is of no benefit to the barman.  It is a negative response and we can do much better than that.</P>
      <P>In the way this Bill is being worked out I would not like merely to have a concept of people being given a sentence of rebuilding GAA clubs or scout halls. That is good work, but there are other possible permutations.  We should explore ways of marrying where possible the crime with the response.  I am impressed by work which has been carried out in Germany where people who, for example, were caught for drunken driving were assigned to work in centres dealing with alcoholics or in extreme cases to work as junior orderlies in the wards where their victims were being treated.  That must be very traumatic, and surely difficult to structure and administer, but other countries have succeeded in doing it.  If somebody commits an act of vandalism on a school there is no reason why that person should not be given the job of repairing that vandalism. It may not be possible to do a great deal of this but we should consider trying to marry the sentence with the type of crime.  Some work has been done on that and it is a very salutory way of bringing home to people the error of their wrongdoing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In summary then &mdash; other people want to get in on this and I have gone on longer than I had intended and I am sorry for that &mdash; this measure is enlightened.  Some people may be tempted somehow to blacken it as a measure which is not adequate to deal with the problems of crime in our community.  Of course it is not because it was never intended to do that.  It is intended simply and essentially to afford another alternative to dealing with people who are convicted, an alternative which takes into consideration for the first time in this country the victim of the crime and the community which is robbed because it allows an opportunity for good to be done and for reparation to be made.  In that process it will do good for the person who has been convicted also and will point the way towards certain kinds of reform and rehabilitation <Col N="1365" /> for such criminals.  I do not think it can be applied to extreme, serious crime or to people who are of a fundamentally criminal nature after many acts of crime or a lifetime of crime.  It must be handled very carefully and sensitively.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing the measure particularly in these difficult days when such measures are hard to introduce and, when they come in, difficult to sustain.  James Joyce said that when ideas take flight in Ireland nets are thrown at them to keep them from flight.  I hope that we will not throw too many nets at this.  It is essentially a good idea if we do not expect more from it than it is intended to achieve.  I wish it well.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would like to give a hearty welcome to this Bill but I am very frustrated that at a time when our cities and towns are going through a very difficult time we are introducing a measure which will apply only to minor young criminals, if one can use the term, and not the hard-core offender, the type of young criminal of whom there are about 150 to 200 in Dublin.  Senior Garda officers told me that if those people were off the streets there would be no problem of vandalism.  I listened to Deputy Keating's speech with a sense of frustration.  He represents a centre city constituency but he would not make that speech to his constituents.  This measure will have as much effect as a thimble full of water used to put out a blaze.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1368" /> There is another Bill which I understand will be introduced soon, but it should have been introduced first.  We urgently need legislation to allow the gardaí to carry out their functions.  They are as frustrated as the public because our laws need to be changed quickly.  The law attaching to bail is covered in the new Bill.  People committing crimes while out on bail will have to serve consecutive sentences.  Society is being undermined because the police do not have the authority they need under the law.  We must make many changes in ralation to our Judiciary and sentencing.  We hear a lot about wrongdoers but we seldom hear about the victims.</P>
    <P>I have a reputation among part of the media as being a hard-liner, a law and order man, but I am not.  I am a compassionate man, but every day I see the victims.  I am sick and tired of not being able to do anything for them.  What can I say?  Will I tell them we are introducing legislation to try to make changes?  I have been calling for changes for many years so that parents of children up to 18 years of age would be responsible in law for the damage done by their children.  They should have to pay fines.  The former Minister for Justice, Deputy Doherty, told me that one of the objections to fining parents was that under the Constitution one person could not be held responsible for somebody else's crimes. Yet, if I own a dog and it bites somebody, when that happens a second time I am responsible in law.  I cannot communicate with my dog but I can communicate with my children.  I appeal to the Minister to include in the next Bill a section which will make parents responsible for the crimes of their children.  If they burn a car the money should be deducted from the parent's wages.  Parents should know where their children are at night.  I am talking about children of 10, 11, 12 and 13 years of age.  Their parents should be compelled to take responsibility for them and pay for any damage they cause.  If my child broke a neighbour's window I would apoligise and pay to have the window repaired.  Most of us pay if our children do damage.  I blame parents if their children are in trouble.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate your concern Deputy, but please stay with the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>: I take this opportunity to ask the Minister and his officials to make the appropriate changes in the next Bill. I suggest that they get in touch with the principal officer of the community and environment department of Dublin Corporation where they will hear many suggestions of how these young people can help.  There are suggestions that these offenders should help the disabled and do community work.  There is plenty of work to be done in Dublin city and this scheme is well worth while.</P>
      <P>At present the Government are paying out vast amounts of money to meet malicious damages claims because cars are burned, shops are broken into or burned down and so on.  Under a scheme like this if young people are willing to sign an order saying they want to be saved &mdash; the hard-core offenders will not be interested in signing such an order &mdash; by way of a book transaction, these young offenders should be paid a wage which in turn would be given to the victim.  In other words, if a car is set on fire and the cost of replacement is £2,000 or more, the offender will be paid for community work and that money will be paid to the victim. The victim would be given the money back from the State under a malicious damage scheme.  That is worth pursuing. That youngster who had set a car on fire would know it will cost him so much per week for so many hours.  The idea that he is not just doing a job instead of going to prison but that out of his own labour he will be repaying the person would mean more to some of those young people who go in for this mindless vandalism.</P>
      <P>I see Deputy Gay Mitchell sitting on the other side.  We attend meetings of our constituents regularly and he will agree there is not much in this Bill that would satisfy some of the people we have had to listen to complaining about what they have been going through and the haemorrhaging of the State by the cost of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1370" /> Recently statistics were published indicating that this country is comparable with many parts of America in the matter of crime and vandalism.  However, in America they can take into account in New York and Chicago the ethnic pressures and the consequent tremendous stresses which we do not have here. When matters of discrimination against ethnic groups, blacks, Poles, Jews, Puerto Ricans, in the US, are taken into account and that we do not have these pressures here it will quickly be realised that we have a very serious problem on our hands.  We talk about it but we are doing very little to cure it.</P>
    <P>I have said before that the first obligation on any Government is to protect the rights of the citizens, their right to walk through the streets of our cities and towns.  We are not doing that.  We are failing as legislators.  Deputy Keating condemned the action of vigilantes.  Of course I condemn them.  Ten years ago in the House I predicted that if we did not do something people would take the law into their hands.  Once that begins to happen there is very little we will be able to do about it.  People are going along now to subversive groups who are dealing with young criminal elements.  Those subversive elements will come along at election time and say to the people: &ldquo;We helped you when you were in trouble. Now it is your turn&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If we do not recognise the signs we had better do so very quickly.  Of course I condemn vigilantes, but their emergence reflects our failure and our lack of understanding of what people are going through.  It is about time we got that message loud and clear because we are the people who make the laws.  The sad part is that there is nothing in the Bill that will persuade vigilantes to stop, because this Bill does not apply to the people who are doing all the depredations.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke about drunken driving and putting offenders into jail at weekends.  He said it could be done discreetly so that no one would know, the deterrent element being that such people would not like to lose their freedom.  The whole object of sentencing a person is so <Col N="1371" /> that other people in the community would realise that the same thing might happen to them; when the names of people being sentenced for drunken driving are published others would think twice.  I know the father of a victim of a hit-and-run driver and very little action was taken against that person.</P>
    <P>We have throughout the community blackguardism of the worst kind and I ask the Minister of State now in the House to convey to the Minister for Justice that we must have another Bill soon. Before the Easter recess I asked when the other Bill would be ready and I was told it would be introduced in this session.  I hope the Minister did not mean this Bill, which will not solve the problem of vandalism, the muggings, the terrorising of our citizens.  Our old people living alone are wondering when somebody will come through the roof.  People are waking up seeing people in their rooms. People have seen in the courts criminals being sent to prison for three months but being released a week later.  That is crazy. We all know of that recent disgrace to the judicial profession when those people were set free after committing murder in Fairview.  I suppose that unfortunate judge does not realise that his name is synonomous with miscarriage of justice, just as Boycott's name is synonomous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: When the Judiciary make mistakes it reflects on them.  When we make mistakes it reflects on all of us.  I will conclude because there are others who have strong feelings on this question of law and order.  If we do not do something in this year to protect our citizens this place will not be in existence five or <Col N="1372" /> six years from now.  We will have been taken over by some sort of revolution because once this vigilante thing gets rooted it will not be easy to stop.  It is the beginning of what many people in this House have spoken of for years, the beginning of the revolution.  People have been pushed as far as they will go and we have got to act urgently.  We want laws which will allow the Garda to come to grips with those criminals.  We have many good laws ready.  Let us get them in here quickly.  If there were something in this Bill which allowed a district justice to impose fines on parents, that would be helpful.  As I said, it deals with minor offenders.  I hope it will be a success.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  The Bill will be very effective for those whom it will touch.  It will be an excellent addition to what is already there, but it will not deal with the fire which is blazing all around us.  That regretfully is the case. I hope the other Bill will be ready soon and that the Minister will consider fines for parents of children up to 18 years being incorporated somewhere in the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the debate on this Bill one is tempted to get into the area of the appalling crime rate figures with which we are faced, of vandalism and a breakdown in law and order.  That would be beyond the scope of this Bill which deals with people who have been convicted and how they should be dealt with by the courts.  If one were to get into a debate on that line of country one would be talking about the effects of unemployment, hardship and a reduction in the standards of living of ordinary people.  In the context of this Bill people will be ordered by the courts, albeit with their consent, to do unpaid work, and the thought comes inescapably that it would be a far more attractive proposition to have paid work made available to many young people before they find themselves before the courts.  That matter will have to be debated by the House at great length, but it is beyond the scope of this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Bill is concerned primarily with providing an additional option in the field of sentencing to judges.  I want to say a few words about the nature of the options which are already there, and the extent to which they are used, or not used as I will be submitting.  It has to be said that in many cases, unfortunately, when judges are appointed, and even after they are appointed, they have not got a sufficient degree of expertise in dealing with criminal law and the imposition of punishments. Many of the judges and justices who are appointed have had little or no experience of criminal law during their time as barristers or solicitors.  Yet they are given the serious and very important role of administering the criminal law side of the legal system and imposing sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For new appointees to the bench at all levels briefings and seminars should be held, and there should be a procedure to bring them up to date with developments in criminal law policies of which they would not have had experience from practising on the civil law side of the <Col N="1374" /> courts.  By the same token, it would be very helpful, not only for new appointees but for all judges and justices, to have a system under which they could be brought together from time to time, perhaps under the auspices of the Chief Justice, and have seminars and briefings to enable them to discuss among themselves recent developments in the field of sociology and the types of punishments appropriate for certain kinds of criminals and people who have been convicted of crimes.  In some countries that kind of going back to school, as it were, is undertaken but I am not aware of it here.</P>
    <P>In any trade or profession new ideas are developing all the time.  New concepts emerge from various organisations, from academics in the universities and from people who specialise in the science of penology, criminology and sociology. Many people in our universities specialise in those fields and could have a very major input into the administration of criminal law, particularly in the field of sentencing, if they were given an opportunity on a regular basis to have an inter-play with the key people concerned, mainly the judges and justices.  This would probably be welcomed by the Judiciary.  Perhaps the Minister could consult with the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court to discover whether such an arrangement might be welcomed by the bench and by the academics concerned.</P>
    <P>It is very important that judges and justices should be apprised of the new thinking.  The criminal law gives very wide powers and discretions to judges and justices as to the type and length of sentence which may be imposed.  All too often it appears to members of the public that this discretion is not exercised all that wisely.  It is important that discretion should be exercised responsibly and uniformly, and that there should be a measure of uniformity in sentences visible to the public eye for comparable crimes committed under comparable circumstances. It goes hard on the public eye and tends to bring the law into disrepute when it is seen that, for a relatively trivial <Col N="1375" /> offence, what appears to be a substantial penalty is imposed, whereas in other cases where a quite serious crime was committed a relatively trivial penalty or no penalty was imposed.  Uniformity must be seen to operate.  Briefing sessions to discuss different categories of crimes and the level of penalties that would be appropriate could be held, where the judges and district justices were brought together to discuss with academics and sociologists the kind of criteria and considerations that should apply in nominating penalties for certain types of crime. That idea was recognised by a famous American judge when he said, &ldquo;If in the district in which a judge sits his fellow-judges have established and insist on following a pattern for dealing with offences of a particular type, it is his responsibility either to get them to change or for him to come close to their standards&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Quite apart from the new options in this Bill, existing options that have been open to judges charged with administering criminal law have not been used as widely as they might have been.  There is one option already open to judges which has been badly neglected, namely, the option of adjourning the case, that after a person has been convicted of a crime the judge would put back the case for three or six months to see how the convicted person would get on during that period.  The convicted person would know that the conviction and the charge were still standing over his head and could be dealt with at the expiration of the adjourned period.  That is done in some cases but not widely enough.  It is a very effective way of putting a convicted person on probation without actually disposing of the case by applying the Probation Act, in the knowledge that that person will conduct himself properly in that period bearing in mind that the conviction still stands over his head and that no penalty has yet been fixed.  The idea is that if all goes well during the probationary period it might be extended or the convicted person perhaps might be discharged.</P>
    <P>The question arises whether the width of discretion left to the Judiciary is too <Col N="1376" /> wide: I am talking of the discretion judges have under the existing options now open to them and the options proposed in this Bill.  Some recent decisions would lead one inevitably to the conclusion that it is too wide.  In the case of serious offences, particularly those involving unprovoked serious physical attack on people causing them injury, the level of discretion at present open to the Judiciary may have to be reconsidered.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the only crime excluded from the purported operation of the community service procedure is that of murder.  I am somewhat concerned about that.  I think some other crimes of a serious nature, other than murder, should be excluded from the operation of the community service order procedure.  With regard to crimes involving unprovoked serious personal attack on other people, on old people and on children, the question of excluding such crimes from the operation of this procedure will have to be examined with some care.</P>
    <P>The judges must be responsive to the feelings of the public in the administration of this branch of the law.  That is essential if respect for the law by the public is to be preserved.  I do not suggest that judges should respond to public hysteria in whatever form that takes place but if respect for the law is to be upheld the judges must look at that aspect.  The matter was summed up by an English judge as follows: &ldquo;Criminal law must represent a remarkably high average of the population's views with regard to penalties and the law-abiding citizen must feel that the law is effective in protecting him from infractions of his liberty by wrongdoers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The proposal for the community service orders has a proviso as mentioned in the Minister's speech.  He said it would be a matter for the probation and welfare service to satisfy the court that arrangements could be made for the offender to perform work under a community service order.  The implication there is that there would be a situation where on some occasions it would be possible for arrangements to be made and on other occasions it would not be possible for <Col N="1377" /> arrangements to be made.  That would be a very unsatisfactory situation because it could lead to cases where people charged and convicted of similar offences on some occasions may find themselves able to avail of the community service order procedure and not able to do so in other cases and, as a result, compelled to serve a prison sentence.  That would be entirely wrong.  If it is accepted that certain types of convicted persons are appropriate to pay the penalty by means of community service on the lines outlined in this Bill, that availability must be open to all.  It would be entirely wrong if a person was prepared to do community service but because it was not availabe was compelled to serve a prison sentence whereas another person in identical circumstances could pay the penalty by means of community service.  If the scheme were to be brought in arrangements would have to be made in advance to ensure that in any cases where that procedure would be appropriate the work would be available for the convicted person if he agreed to do it within the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The people who will have the major responsibility of administering the scheme are the probation and welfare officers.  At this juncture I should like to pay a sincere tribute to the court probation officers, particularly in the District Courts, who, with very limited and inadequate resources do a fine and difficult job.  They work under the most difficult circumstances and they are too few in number but having worked with many of them for many years I know they are dedicated people.  They fulfil an essential and valuable function in the administration of the criminal system.  If they are to be called upon to operate the scheme, I hope the service will be widely expanded and that full and necessary facilities will be made available to the probation and welfare officers to carry out their tasks under the Bill in the manner that they would wish &mdash; the most efficient manner. The Bill is to be welcomed, broadly speaking, because it provides an option which was not heretofore open to judges in dealing with convicted people.  To that extent it is to be welcomed, but at the same time it must be approached with <Col N="1378" /> caution.  Great care must be taken to ensure that the scheme is not used in such a way that people would be released on the community who could be a danger and could cause injury to the community, thereby taking way from the intent behind the scheme which would be limited to being of benefit to the community and to the convicted people themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: As all the previous speakers have indicated, the Bill is to be welcomed as progressive legislation.  I cannot, however, help expressing the suspicion that part of the reason for its introduction at this stage is to relieve the overcrowding in our prisons.  That suspicion is strengthened to some degree by a number of remarks of the Minister in his opening speech.  It is unfortunate that it would appear to be an <i>ad hoc</i> response to the problem of prison overcrowding. It is also unfortunate that possibly it is one of the reforms least needed in terms of the other necessary reforms to the criminal code.</P>
      <P>I express the frustration of many Deputies at the slow preparation and introduction of legislation in the Dáil. When it comes into the Dáil it is reasonably speedily processed, but the length of time for acknowledged reforms to be brought into this House is very frustrating. It is frustrating not only for the Members of the Dáil but for the public at large, who see many worthwhile reforms which practically all the parties agree to be necessary about which nothing seems to be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The sentencing of people convicted of offences comes at the end of a chain of events, of services provided by the State &mdash; if one can call them that.  The Garda Síochána are responsible for apprehending those whom they consider to be guilty of an offence; the courts decide whether or not those persons are, in fact, guilty and the prisons provide retribution, in a sense, for society.  I wonder if the whole question of the effectiveness of imprisonment should not be taken into account when this Bill is being discussed.  I welcome the Bill as a progressive reform mainly because it is an attempt to move away from the idea that the response to <Col N="1379" /> crimes, whether large or small, should be imprisonment.  The general response is that imprisonment is a form of revenge, but I do not accept that.  The Dáil should try to correct that approach to crime.</P>
    <P>The moving of this Bill this week could be seen as a response to growing unease among the general public at the rise in crime.  In discussing crime it is important to differentiate between the serious organised crime which is taking place in our society and petty crime and vandalism which bear most heavily upon communities and up against which people come directly.  It is the response to petty crime that must be tackled by this Dáil.</P>
    <P>Opinion polls in relation to the crime level have recently been discussed and in some areas the response has been vigilante groups, with the inherent danger that such vigilante groups might become involved with paramilitaries and so forth. It must be said clearly by everybody in this House that vigilante groups are opposed in whatever form, whether organised on paramilitary lines or simply the frustrated reaction of communities to what they see as a failure of the forces of law and order.</P>
    <P>My criticism on the media of a Member of this House was not that he supported vigilantes&mdash;because I know that he does not &mdash; but that he indicated that it appeared that these vigilante groups were effective.  There is no evidence whatsoever that vigilantes or paramilitary groups are in any way effective.  The only result for a community of such vigilante groups is the swapping of one kind of terror for another kind, and that is completely unacceptable.  The response of those who feel this frustration should be to exert that frustration on public representatives to order society, to have the correct legislation on the books and to ensure its implementation.  It is essential that this frustration be made quite clear to their elected representatives and that this House respond effectively and speedily to that type of representation from the electorate.  Otherwise, the vigilante type of activity will grow.</P>
    <P>I expect that the response of the people in the street to this progressive legislation <Col N="1380" /> will be a cynical shrug of the shoulders. They will see it simply as a formalising of the system of allowing offenders out of prison before completing their sentences. I am not convinced that imprisonment is the answer in 95 per cent of the cases which come before the courts although it certainly is necessary in very serious cases.  Unless we tackle the social and economic problems which give rise to most of the petty crime and vandalism which beset society, we are failing.  In discussing that area the whole question of drug abuse and alcohol must be brought into the equation.</P>
    <P>We are told also that the response to crime and vandalism must be one of better policing.  Better policing can come about only if the resources are made available to the Garda to provide the men and women on the beat and if the training is given to these gardaí to deal with the type of society we have at present. I am not at all satisfied that gardaí receive anything but the most basic training at present before being put out on the streets of this and other cities.  There has been a welcome development in my constituency where additional Gardaí have been provided.  They are out on the beat there and doing a very good job given their restrictive resources.  However, I think they would do much better were they subjected to intensive training on how to relate to people in the areas in which they will work.  For example, it is entirely unreasonable to expect a young chap who may only recently have left secondary school and who joins the Garda from a rural area &mdash; who is moved after a few months training to a working-class area in say, Dublin, Cork, Limerick or another city, certainly into an urban environment, and more than likely a poor, working class environment &mdash; to relate to the problems being experienced by people in those areas.</P>
    <P>I consider that 95 per cent of the offenders who come before our courts do not warrant imprisonment.  Also most of the people who come before our courts are young persons, again most from working-class backgrounds.  While as far as I am aware no study has ever been undertaken here of the background of <Col N="1381" /> people who come before our courts, to endeavour to establish what motivates them primarily to become involved in crime, we all know there are many elements involved in the perpetration of various types of crimes associated with, say, drugs and alcoholism.  We know also that young people without jobs feel frustrated. There is at least one person whose job it is to deal with young people coming before our courts who has said that in his experience the vast majority of them are functionally illiterate, have had a very poor education and that while not in all cases, by and large, they come from families dependent on social welfare.</P>
    <P>If one takes all of these elements into account, relating them back to what this House is doing in regard to the organisation of society, the economy or whatever, in my view one sees a contradiction between introducing a progressive Bill &mdash; such as one requiring young people who are convicted to undertake community work &mdash; while at the same time making very little effort to solve the problems which brought those people into conflict with the law or before the courts in the first place.</P>
    <P>I might refer again &mdash; and I make no apology for having referred to this a number of times previously &mdash; to Government policy in relation to education.  For example, the educational cutbacks will directly hit schools in working-class areas, as will the number of remedial teachers they are allowed to have and the number of guidance counsellors they are entitled to have.  If those kinds of service are not provided in schools in working-class areas there is nothing surer but that there will be a greater number of young people on our streets involved in vandalism and petty crime.  There is very little evidence of a global approach to the solution of these problems.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is to be successful in itself the Government must be prepared to provide the necessary back-up in terms of finance and personnel.  Otherwise it will be merely another meaningless gesture. In my view the existing probation service is grossly overworked.  Indeed the report referred to by Deputy Keating indicates that at the end of 1981 there <Col N="1382" /> were 57 probation and welfare officers assigned to probation and related duties in various District Courts and that during that year also a total of 1,465 cases were referred to them.  Another point is that it is left totally to the discretion of the judge as to whether he asks for a report from a probation officer.  Under the provisions of this Bill I understand a report has to be requested before a community service order can be made.  We believe it should be obligatory on the court to get probation officers' reports in certain other cases also.  Obviously this would entail an increased workload and personnel.  I believe the increased workload for provisions of the Bill will require additional staff anyway.  I should like the Minister to indicate when replying, whether those additional staff will be provided.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but I have a number of reservations about it.  For example, there should be no question of community service orders being used as a source of cheap labour, thus denying people legitimate job opportunities, leading perhaps to further unemployment. Experience in other areas, such as the work experience programme, has shown that in certain instances people in full-time permanent employment have been made redundant in order to make way for people on work experience programmes. That kind of anomaly must be guarded against in implementing the provisions of this Bill.  On the other hand, there is no point in giving offenders meaningless tasks such as digging holes and filling them in, or cleaning up graveyards, as happens in certain circumstances under the Youth Employment Agency.  The Bill gives no indication of what types of tasks the Minister has in mind although in his introductory remarks he did mention community services by way of assisting voluntary organisations.  The Bill gives him power to make regulations in this regard.  The Minister should spell out clearly what he has in mind here.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill leave it totally to the discretion of the court as to whether it should apply custodial sentence or utilise the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1383" /> In my view it is unfortunate that some of the justices who grace our courts adopt attitudes, which they have expressed, and which in turn have been reported by the media, which would be more appropriate to the last century than to present-day Ireland.  For that reason I should like to see a provision in this Bill that certain offences would be required to be deal with by way of community service orders. Probably it is worth looking at the system obtaining in Scotland from which we could learn much.</P>

      <P>: 36 applications have been received to date for assistance from the funds allocated to the Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs.  The total allocation to this office for 1983 is £110,000.  On the basis of the applications made, £75,000 was granted to the Council for the Status of Women, which represents 39 women's organisations and 10 voluntary organisations engaged in development and support activities for women were assisted to the sum of £14,300.  Most of these organisations are involved in helping single parents.  This brings the total funds assigned to date to £89,300.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The applications received have been made either directly to my Department <Col N="1384" /> or through the Council for the Status of Women.  It is not possible to quantify exactly the total amount requested as this is not specified in all the requests.  There is no doubt, however, that the applications vastly exceed the resources available.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the Deputy that the remaining limited funds will be allocated by my Department before the end of the year to other developmental and support activities for women.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>

      <P>£2.7 million, which had been contractually committed before I came to office, has been provided in the 1983 Estimates for the project.  This will bring the total expenditure on the project so far to £9.3 million all provided by the State.  The current estimate for the further cost of completing the airport is £4.2 million, making a total of £13.5 million.</P>

    <Title>Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed) .</Title>
    <P>Question again propsed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: Before the adjournment I was making the point that the courts should as a matter of right request probation officers' reports on offenders in a much wider number of instances than is the case at present.  I made the point that the system in Scotland is worth looking at and we could learn a great deal from it.  I understand that where a court is required to seek from a probation officer a social inquiry report for all offenders under 16 years of age, for all offenders under 21 years of age if a custodial sentence is appropriate and for all first-time offenders over 21 years of age.  I understand that similar schemes apply in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another point in relation to the Bill before us is that it can be applied only to people of 16 years or over.  At present children can leave school at 15 and begin to work at that age.  Obviously, quite a number of the people who appear before <Col N="1457" /> our courts are under 16 years of age.  We should take a look at how the scheme will operate.  The Bill should apply to those of 15 years or over rather than 16 or over. However, it may be that the scheme should work for a period as proposed and the matter could be considered again.</P>
    <P>The final point to be repeated over and over again is that the Bill will achieve nothing other than to waste the time of the Dáil if it is not backed up with adequate finance and resources, particularly personnel.  It is clear that if the scheme is to succeed it will require a high degree of supervision and a high ratio of probation officers to offenders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>: Like other speakers, I welcome the Bill before the House which provides for an alternative method of dealing with offenders brought before the courts.  Before speaking on the Bill I would like to say a few brief words in relation to matters raised generally by other speakers and in particular in relation to the certain implications that the Bill before the House is this Government's answer to the increased crime rate and the increased problems in our cities and towns and to various problems that have arisen and escalated in recent times. Speakers opposite have tried to imply in their speeches that this is our answer to the problems.  Of course it is not.  It is important that we bring in a more extensive Criminal Justice Bill and I understand that such has been in the course of preparation during the previous few Administrations.  I hope it will be introduced as soon as possible.  Various Administrations are to blame for the delay but when a very comprehensive Bill is being introduced a great deal of discussion has to take place first.  Each Minister, and we have had several in the last 18 months to two years, wants to examine it before it is brought before the House. As I said, I hope this Bill will be introduced as soon as possible, preferably this session.  I understand it is in the final stages of preparation and the sooner it is introduced the better.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is an admirable measure which will give justices an alternative way <Col N="1458" /> of dealing with offenders in certain cases. It is important to remember that the community order will be appropriate for certain offences only.  Obviously there are certain offences in respect of which I, and I do not think any other Member of this House, could not accept that such an order would be appropriate.  Murder, manslaughter, armed robbery and various types of assault, with or without deadly weapons, particularly assaults on old people, terrorising people, premeditated robberies, robbery with violence, attacking people in their homes and so on, come to mind, and the people who commit these crimes should pay the most severe penalty.</P>
    <P>The comprehensive Bill should look at sentencing with a view to bringing certain sentences into line and having uniform minimum sentences in some cases.  Naturally certain discretionary powers will be retained by the courts but it is important that in certain cases minimum sentences should be imposed.  For certain offences people should realise they must serve a minimum sentence and that they will not go free before that time is served.</P>
    <P>If this scheme is introduced there will be certain benefits for the offenders, the community and the prison administration. I will deal briefly with these points. Many people get into trouble at some time in their lives, but they should not have to suffer for one mistake.  If it is not too serious a crime, the lives of the offenders should not be disrupted, for example, by losing their jobs.  A term of imprisonment can have a serious effect on the lives of the offender's family and friends.  If a community order could be made this would benefit the offender and his family and friends.</P>
    <P>The service provided by these offenders can benefit the community. This can take many different forms, which can be explored when this legislation has been in force for some time. Youth clubs, children's groups, the elderly and handicapped can be helped under these orders.  Naturally these people should not be used as cheap labour, but if these offenders can help in certain areas they should be encouraged to do so.  These offenders can be helped <Col N="1459" /> to realise that what they did was wrong but they are now getting an opportunity to repay the community for the wrongs they committed.  This could be a more suitable option for the courts, although prison is a necessary institution for certain types of offences.  If a judge has the option of sending an offender to prison or making an order for somebody to do so many hours of community work, in the long term this could be very helpful because a prison sentence could be detrimental to his future.</P>
    <P>When this legislation comes into operation it will help prison administration but it should not be seen as the answer to our overcrowded prisons, and people who should be in jail should not be roaming the streets or let out of prison early because of overcrowding.  There is an obligation on society and on the Government to ensure that, if people have to be detained for a certain length of time, having committed various types of offences, and particularly the serious offences to which I have already referred, prisons are available to detain them.  The fact that prisons are overcrowded or that there is a lack of resources should not be given as an excuse.  This Bill will be of assistance, but it should not be seen as the answer in itself.</P>
    <P>When we are discussing a community service order, particularly in relation to minimum and maximum hours, we will have to see exactly how it will operate. As we all know, certain jobs can be done very quickly or very slowly, depending on how active the individual is.  If good work is being done, even if the full number of hours have not been worked the offender should be deemed to have made his contribution.  If a person who is holding down a job is also helping in a club and attending regularly, this should be deemed to be satisfactory rather than insisting on the specified number of hours.  We should consider that the offender has made his contribution over a period of time and that the job has been completed.</P>
    <P>We should have some type of training scheme.  Under the present legislation people who are serving sentences have <Col N="1460" /> the opportunity to get training in various areas.  That should be part of this scheme too.  A person who has a job would hope to do his community service outside his working hours, but a person who has just left school and who may not have been trained for anything should be trained so that the time spent on community service will be of use to him or her subsequently. It is important that training should be made available and that minimum skills should be taught, particularly to people who are very young and who have never had a chance.  This may be partly the reason why they are in trouble.  This aspect should be looked at.  It is essential that people who have no basic education should be given a certain amount of education while they are performing a community service.  Otherwise they may find themselves in trouble again.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see what has happened in other countries.  In America traffic offenders and in Germany young people with alcohol problems or drug problems have been ordered to help out in various ways.  The experience in those countries should be considered. Obviously a trial period will be necessary. We will have to monitor how the Bill is working.  The provision of community services in certain areas may be quite difficult.  If such work is not available locally the offender should be able to go to another district to do this work rather than go to prison.  This is another area which must be looked at.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned probation and welfare officers who are doing a great job with limited resources.  Obviously the increase in crime and robberies is partly due to social problems and a lack of facilities in certain areas.  We have to look at the role of the Garda and the community groups.  Years ago the Garda in an area knew the various toughs and were able to talk to them, and Johnny or Paddy knew he could go a certain distance only, and after that he was in trouble.  Now that the Garda are overworked and resources are not plentiful, the role of liaison officers is very important.  In my own constituency I know many probation and welfare officers who have done tremendous work in linking up with young people, taking <Col N="1461" /> them in hand, and making sure that they are not idle but getting involved in various interests such as sports or other leisure activities.  Parents do not always know where their children are but parents, the police and all sections of the community must play their part in the prevention of crime.  I hope the escalation in the crime rate can be stopped.  Crime will be reduced over a period of time by a clear commitment from all concerned.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  Certain aspects will have to be worked out in finer detail. Certain matters will have to be regulated to meet the needs in various areas.  It is only a part of the measures to deal with the overall situation and it should be seen as that.  I hope the major Criminal Justice Bill will come before the House shortly. I hope that any teething problems with regard to the Bill before the House can be sorted out particularly during the first months and years of the operation of this measure.</P>

      <P>: With previous speakers I welcome the Bill.  There are a number of factors that are crucial to its success. It is most important that the Bill be seen by the public as a genuine effort by the Minister, and by everyone in this House because we have a responsibility to the public, to tackle the problem of crime.  It has been said that prison is not the answer to many of the problems but I am not sure that the public would agree with that.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we live in difficult times.  Drugs, the excessive use of alcohol, and unemployment are contributing factors to the many difficulties that exist.  We must be seen as making a genuine effort to tackle the problem of crime and we must be very careful how we present this Bill to the public.  If a person who has been the victim of a crime is told that the offender is coming back the following week to cut the grass or to paint his house, his reaction might be most unfavourable.  Probably that person would not want the offender within five miles of his house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda Síochána, the courts, and the prison system have important roles to <Col N="1462" /> play.  I know many gardaí who are frustrated with the present set-up in the legal system.  They apprehend offenders who are brought to court but frequently they are let out on bail and they commit the same kind of crime.  Last week in Cork 14 times in the space of 24 hours young offenders in an untaxed and uninsured car were stopped and apprehended by gardaí.  They were brought before a Peace Commissioner but were released on bail and they committed the same type of crime.  They drove at excessive speeds in built-up areas, a danger to life, with gardaí following in squad cars.  All of this is a big joke to the offenders.  Unless they fear the law and have some respect for it we will not make any progress.</P>
    <P>The role of the courts is most important. There has been a tremendous lack of consistency in the way cases are dealt with in the courts.  During the past few months I have been reading in the newspapers reports of cases and I have been studying cases dealt with by district justices and I have found that there has been a considerable inconsistency in the sentences and fines imposed.  The public are well aware of what is happening.  They have little confidence in us and in the judicial system.  They consider we do not have control over law and order.  We are the legislators and we are the people given the responsibility to run the country. Law and order is of the utmost importance. I know that unemployment is often given as the main reason for crime but I do not accept that.  Some of the most law-abiding citizens are unemployed but they go about their business in a normal fashion.  We must be very careful that people do not regard the approach of the Government as favouring the offender. I know the Minister has heard remarks to this effect also.  We seem to be bending over backwards to make better facilities available for offenders in our prisons and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The probation officers will have an important role to play with regard to the measure before the House.  At the moment they are overloaded with work. I should like to know from the Minister if it is intended to provide additional finance and staff to oversee the work of <Col N="1463" /> the offenders in the community?  Will the Minister elaborate exactly on how it is intended to act in this area?  We do not know the numbers involved.  I think there is a huge financial cost involved which has not been spelled out.  On paper the Bill looks well but the public may regard it as a cynical move by the politicians. Because we have failed to tackle crime they may consider we are taking the easy way out.  We are building nice comfortable prisons for offenders but where accommodation is not available for offenders the public may consider we are taking the easy way out by allowing them out among the community.  I hope what is being proposed will be a success but I am also aware of the feelings of people. I live in a built-up area and I see the crimes of vandalism that are taking place at night.  I have my reservations about the measure now proposed.</P>
    <P>We have very clever lawyers and people before the courts are allowed out on technicalities.  This area will have to be tackled.  Laws are made to protect people and action should be taken against offenders.  If we do not have the confidence of the public generally what we are proposing here will be a failure.  We must explain to the people how we will cope with the situation and we must spell out our plans to deal with offenders.  There are many unanswered questions and I should like the Minister to elaborate on the matter.  I wish the Bill every success but I have serious reservations about it. The Garda Síochána must feel they have the confidence of the people and the support of the politicians.  They must act in the knowledge that they have the full backing of the law which is not the situation at the moment.  Laws are quoted to gardaí when they apprehend people.  Last week I spoke to some gardaí who told me they were totally frustrated with the present situation.  Their role seems to be eroded each day.  It is commonplace for criminals to make obscene signs at them. Last week young offenders were arrested in Cork.  They are taken to the Bridewell, were charged but were released on bail and when they came out of the court some of their friends were waiting for <Col N="1464" /> them in an untaxed car.  They were back in the Bridewell within two hours having been arrested for stealing cars.</P>
    <P>The Bill is worthwhile and I hope it will have the confidence of the community. However, there are many unanswered questions.  There are muggings, housebreaking, rape and excessive use of drugs and alcohol.  Drugs and drink are contributory factors, because many crimes are being committed by people under their influence.</P>
    <P>What are we doing about the port of Cork?  Are any officials covering that port in connection with ships coming from South America, the Middle East&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I appreciate the concern of the Deputy for law and order problems in Cork city, but he should stay within the Bill.  I would be grateful for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>: The success of this Bill depends on many factors.  We must recognise that there is no use in polite talking in this House on the part of Deputies and the Minister.  We must be serious in our treatment of this whole problem.</P>
      <P>This Bill is a genuine attempt to tackle a very serious problem, but if the gardaí are not confident in dealing with crime and the courts do not face up to their responsibility in being consistent in their administration of the law, this legislation will not be a success.</P>
      <P>We have been accused of not taking the appropriate measures in ports, and particularly the port of Cork with regard to drugs coming from South America in ships which do not visit other ports, leading to drugs importation to Northern Ireland and Britain.  Unless we take measures to deal with this illegal imporation of drugs we are not serious about the whole problem.  There should be extra customs officials patrolling the ports, particularly the port of Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the Minister's Bill and the confidence of the Dáil in it.  I regret that this Bill is titled the Criminal Justice Bill.  It should be called the Community Offenders' Bill, or some <Col N="1465" /> such name, not giving it this grandiose title.  Before the year is out, and possibly before the end of this term, we will need to take another look at the whole area of law reform.  Harsher legislation will be brought before the House at a later stage. For that reason the public should be clear in the knowledge that this legislation is a step in a series of steps which the Government intend taking this year to deal with the enormous crime problems.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill because it has a specific contribution to make.  Crime in Dublin is so bad that public representatives are attending public meetings now at an average of one a week.  In one particular week I attended three public meetings.  The situation is so serious that it is difficult for public representatives to give people hope anymore.  This Bill is welcomed because it is an innovation. There are new ideas in it and, taken together with the legislation which I hope will come later in the year &mdash; and the sooner the better &mdash; it will help to strengthen the law against those who constantly offend against the community.</P>
      <P>I ask will this Bill mean that more space will be available within our prisons for accommodating those guilty of more serious crimes?  One of the present problems is that people are being released on bail, sometimes after a very short period of imprisonment.  Will this Bill dealing with minor offenders free prison space for accommodating those criminals who, when on bail, constantly offend against the community and who are now operating in an organised way?  If the legislation has that additional effect, it will be a bonus.  I would like to hear the Minister's comments on that aspect.</P>
      <P>We must go much further than this Bill goes.  Because further legislation is anticipated, there is no need for amendments on this Bill.  Were we not anticipating legislation it would be necessary to put down amendments to the Bill to deal, for instance, with the question of the Judges' Rules, the right to silence, consecutive versus concurrent sentencing and a number of other similar areas, such as crime being committed while people are on bail.  A number of such areas will have to be considered later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1466" /> Before we give the Garda these new powers, how have they accounted for their present powers?  Of late, the answer is &mdash; not very well.  I give notice that the matter which I intend to pursue until I see real efforts being made to attend to it is that the Garda have not accounted for their present powers to any great extent.  I do not want to write a <i>carte blanche</i> for any Government agency to take on all sorts of powers if they are not accountable to this House for those powers at some stage.  To that extent it is important that whatever legislation is being passed, be it this Criminal Justice Bill or later legislation, we must install some form of review of the Garda, on how they are using the powers given to them, how efficiently they are managing their resources and what they are doing to deal with the present problems.</P>
    <P>The problem of crime facing the country will not be solved by this Bill or by any legislation.  It has reached the stage where politicians patronise the Garda force to such an extent that if a minority of them are criticised, no matter how constructively, or helpfully, people are taken aback because they feel that the Garda Síochána should be on a pedestal and not criticised.  I do not agree with that thinking.  I respect the majority of the Garda and expect them to do a decent job.  However, the minority of gardaí who are not doing so can expect one public representative, at least, to pursue reform of the management structure of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I want this House to have a committee on crime to which the Garda should be asked to account from time to time, or at least annually, for their activities on these matters.  It is a great pity that some things which happened in the recent past did happen.  At least they have brought to light some of the existing difficulties.  The sooner we really tackle the problem by way of this type of legislation and by way of giving members of the Garda promotion on the basis of merit alone and on no other basis, the better it will be for the community.  The problem is so big that no one thinks that the passing of this legislation in isolation will solve it.  It simply will not.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1467" /> On the other side of the coin we must reach a stage where complaints against the Garda are properly and thoroughly investigated, which is not happening at the moment.  As one public representative, I am entirely dissatisfied with the complaints procedure at present used within the Garda Síochána.  It is not satisfactory and is not dealing competently with complaints.</P>
    <P>Dublin city has a very big problem and perhaps also the rest of the country, which will be helped by this legislation. Certain people commit offences and are amateurish enough to get caught but they are not likely to commit an offence again. Their fate depends on which judge they come before.  God help them if they come before certain judges and God help the community if they come before others.  A young man may commit an offence in one wild outbreak and may never wish to commit a crime again but we take him out of the community, imprison him and make a hardened criminal of him.  This Bill, in getting people involved in community services, can help by keeping these people within the community doing services for the community, thus keeping them out of the mainstream of crime.  In many cases people who were guilty of certain minor crimes would not continue a life of crime if they could be kept away from the monsters and the mainstream of criminals running around cities.  For that reason the provisions of this Bill &mdash; forming a part of a plan &mdash; have a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>We must remember that we will not get anywhere with the elimination of crime unless a joint approach is adopted, unless all of us in this House are committed to the forces of law and order, ensuring that they have the facilities and power to deal with these problems.  But we must also ensure that they are answerable for that power and not an authority answerable to nobody.  That is not something I would tolerate.  I will vote for the strongest legislation introduced here; I will support this Bill without difficulty but I want to ensure that any powers given are accounted for to this House.  Hopefully, with the development of the committee <Col N="1468" /> system, we shall have a committee on crime.  Until such a joint approach is adopted progress will not be made. I am not speaking only of these offenders, many of whom commit offences because they are organised by godfathers who &ldquo;case&rdquo; buildings for them beforehand, who tell them where the goods are, who collect the goods from them afterwards, and dispose of them for them.  It is the innocent, impressionable offender who commits the crime on their behalf. We must organise ourselves and realise that there is a serious crime situation obtaining in this city.  There are indications that there is a north side and south side crime organisation.  Unless we organise ourselves and take on these people, unless we are serious and have a joint approach, law and order will break down completely.  We must notify these people that we shall not let law and order breakdown, that we shall take them on, that the provisions of this Bill are but a part of the machinery with more to follow, and the sooner the better.</P>
    <P>Let us not stop at that.  Let us pursue it further.  Let us set up that committee on crime.  Let us review the situation continuously.  Let us hold these people to whom we are giving power accountable for the exercise of that power.  Let us ensure that they do not give any encouragement to the criminal element by abusing that power.  Let us ensure that the people to whom we are giving this power will get out there, harness community goodwill instead of remaining aloof from the community and, on occasion, being disdainful towards the community.</P>
    <P>If it means taking on the criminals it may mean also taking on the Garda representative bodies.  If that is necessary then that is what we must do.  We must get to the heart of this problem and sort it out once and for all.  I am sick and tired listening to constituents, individually and collectively, week after week complaining about the problems obtaining, people who are afraid to leave their houses. During the last three elections I visited many old people who had latches on their doors, something never heard of ten years ago.  I did not grow up in a community in which people had to put bolts <Col N="1469" /> on their doors and I do not see why anybody else should have to grow up in such a community.  I say to the people in the Department of Justice, to the Garda Síochána, that we are taking no more, that they are going to have to be answerable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have been very lenient with the Deputy but he has strayed somewhat from the Bill and I should be glad if he would revert to the Bill itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: You have been very helpful, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  The Bill before us could be strengthened in certain respects.  Since it is community-orientated perhaps the Minister would consider incorporating a section dealing with community magistrates so that we would have magistrates in local communities to preside over offences committed locally, people who understand local problems, who live locally and who encounter the difficulties people face at first hand.  That is not happening at present. Many of our Judiciary do not reside anywhere near the main crime areas and therefore are not in a position to understand the difficulties people face.  Such locally appointed magistrates need not necessarily be lawyers but perhaps advised by lawyers, people who would preside over magistrate courts to deal with community offenders, people who live in the area and have first-hand knowledge of the difficulties experienced.  One of our problems is that very few of our judges come from what might be termed working-class backgrounds or live in what might be termed working-class or similar type areas.  In that way they fail to understand the difficulties some people experience in their homes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might pose the following question to the Minister to which she might reply: what will happen if a person who commits an offence, subject to the provisions of this Bill, who does not carry out the sentence or the community service he or she has had imposed by the courts?  For example, at the time of sentencing, will the court also say that in the event of this work not being done an automatic sentence of incarceration for so long will <Col N="1470" /> follow?  Or, for example, will it be necessary to charge the offender again before the courts?  The best way to deal with this would be to say to the person at the time of sentencing, &ldquo;If you do not carry out the community service you are hereby sentenced to carry out you will automatically serve a sentence of a fixed period in prison&rdquo;.  It would be helpful if that provision were incorporated in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill but it is a pity that we did not avail of this opportunity to involve the community further in local matters by way of community and Garda joint councils.  Perhaps we might consider incorporating such a section in the legislation to come before the House later this year.  However, in so far as this Bill constitutes a step in the fight against crime it is a welcome and positive one.  I hope it will not be too long before the other necessary steps follow, balanced steps, by which I mean not merely legislation but accountability also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>: Many things have been said already in the course of this debate with which I agree.  I welcome this Bill. I first became interested in this type of action to deal with the problems of crime, particularly with young offenders, when as a member of my local authority, Dublin County Council, I visited Craigavon on a goodwill visit to talk to the people there, the elected representatives, and members of the public about the kinds of problems and advantages involved in setting up a new town.  We visited a public community centre opened by the local authority there.  In fact it was more than a community centre, it was a community project which included a community centre for passive recreation. It comprised also a pets corner to all intent and purpose.  As we were shown around we were introduced to two young lads, about 16 or 17 years of age, who were cleaning out the little compounds where there were housed lambs, goats, hens and other small type animals.  It was explained to us by the officer showing us around that these boys were actually carrying out a community service.  Apparently they had been apprehended some <Col N="1471" /> time back for acts of cruelty to these same animals and the judge, in a most enlightened way, had ordered that these boys, as punishment, would take on themselves a certain number of hours working in the community centre in which they had committed these acts of cruelty and violence. That had actually taken place about two years before we visited that centre.  The two boys in question had taken such an interest in the job, in the community service they had been ordered to do by the courts, that ever since, voluntarily, they had been coming back a couple of times a week to continue the job.  That was tremendously enlightening and encouraging for me.  Here were two boys who had gone wrong but who had seen the folly of their ways and had taken on themselves a service which had helped build them into more mature people.</P>
      <P>This Bill was mooted when the Tánaiste was Minister of State.  At that time I welcomed the proposal to introduce such legislation but it is legislation which cannot of itself stem the enormous problems of crime.  However, the Bill should be considered as a forward-looking piece of legislation not only by Members of the Oireachtas but by the public in general and by those who are working in the area of law and order, the Garda, prison officers and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The introduction of the Bill should prompt all of us to concentrate on the huge increase in crime in all areas.  The greatest disruption to our day-to-day lives appears to be caused by petty crime which is hitting all sections of the community and all age groups from very young children out playing and whose playthings may be stolen from them right through to teenagers who may be the victims of muggings by some of their own peers.  But perhaps those who suffer most from these criminal acts are the elderly. We need only think of the late Mr. Ben Dunne who was admitted to hospital immediately after being mugged.  We may not be aware of the effects of some of these acts of vandalism on the elderly in particular.  We may all have heard of cases in which people have been injured badly during attacks on them but there <Col N="1472" /> are no statistics to indicate the effects of such attacks on the lives of people.  On two occasions my car window was broken and my handbag stolen and although I am a lot younger than many of those who have been attacked, these incidents had a very bad effect on me.  I am prepared to hazard a guess that some elderly people have died as a direct result of such attacks.</P>
    <P>The kind of petty crime that is so prevalent in our society today is having far-reaching effects on the quality of life.  We must ask why the crime rate has escalated so much in the past ten years.  There are those who say that the reason is the lack of social planning, of good housing, of proper education facilities and so on, while there are those who argue that such a premise is only an easy way out for the criminal.  I do not think either argument is correct.  It is said, too, that the reason lies to some extent in the situation of the severe economic pressure from which we are all suffering, but that is a worldwide problem.  In the thirties also people were living in a situation of severe economic depression and did not have anything like the material goods that even some of the poorest in our society have today but the level of crime then was not anywhere nearly as high as it is now.  One of my constituents suggested to me that the reason for the massive increase in crime is greed, that all of us have become too materialistic and that if we want something we cannot afford we will go ahead and get it anyhow, regardless of how we get it.  Another premise is that there is supreme confidence on the part of the criminal that he will not be caught.  This premise is one that should be examined because if there is any foundation for it we must ascertain what it is.  I do not think the problem lies in a basic lack of respect for the Garda but undoubtedly the lessening of foot patrols on the streets in the past few years has not been helpful. I am glad that foot patrols are now being increased.  There may have been the impression among petty criminals particularly that so long as they were fast enough and there was no garda in sight they could get away with their criminal acts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1473" /> We might ask ourselves how many of us break the law in minor ways simply because we reckon we will not be detected?  For instance, how many of us are prepared to park on a double yellow line if there is no traffic warden in sight? Each of us has a role to play in bringing about greater respect for the laws of the land.</P>
    <P>In conjunction with this Bill we must consider the whole area of policing.  The question of the availability of Garda stations must be considered.  The infrastructure in Dublin city in particular has not kept pace with the enormous growth in population in those areas and I am not talking merely of the provision of road lighting and schools.  I am aware that there is a committee who are considering continuously the whole question of the provision of Garda stations.  I have made the point on many occasions that the location of a Garda station in any area will not necessarily result in a reduction in crime in that area but it is a deterrent. When building large new housing areas we must simultaneously provide whatever infrastructure is necessary to deal with the influx to that area.  The provision of community facilities, for instance, is helpful in forming the characters of children at a very early age so that later they do not embark on crime which some of them may consider to be merely a game. All of us who are Members of the Oireachtas or of local authorities must have regard to this whole question of the provision of adequate infrastructures in the planning of any area where large numbers of people are to live.  I agree with Deputy Mitchell about the importance of the involvement of the community in ensuring that this legislation will not be merely another Act on the Statute Book which will not be relevant to today and which will not have the effect that we intend it to have.</P>
    <P>The best chance this system has of succeeding is to involve the community.  I have no doubt that the community will recognise that they have a role to play in this.  The community must be involved whether by way of community policing or in identifying areas where offenders <Col N="1474" /> can be given work.  We must be careful not to permit the courts to instruct offenders to work for local authorities only.  They must be sent to carry out work for community groups, voluntary agencies such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Simon Community or for residents' associations.  If the community is not involved in identifying work areas the system will not succeed.</P>
    <P>The Garda have a vital role in ensuring that the scheme works.  At meetings of the Malahide Residents' Association we invite the local Garda sergeant to talk to us.  That is one way of ensuring that he is involved in the day to day happenings in the community.  I understand that Garda sergeants in most communities are willing to liaise with community groups and because of such involvement the image that existed of &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; will disappear completely.  The local police station is as relevant to the local community as shops, schools and bus services.  I hope local police sergeants will explain to community groups the working of community service orders so that the Minister will be supported in his efforts.</P>
    <P>We have not been told the type of crime that will result in community service orders being imposed.  Under the Act dealing with liter the maximum fine is £500 and it stands to reason that many people convicted under that Act will not be able to pay a £500 or a fine of £50. A judge should have the power to give offenders under that Act a community service job to perform.  The best way to learn a lesson for an offence under that Act is to be made pick up litter or clean roadside ditches.  A similar order should be made against those found guilty of petty vandalism.  Such acts cost Dublin County Council an enormous amount of money annually.  Parks are vandalised daily and by young children in many cases.  I am aware that under the Bill orders can only be made against offenders over 16 years of age but in the case of vandalism on community property offenders should be made repair the damage they caused whether it is planting trees or shrubs.</P>
    <P>Many of the Bills that have passed through this House were not worth the <Col N="1475" /> paper they were printed on because the requirements necessary to carry them out were not provided.  In this case I hope the Minister ensures that the terms of the Bill can be implemented.  There is little point in a judge sentencing an offender to 160 hours of community service if the necessary sympathethic and enlightened officials are not available to ensure that the order is carried out.  Unless provision is made for staff we are wasting time passing this Bill.  The necessary personnel must be recruited to ensure that the service orders are carried out to the full. There are many provisions in the Bill to cover cases where the order is not carried out but we should try to ensure that fines are not imposed because that would defeat the purpose of the legislation.  The idea in imposing an order on a young person is to try to help that person understand that there is another way of getting satisfaction out of their daily life.  It is not just a question of punishment.  We hope that as a result of this scheme we will get young men like those I met in Craigavon who, having carried out the work they were ordered to do as a punishment, returned to the centre to mind young animals as an act of love.  We must ensure that the orders help the young people involved.</P>
    <P>Before sentencing young people to carry out these orders judges should consider whether the order can be carried out.  Special consideration must be given to young people who do not have a fixed abode because it will be difficult to ensure that such people carry out the community work.  I do not know what the answer to that problem is but we nust investigate the possibility of providing housing and so on for such young people.  It is possible that some people in community would be willing to house those young offenders while they were carrying out the community work.  The Minister should look at that and other matters before the legislation is passed.  We do not want blatant flaws in the legislation before it gets off the ground.  I hope the Minister will consider the matters I have raised.  When a crime is committed in an area we are a little quick in blaming those living in itinerant <Col N="1476" /> settlements and so on.  Recently serious acts of terror and vandalism occurred in Coolock and the local paper carried a story about them.  However, the itinerant settlement committee of Dublin County Council felt obliged to write to that newspaper pointing out that they did not like the inference that automatically it was assumed that those acts were carried out by itinerant children from a certain area.  We have all been guilty of jumping to conclusions as to the perpetrators of crime, assuming when we see a group of young people that they are up to no good.  It is easy to fall into that trap and we must be careful not to victimise young people.  I have three young boys and there are times when one sees them whispering and giggling and one wonders what they are up to.  We must be careful not to blame young people for crimes which they may not have committed.</P>
    <P>This Bill is concerned with communication between young people and those with more experience.  I make a fervent plea to parents, members of residents' associations and voluntary groups to welcome this Bill and help by making constructive suggestions.  The Minister raised this matter in his speech and said he was open to any proposals.  I appeal to people to play a role in making this legislation effective and I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have no doubt that all Members will welcome this legislation.  It comes at a time when there is widespread concern about the escalation of violence, particularly in urban areas.  The previous speaker referred to problems on the north side of Dublin, which I also represent. In recent months there has been an increasing breakdown in law and order to such an extent that many people are talking seriously about vigilante groups. During the past few days there has been some controversy regarding the setting up of such groups but many people feel they must do something to protect their families and their property and, perhaps, their lives.  Crime is increasing and we as legislators must ask what we can do to bring about a reduction in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is unfortunate that we are seeing vast <Col N="1477" /> cutbacks in the prison service and in Garda overtime at a time when greater vigilance is required on the part of the Garda and the authorities.  While this legislation will be welcomed by many we must not feel that we now have a solution to the problem, a new type of punishment for young crime-doers.  It has been emphasised that young people before becoming involved in community work must give their full consent.  If a young person refuses to become involved in such work or having started it decides not to continue, what then will be the position?</P>
    <P>There is a strongly held opinion that a harder line should be adopted by the authorities.  I do not blame people for adopting that attitude because during the past few years we have treated this problem with kid gloves and we are entitled to ask what this approach has achieved. Has it eased the situation?  Has it reduced crime in any way?  Figures published a short time ago show an increase of about 37 per cent in the crime rate in Dublin during the first three months of this year. This is an alarming figure and it is against this background that we must consider the attempt in this legislation to contribute to a reduction in crime.  In my view this Bill will not make such a contribution. It is a continuation of the &ldquo;softly, softly&rdquo; kid glove approach to crime and crime-doers.  People are asking what action is being taken by the Government and the Garda to reduce the extent of crime.</P>
    <P>In recent times gardaí have received bogus calls to certain areas and then have been stoned and assaulted and their vehicles destroyed.  In some parts of Dublin the full complement of Garda cars and vans has been put out of action by vandals.  The Garda have a difficult enough job without being openly taunted by people and lured into situations where they may suffer bodily harm.  These incidents happen so frequently that they no longer receive wide coverage in the newspapers but it is not unusual to see a short item in the morning papers to the effect that gardaí in a certain area were attacked the previous evening and the squad car put out of action.  That is the type of <Col N="1478" /> society we have today and we are in a sorry state.  This Bill will not do anything to alleviate the problem.</P>
    <P>There are certain types of people who will benefit by being involved in community work and this can only be good for the community and for the young people themselves.  Last year a number of people were brought out from Mountjoy to work in groups on various local projects and this scheme worked so well that it gave a lead to the type of legislation before us.  I might add that it was prepared under the previous Government but we are not discussing a political issue.  We are all in agreement with any action taken to alleviate crime. There are many areas in Dublin where community work, such as is envisaged in the Bill, could be very advantageous. Very often there are housing estates in a most untidy condition and people could be put to work on them.  Our hospitals, old people's homes and old people's estates are all places where this type of community activity could be very beneficial for everybody concerned.</P>
    <P>It has very often been emphasised that not enough onus has been placed on the parents as far as crime and vandalism is concerned.  I appreciate it would be very difficult to hold certain parents, who may not have the means, financially responsible for damage caused by their offspring. Nevertheless, we should consider something along those lines also because there is a very apparent lack of parental control at the moment.  Young children are left roaming the streets all day and even all night in some cases.  Their parents often have no idea where they are. The parents are perhaps more at fault in those cases than the children.  Some onus should be put on the parents in situations like that because we have extensive damage, amounting to thousands of pounds, being caused on an annual basis by vandalism and the taxpayers are being asked to foot the bill year after year.  One hour's vandalism can cost a local authority as much as £20,000 to £30,000.  We have known of single acts of vandalism which have caused fire damage amounting to £1 million.  In cases like that the parents <Col N="1479" /> walk away scot free.  While we must all the time look at what can be done to bring about a situation where not alone will young people be punished for those offences but where they will be educated to appreciate that there is much more to life than just going around vandalising property, the parents must be responsible in some way.  I would like to see the parents being asked to carry some responsibility.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill will be helpful but at the same time we must not feel that it is the answer to all our problems.  The Minister made that quite clear in his contribution this morning.  This is a small start and we must consider what other areas should be looked at.  We must use every possible resource for the protection of lives, property and the upholding of the law.  There are too many people who have come to accept that the way to get through life successfully and profitably is to break the law and to take anything they like.  It is up to the authorities, particularly the legislators, to ensure that adequate legislation is introduced for the protection of people's property and right.  This Bill must be looked at as a very small step in that direction.  I hope the Minister will give urgent consideration to other steps that must be taken to eliminate the almost total breakdown of law and order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would like, as I gather most of the speakers today have done, to welcome the introduction of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill as the first step in our serious tackling of the problems of increasing crime.  It was significant that at last Monday's Barrettstown meeting this ranked with the economic issues as one of the major issues for which the Government would develop long-term, short-term and medium-term plans.  I see this as the first phase in a radical and extensive overhaul of the system of justice in the country which should within three years lead to an improvement in the laws, the court system and, hopefully, a significant improvement in the level of crime.  I see this Bill as a particularly flexible element <Col N="1480" /> of that whole programme which I expect to see included within the next year in an extensive Children's Bill, which will look at the whole question of child care and child custody in the case of child criminals, tackle the problem of children's courts, consider the age of criminal responsibility and set up for the first time in modern Ireland proper and adequate procedures to deal with this growing area of crime and young criminals.  Those criminals are getting younger in recent years.</P>
      <P>I see another element of that attack as the long overdue improvement in the powers of the Garda Síochána and some changes in the laws which have been accepted as necessary by the two previous Governments and which we know are before the Department of Justice at the moment.  I am optimistic, now that the first phase of the economic activity has been got out of the way for this year, that the Government will be able to move rapidly to bring about reform in these areas and that the commitment of community policing, first enunciated by the present Minister for Transport, Deputy Jim Mitchell, supported by the Garda sergeants, will also become a reality. When this whole package is implemented, developed and established it will generally improve our facilities to deal with this growing problem, and bring back the sense of confidence in the Government and in law and order which has been badly shattered in the last few years and has left people feeling very unprotected.</P>
      <P>I disagree with the previous speaker that we have been approaching the problem with kid gloves in the last few years. We have totally failed to tackle the problem. The largest area of growing crime is among children.  Our children's legislation dates back 80 years and is totally inadequate and unsuited to deal with the current problem.  Child criminals are tagged on to the normal criminal system and are dealt with in an environment totally unsuited to their needs or unlikely to lead them to change their ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most common resource available to judges is the use of probation.  We have not given them the facilities to allow <Col N="1481" /> any other sanctions.  We had the experience of a totally erratic Judiciary, the most outrageous example of which was in relation to a recent case where young offenders were involved.</P>
    <P>This first step should be followed by a Children's Bill, improvement of the Garda Síochána and the development of community policing.  If this was done the vigilante movement, which exists in a dangerous form, could be harnessed into a structured and ordered form and be of immense benefit to the community.  This should be undertaken speedily.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a new approach for us and deals with sanctions which may be imposed on people found guilty of various crimes.  The type of crimes for which it could be used will be limited.  We can learn from the experience of other countries. Such a Bill has proved to be successful in Britain where it was introduced not without hitches.  It has been successful in Germany and other countries.  One of its most attractive features is that it gives an opportunity to an offender for constructive activity in the community in a way which does not interfere with his normal training or employment rather than incarcerating him in an institution which would perhaps encourage his criminal tendencies.  The experience in Germany has been that only a tiny percentage of offenders who have done community service work commit further crime.  It compares with the juvenile liaison officer scheme where it is found that the use of the scheme results in a low level of recurrence of crime.  If an offender is dealt with in any other way, such as serving a prison sentence or being involved with the courts, the tendency to return to crime is significantly higher.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill because the experience in other countries shows that it works.  When an offender is charged in a police station and later in court and put into an institution it is commonly accepted that he will meet with hardened criminals and instead of being rehabilitated is confirmed in his criminal techniques.  He is removed from the community, cut off from constructive pursuits and important relationships such as family, friends and so on.  The sanction of community service work will not be <Col N="1482" /> allowed to interfere with a person's employment or education.  Admittedly it will not be suitable for a certain number of prisoners.  Involvement in the scheme is voluntary.  A person who commits a crime must accept the use of this method of sentencing.  This is an important element in that the person must make a choice.  That involves the criminal in a first positive act.  In drug-related crimes the experience has been that people who choose the therapeutic community of Coolmine as an alternative to imprisonment have a high success rate in dealing with their problem.  I can understand that the voluntary element will be controversial and people will ask who will choose it.  The alternative sanction is such that a person who wishes to be rehabilitated will not choose it.  The experience of the Coolmine community would lead one to believe that a well ordered community service operation could be nothing but therapeutic and constructive for those who engage in it.</P>
    <P>Other speakers referred to community involvement.  This is to be welcomed.  It is undoubtedly a challenge to the community. There will be initial fears and worries about its use but these must be overcome.  It is encouraging that the trade unions have given a cautious welcome to the Bill and are willing to meet the Minister.  They would undoubtedly be represented on any committee dealing with the supervision of the Bill.  It is encouraging that they have opened their arms to the Bill as their co-operation is vital.  As Deputy Owen specifically outlined, it is very important that the community as a whole would also open itself to the possibilities of this Bill and look for ways in which they could co-operate for mutual benefit.</P>
    <P>In my own constituency we have had the experience of the existing work programme for prisoners, which is on a different level and involves prisoners who are in closed units being released to do this kind of work.  They built a scout hall which could not have been provided by the community because of lack of funds, even with grants from the State.  There would have been no such facility available for the young people of the area <Col N="1483" /> without this programme.  The quality of work was exceptional and a very good relationship developed between the local community and those involved in the scheme.  This kind of activity is so different from the average prison experience and the possibility of extending it to persons probaly involved in their first minor crimes is very welcome.  In relation to that scheme, it was especially encouraging to be at the informal opening of this hall and to see prisoners attending, some of whom had been released at that stage and some who were still serving sentences. Everyone benefits from this type of development.  In relation to that, it is obviously extremely important that different types of work programmes are established involving community associations, residents' associations, hospitals, semi-State and State organisations who could develop projects suitable for involving young offenders in community services.  Adequate staff should be made available in the probation service to supervise and order them.</P>
    <P>I am very interested in some of the examples the Minister gave this morning of persons with a drink problem working in homes for alcoholics.  Surely a lesson would be learned by a young alcoholic if he saw the long-term effect of alcoholism on other adults.  That sort of imaginative, constructive approach to crime is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The other element that is extremely important is that lives are being interfered with.  Instead of interfering with their careers, homes and marriages because of one mistake, we should adopt this constructive approach which minimally interferes with their lives but which involves an element of retribution and constructive punishment.  Anyone involved in dealing with social problems in our society have found this to be the best approach.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will outline on Committee Stage the thinking behind the limitation on age.  The young offender from 12 to 16 would particularly benefit from this approach and it would be very much more suitable for that age group to be engaged in that kind of work.  I would <Col N="1484" /> like the Minister to reply to that and to consider whether the age could be reduced because, as I mentioned in my opening remarks, this problem of crime committed by the very young is extending and tendencies to drug taking and associated crime are constantly moving down to a younger age group.  I anticipate that the age of criminal responsibility will be looked at in the new Children's Bill and there may be changes, but it will still involve the use of this or a similar Bill to deal with persons who are involved in crimes in this age group.  If there are reasons for this limitation I would like to hear them.  I regret the exclusion of a younger age group as they would benefit from constructive intervention in their lives.</P>
    <P>The importance of tackling this problem in our community in a new way is an answer to the growing spiral of crime, especially in our cities.  Deputy Brady referred to the crime figures released last week.  We must all sit up and take notice of them as they are startling figures, especially in relation to Dublin city.  Like Deputy Brady, I represent a Dublin north side constituency where the unusual feature of the last three or four years has been the way in which criminal activities have turned on the community itself.  One tended in the past to have crimes of property directed against communities, groups and individuals with a great deal of property.  I am not saying that any community deserves to have its property attacked but it is particularly sad to note the development in the last number of years where the poorer communities are being destroyed and attacked by their own people and the little they have is being eroded by the activities of vandals and criminals.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen referred to this problem and said that many young people do not fully appreciate what they are doing.  I am aware that this is an explanation, but there is a double responsibility on the Government to maintain a firm commitment to certain levels of order for the good of the community and the individual, those who are suffering the crime and those who are perpetrating it.  We must also take the kind of action necessary <Col N="1485" /> to break this cycle and try to understand why certain young people, although they are still in a minority, turn their energy to destructive purposes.  We must look to the family environment from which they emerge.  The family is not always to blame &mdash; there will always be the chronic offender &mdash; but many problems stem from perhaps one family in an area who are known to be responsible for crimes in the area.  At present society only steps in either to lock them up or to impose various sanctions on them.  The Bill is particularly attractive because society and the law will intervene in a constructive way which will offer the person an alternative pattern on which to model themselves instead of imposing a sentence on them which involves locking them up with those who have more developed criminal tendencies.</P>
    <P>If this Bill is added to and strengthened by the recommendations of the task force on child care and a new Children's Bill comes before the Dáil in the next session or two, this will be a very important new direction for our laws and our courts. Society has failed and we as a Government have failed to deal with this problem over the years.  It is extremely important that this quite original &mdash; in Irish terms &mdash; flexible and positive Bill gets maximum co-operation from the community and from the forces of law and order.  It offers to our judges an alternative to the extensively overcrowded facilities which limit them to the only possible options of fines or the application of the Probation Act.  The message must go out to the community that this is one of many proposals that this Government will be making in the whole job of tackling crime in this city and in the country as a whole. This is the first step, an important one which makes a great deal of sense on many levels.  It is cheap, constructive and of more value to the individual and to the community in dealing with the type of criminal that it will suit than any other options which are available to the courts at present or which in any other proposed changes would be made available.</P>
    <P>I am happy to welcome the proposals as outlined by the Minister for Justice.  I repeat that I would like his comments at <Col N="1486" /> a later stage on the age limit and the possibility of extending it downwards. Again I support Deputy Owens' plea to be more involved in the community in particular.  This Bill should be given an enthusiastic reception and it should be made to work to the maximum benefit possible to our community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome this Bill and I thank the Minister for bringing it into the House.  Some Members have said that this has taken some time and that is true. The Bill was almost ready last year.  I am sure that it took the Minister some time to come to grips with new legislation on his table and it is to be welcomed that he has at the start of this session been able to bring the Bill forward.  With other speakers I would say that it is just one of the Bills which we hope to see passed in this session.  It is an important Bill which is trying to come to grips with some of the problems of crime and to rehabilitate and give some assistance to criminals who wish to be rehabilitated.  Very often through no fault of their own offenders and wrongdoers are put away into places which are not suitable to the purpose and which do very little to change their attitude when they come out again.  I am sure that many criminals engaged in small crime or crime of a more serious nature who wish to be rehabilitated will over the years take advantage of this Bill.  For that reason I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some experiments which have taken place over recent years prisoners have been allowed out to do work, as the Minister mentioned, to build scouts' halls and take part in other community activities. These experiments were extremely successful and many jobs were done in the community that would not have been done otherwise.  This brings a new realisation to the ordinary members of the community who often think of these offenders as totally unacceptable that given reasonable opportunity they can rehabilitate themselves.  Many of the people who have spent years in the various institutions and custodial houses around the country would have benefited from the provisions of this Bill had it been in operation 20 years ago and the <Col N="1487" /> problems that we have now might well not be here.  Children who have been involved in crimes and who have been thrown from one place to another and often not put in anywhere would have benefited from the type of conditions provided in this Bill.</P>
    <P>I accept that the Minister has not been very long in his position and nobody can expect miracles overnight.  He was not too long in office when he saw the problems in his own constituency over the Christmas period and this brought to him quick realisation of the law and order position which exists in our cities and to a lesser extent in rural areas today.  I hope that he will see his way to bringing in The Criminal Jurisdiction Bill as soon as possible in an attempt to deal with some of the many matters in that Bill which the Fianna Fáil Government had almost ready last October.  I know that he would wish to look at certain aspects of it and he might want to change certain things about which his own party feel strongly.  There is an absolute obligation on him now as Minister for Justice &mdash; these are difficult times in which to be a Minister for Justice &mdash; to come forward with legislation that at least will help, along with this Bill and other means, to try to decrease the escalating level of crime in the cities, in his constituency, in my constituency and many others.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age when one hears discussions everywhere on the acceptable level of violence.  That is sad.  Judging from the apathy from official sources it would seem that gangsters who rob banks and businesses, muggers and car thieves seem to emerge with more sympathy and rights than do law-abiding citizens going about their everyday affairs.  Crimes, no matter how horrific, seem to be explained away and excused on some kind of socio-economic grounds.  Unemployment and environment are given as reasons for a high level of crime.  That is partly true in certain areas of Dublin and other cities.  There is still an obligation to deal with some of the matters that the Garda have continually put forward as the reasons why they cannot cope with the problem or cannot get on top of it. <Col N="1488" />&ldquo;Cope&rdquo; probably is the better word because they are a long way from getting on top of it.  If they can cope in keeping it at some consistent level they will be doing a good job in society generally.  On their own admission they have failed to do this in recent years.  Everybody knows about the right to silence and bail.  I would support consecutive rather than concurrent sentences for crimes committed by people while on bail.  One big problem in the city today is that people know that if you are caught &mdash; which is unlikely anyway &mdash; and, which is more unlikely, if you are sentenced, before you are put away the thing to do is go out and do as many more jobs as you can because the sentence will be concurrent rather than consecutive.  This is a loophole which the Garda have rightly campaigned against for a number of years and I think it will be amended in the Bill when the Minister brings it forward.</P>
    <P>Regarding evidence, many things should be done which would make it less attractive for people to engage in criminal activity.  I am referring to such matters as the question of evidence, the right of the Garda to question suspects and to get various information on their identity, addresses, explanations of the various property in their possession, and so on. The Garda cannot do that and therefore they cannot do their jobs.  This point was made very clearly over the last year or two.  The Garda should have power to search premises if there is reasonable ground for believing that criminal activity has taken place.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the names of witnesses being taken.  They should be excluded from statements and the book of evidence.  These witnesses are often intimidated because it is easy for people to find their names and addresses.  As a result they withdraw their evidence.  The idea the Garda are putting forward is that we should make it more difficult for a criminal to threaten witnesses.</P>
    <P>Nobody would disagree that we need a comprehensive updating of penalties for all crimes.  They are seriously out of date and should be looked at regularly. The types of sentences &mdash; if they are imposed at all &mdash; imposed for serious <Col N="1489" /> crimes are ludicrous.  Very often these criminals get short sentences but rarely serve them.  If they did have to serve their full sentences it might help the situation. Many of our present day crimes, such as drug-pushing, are not mentioned in our legislation and should be included in the up-dated legislation.  Drug-pushing is one of the most serious crimes in our cities today, yet tough sentences cannot be imposed on these people.  It seems to be almost impossible to put away a drugpusher. I must congratulate the Garda because recently they managed to arrest and bring before the courts a number of the better known drug-pushers.</P>
    <P>Crime is one of the areas in which people tend to get over-emotional and to say the problem is worse than it is.  I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that it is at a very serious level in this city, which is a place I know better than most people who write about it because I spend a great deal of time talking to the people in my constituency and listening to the victims of crimes of vandalism, and the people who have to deal with the effects of these crimes.  I would not say law and order has broken down, but we have gone a long way down that road. The Garda do their best but in certain parts of the city they say crime is so bad because they do not have the necessary support from organisations and institutions and particularly this House.  They feel we have delayed giving them extra manpower.  Last year when I sat around the Cabinet table we gave them a significant number of extra gardaí and more resources, but no matter how much money is spent to clear up this problem, it does not seem to help.</P>

      <P>: The courts, the Garda and the people are trying to curtail what is a massive problem.  I suggest that we do not police cities like Dublin in the traditional way.  The Garda have admitted that if we continue to follow this line, the problem will get worse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are provisions in this Bill to deal in a new way with criminals.  This is a <Col N="1490" /> start to solving the problem.  In my view, the solution lies in community policing densely populated areas which have a high crime rate.  The Garda sergeants have put forward very good proposals in this area and there is an obligation on the Government to implement some of those suggestions as quickly as possible.  If that is not done and if we continue to fight crime in the traditional way, crime will continue to increase and, more important, the support of the community for the Garda will diminish.  The Garda admit they are finding it very difficult to get support from the community in certain areas of this city.  Many reasons can be put forward as to why that has happened. They say the main cause is a lack of manpower and the necessary resources.  In most areas there is only a small number of people involved in crime, but one does not have to be a garda or a local clergyman to know who the criminals are.</P>
    <P>We have a large number of gardaí and we have a very small number of criminals, yet this problem is increasing.  I am not sure if the reason is an imbalance as to where the gardaí are based, if the existing legislation and powers are not strong enough to deal with the offenders when they are caught, or if there is the incentive to catch them, or, if they catch them, they cannot question them, but I am sure that community support for the Garda is at a very difficult stage.</P>
    <P>People say they will have to deal with crime in their own way if the problem is not satisfactorily dealt with.  It has been reported recently that I condone such a measure but that is not so.  I listened to what I said a number of times but I never meant such a meaning to be taken from what I said.  I am saying the Garda have to get on top of the crime situation and take control but to do that they need the necessary back-up by way of legislation, numbers and so on.  This will help to solve the problem.  If that is not done there will be a continuation of attacks on old people, robberies and so on.</P>
    <P>The other night in my area a person over 70 years of age was harassed and petrol bombs were thrown at his door. This is a nightly occurrence.  People say <Col N="1491" /> we are exaggerating and taking instances out of context, but that is not so.  People are living under strain and stress and are being harassed in their own homes.  This is a new trend in this city.  It is irrelevant whether our crime figures are higher, lower or the same as a US city.  We should work on the figures and the level of crime. It is a terrible thing to say that there is &ldquo;an acceptable level of crime&rdquo; or &ldquo;an acceptable level of violence&rdquo;.  Anyone who says that should think again.</P>
    <P>The Garda have an obligation to try to eliminate the problem and they need help to do that.  In the densely populated areas of the city where crime is escalating, and where the criminal operates freely despite the best efforts of the Garda, community policing is the solution.  The Garda should be working with the social workers, community workers and the residents' leaders.  It goes back to the original idea of policing which was done by the community for the protection of the community.  We seem to have got away from that.  Everybody talks about dealing with the problems.  Nobody tries to prevent them.</P>
    <P>Many gardaí seem to see their role as being to deal with crime.  I do not see them that way.  They should be trying to prevent crime.  There were set up in 1922 to be protectors and peacemakers.  They did not use guns.  They wanted to dissociate themselves from the types of military bodies which were around in those days.  They saw their function as being knit with the community, as being men on the beat trying to help and protect people.  They should get back to that role today.  We cannot do that overnight.  We cannot afford the numbers of gardaí needed to achieve community policing in widespread areas.</P>
    <P>On the 1981 crime figures 60 per cent of national crime was committed in the metropolitan areas.  A large percentage of that figure was committed in small areas within the metropolitan areas. Crime still is not widespread.  I could tell the House the five or six locations in this city where heroin is pushed.  I could nearly tell the House who is doing the pushing.  So could the Garda and everybody <Col N="1492" /> else working in those communities. Unfortunately, down through the years the Garda and the community have become divorced from one another to a large extent.  To eliminate crime in this city the Garda must again become close knit with the community.  We need the man on the beat who knows what is happening, instead of just working in divisional areas.</P>

      <P>: This is a community service Bill.  It is the first of a number of Bills which the Minister will be bringing before us.  I support the concept of community service in its broadest sense.  I see a changed role for the Garda.  They should see themselves as preventers of crime, as being involved locally and actively with groups and associations who deal with delinquents of one kind or another.  The probation officers and others will recommend suitable cases to be covered by this Bill.  We need proper liaison in local areas.</P>
      <P>In places like Sheriff Street and other flat areas in the centre city there are huge unemployment and environmental problems. As has been proved in other cities, because of the social problems there is also a high level of crime.  To deal with it the Garda have to get involved with the people in those areas, not drive through them at 70 miles per hour.  I sympathise with them.  I have spoken several times to gardaí from rural areas when they come to Dublin.  With no disrespect to them&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: They try to police these areas and do a good job.  It is very difficult. Unless the Garda in these areas are from the community or connected with the community, they cannot play a constructive role.  The Minister and his officials <Col N="1493" /> have a hard job in trying to deal with a problem which is escalating every day. They have to try to come up with solutions and to enact legislation which is not seen as a harassment of the local community and at the same time gives the Garda the necessary powers.  The Minister should realise there are other ways of dealing with this.  People would be glad to spend extra money to solve this problem. Our society is overtaxed at the moment, but if people thought money was being spent properly to provide services such as those suggested in this Bill, they would be happy to pay.  Having 200 men spread out over all the districts will have no effect.  We have to get away from the conventional way of policing.</P>
      <P>A number of community facilities could be built within the inner city by people who committed crimes.  If they were working in their own areas building social centres and scouts' halls, they would see the good they could do for their own areas.  At the moment they see only the destruction.  Many young people between 16 and 19 years of age steal and rob and take cars.  They do not realise that what they are doing is wrong. Nobody explains it to them.  If they are charged and sentenced, and if they spend a number of hours on community work, and meet the social workers and gardaí, they will change their attitude.</P>
      <P>That is far better than taking ten young boys out of Sheriff Street and sending them to Loughan House for six months, and then bringing them back to Sheriff Street.  That does nothing for them. Unfortunately we have continued to cod ourselves and fool ourselves.  I should hate us to continue doing that.  When these people are arrested and charged, if they are put back into their own environment to work on social centres and services to help their own communities, that will be far better than locking them up in Mountjoy.  They should be put back into their own community to work with people who can identify their problems and help them, and perhaps sort them out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very often in this city it is not the deprived areas which get the money.  The <Col N="1494" /> question of equality and opportunity arises.  People in the wealthier areas can produce very good documentation and dossiers showing why they should have community facilities.  Some facilities are needed everywhere, but they are now built in areas where they are not really needed because there is parental control and the drug problem, lawlessness and vandalism do not exist to the same extent as elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The money is not given to the inner cities where the unfortunate people live. Numerous organisations and voluntary bodies would be only too glad to have community centres built in these areas. Companies and businesses would be prepared to fund them, as they do at the moment.  I do not want to paint a picture which is all gloom.  In some of the parishes in the inner city, firms and companies have put up substantial sums of money to help the community to build their own centres and recreation halls. Young offenders should not be shifted down to the country to work on community service, but put back into their own areas under supervision where they would meet people who would be able to help them in the future when they are out of custodial care.</P>
    <P>There is much talk nowadays about law and order and the rising rate of crime and unfortunately some people who have difficult jobs to do regard everything that is said as criticism.  We must not get to the stage that we only react to events.  I stress to the Minister not to be afraid to take the initiative and to adopt new ideas.  If we reform the courts, get this Bill through and have a new Criminal Justice Bill, that would be worth while.  We cannot put our heads in the sand at a time that the crime rate is soaring.  At the moment old people are afraid to go to Mass in the mornings or to shop in the afternoons.  Many of them never go out at night.  Attendances at the bingo centres in town have declined.  Even though action taken by the authorities may be criticised, it is important that something be done.  Otherwise, the crime rate will continue to escalate and in ten years time people in this House will still be talking <Col N="1495" /> about the problem.  Officials in the Department of Justice will be bringing forward new Bills and Ministers will try to defend impossible positions.  In the interests of the community, of the victims of crime and those who inflict crime on others, we must try to find new ways to deal with the matter.  It has been done in other countries and we will have to do it here.  Otherwise we will be failing in our job and we will not enhance our role as legislators.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>: In common with a number of speakers I should like to place on record my approval of this Bill.  I echo the sentiments expressed by others with regard to the increased level of crime. There are a number of factors contributing to this, such as the rising level of unemployment and the growth of urban areas.  While people in the larger urban areas seem to be experiencing a much greater level of criminal activity than people from rural areas, nevertheless the problem is serious throughout the country and it has to be faced up to by the legislators.  I recognise there are difficulties with regard to providing suitable accommodation for those sentenced for crimes.</P>
      <P>The rising level of crime has created many difficulties.  To throw a person into an institution for a few months will not solve the problem.  When a crime is committed against the State there must be some level of retribution.  I accept that this Bill will not solve all the problems but the procedures set out in it have been successful in other countries, in particular in the UK and in the North of Ireland and their urban and social problems are far greater than ours.  The fact that we are prepared to consider various means to deal with criminality is an important step forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A point that must be made is that sentences for similar offences vary from judge to judge.  Recently an unfortunate person was convicted of a drunk driving charge but because he did not know his rights he got a jail sentence which I thought most inappropriate.  I do not condone driving under the influence of drink <Col N="1496" /> but if the person in the case I mentioned had known his rights he could have appealed.  He had no financial resources and I considered the law had failed grievously in his case.  He spent three weeks in Limerick prison and was released when one-third of his sentence was completed. People are taken into custody at great expense to the State: in many cases police officers have to travel many miles at State expense, but the offenders are released the following day because accommodation is not available.  A feature of the problem is that the same people keep turning up in the courts.  A person may commit a minor crime and be sentenced to an institution.  In such a place he may meet hardened criminals and become tainted.  Releasing that person into the community to face again the same problems is of no help.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that the offender must consent to community work before he is given that work.  That is most appropriate.  The success of this Bill will depend on the degree of acceptance to do certain kinds of community work and to carry it out under supervision.  Once a person is convicted in the court it leaves a certain blemish on his character, at least in the minds of other people, and this is grossly unfair in many instances.  By doing some community work such offenders will be seen to make a positive contribution to the society they have injured.  There are many options available to the courts and I think they will lead to a decrease in demand for the institutionalisation of prisoners.  It will also release space for prisoners who must be committed.  Accommodation is extremely expensive and from recently published figures it is clear that the overall cost of keeping people in prison has risen astronomically and is continually increasing.  The level of income of some of the prison officers is far in excess of what it should be and there are also growing dangers for the safety of these prison officials.  For that reason, they are demanding additional payments to exercise control over certain types of prisoners.</P>
    <P>It has always been part of the payment to society that a person who commits a <Col N="1497" /> serious crime be institutionalised.  When the offender is of good behaviour over a certain period of time he is given a fair reduction of sentence, which should be the case.  Special consideration should be given to those not in the normal sense real criminals, who commit crimes of a minor nature and who may have learnt from their experience.  By committing such persons to prison, one may be doing great damage.  Sending them out into society willing to make a contribution would be extremely successful and I am delighted that this is being attempted under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a variety of works of which various communities are in need.  Sometimes funds can be raised by the local community, but supervision of this type of work is of extreme importance.  We already have youth work programmes and some excellent community centres have resulted from these.  This is because they have been exceptionally well supervised by very competent people.  It is precisely on that point that I commend to the Minister to give very serious consideration to the level of supervision of this type of work.  Without proper supervision I cannot foresee any benefit to the community. I have discussed this aspect with people involved in the repatriation of criminals at various age levels, who feel that this Bill can only be successful if the level of supervision is appropriate to the level of the crime committed and people are paid for this work.  That has been suggested in the Bill.  To make this scheme a success it must command a certain funding over and above what is now available.</P>
    <P>In the countries which have tried this type of programme, to which reference has already been made, it has been exceptionally successful.  Various pilot schemes have initially been created, for example in Britain, and arising from their success rate the programme was extended and the Bill amended and updated.  It now covers the entire country.  Considerable benefits have accrued from the fact that the levels of achievement were studied and the schemes improved and there has been considerable input into this work by <Col N="1498" /> the various community organisations and, indeed, by the police.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the level of and increase in crime and also the level of policing.  There is a demand, particularly in the urban areas, for additional numbers of gardaí.  The gardaí should not be operating in a remote controlled form. They should be part of the community, must identify with it and be seen at all times to do so.  That is not the case and I do not know why.  Various police statistics claim that the level of indictable crime is not increasing to the extent that people claim.  In rural areas almost every village had a police station, with an almost 24-hour service.  These men were seen to be part of the community but, unfortunately, that is no longer the situation, which is most regrettable, although there is the presence of squad cars.</P>
    <P>Significantly, over the Christmas period advertisements warned that drunken driving would be severely impugned and that there would be quite a large increase in the level of policing.  I drove around frequently and encountered only one police block.  There was no physical evidence of increased levels of policing, but that it was in the minds of people that they would be fined or lose their licences was a serious deterrent against driving under the influence of drink.  That campaign was successful last year, but to what extent will it be successful again?  Much as I regret saying so, it will not have the same degree of success again unless there is a very definite police presence and they are seen to be stopping people.  I would not wish people to be fined or convicted of the crime of drunkenness and once people know that the police will be there, they will refrain from driving when drunk.</P>
    <P>Extreme levels of unemployment exist in all the major cities, not only in Dublin, but even in my own city of Kilkenny and in the city of Waterford in which I also lived.  These cities have unacceptable levels of unemployment.  Arising particularly out of the level of youth unemployment, there is a degree of poverty and deprivation, with an obvious effect on those involved.  They take it out on society in various ways.  Car thefts are on <Col N="1499" /> the increase, particularly in the major areas.  We must have community work which will fit the type of crime committed. Over a time, it could be most beneficial to the community.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested in the Bill that helping the disabled and the old is a most desirable type of community work.  Other commendable examples are the development of scout centres and of community centres.  It is to be hoped that in 12 months time we will be able to report a tremendous level of success in this regard.</P>
    <P>The probation officers and welfare officers have constant contact with people.  However, they might not necessarily be the right choice to supervise people who have been sentenced and have agreed to do certain levels of community work.  Perhaps someone totally different could be engaged who could teach them a trade and give them a new insight into community activities.  This would be helpful.  Sometimes these offenders have a certain loathing for police officers and welfare officers, but perhaps that situation could be improved.</P>
    <P>The fact that the work will not interfere with the normal work of the offender is to be applauded, but in most cases people who commit crimes punishable under the provisions of this Bill will not have any work.  The type of crime envisaged will be committed by people of 16 years and over who will not have any work.  It must be remembered that there is a great variety of crime.  In the future probably there will be more people convicted who will already have had one or two convictions for drunken driving or drugs abuse, but many other offences could command a mandatory prison sentence. Taking into account the background of such people sending them to prison perhaps would be the wrong approach.  It is precisely those circumstances &mdash; the notion of criminals paying back to the community &mdash; for which this Bill has been designed.</P>
    <P>The general level of policing within the community is very important and something to which thought must be given.  I <Col N="1500" /> made the point about having a fulltime police presence in most communities. Whether or not we realise it, whether it be because of lack of finance or otherwise &mdash; and that must be taken in to account in these difficult times&mdash;we are creating no-go areas.  Reference was made to vigilante groups.  I totally dissociate myself from such groups.  I should hate to see that type of development take place in our democracy because it is totally unacceptable.  We have an excellent police force who do, and have done, an excellent job over the years.  Nonetheless sometimes they are seriously impeded by various laws that prevent them from getting the necessary convictions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I might appeal to the Deputy to confine his remarks to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>: I make that point because the Bill is designed so that the normal, convicted person can undertake certain community work.  However there are people in respect of whom we are unable to get a conviction.  If we could get such convictions the provisions of this Bill would be a most appropriate way of getting them to make recompense to society for some offence they had committed.</P>
      <P>This is an exceptionally important Bill which I recommend to every Member of the House.  I am certain its provisions will prove significantly advantageous and beneficial to all communities provided there is a will on the part of all people concerned about rising crime, about unemployment, particularly among young people, people who are concerned about the level of deprivation obtaining in a number of our communities.  It carries the significant advantage that, at the end of the day the community will have benefited tangibly from the commital of a crime by a person who would normally be institutionalised, with no hope of reformation for himself in regard to his attitude towards crime.  At least such people will be able to say: &ldquo;Arising out of that crime I made a contribution towards the community&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1501" /> I feel the provisions of this Bill will prove to be worth while.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West)</i>: While welcoming this Bill I am not sure it goes far enough in alleviating the type of crime I hear of daily as a Dublin Deputy, about which I read in the papers and am told constantly by my constituents.</P>
      <P>I see listed in this little booklet the type of tasks an offender will be asked to undertake.  Perhaps many of these tasks would have been appropriate for criminals five, six, or seven years ago, but I cannot envisage the type of criminal of today, or anybody supervising them, settling down to undertake this type of work, such as helping in residential children's homes, pre-school groups and youth clubs or decorating old people's homes.  We have in this city a huge litter problem.  The walls of our city are covered in graffiti.  There is a lot of other work that could be undertaken in the community by such criminals but I cannot envisage them fitting into the type of work listed in this booklet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this morning that additional prison accommodation would be provided in the near future.  We all welcome that, but equally I feel we should not provide hotel-like accommodation for criminals such has been done in the past.  Certainly I do not think some fo them should be provided with televisions, video, radio or even newspapers because some of them are in there only to organise more crime when they emerge.  Court sentences today are in many cases a joke.  I might refer to the murder of the young man in Fairview about which there was widespread concern expressed at the attitude of the judge in that case.  It was utterly ridiculous.  In a case like that I do not know whether a new trial can be demanded.  The strange thing is that those people walked out of court scot-free and organised a victory parade through the city from the GPO to Fairview.  That constitutes nothing short of making a joke of the law.  There are many citizens with no confidence whatsoever in the courts.  Because of lack of prison accommodation we know that many prisoners sentenced in court for <Col N="1502" /> serious crimes are released after a few weeks.  They go back onto the streets to rob homes, shops, banks; they are doing so even while on bail.  As recently as Sunday last I heard on radio an old woman say she had been beaten up and robbed several times.  In the Isle of Man, a small little island, there is none of this type of crime because there is there a provision that the birch will be used in respect of people who commit crimes of the type we are referring to.  I recall listening to the man promoting tourism in the Isle of Man, I think on the Gay Byrne programme, who when asked to what extent the birch was used replied &ldquo;Very rarely&rdquo; because he said the fear of it acted as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the way that crime has escalated here, the birch is needed to deal with the problem.  In my area the local church has been the target.  Every shrine in it has been smashed and robbed while the doors and windows have been broken.  Only last week three children between the ages of five and eight were apprehended but all the Garda could do was to take them to the local Garda station and release them later that evening. We have reached the stage in this city where people are afraid to walk the streets in daylight.  After dark the situation is intolerable.  If one knocks on a door at night in some parts of the city the occupants of the house will not be prepared to answer the knock.  One shop in my constituency has been robbed 13 times in the past 18 months.  While the criminal concerned has not been caught in the act it is known that he is a man who has been released from prison on several occasions having served only a short time on each occasion for the various crimes of which he was found guilty.</P>
    <P>Another serious problem is the stealing and burning of cars.  Apart from the loss of the cars to the people concerned there is the further dimension of stolen cars being involved subsequently in the murder of people.  People are killed on the roads by so-called joy riders.  Some may describe death caused in this way as manslaughter but I would refer to it as murder. The Garda, to whom the community have always looked for protection, are <Col N="1503" /> now the targets of these criminals.  Patrol cars have been rammed in this city on many occasions leaving the occupants to run for their lives.  I cannot find anything in this Bill that will alleviate that problem.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed about the administration of the work scheme.  I understand that the Minister will have power to make the rules and regulations governing the legislation, but I would consider Army personnel to be the most suitable people to supervise the work that offenders will be asked to do.</P>
    <P>In the past we considered tourism to be a very good industry but people no longer wish to come here especially people who were robbed on a previous visit.  They will not be likely to come back.</P>
    <P>Traffic offences represent another problem.  People found guilty in this respect should be included in this work scheme.  It is usual to see motorists breaking the lights in this city and as a result being involved in serious accidents. Motorists who damage property should have to pay for that property.</P>
    <P>I note that the sentence in respect of the work scheme will be from 40 to 200 hours.  That is not enough.  The Minister has said that an offender who was at work or who was attending college would be allowed to undertake the work imposed on him in respect of an offence at times that could be arranged so that his regular work or his studies would not be interrupted. I do not agree with that because it would make matters too easy for the offender.  His lifestyle should be interrupted because the more difficult he finds the situation, the less likelihood there will be of his committing crime again.</P>
    <P>Perhaps failure to enforce the law is the greatest cause of concern in the community today.  I welcome the Bill but I have reservations about it.  Perhaps much of what has been omitted will be included in the Criminal Justice Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have been here during most of this debate and I realise that it would be difficult to have a debate <Col N="1504" /> on this legislation without discussing such questions as the level of crime, the need for other legislation or the behaviour of the Garda.  Perhaps this is understandable since we live in extraordinary times in terms of crime and violence.  However, while I wish to restrict myself in so far as possible to the Bill, I shall refer to the constituency concern with the present crime levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Increasingly TDs are being asked to attend meetings in their constituencies. Almost weekly I am asked to attend a meeting of some women's group and I find that the people concerned are anxious to talk to me mostly about law and order.  I find that more than anything else these organisations are anxious to tell me about the lack of law and the awful disorder in their communities.  In urban areas particularly the problem is very serious.  Those of us who represent urban constituencies are aware of the frustration and the sense of helplessness on the part of constituents.  One must question how these people will relate to the idea of community service orders and to offenders working in the community.  I am thinking of a typical residential area in my constituency to which I was asked to go because of the imminent setting up of a vigilante group.  I was asked to go there and to listen to the problems that the people were experiencing.  I complied with that request and the evening was one of the best that I could have spent. The area involved a cul-de-sac type of estate and I was told firsthand of the incidence of crime there.  One of the complaints that these people had was the Garda in the area were not sufficiently responsive to appeals for help with the result that the community felt they had been abandoned.  Subsequently I helped to organise liaison between these people and the local Garda and I was told that the area could be assessed in terms of easy access for the purpose of crime.  I asked the people to send me a list of all the crimes they were talking of and on receipt of that list one would be forgiven for getting the impression that the major criminals were going out to the area in tour buses.  There was an astonishing level of crime there in a period of two to <Col N="1505" /> three months.  We must ask how people who are so distressed about their property, about their children and about their own safety are to respond to the idea of offenders who may have robbed their houses or stolen their cars being given an easy option by the judge making a decision that instead of sending them to jail &mdash; some people feel that it is the only retribution for crimes against the community &mdash; ordering them to do week-end jobs.  I am optimistic about this because I am committed to the notion that we should be getting away from the present system.  We must look at more alternatives to prison than we have at present.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the legislation will come into operation when he makes the necessary order and that the selection and necessary training of staff for the new scheme will take some time.  That is not a bad thing because we must prepare for the operation of this new system and hopefully we will have the other criminal justice legislation before the House prior to the scheme coming into operation.  We have been told that the procedure proposed is effective in other countries but we must bear in mind that, for instance, in continental Europe, people are more law-abiding and accustomed to more rigid enforcement than we are.  I would not like to see the Swiss system introduced here.  In that country people are told the time of the morning when they can put out their dustbins and when they should bring them in again.  The reality is that people in those countries are accustomed to carrying identity cards and rigidly recognising traffic laws.  For that reason they adapt to systems which are more humane and rehabilitative.  It may be that the Bill is being introduced at an inappropriate time but that should not be a deterrent.  It should be a challenge to us all.  We have an ideal opportunity to explain to people what will develop from the legislation.  Many people who are distressed and upset at the level of crime are also upset when people look for harsh and severe recriminations against offenders.  At times groups such as residents' associations, women's groups and others, have suggested that proposals <Col N="1506" /> such as those in the Bill should be introduced.</P>
    <P>A sentencing judge will have to make a decision about whether an offender is suitable for a community service sentence and that poses the question of what will happen to an offender who has a psychiatric or a severe psychological problem which may have influenced the crime. Will such an offender be disqualified from such an order because he has that problem and as a result be sent to prison? That would be undesirable and unhelpful to the prisoner.  I am aware that about 40 per cent of those who go to prison here have reasonable to serious psychological and psychiatric problems.  Those problems are not detected before those people go to prison and are not detected or treated in prison.  I am not suggesting that people who have problems that may not be apparent but may become exaggerated in the atmosphere of a prison should be cut off or disqualified from a system that may be more helpful to them.</P>
    <P>The question of finance has been raised by many Members and it was dealt with by the Minister in his speech.  If we look at the cost of maintaining our prison population, the number of people in prison and the bad record of rehabilitation, we will come to the conclusion that it should be a case of transferring funds for maintaining offenders in prisons to fund schemes that will give them an opportunity of repaying the community for the crimes they committed.  With regard to the number of committals to prison I should like to quote from the December 1981 issue of <i>Horizon</i>, the journal of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors.  An article in that issue states:</P>
    <P>Of the total number committed to prison in 1980, 24 per cent were 21 years or under.</P>
    <P>It is intersting to look at the ages because this legislation refers to young prisoners.  The article in <i>Horizon</i> continues:</P>
    <P>In 1976 the figure was 25 per cent. In the past five years the percentage of the male prison population under 21 has remained much the same but there <Col N="1507" /> has been a dramatic increase in the number of females under 21 who have been committed &mdash; from 36 per cent in 1976 to 45 per cent in 1980.</P>
    <P>On the question of the rehabilitation of prisoners the article states:</P>
    <P>It is difficult to judge how successful the rehabilitative process within the prison system is but if one is to take the number of offenders being committed to prison who have already been &ldquo;in&rdquo; before the signs are not encouraging. Almost seven out of every ten prisoners have previously served &ldquo;time&rdquo; [That is very high].  The actual number in 1980 was 65 per cent &mdash; 3 per cent more than in 1976.  35 per cent of this number had previously served once to five times, 22 per cent served five to 20 times and 8 per cent had served over 20 times.  In the five year period there has been a steady increase in the number of persons being committed who had been in prison before, especially in the one to five times category.</P>
    <P>Those statistics must pose the question: What is the point of high expenditure on a system which does not appear to be doing anything for the people concerned? I am glad that there will be an involvement of welfare and probation officers when the sentence is passed and the order is made.  Presumably there will be fairly intensive participation.</P>
    <P>There is a problem with crime families where young boys systematically graduate to a career in crime.  I have spoken with the mothers of some of these families and I feel it would be beneficial to involve a welfare officer with such a family in the context of a community service order.  At present these families are abandoned outcasts.  People tend to think of Mafia-type criminal families and I accept that they exist but I am thinking of, perhaps, large families in small houses where children become involved in petty crime and it becomes a way of life.  This tends to be a behaviour pattern in the family and it is difficult to break the cycle. I believe much good could be done by the involvement of welfare workers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1508" /> The Minister referred to the types of crimes with which this legislation will deal.  I would be horrified to think that people convicted of crimes of rape or other similarly violent crimes would benefit from it.  Certain definite exclusions would have to be incorporated.  I would also question whether it might be possible for prisoners already serving sentences to apply to have their sentences changed by way of a community service order so that they could have the benefit of facilities which will be available to those before the courts following the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I will consider the matter of women in prison.  I have already given figures which show that there has been an increase in the number of women offenders but we are talking about an increase in a very small minority group.  Women form only a very small proportion of the entire prison population.  There were 18 women prisoners in Mountjoy in 1980 compared with 422 men.  In Limerick prison the figure is slightly higher &mdash; ten women compared to 118 men &mdash; because there are more long-term prisoners there.  I believe we do not need another prison for women because the problem of women offenders is not a serious issue and I would propose that community service orders should be made in respect of them.  I have been in court and seen poor, disadvantaged women being sentenced to three or four months' imprisonment for being drunk and disorderly. This should be unacceptable to us.  Perhaps it is felt that it is a worse crime for a woman to be drunk and disorderly rather than a man.  Many women are in prison because of minor offences such as drunkenness and shoplifting and very few of them have committed crimes of violence. Community service orders could well be made in respect of women offenders and could possibly halve the number of women prisoners in Mountjoy, probably about 28.  There are about 500 men serving sentences there, many of them having been convicted of violent crimes.</P>
    <P>We should welcome this alternative and encourage the community to accept and understand the reason for it.  Prison <Col N="1509" /> sentences are not the answer.  Anyone who has visited our prisons and seen the life there, particularly in Mountjoy which is very old, must understand the horror of it.  The Minister mentioned that prisoners are one to a cell but I think there are instances where there are more.  It is very like living one's life in a brush cupboard with no privacy, cut off from family, very tense and entirely boring. An alternative to this type of incarceration must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the members of the welfare service who are very committed and humanitarian in their approach. I am sure they will be watching to see how this legislation progresses.  It is important that it be handled carefully and that we should project the idea that it is a positive move which will be an asset in terms of prison reform.  It must be perceived by the community as a means by which they will be positively involved with offenders.  Deputy Keating pointed out that there may be initial problems and that there will be people standing by ready to say &ldquo;we told you so&rdquo; if it is not successful.  We must allow for some mistakes and not condemn this measure.  It certainly represents a move in the right direction and we will have other legislation which will give a balance in terms of the frustrations which the community are feeling.  We will address ourselves to the fears which people have expressed during this debate about the level of crime.  I hope the community service order will not only be accepted in the House but will be supported as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will read it and have it written into the record again.  The Minister stated last night:</P>
      <P>As regards the major examinations last year it cost £650 per job filled. Some jobs cost well over £1,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I presume from that that the average cost per job would be in the region of £650. When I reported progress last night I had very briefly referred to the difficulties young people are having at the moment trying to obtain employment.  I would like again to point out that the amendment to our motion put down by the Government is similar in tone to many <Col N="1511" /> statements that have been issued by the Government recently.  I would like to emphasise that there is no comparison at all between the people paying for services, such as water and sewerage, and paying for what should be a right, the chance to be employed.</P>
    <P>The net result of the imposition of the charges in this case is that of putting a premium on the right of people to look for work. The many promises and commitments made by the Government in relation to youth make this fee deceitful and fraudulent and it is an indication of the depths to which the Government have sunk.  It is also a very damning indictment of the bankruptcy of thought that has afflicted the Government and paralysed their efforts to create employment, which should be their main priority.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to the 1981 report of the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission.  On page 5, part 1, of that report the following is stated:</P>
    <P>The Commission is sometimes asked what it costs to make an appointment to the Civil Service.  This can vary depending on the type of post, the number of candidates and the number of appointments to be made.  In 1981 the average cost per appointment was £298.</P>
    <P>I do not pretend to know what happened in 1982 but there seems to be a very grave discrepancy between the figure given last night by the Minister of £650 per job filled in 1982 and the figure of £298 in the 1981 commission report.</P>
    <P>This charge is just another tax but it is a tax in the main on young people.  I know that others who apply for jobs in the civil service and for promotion in the civil service have also to pay this fee.  It would be much fairer and more equitable if those people had to pay a little more and if the young people applying for the first time, who are seeking work in the civil service, were given the chance to do that. Those young people are already under the strain of examinations and the intense <Col N="1512" /> pressure to try to obtain employment. The extra burden, even though many people say it is very little, can be the last straw in this burden which young people have to bear.</P>
    <P>In relation to a recent competition, people who were interviewed, came to Dublin and paid for a night in Dublin, have now got letters saying that because of the huge number &mdash; the Minister referred to this last night &mdash; it will be a considerable time before the commission are able to get in touch with them.  This is a competition for entrance into the Garda Síochána.  I feel the figure of £650 given by the Minister is an exaggerated figure.  I do not believe the full figures could be available yet.  I believe this figure has been thrown in here as an excuse for imposing this fee on people applying for jobs in the public service.  I ask that these figures be rechecked.  As was emphasised by Deputy Fitzgerald last night, there is a great difference in the expense a person applying from a rural area has to bear.  There is a great drive on by the Government practically to abolish unemployment assistance as means to be assessed have been greatly increased.  A parent who has two or three children looking for a position in the civil service now must cast lots to see which child will be given the £10 application fee.  I welcome the fact that the Minister has given in a little on this.  He and the Government should admit they were wrong.  The application fee should not apply to school leavers.</P>
    <P>This fee will hang like an albatross around the necks of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  It emphasises the harsh and uncaring monetaristic policies of the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support the amendment tabled by the Minister that Dáil Éireann recognises that in the present financial circumstances it is desirable that the costs of some State services be borne to at least some extent by those making use of the services.  This subject has been topical in the media for some time.  I appreciate the opportunity to reject categorically the not only specific fallacious allegations but the overall allegation that this is a tax on <Col N="1513" /> unemployment.  It is not enough to put down motions on tax savings or cuts or expenditure in Private Members' Time without first looking at the background to them.</P>
      <P>We have 190,000 people unemployed. Many people have put forward views as to how the desperate problem of youth unemployment might be solved.  They have suggested providing greater incentives to agriculture and industry through private enterprise and further State enterprise through State-sponsored bodies and direct State employment.  The underlying root cause of the problem was the reckless Fianna Fáil policy which was laid down in their manifesto and carried out by them in Government between 1977 and 1979 when they increased public and civil service employment.  Not only did that policy not solve the unemployment problem but, as we all know to our cost, it gave us a national debt of £11 billion.  Civil service officials at the time said their biggest problem was to find work for those recruited.</P>
      <P>The need for our economic stringency is because of that reckless policy.  We had to look at the alternative of imposing charges for services, whether it is agricultural development officers calling out to farmers, charges for local authority services or charges for examinations and interviews for the civil service.  The initial cause for the floundering of the State's finances lies with the party who come into the House week after week in Private Members' Time and put down motions relating to the remedial actions we have had to take for their reckless policies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since July 1981 there has been a recruitment embargo on the civil service. The cost of each job filled and the cost of administering the procedures to whittle down the number of applicants is very high.  There has been much misleading comment in relation to this subject.  The total vote for the administration of the Civil Service Commission is £2,747,000 but that includes only the salaries of those employed in the commission.  If we take the total cost of administering it, there is an additional £355,000 of which £100,000 is for advertising vacancies through the media and the remaining £217,000 is for <Col N="1514" /> accommodation which has to be rented in order to hold examinations and interviews. The proposed charges, despite misleading comments which stated that for the higher grades there will be a charge of up to £50, are quite specific: £10 for clerical assistant grade upwards. These include very lucrative appointments such as architects and so on.  However, 75 per cent of the charges which will arise from the budgetary decision will be at the rate of £7 for the lower grades relating to postman, typist and technician trainees.  It is not applicable to semi-State bodies and is a once-off charge.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service Commissioners provide other services.  They visit secondary and post-primary schools and provide assistance to career guidance teachers. When I researched the history behind this subject I was interested to see that there were charges in 1968.  If we look at those charges and take inflation into account, we will see what a similar charge based on £2 then would be now.  If we take the administrative officer grade the gross figure now would be £18.72.  Similarily for executive officers.  For clerical officers it is £11.70 and the same for clerical assistants.  For a driver tester it is £18.72.  So, although the figure of £7 and of £10 is a once off charge and has been severly criticised by the Opposition, it is only fair to point out statistically that to bring back the same level of charges with updated prices would mean, in some cases, twice the amount being charged now.</P>
    <P>When we delve into the history of the Government decision and we see this motion condemning the Government, it is intersting to look at Fianna Fáil's previous performance in this area and answers given by members of that party in this House.  Their replies clearly state their policy when they had to face their reality in Government.  The following is a quotation from the Official Report of 2 March 1966, Vol. 221, column 716:</P>
    <P>Mr. Coogan asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of the past five years (1) the number of posts advertised by the Civil Service Commission; (2) the number of applications <Col N="1515" /> received; and (3) the amount collected in application fees; and if, in order to avoid hardship to applicants with young families, he will dispense with the payment of fees by future applicants.</P>
    <P>Mr. J. Gibbons: The statistical information sought by the Deputy is:&mdash; ... As regards the last part of the question, the general standard of fees charged to candidates seems to me quite reasonable and should not cause hardship.  It is long standing policy to charge application fees at open competitions. This has the effect of reducing the cost to the taxpayer of these competitions and of keeping the candidature within reasonable bounds thereby minimising the delay in making appointments.</P>
    <P>I also wish to quote from the Official Report of 22 February 1961, Vol. 186, column 691:</P>
    <P>Mr. Ryan asked the Minister for Finance if in view of the great hardship which the rule causes, he will relieve unemployed applicants for positions as postmen of the obligation to pay the sum of fifteen shillings in stamps with their applications.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan: ... It has for many years been the Commissioners' policy &mdash; with which I am in full agreement &mdash; to charge application fees at all open competitions held by them.  Not only do the fees reduce the charge falling on the taxpayer in respect of the expenses of the Commissioners but they serve to keep candidature within reasonable bounds and so avoid extra expense and delay in making appointments.</P>
    <P>We see the blatantly cynical opportunism of that party when they are in the hurler-on-the-ditch position in Opposition where they do not have to face reality and take tough decisions.</P>
    <P>It is also valid to point out in a week when the first item discussed was taxation that the difficulty is not only the overall economic situation but the intolerable levels of tax burdens.  Therefore, we <Col N="1516" /> should look at taxes that lead to employment, instead of the Opposition fallaciously accusing us of introducing taxes on the unemployed.  Do Fianna Fáil want higher tax burdens on the hotel and motor industries with their 23 per cent VAT?  I was talking to an ordinary farmer yesterday who employs a farm labourer and the total contributions under PAYE and PRSI came to £43.  That amount prohibits him from taking on further staff.  It is recognised on all sides of the House that the limits for taxation have been reached, not only in terms of diminishing returns but also in terms of the capacity of people to pay.  We have seen the vintners, motor traders and the PAYE sector on the streets protesting that they cannot tolerate the present level of taxation.  We have no alternative, either we withdraw the services or charge a nominal amount for them.  Surely it is equitable &mdash; a very trendy and fashionable word &mdash; that the burden should be moved from the taxpayer towards the user of the service, leaving aside the hypocritical stand of the Opposition week after week putting down motions for extra expenditure with their projected budget deficit at £150 million smaller than we outlined in our budget of £900 million.</P>
    <P>The Opposition should clearly spell out their alternatives in terms of the overall economics and state exactly how they would get off this gravy train.  The people are clearly aware that the myth that the Government pay for the services and not the taxpayers has well and truly outlived its usefulness.  If we look at the specifics of the costs for various grades in the public service last year we will see the reason why not only was there proven to be a number of frivolous applications, but also that the cost to the taxpayer is intolerable.  There were originally 40 vacancies for the grade of post office clerk and the cost of filling them came to £173,000.  There was an initial application list of 16,235 but about 4,000 did not do the written examination.  It is hard to understand why they did not sit for the examination for which they had applied some weeks previously.  I have endless lists of examples before me.  There were 19,863 applicants for the position of clerical <Col N="1517" /> assistant and 12,376 sat for the written examination, a discrepancy of over 7,000 people who applied for the position. The cost of running the examination was £201,500 to fill 900 places.  Any reasonable taxpayer could validly point to those figures and say they are alarmingly high, not in criticism of the Civil Service Commission but of the high level that the taxpayer is being asked to bear which is unfair, especially when you see the number of people who apply but do not bother to sit for the examination.</P>
    <P>It behoves Fianna Fáil to spell out the overall consequences of their reckless action in terms of these motions, and, in relation to this motion, if we take the time to study the possible alternatives, we are faced with a number of different options.  Should the Government back down altogether or emulate the previous Government when they moved a Supplementary Estimate in the autumn for the Department of the Public Service of £400,000?  Should we ignore the problem and push it into the future and find that all our PAYE is gone to pay interest on debt?  Are we going to ignore blatantly our responsibility in Government? Are we going to reduce the cost per job ratio that I outlined earlier, which is at present £298 per average job filled? That is what it costs to go through this procedure.</P>
    <P>Should we change that ratio by employing more civil servants?  That is the very policy that got us into this mess in the first place.  Should we bring in higher taxation to the amount of £400,000?  Should we rationalise job applications or should we go the whole hog, which Fianna Fáil simplistically have ignored, and amend the 1956 Act whereby the commissioners are simply legally obliged to hold open competitions? The full consequences when we look at the financial aspect mean that that Act must be amended.  What are the consequences and alternatives?  Will it be the leaving certificate only and a screen test on the leaving certificate only despite the codes of practices accepted at present that the post-primary schools are already accustomed to?  Surely this would be unfair to those who leave at intermediate <Col N="1518" /> certificate level and who may be have looked for some work experience.  Perhaps we should have cancelled the examinations this year and used the panels of last year.  That could have been done.  It is a feasible option because we see the numbers of unsuccessful applicants last year on panels probably based on some talent, but surely that would run totally in the face of the Opposition's much-expressed disappointment at the lack of opportunities for this year's school leavers who were not in a position to apply last year and are on no panel.  Of course, we had to hold the examinations.</P>
    <P>The other factor is that if we use some form of screening test with higher education qualifications naturally in this day and age that would lead to claims for higher grades of pay.  As always, the Opposition party have failed miserably to state any alternative in relation to the specifics and the general economic situation as to how they might go about it. Private Members' motions such as this are not only pure gimmickry, they are a charade which is an insult to the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on some general points in relation to the overall work of the Department of the Public Service and the civil service and reforms that would not only be essential and desirable but cannot be delayed.  In this country we have not only a financial mess but we have two major problems.  One is our unique dependency ratio in Europe and the other is a structural problem.  In this matter of the entrance to the civil or public service I favour full regionalisation of interviewing and examinations to reduce the cost for the people in Wexford, Waterford, Donegal, Cork and Kerry who must come up to Dublin.  On doing a little research on this I was amazed to see how touching was the commitment of the previous Minister, Deputy Gene Fitzgerald, to really reducing the cost to the applicant.  What did he do to reduce the cost of overnight stays by regionalisation?  The existing level of activity was 17 per cent held outside Dublin.  He reduced it to 12 per cent and, still not satisfied in his overwhelming concern for the poor applicant, he reduced it to 9 per cent, leaving a situation where <Col N="1519" /> the £7 or £10 was derisory in comparison to the accommodation costs and the cost of transport of any rural person coming to Dublin in order to participate in the weeding-out process.</P>
    <P>In the general area of the public service I hope that the Green Devlin report will clear divisional aspects of the civil service in relation to policy versus administration, that there will be full accountability in our public service both for promotion and for culpability and that there will be open recruitment at the highest level so that we will get the best brains into the most responsible jobs.  The level of money that we are talking about under the management is extremely high and the responsibility is extremely great.  It is no reflection on the existing personnel there, but it is always interesting to have open-minded views of people with expertise in various areas coming into these bodies to enlighten and to get the maximum efficiency and effectiveness from our structures.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will be able to use to good effect the one-in-three embargo which has taken place since July 1981, not so that a section of a Department would be bereft of staff but that there would be sufficient flexibility within any section to move staff from over-staffed areas and to rationalise and get full efficiency. I have spoken to young people in their early twenties who have left the civil service from pure frustration and boredom and lack of job satisfaction.  That is a very sad reflection.  I am not saying that it is widespread but the fact that there should be any indications of it would suggest that we must restructure our manning levels within particular sections.</P>
    <P>Within the scope of this Opposition motion there is not the fat, the surplus, the wasteful or inefficient process with these interviews and examinations to take any soft option.  There is no hedging on this.  The money must be paid.  The development of technology, electronic scanning equipment and multiple-choice short answer tests has led to an annual saving in the region of £45,000, staffing levels in the commission are at a minimum and in the current year a reduction <Col N="1520" /> of approximately £30,000 is anticipated in the cost of technician trainee examinations. Therefore, there is not scope to save £400,000 by rejigging the mechanism for admissions to the civil service. It is a simple, straightforward issue for the taxpayers who are marching in every sector or it is simply a case of Fianna Fáil opportunism that has neglected its duties.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate the facts as I see them relating to this situation.  Fees were charged up to 1968 and the present rates compare favourably if we take all updating in relation to grade-weighted averages and inflation.  In 1968 when this charge was abolished the number of applications to the civil service was at a low ebb and maybe that was the reason for abolishing the charge.  Perhaps this was a once-off boost to give encouragement. However, on the figures I have quoted where they were dealing with 12,000 and 16,000 job applications that was not the case and, therefore, the underlying reasons for abolishing it in 1968 are now gone.  It is also fair to point out the number of frivolous applicants who did not pursue their applications.  I give some examples: executive officer competition, 18 per cent; clerical officer competition, 53 per cent &mdash; more people decided not to go ahead with their applications than went ahead; clerical assistant competition, 35 per cent; post office clerk competition, 25 per cent.  They did not even bother to sit for the examinations. That speaks for itself.</P>
    <P>We must accept that the 1956 Act obliges the Government and the Civil Service Commission to hold competitive tests for all posts, written or by interview, and to place all candidates in the order of merit from that competition.  It would be very wrong indeed if any sector in private industry decided that because the Government had taken this action they should follow suit.  There is absolutely no resemblance or comparison between the difficulties that the Civil Service Commission are obliged to undergo under legislation and the flexibility and scope that private enterprise has in relation to these matters and the lack of regulations governing them as compared with the civil service.  The proposed reduction of <Col N="1521" /> 3 per cent staffing levels in every Department has been more than exceeded in the instance of the commissioners.  There is no scope for any further efficiency and productivity.</P>
    <P>When the hypocritical mask of Fianna Fáil is pulled away, and when their  is put to one side, the reality is that  or £10 &mdash; one night's babysitting money &mdash; is not an exorbitant charge in view of what the hard-pressed taxpayer has to pay.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>: I support this motion. The closing remarks of Deputy Yates, who is about to leave, concerning babysitting charges in County Wexford is particularly apt in the present circumstances. This was an example of black humour.  He said he was asked to speak &mdash; there are various ways of asking &mdash; on this motion and he prides himself on being the youngest Member of this House.  The youngest Member of this House from the grand proud county of Wexford delivered the most priggish, self-righteous, reactionary speech I ever have heard in my long years listening to schoolchildren.</P>
      <P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>: Allow me to speak, Deputy Yates.  I listened to his smug speech with incredulity.  I thought he prided himself on representing the young people but I said to myself that, if that is all the young people of Ireland have to look to to represent them in this House, may God help them.  In my opinion this shows his sick humour, coming here to lecture the people as to how they should conduct their business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I was in the Seanad last year I remember coming to listen to a debate in this Chamber and he was speaking on a motion dealing with unemployment.  He made an impassioned plea for the young people and asked that all sorts of tax burdens and inequities be lifted from them.  He said he was very proud to be the youngest Member of this House.  Yet he comes here tonight and says, with a righteousness that leaves me gasping, that we should whip away our masks of hypocrisy.  When we were in Government <Col N="1522" /> his party trooped through the lobbies night after night on motions to keep Fieldcrest or somewhere else open, to reduce this or that and night after night we had razor-edge votes.  They shed crocodile tears.  Deputy Yates is a member of that party and tonight he comes here and tells us to take away our hypocritical masks.  That young gentleman looked back to 1968 and even further back to 1961.  Was he about then?  Just about. When he spoke of what happened in 1961 it sounded odd, but funny.  Might I be a little irreverent and say I hope he was out of nappies?</P>
    <P>I recognise that the Minister has made what I call a sort of climb-down, similar to that made by the Minister for Education when she made a sort of climb-down on the school transport charges.  The Government cannot decide whether they should give in to pressure.  There have been day-long meetings about what they should do about this or that, and now they have come up with a half-baked potato.  They have decided that the charge might last for this year only, and that it is only for one job application, hoping that will get them out of a hole. I want to nail my colours to the mast and say that the charges should be withdrawn immediately.</P>
    <P>I cavil at the wording of the Minister's amendment and want to draw the attention of the House to what I think is a misleading use of a word in the amendment, which says:</P>
    <P>that the cost of some State services be borne to at least some extent by those making use of the services.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;State services&rdquo; mean that one uses something and gets something.  At local authority level there has been some talk lately of charges for services, such as refuse collection or water rates.  The principle of charging for services is a good one, but in this case one is not getting a service.  What is happening is that one applies for an application form.  One then gets back an application form which says that one must forward a sum of £10, £7 or whatever, and then the application will be dealt with.  In fact, a service is not being provided.  A person forwards <Col N="1523" /> money and gets back an application form. The filling of that form and the forwarding of the money and the form to the civil service does not betoken a service received, because the applicant may get a letter stating he is not qualified and will not be considered further.  This means he has not been given a service.  That should be recorded because the wording of the amendment, strictly speaking, is incorrect. It is a charge for a job application form, not even a charge for sitting the examination.</P>
    <P>I have read the Minister's contribution. The previous speaker said we should produce alternatives.  Each Minister who spoke here cried and said that because of the awful Fianna Fáil Governments which were in power they must now do this or that.  This is very ridiculous because it is a negation of ministerial, governmental and Deputies' responsibilities. In the run-up to the 1982 general election there were massive advertisements in various papers saying that voting for Fianna Fáil would cost the people a packet &mdash; it reminded me of the history books and Kitchener saying one should serve one's country &mdash; but it is costing the people who decided in their non-wisdom to put in this Government four or five packets, because they decided to go for the alternative which was, reading between the lines, the Government which would not cost them a packet. They voted for this Government.  Looking back and crying and <i>deja vu</i> and all of that are no good.  They are the Government. They should carry on and not look back and try to blame somebody else.</P>
    <P>An alternative came to my mind as Deputy Yates was speaking.  We are now all contributing willingly to the youth employment levy.  When we realised that this money would be deducted from our wage packets we decided that, if it would actually give employment to young people, it must be a good thing.  If the Government are looking for £400,000 from the job application fee, why not take it from the youth employment levy which is intended to help young people? That would be one way of getting £400,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1524" /> I want to take Deputy Yates to task for a remark he made.  He said that for Opposition Deputies to put down motions in Private Member's time is an insult to the taxpayer.  Some three, four or five years ago, when Deputies were living on a razor edge of uncertainty, they were subjected night after night to tight votes on alternative proposals in Private Members' Time by the then Opposition. This was not considered an insult to the taxpayer.  Under Standing Orders time is allowed to the Government and the Opposition.  The Ceann Comhairle presides impartially over the House in his wisdom.  It would be a very poor country which would not permit the Opposition to put forward their own ideas and point out anomalies and abuses.  I do not want to inhabit a land which Deputy Yates and his ilk would have us inhabit in which the Opposition could not put forward their point of view.</P>
    <P>I represent the constituency of Longford-Westmeath.  Whenever I like, at the proper time&mdash;and I intend to abide by the rules of the House&mdash;I will represent my constituents.  I will not listen to tripe and twaddle from a youngster who tries to tell me what I can do.  Deputy Yates should go home and rethink his remark about an insult to the taxpayer. The taxpayers of Longford-Westmeath sent me to Dáil Éireann and, while I am returning from that constituency, I intend to put forward their point of view.  I am annoyed by that childish and damaging remark which exemplifies the attitude of the Government towards taxpayers and young people and the whole democratic process.</P>
    <P>The motion deals with examination fees.  I want to deal with it in the context of increased examination fees, increased school transport charges, increases in the price of school book, VAT increases, increases in the cost of living, PRSI increases and increases in the price of petrol.  I do not blame the Government for all those increases, but I blame them for most of them.  Young people who have done their examinations and put up with a lot of hassle and worry find themselves with very little money in their pockets.  I do not know what the babysitting <Col N="1525" /> charges in Wexford are.  They must be away beyond the national norm.  No Wexford Deputy is here.  At any rate, they decide to apply for a civil service job and they are landed with this fee.  This is the straw that breaks the camel's back. This is adding insult to injury.  In many cases in rural areas they must travel to a centre to sit for the examination.  Athlone is a centre for many examinations and I see them coming off the early morning train from some of the western areas. They have no free CIE pass.  They must also have their meals and then get home at night.  On top all of that they are being asked to pay a fee.</P>
    <P>I should like to take up something else Deputy Yates said.  I hope I am not being too hard on the poor young man.  He asked how many do not turn up for the examinations.  How dare he?  When I was teaching I had the privilege of meeting young people daily.  I encouraged my girls to apply for every job that came up.  If you do not do that what hope have you got of getting a job?  I encourage them to buy a newspaper each day and comb  the advertisements to see what would be suitable for them and apply.  It is only by saturating the market with their job applications that they might be lucky enough to get an interview and then a job.</P>
    <P>The Deputy quoted a figure of 17,000 applications for one grade in the civil service and said only 12,500 turned up for the examination.  So what?  Are not the young people of Ireland entitled to apply for jobs?  The jobs are scarce enough.  Very often job applications dates clash and they are unable to turn up for both examinations.  You cannot say you have equality of opportunity unless you have access to that opportunity. Access means that you can apply for and sit for the written examination.  Being sanctimonious and asking why they did not all turn up for the examination is just being mealy-mouthed.  It also emphasises the rural-urban division which is arising more and more nowadays.</P>
    <P>In this job application fee there is a bias against rural applicants.  They have to travel, and so they have this added cost as well as the cost of sitting the <Col N="1526" /> examination.  This must all be put in the context of the extra charges being borne today by all young people.  Since this Government took office last November it is no coincidence that there is an air of hopelessness.  I do not want to hear again: &ldquo;It is all your fault&rdquo;.  That is not good enough.  That tune is too well worn: it never sang sweetly and it is sounding shriller each day.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to what happened in 1961 and he quoted an answer to a parliamentary question in 1966 by the then Minister for Finance.  That is totally out of tune with present-day circumstances.  The whole point of better Government and improved social conditions should be to enlighten.  There was a change some time in the late sixties and it coincided not with a drop in the number of applicants seeking entry to the civil service but with what was then a great liberalisation of ideas and policies by the then Fianna Fáil Government with regard to young people.  I am thinking of the time when the late Donogh O'Malley was Minister for Education and when he implemented the free second level education policy.  It was the time when the regional technical colleges were established. These followed the OECD report on investment in education in Ireland. That pointed out that social and educational policies should be geared towards meeting the demands of the young people in Ireland who comprised a very considerable proportion of our population.  It was a time when opportunities were opened up for young people and a time when outdated ideas regarding the young were discarded.  At a time when there were considerable advances in education it was seen to be wrong to charge young people a fee for looking for a job.  That was the situation rather than what was stated by the previous speaker who suggested it was because there was a dearth of applicants.  There was never a dearth of applicants for jobs here.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said last night, we have a huge unemployment problem with 190,000 people unemployed.  I cannot see how imposing a fee in respect of an application form will help the unemployment <Col N="1527" /> problem.  It will do exactly the reverse and it will also create a dreadful atmosphere of pessimism among young people. They will not know to whom they can turn for a job.  I admit I do not have the answer to that problem but I have an answer to the matter before the House and that is to ask the Minister to scrap the charge.  It will not lead to employment for young people.  We have the collective task of dealing with the awesome problem of unemployment but it cannot be tackled by this measure introduced by the Coalition and which was one of their first actions.  I cannot help thinking that this Government are anti-young people because their most hated and fierce measures have been directed against them.  I am thinking about school transport charges as well as this charge and others which will lessen the quality of education and the quality of life for young people.</P>
    <P>In his announcement last night, which was elaborated on this morning, the Minister said that it was hoped that it would be one fee per person in respect of several applications.  I may be corrected on this but that was my reading of the situation.  The Minister has gone some of the way with our proposal and I am very glad it was a proposal put forward from this side by Deputy Fitzgerald and Deputy Calleary.  Some of the scales have dropped from the Minister's eyes and he has gone some of the way on the road to Damascus.  I ask him to go the whole way and to drop the whole daft, silly notion because that is exactly what it was from the beginning.  Since this debate started last night I have been wondering who thought up the proposal.  I ask the Minister to drop the idea completely. He will not lose face if he does so.  If the Government decide that this measure should be scrapped completely they will gain face.  If they do that I will be one of the first to say that they have seen sense, that they realised it was a wrong measure, one aimed at keeping young people out of the job market.  I ask all Members, why should our young people be deprived of a chance?  It is their country, it is not just a country inhabited by us representing a certain number of <Col N="1528" /> people.  Our country has a very large population of young people under 25 years.  If we are seen to be party to any discriminatory action against them, we will not be serving the interests of the people, and particularly the young people.</P>
    <P>We realise that our motion prompted the partial climb-down by the Minister. I ask him to go the whole way and to drop the charge completely.  We must remember it is a charge for a job application form.  I ask the question, is this country to be governed just by a Government with no opposition?  I go back to Deputy Yates who said it is an insult to the taxpayers that the Opposition should bring in motions like this.  I represent a sizeable proportion of the people of Longford-Westmeath.  I mean to represent them and I will not be put off by such remarks and insults.  My party will not be put off from putting down motions on various matters or pointing out what they consider wrong actions by the Government.  I believe strongly in democracy and acting within the confines of a democracy.  I am very glad I live in a democratic country where there is a Government and an Opposition.  While there is an Opposition there is safety for all people in the country.</P>

      <P>: I am very disappointed with the way debate on this motion has proceeded.  I was in the House last night and I listened to the speeches of Deputy Fitzgerald, the Minister and Deputy Calleary and this evening I listened to Deputy Yates.  I find it difficult to accept what Deputy O'Rourke said about the contribution of Deputy Yates.  He sought to point out the difficulties arising for the taxpayers as a result of the change with regard to availability of jobs in the civil service.  Last year a position of trainee technician was advertised.  Interviews took place at a cost of £169,000.  From these interviews, 40 positions were filled. In effect, for the State to employ a technician trainee in 1982 cost £4,000 &mdash; £4,000 of the taxpayers' money to give a permanent pensionable job.  It is not reasonable to say that the Government were wrong to have another assessment <Col N="1529" /> of the costs involved in recruiting for the civil service.  Contrary to what Deputy O'Rourke believes, young people who go from interview to interview become very frustrated.  In a recent radio interview, young people alleged that the educational system as practised by Deputy O'Rourke led them completely astray.</P>

      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;to direct in the proper way people who are looking for jobs.  I can see no justification for taxpayers paying £4,000 to create a technician trainee job which is permanent and pensionable. When these school leavers are examined by the Civil Service Commission, the commission are bound, under the 1976 Act, to write to everyone of the applicants whereas in the private sector applicants may not get even an acknowledgment of their application.  Why should a permanent pensionable job cost five or six times more than a job in the private sector?  Take, for example, the ESB, where the cost of filling a job is £4.50, whereas it costs £30 to process the application in the civil service.  It is very hard to reconcile these levels of cost.  As the Minister said last night, if the general public and, indeed the Opposition, want the Civil Service Commission to continue to recruit, somebody has to pay, either the taxpayer or the applicant.  Deputy Yates and the Minister made reasonable points about the proportion of costs. Deputy O'Rourke was not listening too earnestly to what Deputy Yates said when he suggested that the £7 cost to a young person on a once-off basis as indicated by the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: I have my own contribution to make, but I was disappointed to hear the last two speakers on the Government side of the House indicate that a member of the Opposition has no right to speak unless he or she has a solution to the Government's problem.  That to me is a democratic heresy.  It is a challenge to the right of anybody who is elected to this House.  Indeed, I heard members of the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party when in Opposition saying that the Opposition are charged with attacking the Government.  I do not accept that and I do not intend to dwell on that point.  Rather I hope to dwell on what is before us, in the hope that, when finished, I might have softened the heart of the Minister in respect of what he is proposing with these charges.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I respect the Minister and I know him over some years.  He and I have been involved in educational matters in County Dublin.  We have been involved with youth and I do not accept &mdash; he can contradict me at some other stage &mdash; that this is the produce of his mind.  He realises that, especially in the times in which we live, it is not appropriate to be putting a tax on parents in respect of the legitimate pursuits of their offspring who are looking for employment.  That is what we <Col N="1532" /> are doing here.  I am not concerned about the situation which arises when any professional person applies for employment through the Civil Service Commission or any other commission.  Rather would I have them paying more than is required.  I am concerned that, in times where there is so much talk about the consideration we have for young people and for Irish families, here we are taxing the parents of the young who have completed their secondary education.  That is what the Government are doing.</P>
    <P>Already Deputy O'Rourke has referred to the fact that in respect of the intermediate and leaving certificates there is a charge of £20 for each examination. I know that charge was there during our term of office.  I did not agree with it then and I do not agree with it now.  Here we have another tax on the parents who make sacrifices so that their children can complete their education.  I disagree entirely with the approach of Deputy Yates who disappointed me very much, and latterly with Deputy Carey who would say that young people are disappointed when they do not succeed in these examinations.  The contrary is the position.  There is a pyschological benefit to young people who have applied for positions of this kind.  The hope is there and we are not deceiving them.  Formerly, the situation was that out of their own pocket money, by their own industry, they could pay for the stamp, write away for the form and fill it in.  They did not have to plead with their parents, as they had to for the previous years while at school for more money for books, for the bus, for the lunch.  Now they must plead for money so that they can hope to enter the civil service.  That is what is proposed here.  That is what the Minister is requiring of this House.  That is what this side of the House is rejecting.</P>
    <P>Here I compliment our spokesmen, Deputies Gene Fitzgerald and Séan Calleary who from the very beginning took issue with the Minister in respect of this charge as it affects young people especially. People are talking about a solution. I do not mind whatever the benefit would be if the Minister tells all the professional people already in employment <Col N="1533" /> who are anxious to opt into better employment that they must pay twice the fee they have been paying.  If he does that I would say: fair dues.  If the Minister tells me in respect of the professional people, former teachers, former members of Dublin Corporation, of Dublin Country Council who are on pension and who have as a sideline the correcting of papers that he proposes reducing their fees, I would say I do not disagree with that because I am concerned about helping the weakest.</P>
    <P>We should put another matter straight. I have heard Deputy Carey and Deputy Yates talk about the taxpayer, that it is not fair to be asking the taxpayer to do this.  The people about whom I am concerned are the surest taxpayers we have. I am not talking about the sons and daughters of the self-employed, or about the sons and daughters of large substantial farmers, or of big industrailists who receive subsidies from the State in other ways; I am talking about the sons and daughters of middle income people here who by virtue of the fact that they have these families are satisfying the first requirement in our society, who by virtue of having these families are making a contribution in income tax, VAT and so on.  In everything they do to sustain that family there is a pull from the Government into the pool out of which this is paid.  Deputy Carey and Deputy Yates, representing counties where there is that type of person, expect me to have pity on the taxpayer who is paying.  We are concerned about the families of the taxpayers and the situation that arises now.  Deputy Yates went back to 1961&mdash;1961 was the year it was discovered we could do without this charge &mdash; to find justification for it.</P>
    <P>Again, fair dues to the Minister because he has assured the House that he hopes it will be a very temporary measure. I hope the Minister will return to the Government and say: &ldquo;I am displeased with what I have been asked to do, especially in relation to the 50,000 young people who sat their intermediate certificate examination last year and the 45,000 who sat their leaving certificate last year&rdquo;.  The same numbers will be sitting for those examination this year. <Col N="1534" /> They are now on the market in response to the exhortations of their parents and teachers, to pursue a type of education. I will be critical of the type of education they have been pursuing in so far as it constitutes only a functional, relevant type of education that seems to satisfy those who say that education should be for employment only.  I would like to take a broader view of education and I would say to the Members of this House that perhaps it is those useless subjects we have left aside which were the real subjects of value, but that is for another day's debate.  But those teenagers, who have completed that education, who are not entitled to any dole, who are not entitled to any assistance, because they apply for employment, because they register with the State for employment, the Minister now proposes to charge them because, he says there is a service being provided.</P>
    <P>Is this the headline we are setting for the private sector?  Are we going to give justification to the banks, to Guinness's, to CIE, the ESB, all these, to follow the headline set by the Minister, a Minister belonging to this caring Government, who before the last election told them that they had a greater interest in youth? What does the Young Fine Gael group think about this, a group apparently who have studied the whole area of society, who are competent to speak about abortion, divorce, pro-life or anti-life amendments, who have the answer to all the problems of our youth?  Have they made representation to the Minister?  Has the former head of the National Youth Council, now advising the Government on behalf of youth, suggested that out of the £17 million or £30 million given to the Youth Employment Agency they might help the Minister who is searching around for a couple of hundred thousand pounds so that he can tax parents of young people applying for employment in our service? In a year when we had, on everybody's admission, the toughest budget ever&mdash;no relief in the matter of income tax for the parents of these children, when VAT was increased, with an extra 1 per cent being levied for youth employment&mdash;is this the gratitude the Minister and his Government are showing to the middle income <Col N="1535" /> taxpayer <i>in lieu</i> of all that?  I hope not.</P>
    <P>It has never been my practice to refer to what other speakers have said because they have the same entitlement to give expression to their thoughts as I have, but I must say, listening to young Deputy Yates, for whom I have the highest admiration, it was the first time I heard him indulge in emotional, useless terms, criticising this side of the House for putting on a hypocritical mask, and he was speaking on behalf of the hard-pressed taxpayer in Wexford.  At the same time he spoke on behalf of the youth of Wexford who have to travel up to Dublin to sit these examinations.  Apparently he has no thought for the young son or daughter of urban families.  I had the impression that Deputies Yates and Carey had got a ministerial injection, together with a certain amount of bureaucratic claptrap and statistics and told: &ldquo;Lads, go in there and fill in the gaps&rdquo;.  I will not refer to the proverb which speaks <Col N="1536" /> of the person who rushes in where others fear to tread.  But if they do it, they should do it in a manly courageous fashion. When we have applied ourselves to the subject of the motion and the amendment, with a view to extracting from the Minister a continuing softness of his heart and a continuation of the concern which allowed him succeed in having the £10 reduced to £7, and will allow that £7 be used in respect of a miscellany of applications, in the name of heavens, in the name of all that is good and holy, in the name of the young people, and of the taxpaying parents who have made continuing sacrifices on their behalf, would the Minister say to the House now, in one word, that he will do the right, the big thing and remove any question of a tax on parents in respect of applications their teenage sons or daughters may make to have employment in their own country?</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate . - Dumping of Chemical Waste.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise the serious effect indiscriminate dumping of chemicals can have on the fish life and flora off our coasts. Serious questions have arisen as a result of the recent disappearance of 41 drums of dioxin' contaminated waste which were earmarked for disposal on the European mainland.  The matter arose as a result of an explosion in the north Italian town of Seveso in 1976.  That was the worst pollution disaster on the European mainland to date and thousands of acres of land <Col N="1539" /> were rendered unhabitable.  Up to 1,000 people were evacuated long-term from the area and almost 80,000 livestock were slaughtered.  Dioxin has been described as one of the most highly toxic man-made substances known and since the explosion the Italian authorities have been faced with the problem of disposing of highly contaminated material waste.  I would have presumed that after a disaster of such magnitude the Italian authorities would have monitored the mop-up procedure closely.  Therefore, it is most suspicious that 41 barrels of waste have now &ldquo;gone missing&rdquo; on the European mainland. There is evidence that a truck cartrying 41 drums of material left Italy last autumn and passed through Marseilles in France but since then nobody has seen the barrels.  Earlier this week claims were made that the waste was on board a ship, <i>Matthias II</i>.  I approached the marine division of the Department of Transport on the matter and I was informed that the reports were incorrect.  I told that the Belgium police searched <i>Matthias II</i> in Antwerp on 4 April and no trace of the barrels was found on board.</P>
      <P>That information from the Department alleviates any worries about dumping by <i>Matthias II</i> but it still leaves many serious questions unanswered.  The information does not explain how the Italian and French Governments allowed such highly toxic material pass through their countries without proper monitoring. That seems to indicate that some arrangements or conspiracy exists between those governments to get rid of that highly dangerous waste in some irregular or unofficial manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The obvious means of disposal would be to dump the material at sea.  I am asking the Minister to have the Department of Foreign Affairs approach the Italian and French governments to get an assurance that the material has not been and will not be disposed of at sea.  The disappearance of 41 barrels of dioxin waste has aroused international interest. Recently the West German doctors association warned the Swiss pharmaceutical firm, Hoffman La Roche, that if they refused to make known the location of <Col N="1540" /> the 41 barrels of waste widespread boycott of the company's products would take place.  The Swiss firm is the parent company of the plant where the accident occurred in 1976.</P>
    <P>I raise this matter tonight because this waste may yet be disposed of at sea in an area which would affect our fish life.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that discussions take place with the European Governments already mentioned to ensure that such dumping will not take place in the seas off our coasts.  We must not relax in our efforts to protect our shores and we must give every possible support to the efforts being made to protect our environment.  I have made the point in a previous debate that we should be moving away for an acceptance of the oceans as repositories for our waste. There is an international right to a clean environment and this is supported by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Unilateral dumping of waste should be unacceptable to us.  This country took a firm line at the recent London Dumping Convention when we supported a Spanish motion that there should be an immediate cessation of nuclear dumping off our coasts pending an expert investigation into the methods of dumping and the possible environmental effects.  I compliment the Department on their very firm line and I ask them to take a similar line in this case and obtain clear-cut assurances that this waste, if not already dumped, will not be dumped off our coast.</P>
    <P>This whole episode smells of connivance and conspiracy between two countries to get rid of a highly dangerous substance by dumping it outside their own boundaries.  The question of maritime dumping should be the subject of a special debate here at some stage.  In the previous session the Minister for Industry and Energy accepted this point from the Leader of the Opposition and I hope that such a debate will be held at an early date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan) John F. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The dumping of waste at sea is controlled by the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, which gave <Col N="1541" /> effect to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, known as the London Dumping Convention, and to the Convention for the prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping from Ships and Aircraft, known as the Oslo Convention.</P>
      <P>In accordance with the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981, the dumping of any substance or material from ships, aircraft or marine structures within the territorial waters of the State or the loading within the State or its territorial waters of substances for dumping is an offence unless such dumping or loading is in accordince with a permit issued under the Act.  An Irish vessel, aircraft or marine structure dumping at sea outside territorial waters requires a permit either under the Act or form another state that is a party to the Oslo or London Conventions.  All states who are parties to the conventions have parallel responsibilities.  Thirteen states have ratified the Oslo Convention while 52 states have ratified the London Dumping Convention.</P>
      <P>The issue of dumping permits, with the exception of those relating to radioactive waste, is a function of my Department. The issue of permits for the dumping of radioactive waste is the responsibility of the Department of Industry and Energy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To provide for the enforcement of the provisions of the Act, authorised officers have been appointed by the Minister for Transport and specifically in respect of <Col N="1542" /> the harbours under their control by the various harbour authorities and Córas Iompair Éireann.  An authorised officer has wide powers enabling him, <i>inter alia</i>, to enter any vehicle place or premises, to board any vessel, aircraft or marine structure and to carry out any inspection and examination which he considers reasonably necessary.  He is empowered to detain a vessel, aircraft or marine structure if he suspects that a contravention of the Act is taking place or has already taken place.</P>
    <P>The Act provides for prosecution for offences and specifies the penalties for such offences.  In particular, it provides for substantial penalties, including imprisonment in certain cases, for contraventions of the restrictions on dumping imposed.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has referred to recent reports concerning the vessel <i>Matthias II</i>. This vessel left Antwerp on 5 April 1983 and incinerated liquid chemicals off the Dutch coast.  The vessel later loaded a similar cargo in Sweden and is en route to the same site to incinerate the cargo. I am informed that the vessel was not at any time carrying a cargo of dioxin from Seveso in Italy as reported.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy that we have already contacted the Department of Foreign Affairs on this issue and we hope to receive a report from them shortly.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.57 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 April 1983.</P>

      <P>: The provisions governing arbitration proceedings on claims by local authority officers are set out in the conciliation and arbitration scheme for local authority and health services.  Under the scheme, the report of the arbitration board is first considered by the management and staff sides who must signify to each other acceptance or rejection of the report.  In the event of it being accepted by both sides, then, in accordance with the scheme, the appropriate Minister must give his decision on the report within a specified period.  In the case of the arbitration board report of May 1982 affecting rate collectors, while the report was accepted some time ago by the staff side, I understand that it was accepted only last week by the management side. I received the report on Monday last and I will give my decision on it as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware that many local improvement scheme applicants in the west of Ireland were unable to proceed with their applications in 1982 due to the introduction of the minimum 10 per cent contribution requirement; whether this requirement will be dropped in 1983; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The local improvements scheme was adapted in 1981 to take account of EEC aid available under the western package for farm roads.  EEC Regulation 1820/80 stipulates that local landholders must contribute at least 10 per cent of the cost of eligible farm road projects.  It is <Col N="1416" /> considered that this requirement is not open to renegotiation.</P>
      <P>In order to avail of the EEC aid to the maximum extent possible, it was necessary in 1982 to require the county councils concerned to devote over 90 per cent of their allocations under the local improvements scheme to farm road projects eligible for EEC aid.  I am aware that, as a result, instances have arisen where other farm road projects could not be undertaken because the applicants concerned were not able to contribute a minimum of 10 per cent of the cost.</P>
      <P>The arrangements made for the local improvements scheme in 1983 enable some £646,000 to be spent on non-EEC work in western counties compared with £277,000 in 1982.  This money may, for example, be spent on farm road projects where payment of the 10 per cent minimum contribution would constitute a hardship.</P>

      <P>: I attended an informal meeting of EEC Energy Ministers on 15-16 December 1982 in Copenhagen, accompanied by three officials from my Department. Official Government transport was used apart from a return journey by commercial airline by one official who had to stay over for a meeting.  My costs amounted to £47 and those of my officials to £461.</P>
      <P>On 10 February 1983, I visited London in the course of negotiations on a possible natural gas contract with Northern Ireland.  I took advantage of the occasion to visit the British Parliament in connection with my duties as Leader of this House.  I was accompanied by seven officials from my Department and two from other Departments.  I and some of the officials travelled by official Government transport, the remainder of the party by commercial airline.  My costs amounted to approximately £27 and the total for officials was £828.</P>
      <P>At the invitation of Sheik Yamani, I visited Saudi Arabia during the period 25 February to 2 March 1983 for discussions about oil supply contracts and related matters.  I separately met the Governor of Petromin, the Saudi Arabian oil company. I also met Dr. Gusaibi, Minister for Industry and Electricity and acting Minister for Health to pursue possibilities for greater Irish involvement in development projects of various kinds in Saudi Arabia.  I also met the Saudi Minister for Economic Planning, Hisham Nasser.  I visited a number of existing Irish/Saudi projects.</P>
      <P>My journey also included an official visit to Bahrain where I was received by the Amir and met the Prime Minister and other Ministers.  The purpose of this visit was again to promote the continued involvement of Irish interests in development projects, in particular by the ESB.  I was accompanied by three departmental officials.  We travelled by official Government transport to Paris and other journeys were by commercial airlines. My costs amounted to £1,645.  The costs of transport, etc., for officials amounted to £5,980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 9 to 24 March 1983 I participated <Col N="1422" /> in an IDA industrial promotion tour in the United States during the course of which I visited a number of cities and important industrial centres there.  I also availed myself of the opportunity of visiting the Californian state capital in my official capacity as Leader of the House. I was accompanied by two officials from my Department.  Much of the cost was met by the IDA and the departmental costs were limited to approximately £787 incurred by me and £833 incurred by officials.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State at my Department attended an EEC Council of Ministers in Brussels on 7-8 February 1983. He was accompanied by two officials. Travel was by official Government transport. The expenses of the Minister of State amounted to approximately £76 and those of the officials to £133.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State attended another EEC Council of Ministers in Brussels on 9-10 March 1983.  Travel outward was by commercial airline and the return by official Government transport.  The total cost borne by my Department was £193 of which £70 was incurred by the Minister of State.</P>

      <P>: Work is in progress on a scheme to consolidate the pier at Killala by sheetpiling.  In addition the pier is being resurfaced and lights and ladders are being provided.  The fishermen who are seeking a dredging scheme have intimated that they would prefer such a scheme to the work being undertaken at present.  According to the technical advice available to me the sheetpiling is necessary to protect the pier structure by preventing undercutting and subsidence. The question of dredging the approach channel has been considered in the past but it was decided, on technical advice, not to proceed with it.  I am, however, having the matter re-examined.</P>
      <P>A proposal to dredge an area adjacent to the co-op premises to facilitate the smaller boats is also being examined.</P>

      <P>: The following is the information requested by the Deputy:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>Number of Foreign Trips since 14/12/1982:</P>
      <P>Minister, three, Minister of State, None.</P>
      <P>Details of Foreign Visits</P>
      <P>1.  I travelled by Government jet to a one-day meeting of the EEC Council of Ministers (Transport) in Brussels on 15 December 1982.  I was accompanied by four officials&mdash;two each from the Department of Transport and Department of the Environment.  The total cost of my visit to the Exchequer was £120&mdash;the cost for officials was £1,219.</P>
      <P>2.  I, in my capacity as both Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, visited the United States between 26 March and 10 April 1983 for the following purposes:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1429" />
    </P>
    <P>(a)  To inquire into developments in new telecommunications technology with particular reference to job maintenance and job creation in Ireland in this field as well as examining new developments that may be used to improve and make more cost-effective Ireland's telecommunications development programme and telephone repairs;</P>
    <P>(b)  To examine developments in satellite and cable broadcasting with a view to exploring upcoming opportunities for Ireland;</P>
    <P>(c)  To promote Aer Lingus, CIE Tours International, SFADCo, Bord Fáilte and Irish tourism in general;</P>
    <P>(d)  To visit the Boeing Aircraft Company Plant with the Aer Lingus Chief Operating Officer;</P>
    <P>(e)  To examine the affairs of the Aer Lingus-owned Dunfey Hotel chain.</P>
    <P>I also took the opportunity of speaking to large numbers of Irish-American community and club leaders regarding the evils of violence in Ireland and the misdirecion of Irish-American funds for this purpose.  I travelled by Aer Lingus to the US.  I was accompanied by two officials (one from the Department of Transport and the other from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs) at meetings and functions during different parts of the trip.  The total cost of my visit to the Exchequer is estimated to be approximately £1,600.  The estimated cost for the accompanying officials is £2,800.</P>
    <P>3.  On 15 April 1983 I visited Holyhead for one day&mdash;on a B &amp; I promoional trip&mdash;to address a function to publicise the first anniversary of the introduction of B &amp; I's Dublin Port/Holyhead car ferry service and to meet local authority leaders in the vicinity of Holyhead.  No official Government transport was used.  The Minister was accompanied by one official from the Department of Transport. There was no cost to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>: Tenders were invited on 10 June 1982 for provision of offices at Athlone, Ballina, Galway, Killarney and Sligo under the decentralisation programme.  Tenders were not invited for offices at Cavan and Letterkenny.  Provision was made in the Estimates for 1983, which were published in November 1982, for the commencement of the programme but, as stated in the Principal Features of the Budget statement, the programme has been cancelled to achieve a saving of £5 million in 1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the majority of cases where a claimant's complete insurance record is available no undue delay occurs in the processing of claims to unemployment benefit and payment is made without delay.  In a minority of cases, however, <Col N="1440" /> delay can occur where there is no record of the claimant's contribution record.  In such cases in order to enable payment to be made as quickly as possible alternative evidence is accepted to establish entitlement to benefit such as the form P.60 which employees receive annually in April from their employers.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to disability benefit is that payments are issued promptly where claims are made correctly and the claimants are qualified on their insurance records for the receipt of benefit.</P>
      <P>Delay in payment can arise where a claimant is not qualified for payment of benefit on the available insurance record and it is necessary to make enquiries in order to establish title to benefit.  The duration of the delay in such cases will depend on the time taken to complete the inquiries.  Delays in payment also occur where medical certificates are not submitted promptly to my Department or where incorrect RSI numbers are quoted.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that I fully accept the necessity for the speedy processing of claims for all social welfare benefits and in this connection I would urge claimants to play their part in the process. It is of the utmost importance for claimants to submit claims promptly and to give complete information with their claims including the full name and address and the correct RSI number.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 12 February 1982 to 27 April 1982.  She was not entitled to payment of benefit because, according to the records of the Department, she had not the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in 1980-81, the contribution year governing her claim.  According to the records of the Department she had 15 credited contributions in that year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Payment of disability benefit was not <Col N="1441" /> made on her subsequent claim from 30 November 1982 to 1 January 1983 as the record of her contributions in the 1980-81 year also governed this claim.</P>
    <P>From 3 January 1983, the commencement of a new benefit year, her claim is, however, governed by the 1981-82 contribution year.  She has 34 credited contributions in that year.  These contributions were not, however, associated with her claim in January last with the result that payment was not made at that stage. Payment has now been issued for the period from 3 January 1983 to 2 February 1983.  Payment was disallowed after that date following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She has been informed of the decision to disallow payment of benefit and advised of her right to appeal if she is dissatisfied with the decision.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>He claimed unemployment benefit on 28 December 1982 and he was paid flat-rate unemployment benefit at the rate of £68.05 weekly as payments became due. It was, however, necessary to ascertain his average weekly earnings to enable his <Col N="1443" /> entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit to be determined as payment is subject to the limitation that the total flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax refund may not exceed 85 per cent of his net average weekly earnings. The enquiries were recently completed and the 85 per cent limit applicable to him amounted to £80.39.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, he was allowed pay-related benefit at £12.34 weekly and all arrears due to him were paid last week. Further combined payments of £80.39 representing flat-rate unemployment benefit £68.05 and pay-related benefit £12.34 will be made as they become due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The person concerned was awarded a widow's contributory pension at the rate of £36.25 per week with effect from 1 April 1983.  This is the maximum rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children.</P>
      <P>A widow's pension book with orders payable from 15 April 1983 was issued to the designated post office on 12 April 1983 for collection by her.  She had previously been in receipt of invalidity pension and this book was returned by her, the date of the last order cashed being 7 April 1983.</P>
      <P>As widow's and invalidity pensions are not payable concurrently, her invalidity pension claim will now be treated as a claim to disability benefit which can be paid at a reduced rate together with widow's pension.  She will be advised shortly of the position regarding her entitlement to disability and the arrears of widow's pension due for the period from 1 April 1983 to 14 April 1983, less any deductions to recover monies overpaid in the form of invalidity pension, will be issued to her by payable order.</P>

      <P>: When the person concerned claimed unemployment benefit she conveyed that she had been employed in the United Kingdom during the period 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981.  Details of her British contribution record were requested to enable her entitlement to unemployment benefit to be determined in accordance with the provisions of EEC Regulations.</P>
      <P>However, the British authorities were unable to furnish details of United Kingdom contributions during the period and further inquiries were undertaken in the case.  It was established that she entered Irish insurable employment on 1 November 1981 and consequently she was awarded pre-entry credited contributions. The effect of this was to qualify her for unemployment benefit on the basis of her Irish contribution record and payment at the maximum weekly rate of £31.65 was authorised in her case.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made to pay all arrears due to her this week and further payments will be made as weekly payments become due.</P>

The assessment of his means, consisting of half the weekly value of capital and the weekly letting value of his wife's share of a holding, entitles him to pension at this rate.
