    <Title>Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 32.</P>
    <P>In page 14, subsection (2) (a), line 45, to delete &ldquo;7&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;12&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Posts and Telegraphs)</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asking last night about the reason for having 12 members on these boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The two boards will be a very important part of the new organisation. I am anxious that the final composition of the boards will be organised as soon as possible&mdash;I have an amendment in this respect which we will come to later.  I appeal to the Minister that when he is selecting the members of the two boards he will reappoint the members of the interim boards.  It is only right and proper that those members who have worked so hard on the interim boards would be reappointed, because then the boards would have the benefit of their experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On An Bord Telecom there will be five selected members and seven appointed members.  It would be appropriate that one of the unions would have at least one representative.  According to our legislation the POWU would not be given permission to elect a representative on the <Col N="1806" /> board.  About 5,000 telephonists will be transferred from the Department to An Bord Telecom but they would not have representatives on the board to look after their interests.  Therefore I suggest there should be an amendment to allow at least one representative of the POWU to be a director on the board.  I would appreciate it if the Minister would confirm for me whether there is a member of the POWU on the interim board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil did not put on a member.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will explain the situation. There may be some confusion here because we have the temporary board, an interim board and eventually the statutory board.  On An Bord Telecom there is a representative of the IPOEU and Mr. O'Sullivan of the Local Government and Public Services Union.  In the case of An Bord Poist there is a representative of the POWU, Mr. Quinlan, General Secretary, and Mr. Cardiff of the FWUI.  It is my intention to reappoint these people on the interim board and to add two further trade union representatives. Pending the election of the statutory board there will be four working directors in the case of An Bord Telecom and five working directors in the case of An Bord Poist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will probably agree that the present chairman of An Bord Poist, Mr. Quinn, and the chairman of An Bord Telecom, Mr. Smurfit, have both given very distinguished service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>Those who praise may criticise.  I would like to be associated with Deputy Leyden's remarks because they are worth putting on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I was seeking a minimum number, but the Minister has gone even further and I am very happy to accept his amendment.  There is no disagreement on this matter.</P>
      <P>I know the work that has been done by the interim boards, who have been operating without any powers over the past few years.  It is very frustrating for a board to operate without any statutory power. Mr. Garvey, the Chief Executive of An Bord Poist, and Mr. Byrne of An Bord Telecom, have been studying the system in great detail.  Both will be appointed under this Bill because they have gained great experience and have built up a very good relationship with the executives and chief executives of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I do not want to labour the point but we are both on the same wavelength in this matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no pirates in this case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>For continuity of leadership there is a case to be made for the reappointment to this statutory board, which I hope will be set up in six months &mdash; and not later than 12 months &mdash; of the chairmen and people who served with distinction on the two boards.  They will ensure that these companies will be steered steadily through the troubled waters ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both boards have extremely capable people working on them.  Irrespective of what Deputy O'Sullivan said, we had a good representative of the trade union movement on An Bord Telecom.  I believe the POWU should have at least one representative on An Bord Telecom, who will represent 5,000 telephonists who will be going through a very difficult period in the next few years and who will require a voice on the board.  On behalf of these telephonists I appeal to the Minister to invite a representative of their union on the interim board to allow a representative of that union to be <Col N="1808" /> appointed also to the permanent board. I hold no brief for anybody.  But I received detailed representations from all the unions involved and I am impressed by the service they are providing for their members.  I believe they should be given adequate representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>We are increasing the number of directors from seven to 12 but my honest opinion is that seven is enough.  The people appointed to these boards will have to be paid a salary to be decided by the Minister in consultation with the Minister for Finance.  My greatest fear is that we are building another bureaucracy.  The fewer people there are at the top of any organisation the better chance there is that it will have a solid foundation.  Here we have the opportunity of setting up this board and we should be trying to keep costs down.  It is an unnecessary and undesirable move to increase the number of directors from seven to 12.</P>
      <P>If we proceed along these lines we will be setting an example which may be followed right down the line.  People will be appointed throughout the country but what we want is an efficient service and we should give an example by keeping the board of directors small.  This would be more economical and more efficient because the bigger the board the more secretarial and managerial staff will be necessary to service it.  The board should be a tight-knit, efficient unit, and expanding it further will not add to its efficiency or help to improve the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why is it necessary to increase the number on the board?  There appears to be agreement on this point and maybe I am a lone voice, but in my view we should be setting an example.  If we increase the number of directors somebody will have to pay.  Not enough attention has been given to the paying public, the people who will receive this service.  We should be trying to help these people because to date they have been given a service which has been very unsatisfactory.  Because the service was so unsatisfactory everybody was happy to move into an area where we would set up boards.  The interests of the paying public, the people who are <Col N="1809" /> receiving this service, must be taken into account.  If we build up a huge bureaucracy, the danger is that the paying public will not get the service to which they are entitled.  This could be the start of something, and we should have a further look at it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's amendment.  Deputy Mac Giolla and I put down a similar amendment.  Basically it is the amendment the Post Office Worker's Union were anxious to have included in the Bill.  The amendment attempts to ensure that there is adequate provision to enable a sufficient number of worker directors to be elected to the board.  For that reason the numbers have had to be expanded.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that an additional five directors is a huge increase in a bureaucratic structure.  I am not at all that taken with the idea that in itself bureaucracy is a bad thing.  This House could not function without a bureaucratic structure.  We would not have our Order Papers or any of the various services on which this House survives without a bureaucratic structure.  I am not all that taken with the idea of condemning bureaucracy.  It can go too far, but I do not believe increasing the number of directors from seven to 12 is a move in that direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister has power to appoint directors to the board.  I urge him to ensure that the directors he appoints are committed to the public service and have not got a business interest which could be at variance with the interests of An Bord Telecom or An Bord Phoist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind my colleagues that we have approximately 90 sections to get through.  At the rate we are going, we will not reach some of the really important sections which are causing grave concern to many people, sections dealing with licensing, security of tenure, and other important areas.  We will not reach them if Deputies are repetitive. I ask for the co-operation of all Deputies.  Last night Deputy Mac Giolla voiced the same concern.  Repetition is far from satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1810" /> I am glad the Minister introduced this amendment which was also submitted by The Workers' Party.  It gives room for industrial democracy.  If we are to have industrial democracy it is only right and fair that the Government should give a lead.  They have done so in this case.  I am glad the Minister accepted the necessity to increase the number.  I do not agree with Deputy Enright in this regard.  By any stretch of the imagination 12 is not a big number on any board.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the remarks made by Deputy Leyden <i>vis-á-vis</i> the existing board, that they should continue on by virtue of the fact that they have given service.  Service should be recognised. I am a little suspicious because Deputy Leyden went so far as to name people in the House who should be retained on the board.  This is rather irregular behaviour.</P>
    <P>Part of the problem in the public sector to date has been that we have had people in it who were not committed to it.  They headed semi-State bodies and they had no commitment to them.  At the first opportunity, if there was an offer from a private concern they opted out.  That has been the problem down through the years.  They acquired expertise in the State sector and then they snapped at the first carrot dangled before them.  If we have people who are committed to the State sector and are prepared to stick with it and develop it, we will have two very successful enterprises.  The history of State enterprise to date has been bedevilled by the fact that from time to time we had people who were not committed to it.  That is the great tragedy of State enterprise.</P>
    <P>I hope that, in choosing people to act as directors, the Minister will choose people who have a commitment and the necessary expertise as well.  There is a need to spell out clearly that there should not be a conflict of interest on the part of people on the board who may profit from being on the board.  That is equally important.  This position could be quite lucrative for some people.  There will be massive contracts available.  Huge sums of money may be transferred.  Anybody on the board will be on the inside track. <Col N="1811" /> There must be no conflict of interest. Interest should be declared.  Anybody who is interested in getting a contract from either of the two companies should be excluded from the boards.  That would ensure that members will act in the best interests of the State.  I welcome the Minister's amendment.  I have no doubt that he will consider giving representation to members of the Post Office Workers' Union who are not represented at the moment.  I thank him for that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>My intervention will be brief.  I take slight issue with my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan.  Everybody in this House can interpret what is and what is not a priority.  Otherwise we would not be here at all.  It strikes me that in the debate there is sympathy for the point of view of the trade unions.  I welcome the extension of the board to ensure that there will be representation for the trade unions.  I am not impressed by the mild attack Deputy O'Sullivan made on business people who have made a contribution to the existing service.  My main purpose in rising to speak is to make sure that the voice of the person these services are intended to serve, the consumer, is heard.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is understandable that trade unions want representation.  They will be protecting their interests.  Nobody suggests that a businessman or a manufacturer should be on the board to promote his own interest.  That would be abhorrent to the House.  Ideally those boards are there to serve the consumer, not the trade unions, not businessmen, not industrialists, but the person who is paying for the service.  I should like the Minister to tell me what formula he has to serve the needs of the consumer.  I am at variance with my colleague, Deputy Enright, on the number of members on the boards.  I want the Minister to assure me that there will be representatives of the man and woman in the street on the boards, the consumer who will be paying for all this.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the directorships.  This is the power hub of any board.  I would not limit membership to seven.  I am glad it is being extended to 12.  If it is not anticipated that the consumer will have a directorship, the section should be extended further.  That is the extent of my contribution.  We are promoting the cause of the trade unions and we should be in sympathy with the work force of the two State services, the postal and telecommunications services. Their interests must be guarded.  I do not think they need have any fears in respect of either side of the House that those interests will be guarded irrespective of whether they dominate the directorship or not but, please, let us not forget the taxpayer who is paying for it all and let us guarantee that his interests will also be served.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear Deputy Tunney speak as he has spoken. I absolutely agree with what he has been saying.  I do not very often agree with him but I think he is absolutely correct in everything he says about the consumer interest here.  Everybody sympathises with the workforce in the Post Office and with every other work force including those out of work altogether.  One of the great handicaps which industrial development carries in this country is the abominable telephone service and to some extent the telex, telegram and postal services, although the telephone service is by miles the worst.  The fact that it is so abominable deprives people of jobs because it is a very important element in making a negative decision for industrial investment here by foreign capital. The relevance of what Deputy Tunney says might have been pitched even more strongly than he did pitch it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I tend to sympathise with Deputy Enright's view that seven is enough and 12 is probably too many, particularly since the section as it stands merely prescribes a minimum of seven at the moment but permits the Minister, provided <Col N="1813" /> he can get his colleague in the Department of Finance to permit it, to enlarge that number without limit.  In other words, if the Minister has in mind to appoint any particular person or category of persons over and above seven he can do so without this amendment at all. What he is seeking to do is to retain the power to inflate the size of this board without limit but to raise the floor from seven to 12 as being the minimum number of directors.  I confess that, although I am bound by the superior wisdom of my side and if this is voted on I will have to support the Minister and assume that he is right and I am wrong, I think he is wrong here.  I do not see any reason for this enlargement when he has already got this discretionary power to go beyond the figure of seven if he and the Minister for Finance decide that is in the public interest.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy O'Sullivan's plea that the Minister should take care that no possibility of a conflict of interest can arise on the part of people appointed to this board.  The older one gets the more astonished one is by the ruthlessness, not to say dishonesty, of people who are perfectly willing to exploit a situation in which they find themselves, thanks to a public duty, for their own private advancement.  Although I have no individual in mind here I have run across enough instances of it in my time to make me cynical.  Deputy O'Sullivan's warning is very well placed and I hope the Minister will make sure that this particular topic is never the subject of criticism of himself or of any Minister who may hereafter be in his seat.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan, however, began by talking about people in the State sector who were not committed to it and who would then tend to wander off to private enterprise or would get creamed off by private enterprise.  Deputy O'Sullivan has got the situation the wrong way around.  I am delighted that the public sector should contain people who make such a mark in the service of the public sector that private industry wants to have them.  My fear is that too many of the people in our public sector are people whom private industry sees as unemployable <Col N="1814" /> in market conditions and would not touch at any price.  If somebody has demonstrated by his operations in the public sector that he is efficient and businesslike and that he brings success with him then that man has been committed to the public service for the length of time he has been in it.  It is proved by the best yardstick of the lot, namely, that private enterprise, which operates in the market and does not have a statutory duty to anybody, wants to get hold of him.  That, to me, is a sign that the public sector has rung the bell here for once.  When we find on the other hand the public sector being run by people who are not being creamed off by private industry because private industry could not find a use for them then it is a moment for a Minister to decide that it is time to change his whole board around and put people in of a different hue and stamp.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy De Rossa that the way this Committee Stage debate has been organised is unfortunate.  This is an immensely important Bill.  It is the first time since 1908 that basic legislation affecting the postal and telephone service has been the subject of parliamentary discussion.  It is the first time since long before any of us were born and it is a shame that we should be having to discuss this in a day and a half&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>If we looked at the reasons for the setting up of these boards we might have a different outlook in relation to the directors.  The services which we now propose to hive off to two different companies were provided under the aegis of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Having given consideration to this matter it was decided that the best way to make those services available to the public would be through the medium of these two companies.  The consumer interest is of basic importance.  These are commercial enterprises.  The members of the interim boards of these two companies were selected because they had proved successful in their own fields.  I felt at the time that if we could get people to serve on these boards who had already proved successful in their own fields we would have a much better chance of being successful in our efforts to provide a better postal and telecommunications service.  I was strongly in favour of trade union representation on the interim boards.  Trade union representatives were appointed.  They were appointed simply because at that time there was no machinery for election from the ranks of the trade unions.  It will be a changed situation in the case of the statutory boards.  The people who are now serving on these boards had proved themselves as very successful business people and they took on an onerous task.  Successful business people are not particularly anxious to try their hands at what is quite clearly a very difficult proposition on the basis that if they fail it could affect their <Col N="1816" /> general standing as successful business people.  These people should be thanked for taking on the task and I ask the Minister when he is appointing new directors to the board to give very favourable consideration to the people who served during a very difficult time.</P>

      <P>I wholeheartedly welcome the involvement of people in the trade unions and having them represented on these boards.  The board would have no chance of success unless there was worker participation at director level.  Deputy Faulkner spoke about getting people in from outside businesses to take an active part in this and he mentioned that they might not be successful. The public purse will have to carry the can in the event of failure but the people who will be brought in will have the necessary expertise and I do not think there is a danger of failure.  Deputy De Rossa said he did not see anything wrong with bureaucracy but we must remember that someone has to pay for it.  We are talking about two separate companies and increasing the membership of these boards from seven to 12.  That is ten additional people at that level and that is why I am expressing concern on this matter.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 33:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (2), lines 3 to 5, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" />&ldquo;(b)  the chairman and two-thirds of the directors shall be appointed and may be removed from office by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  A third of the directors shall be elected in the manner prescribed in section 32 of this Act.  The directors other than those nominated by the Minister may not be removed by the Minister without prior consultation with the recognised trade unions and staff associations in the case of the directors elected under section 32 of this Act;&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This section enables the Minister to remove directors from the board and the amendment seeks to require him to consult with the trade unions and staff associations in a case where he intends to remove worker directors, that is directors who have been elected by the work force in the two companies.  It is simply a means of protecting the interests of those who have been elected rather than appointed by him.</P>

      <P>This is standard format under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises Act,) 1977, and if we did it here it would create a precedent.  I know the Minister for Labour has that Act under review with the intention of updating it so it would be dealt with by the Department of Labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment and I appeal to the Minister to consider it in the light of the debate we had yesterday and the approach he took to proposals put forward.  In fairness to the section and the amendment, basically it means that the Minister could not remove people who were elected by the unions and their representatives and there is a lot to be said for that.  In any event it is very unlikely to arise unless the board were not carrying out their statutory functions and a decision would have to be made if that happened.  It is a safeguard that in the event of the board not carrying out the functions laid down in the Bill the Minister could remove members. However, the unions should be <Col N="1818" /> informed of events taking place because the people on the board representing staff associations are elected by them and I would not like the Minister to have that power.  I suggest that The Workers' Party should withdraw this amendment and that the Minister should consider it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Our amendment does not seek to take from the Minister the power to remove directors.  It merely requires him to consult with the recognised trade unions and associations from which the directors have been elected.  I do not see that if conflicts with anything else.  It may not be the practice in other State companies but that is not a good reason for not introducing it at this point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 34:</P>
      <P>In page 15, subsection (2), lines 12 to 15, to delete paragraph (e) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  the company shall, in consultation and agreement with recognised trade unions and staff associations, set up machinery for the purposes of negotiations concerned with the pay and conditions of service of its staff;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 sets out provisions which must be included in the articles of association of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  The purpose of this amendment is to require the agreement of the staff organisations for any staff negotiation machinery to be set up by the companies <Col N="1819" /> and not merely consultation with those organisations.  The amendment is proposed in deference to a recommendation made by staff unions and associations in the course of the on-going consultations about the re-organisation.  In practice, negotiating machinery would be ineffective if it were unacceptable to staff associations and unions.  The amendment also substitutes the words &ldquo;recognised trade unions and staff associations&rdquo; for the words &ldquo;any organisation appearing to it to be appropriate&rdquo; in the original.  This too is in response to staff representations. The original words were intended only to relate to recognised trade unions and staff associations and not to unspecified other organisations but such recognition was envisaged specifically under and in accordance with the agreed formal negotiation machinery rather than before such machinery is established.  It is accepted now that that recognition need not necessarily be so delayed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De. Rossa Mr. De. Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De. Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We will withdraw amendment No. 35 in favour of the Minister's amendment No. 34.  The record of the staff of the Post Office over the past 60 or 70 years is excellent in terms of negotiations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The only variation in my amendment No. 34a is that it specifies postmasters of sub-post offices which are not regarded as staff.  In that regard I asked a parliamentary question on 8 June 1983 about when the results of a joint arbitration on pay and conditions of postmasters of sub-offices would be available. The Minister said that the hearing of the claim was still continuing and that it was not possible to say when the arbitrator's report would be available.  I should like to ask the Minister to expedite that pay agreement because it should be settled before the boards come into operation. It is appropriate to mention the word &ldquo;postmasters&rdquo; or &ldquo;sub-post offices&rdquo; in this amendment.  It strengthens the postmasters' position in relation to negotiations. I am very anxious that the Minister would include that title and that my amendment be accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unable to accept Deputy Leyden's amendment.  Negotiating machinery for staff and postmasters are quite different.  Postmasters are contractors as distinct from employees.  The existing negotiating machinery for postmasters forms part of the contractual conditions of postmasters and would therefore be suitable for adoption to take account of the establishment of An Post, to be carried forward to a new company in accordance with section 39.</P>
      <P>I understand that in discussions with the postmasters union, clear and specific undertakings have been given in relation to future negotiating machinery in An Post.</P>

      <P>In page 15, subsection (2), lines 16 to 18, to delete paragraph (f).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment proposes to delete paragraph (f) which requires that the company shall not invest in any other undertaking without the approval of the Minister and after the consent of the Minister for Finance.  I consider the section to be too restrictive and also to be inflexible. We were told that the reason for establishing a company rather than a <Col N="1829" /> statutory corporation was to give the board flexibility in deciding on their business. I understand also that the manner in which the board carry out their business will be governed by the memorandum and articles of association and that they cannot invest in a company other than those which are related directly to their existing business and which are governed by the memorandum and articles of association.  These articles and memorandum cannot be changed without the permission of the Minister.  Subsection (2) (f) is too restrictive and will result in inflexibility in the board.  For that reason I seek to have it deleted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is unacceptable.  The primary purpose of the companies is to provide an efficient postal and telecommunications service and they will be expected to concentrate their financial resourses accordingly.  Investment in outside undertakings might not necessarily be related to those services and could affect those services adversely.  As the State, in the person of the Minister for Finance will be guaranteeing the borrowing of the companies it is reasonable to require ministerial approval for outside investments.  There is no reason why reasonable proposals for such investments would not be approved.</P>

      <P>Deputy De Rossa is asking us to give certain freedoms which other State companies such as Aer Lingus do not enjoy.  The Minister is a shareholder in the companies and it is only right that he exercise some control over the type of investment proposed to be entered into.  It is necessary to retain this paragraph in the Bill and I am opposed to the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2) (f) is restrictive and a lot of Deputies on both sides of the House have urged that the boards be given as much freedom as possible consistent with the interests of the public and the need to provide an efficient and comprehensive service.  The <Col N="1830" /> paragraph does not refer to &ldquo;outside undertakings&rdquo; it says:</P>
      <P>the company shall not invest in any other undertaking without the approval of the Minister.</P>
      <P>That is far too restrictive.  The Minister will appoint most of the directors, the rest of them will be elected by the employees of the company and the memorandum and articles will be prepared in consultation with the Minister so I cannot see a necessity for restricting the activities of the companies further.  Also, if the articles of association have to be changed the Minister's permission must be sought. I press this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should say why he feels it necessary to retain this section.  The wording in paragraph (f) means that the companies will be restricted very much.  However, from a democratic point of view the Members of this House have no objection to some form of control by the Minister.  There would be a lot of merit in deleting this subsection.  This paragraph could inhibit the company from getting involved in advantageous business activities.  Would this paragraph preclude the companies from getting involved in the courier service in competition with illegal couriers? Would it restrict An Bord Telecom from becoming involved in the supply of internal telephones, other consumer equipment associated with telephones and other business activities which would complement their main activity?  The Minister's views on this should be recorded to be a guideline to the companies when they are considering business ventures.</P>

      <P>The Posts and Telegraphs Review Group in chapter 14 (20) of their report recommended that subject to the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs new bodies should be empowered to invest in any undertaking carrying on an activity which appears to them to be requisite, advantageous or incidental to or it appears to them to facilitate the performance by them of any of their functions.  This recommendation <Col N="1831" /> was accepted in the 1981 White Paper.  In addition, since the Minister for Finance will, under section 26 of the Bill, be empowered to guarantee approved borrowing by the bodies, it is considered appropriate that his prior consent ought to be required before they invest in outside undertakings.  Section 16 (2) (f) of the Bill provides accordingly.  It is not unreasonable that the Minister, who will own almost all of the shares on behalf of the public, should expect to be consulted about any outside investments they might contemplate.  There may be some concern about how the provisions would operate in practice but there is no reason why reasonable proposals would not be approved.  It is a fairly normal provision which should be accepted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The paragraph states that the company shall not invest in any other undertaking without the approval of the Minister.  Both the Minister and the Minister of State keep emphasising &ldquo;outside undertakings&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Outside undertakings&rdquo; imply undertakings which have no connection with the business for which the board was established whereas &ldquo;any undertaking&rdquo; precludes them from investing in anything without the Minister's approval.</P>

      <P>This paragraph should stand.  The two boards are being set up with public money.  If these bodies were to move into other fields of business they could come into open competition with firms which are operating on a knife edge and they could cause difficulties for these firms.  The Bill as set out ensures that the companies will deal in their own sphere and that other business investments would have to be approved by the Minister. That is a reasonable provision when public funds are involved.  If the investments proposed come within the ambit of the boards' terms of reference, approval would be forthcoming.  The setting up of these boards means the setting up of new structures and I feel that the paragraph is necessary.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(2)  The telecommunications company shall issue shares to the Minister to the value of the property transferred to it on the vesting day in accordance with sections 37 and 38, less the amount by which sums issued by the Minister for Finance under the Telecommunications Capital Acts, 1924 to 1981, which have not been repaid before that day exceed the sum of £355,000,000 plus the amount of the outstanding liability of the Minister to Irish Telecommunications <Col N="1834" /> Investments Limited immediately before the vesting day.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment has two purposes.  First, it deletes all references to loans <i>et cetera</i> involving Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited which were included in reserve, that is, in case any loans arose.  This is not appropriate now as no such loans have arisen and none is envisaged.  Secondly, it corrects the reference to £355 million of unpaid advances under the Telecommunications Capital Acts, 1924 to 1981, which are to be converted into shares of An Bord Telecom Éireann and provides for an additional amount of those advances to be converted into shares of An Bord Telecom Éireann corresponding to the liability of the telecommunications service for unpaid leasing charges of that amount which BTE will be required to discharge to Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited under section 39.  The balance of the unpaid advances under those Acts will be a liability of BTE to discharge under the new section 35 being inserted by amendment No. 116.

Subsection (4) prohibits him from disposing of those shares by sale <i>et cetera.</i>  All the other shares in each company will be owned by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs on behalf of the State.

      <P>This deals with the issue of share capital.  I accept the Minister's amendment but I am interested in the possibility of issuing shares to a third party under this section.  I am not opposed in principle to the company raising money from private sources or on the money markets but I do not want a loss of control on the part of either company through the issue of these shares.  Would the Minister introduce an amendment on Report Stage to ensure such shares will not carry voting rights?  It is essential that the company should retain control and any sale of shares should not carry voting rights.  That is essential if the companies are to retain control.</P>

If any attempts were made in that direction the matter would have to come before this House.  The purpose of the amendment is to preclude the Minister from selling any of the shares in either company in the absence of specific enabling legislation.  It has never been the intention that the Minister should sell any of the shares.  The amendment should also allay staff fears by reinforcing the point that the postal and telecommunications services will remain firmly within the public sector.  Similar steps to prevent the prohibition on the sale of State owned shares exist in relation to both the National Stud and Fóir Teoranta.</P>

Yesterday we were talking about the European Investment Bank and the disbursement of moneys and I complained, and this was the general view of the House, that a Department as important as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs when getting money from the European Investment Bank get it <i>via</i> the Exchequer.  But the advantage of the low rate of interest is not transferred to the Department; it is enjoyed by the Exchequer.  Often in the past we had the Road Fund, for example, raided for money and the expenditure of those funds bore no relation whatsoever to the original purpose for which the fund had been formed.  We do not have any amendment down but we comment on it for the benefit of some future Minister of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No.44:</P>
      <P>In page 16, subsection (1), after line 51, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) For the purposes of this subsection moneys borrowed in a currency other than the currency of the State shall be deemed to be the equivalent in the currency of the State of the actual moneys borrowed, such equivalent being calculated according to the rate of exchange at the time of the borrowing for that currency and the currency of the State.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment deals with section 25 (1).  This is a standard provision setting limits for borrowing for capital purposes by An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom <Col N="1841" /> Éireann at £58.5 million and £1,400 million respectively.  The purpose of the amendment is to protect against currency fluctuations by providing for the conversion of foreign currency to Irish punts at the time of the actual draw down.  A similar provision was made for the ESB in section 3 of the Electricity Supply (Amendment) Act and is already made in section 26 (3) of the Bill in relation to limits on ministerial guarantee of the companies' borrowing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not disagree with the section but I should like to refer to comments made yesterday in regard to both companies.  The Minister informed us he would not have any influence over the boards in relation to the banks they would be involved with.  I suggest the Minister should reconsider the position. It is possible that both boards will spread their financial business among two or three Irish banks.  That could be a very lucrative business for the banks.  There may be much lobbying among the banking organisations to get the business of the two companies.</P>
      <P>I wonder has the Minister any bias.  I personally have not because, like most Deputies, all the banks are represented in my constituency.  However, I should like to see fair competition between all the banks.  This will be the biggest single transfer of finance business since the foundation of the State.  I remember when the health boards were set up we had a most unseemly row between two banking organisations for the business.  A most amazing situation developed in the Western Health Board area.  At one meeting of the Western Health Board a particular bank was appointed but at following meetings that decision was rescinded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should give this matter special consideration.  There is no specific provision in the Bill to ensure that the Irish banking institutions &mdash; the registered licensed banks &mdash; will be allowed to tender for the business of both companies. Indeed the Bill does not specifically exclude outside banking interests from getting involved.  The Bill does not provide <Col N="1842" /> that the Department of Finance, through the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, could give a licence to An Bord Poist, in particular, to finance the board from the Savings Bank and the other banking activities carried out by the Department at the moment.</P>
    <P>I would express a note of warning here because of what I read about the situation in my constituency in regard to the health board.  Certain pressures were brought on the members of health boards when they were first appointed to trade with particular banks.  In the hope that that can be avoided I suggest the Minister should have ultimate control.  I would not have any reservation about a Minister having representations made to him.  He could bear in mind the recommendations by the companies.  I believe both companies should spread their business among the major Irish registered banking organisations.  These institutions employ quite a number of staff.  I also point to the amount of business carried out by the present Department of Posts and Telegraphs with the major banks.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point that the companies should spread their business among the major banks, it would be invidious if the Minister would intervene. The companies might wish to change bankers in time to come and if Ministers were to be interfering there could be allegations of political interference.  We have to be particularly careful to avoid that.</P>

      <P>As Minister I had many discussions with representatives of the boards and we had a Bill, now an Act, in regard to the investment company.  It is important to emphasise what the board members stressed to me in the discussions. They said they should keep a very close eye on the money market in regard to borrowings, particularly in regard to An Bord Telecom.  By deploying the undoubted expertise that is available in regard to this matter we can gain and avoid losses through fluctuations in the value of the punt against foreign currencies. In view of that danger our own <Col N="1843" /> money market should be exploited to the full.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposal is to extend the period from three years to five years during which grants could be made by the Minister. We consider that three years is too short a period during which the company could be expected to establish viability.  Two other amendments, which have been ruled out of order, sought to have the time extended to give the two companies an opportunity to get off the ground.  The Post Office is in a very run down condition. It has to be modernised in regard to equipment and buildings as well as its <Col N="1846" /> transport fleet.  Many State companies are very heavily burdened by borrowing and any surplus they make is eaten up by interest payments.  For that reason we are anxious that sufficient capital will be made available to the companies to give them time to develop and that sufficient grant money would be available to them also to get them established and so avoid the necessity to borrow heavily from the private banking sector, thus ensuring that the company succeed.</P>

      <P>It should be recognised that the postal service has been in surplus for some time now.  They made a profit last year and it is envisaged that they will make profits, that they will be in surplus, and the £20 million provided here is purely to enable their starting off operation in the first three years.  It would be wrong for this House to contemplate the situation whereby they would be losing money each year.  This gets back to the fundamental point about State enterprise.  I believe in State enterprise and I know that Deputy De Rossa and Deputy O'Sullivan believe in it also.  Fianna Fáil spokesmen have made statements indicating&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A philosophical point about State enterprises is that in the past we have tended to lumber them with all sorts of duties and responsibilities that made them almost destined not to failure but to lack of success.  That gets a bad name for State enterprise.  We are fully confident and expectant that An Post will be a profitable business and we do not think that it should be a burden on the Exchequer.  The service should be paid for by those who use it and the more who use it the better.  As an interim arrangement we are allowing for a starting situation over three years by providing this £20 million.</P>

This is in no small way due to the type of buildings that they have which were never intended as post offices.  They do not make for very efficient service because people there are working under frightful conditions.  This has led to a great deal of unrest and deterioration of service.  We are on amendment No. 49 regarding the three to five years.  The Minister is precluded from accepting the other two amendments of The Workers' Party by virtue of the cost to the Exchequer. Here we have a proposal for a sum of £20 million payable over three years rather than five years.  From the point of view of the Post Office it would be better to accept it over a three-year period than over a five-year period.  I would much prefer to get my £20 million in three years rather than in five.</P>

      <P>I ask the Minister that the money would be paid through share capital rather than through Exchequer loans as suggested in the section.  In getting off the ground the Post Office have a great deal of ground to make up on their counterparts in telecommunications and it will not be possible for them to fund these loans in the short term and so the whole thing could be off to a bad start.  I ask the Minister to give further consideration <Col N="1849" /> to this means rather than to Exchequer loans and other means as suggested in the section.</P>

The words are &ldquo;not exceeding&rdquo;. Therefore, it is not really a financial motion in a sense because it does not say that the Minister will have to give £50 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making the point.  I do not see the reason for ruling it out of order.  It would not cost the Exchequer anything until the borrowing arose.  In a few years time the Minister will have to bring an amendment to amend section 18 to allow for an increase if not of £100 million of at least £75 million. I do not believe that £50 million will be adequate for loans to finance capital works.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Sullivan said, I travelled to Cork on behalf of the Minister to review the situation there and it is absolutely diabolical.  The conditions under which the workers there are operating are really dreadful.  Our endeavour was to do something about it there but the financial situation was as difficult in our time as it is now.  I do not know if any great improvement has taken place, but the building adjoining the sorting office was collapsing; that was the old cinema in Cork.  Deputy O'Sullivan is right; far from being a great asset, many of those buildings are an absolute liability.  They are falling apart.  From my experience in the Department and the opportunity to view post offices in some locations in the country, Sligo and elsewhere, they leave much to be desired, but above and beyond them all the worst was in Cork.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted we have reached section 27 because it has a fundamental bearing on the flexibility of this company.  I sympathise with the company taking on these liabilities.  The majority of the buildings are in a diabolical condition. They are outdated and outmoded and require major investment.  As a former architect and from my experience of present day costs I am of the opinion that it is necessary for the Minister to allocate at least £75 million for investment in buildings and other capital works.  In the course of his reply the Minister should tell the House the number of buildings in the possesion of the Department.  I accept that they have been valued at £38 million but that figure may be exaggerated.  The Minister, or a future occupant of that office, should be in a position to allow extra borrowing for investment in buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first item on the agenda for discussion by the new board will be the carrying out of a survey of all the buildings under their control.  I accept that there are some very fine buildings.  When Fianna Fáil were in office a lot of work was carried out and it is interesting to note that today a Minister of State is opening a new post office in Mullingar which was built under Fianna Fáil.  The building programme is already under way and compared to the accommodation that An Bord Poist will inherit An Bord Telecom have a distinct asset.  In fact, in my constituency of Roscommon work is well under way on the erection of new engineering headquarters.  When in Government Fianna Fáil were responsible for an accelerated building programme under former Ministers Reynolds, Wilson and Faulkner.  An Bord Telecom will be inheriting fine assets as far as buildings are concerned, buildings that compare favourably with any installations I viewed in other countries.  On <Col N="1851" /> the other hand An Bord Poist are not inheriting good assets.</P>
    <P>With regard to the subvention for the first three years I hope that the finance to be allocated by the Government will be adequate.  Deputy Wilson reduced the period from five years to three years and in view of that, and the comments made by the Minister, The Workers' Party should consider withdrawing their amendment because it does not assist the company in any way.  It must be remembered that there are areas where the company will provide a social service which from a business point of view could not be regarded as economic.</P>
    <P>For example, the telegram service is losing £300,000 per annum and the new board will be inheriting that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That section is losing a lot of money and when that figure is deducted from the £6.6 million it does not leave much to be spread around.  I hope the Department or the new board do not have to plead with a future Fianna Fáil Minister for more money on the basis that they are not able to run the uneconomic services.  I accept that in difficult economic times it is hard to allocate more than £20 million but I do not believe that amount will be adequate to finance the many services to be operated by An Bord Poist.  I accept what the former Minister said about having had to fight very hard to get an allocation of that amount.  I would prefer to have a period of five years with a sum in the region of £35 million rather than a three-year period with an allocation of £20 million.  I believe the motivation behind the amendment by The Workers' Party is to provide more finance to help the new company get working.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment under discussion must be considered in the context of the two amendments that have been ruled out of order, Nos. 48 and 50. In amendment No. 50 we sought to increase the amount the Minister could grant to An Bord Poist from £20 million <Col N="1852" /> to £40 million and in amendment No. 48 we ought to increase the amount the company could borrow from £50 million to £100 million.  I do not believe £50 million will be sufficient to carry out the capital works necessary to bring our postal service up to scratch and operating in modern buildings and using up to date equipment.  I have heard a Member say that buildings in Cork were in a bad condition but the postal sorting office in Tallaght is rat-infested and falling down around the ears of postmen.  I understand that they have not been able to occupy a temporary warehouse there because the money is not available to instal the necessary equipment.  There is a great need for capital investment and because £50 million will not be sufficient An Bord Poist will have to go to the banks and borrow at inflated interest rates.  That will cause problems.  It should be remembered that there are many State companies in serious trouble because of the amount of interest they have to pay to the private banking institutions.  In fact, many of those companies are in the red because of the huge sums they must pay in interest.  I appeal to the Minister to consider raising the £50 million allocation to £100 million and increase the £20 million provision to £40 million.  I accept the case that it is better to have £20 million over three years than to have that amount over five years but our amendment was tabled with a view to increasing that figure to £40 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to tell Deputy Leyden that the telegram service is losing a lot more money than he mentioned but that is related to the Telecom side and not in regard to An Bord Poist. In the case of An Bord Poist they will have assets transferred to them of £32.5 million and £10 million working capital. There is an enabling provision whereby they can get up to £50 million from Exchequer finance for capital works under section 27 (1) to be provided wholly in exchange for shares.  That means that there is an authorised maximum of £92.5 million plus the £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the points made by <Col N="1853" /> Deputy De Rossa in seeking an increase in the allocations I am sure he will accept, as I do, that taxes are at the limit.  Any time there is talk of a cutback the Government are accused of Thatcherite monetarism.  Why, therefore, should we be imposing extra charges on the Exchequer which can be avoided if we can impose them on a service which has the potential for growth and to be able to look after these things?  The direction should be to get the growth which is there.  The potential exists to get new business and that is the direction I want An Bord Poist to follow.  I am sure all Members would prefer that rather then the board having a deontas mentality, depending on grants.  That would be fatal.  It is important that it is made clear that this is a commercial enterprise which has proved to be profitable in the past and is capable of greater profits in the future.  In this case the profits could be employed to the advantage of the service and the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy De Rossa wanted to improve the situation he should have suggested that the £20 million should be available over two years, that there should be a £10 million fund per annum for expenditure.  With regard to the amendment which sought to increase the £50 million, just as important as the amount of money available for capital development &mdash; that is necessary has been agreed by all sides &mdash; is the question of what will be done with the money when it is made available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The danger of the Taj Mahal syndrome, when you are investing in public buildings, has to be avoided.  It is not always avoided.  I remember when the regional technical colleges were built and anybody with a refined aesthetic sense turns green in the face when he sees them first and shades his eyes when he sees them secondly or thirdly; nevertheless they were needed at the time.  They may not have been desirable as buildings but they were functional.  The £50 million that will be invested should be invested in such a way that the buildings will be comfortable and functional but that the actual expenditure is looked at very <Col N="1854" /> closely because, with all due respects to our spokesman, the follower of Vetruvius, who is not present at the moment, architects very often have very grandiose ideas when they have public funds at their disposal and the public purse often has to pay unnecessarily because of this.  Everybody would like an ideal world where all the best principles of aesthetics are applied but, in circumstances where people are working in the conditions mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan, we could even think of a national or an international competition for the most economic building for the best value for public money.</P>

      <P>I mentioned earlier some of the worker directors on either side and I did not complete the list.  There are effectively three trade union directors on either side at present, apart from the postal side where sub-postmasters are represented as well.  Of those three I mentioned, two are from post office unions and one is from an outside union. However, all those people will be overtaken and replaced when the election takes place for employee directors.  As provided in the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, that will be confined to the representatives of employees. The intention is that the present <Col N="1861" /> trade union directors and those nominated to serve on the board after vesting day and up to the election will be replaced by those who are successful in the election.</P>

      <P>This one deals with disclosure of interests.  Therefore, if an item comes up at a board meeting, in which a member of the board or his spouse had an interest, he or she would have to so declare.  It is already required under the provisions of the Bill that he or she declare that interest.  But it does not make it clear that that interest should be declared at that board meeting.  We are just clarifying that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it preclude him or her from being a member of the board? I made this point earlier regarding the people the Minister would appoint to the board &mdash; that they should disclose their interest before acting on the board.  Not to do so could be advantageous to them regarding contracts which could be quite substantial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point the Deputy has just raised, of course we would endeavour to appoint directors who would not have any vested financial or beneficial interest.  Of course, that is our aim.  But one cannot say at the outset that no issue will arise on which a particular director might happen to have an interest.  We are endeavouring to make provision that, if that arises, he would declare that interest.  We are endeavouring to clarify it further by saying that he should declare that interest at the board meeting, so that there cannot be any question of him improperly influencing a decision in his interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be a record kept of actual involvements of directors. As any member of a local authority here will know, under the Planning Act, it is a prerequisite that there is kept in the office of the local authority a record of members' assets.  It is the only area in which local authority members have to disclose their assets.  Members of the Dáil do not have to meet such a requirement; by the way, I believe they should.  There should be a record kept of the involvement of members of the board.  That may be a difficult requirement to implement but there is a good case to be made for it, <Col N="1863" /> taking into consideration also the point just made by Deputy O'Sullivan.</P>
      <P>If a member is being offered membership of a board, he should be informed of the conditions attaching to his membership. Anybody with any possible vested interest should not serve on the board.  Furthermore, there should be a record of all the directorships any particular individual may or may not have, also the type of business in which that person is engaged.  In that way if there was any dispute at any stage regarding disclosure of information at a meeting, then at least the company would be in a position to check their records ensuring that there was no conflict of interest.  It is a very important area.  It will also be a difficult one to control.  The majority of people appointed could have some involvement in any given area.  If good quality membership of the board is required, then we should be gearing ourselves towards people who have some interest or expertise in the telecommunications or postal field.  Merely informing a meeting that one has a particular interest may not be sufficient.  There should be some record kept additionally.  Indeed, in the offer of membership from the Minister, there should be a clear statement that the person will comply with these requirements and that legally such requirements would be enforceable.</P>

      <P>Regarding the analogy Deputy Leyden drew between members of local authorities and directors of the boards of these two companies, granted a member of a local authority will have to declare his interests, but the decision-taking is vested in the manager.  I would respectfully suggest that he is not comparing like with like.  Here the decision <Col N="1864" /> will rest with the board.  The expertise will be acquired through the executive. Here we are talking about vast amounts of money, some contracts exceeding £1 million.  That is a sizeable amount.  Steps must be taken to ensure equal distribution of the work.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 59:</P>
      <P>In page 21, before section 35, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;35.&mdash;(1) A person shall not disclose <Col N="1865" /> any information obtained by him while performing duties as a director or member of staff of, or an adviser or consultant to, the postal company or the telecommunications company unless he is duly authorised to do so.</P>
    <P>(2)  A person shall not obtain any information where he is aware or has reasonable grounds for believing that the disclosure of such information to him would be a contravention of subsection (1).</P>
    <P>(3)  A person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2) shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
    <P>(4)  In this section &lsquo;duly authorised&rsquo; means authorised by the company or by some person authorised in that behalf by the company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to protect the postal and telecommunications services against the unauthorised disclosure of sensitive information about the development, maintenance or security of the nationwide networks.  Similar statutory protection was given by the 1976 Gas Act.  Subsection (1) prohibits the disclosure of information obtained by any person while performing duties for the companies which is not authorised by the companies or by their authorised nominee as provided in subsection (4). Subsection (2) prohibits any person from obtaining information in breach of subsection (1).  Subsection (3) makes it an offence for any person to contravene either of the previous subsections.  Section 4 &mdash; penalties &mdash; and section 5 &mdash; proceedings &mdash; will apply to offences committed under subsection (1) or (2) of this section.</P>

      <P>In subsection (1), after &ldquo;information&rdquo;, to insert &ldquo;of a confidential nature&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> The word &ldquo;information&rdquo; is exceptionally broad.  It could be a case of disclosing information to the effect that the office was painted, that a colleague was getting married, that the van had broken down or something along those lines.  We seek to insert the words &ldquo;information of a confidential nature&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to have a provision that no information shall be disclosed unless it is authorised.  I am sure in normal practice information that is not confidential will be authorised.  It is important that there should not be unauthorised disclosure of sensitive information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is all-powerful in this respect.  However, it should cover Opposition Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is part of the duty of an Opposition Deputy to ensure that the Government act in a proper manner.  I hope this section will not prohibit the proper disclosure of information to an Opposition Deputy who wishes to ensure that the Minister does not take the wrong course of action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It has nothing to do with the Minister.  It does not give more protection to the Minister, only to the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>There is nothing wrong with this section but whether it works in reality is another matter.  If there is information before the board which is of vital interest to a certain union or association there will be some difficulty because it will have to be decided whether the person elected by an association or union represents the union or represents the board.  This section would make it illegal for that member to disclose information to his union, his colleague or to his electorate.  It would put the worker-director in a very difficult position in relation to disclosing legitimate information to his members.  On the one <Col N="1867" /> hand we are inviting people to represent unions but in this section we are making it illegal for them to disclose any information. If a worker-director attends a branch meeting of his union, under this section he will not be allowed to disclose any information to his union, his colleagues or his electorate.  In reality the provision may not be effective and I doubt if any prosecutions will take place under this section.</P>
      <P>I can see the justification for the section in relation to the disclosure of information which would be of benefit to persons outside the board which would give them an added advantage in relation to tendering procedures and appointments, but it imposes a difficulty on the person involved.  For example, a person representing sub-postmasters would be elected by the members of the union but he would not be in a position to disclose information to the annual conference or to the union executive.  As such, this may not be of great assistance to the union.  It imposes a limitation on the usefulness of worker-directors.  I have certain reservations about the whole section.  The word &ldquo;information&rdquo; is too broad in this context and it should be defined more precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Deputy's point regarding a worker-director, he is there to make a contribution, with the appointed directors, to ensure the expansion of the company and its profitability in the interests of the members.  I am not trying to give the Deputy a lesson in industrial relations but would point out that would be an entirely different function. Deputy Leyden's concern is directed mainly at the worker-director. However, there is also the case of the appointed people.  The worker-director has a vested interest in ensuring continuity of employment and in seeing that the company remains profitable.  On the other hand there are people who would have an interest in hiving off some of the activities of either company to the private sector.  I see danger here not for the worker-director but for the people who would have something to gain materially from the operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1868" /> What is information of a confidential nature?  That would be very difficult to determine, but there is a very simple device which can be used.  Committee sessions could be held and it could be stated on the agenda of the meetings if a matter was confidential.  I would hate to think that the inclusion of this section was a reaction to a recent happening where there was disclosure of the proposed closure of certain lines.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to impose the very severe penalties proposed in section 4, although I imagine they would be very difficult to impose because it would be very difficult to say who disclosed the information.  Will the directors be subject to those penalties?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>These are the maximum penalties and it would be for the courts to decide what penalties, if any, should be imposed.  This section is aimed at all directors, not just worker-directors. For example I could visualise a situation where the interest of the service could be compromised by the disclosure of a plan by An Bord Telecom to get into satellites. It is only right that if a person makes a disclosure of this nature to an international competitor he should be penalised.</P>
      <P>It is also important that directors be protected because at present there is a danger that not all information is given to boards.  I am disposed to the view that many State boards are circumvented because of a reluctance by management to give them confidential information. That is a very serious situation because the boards are responsible to the Minister and the Minister is responsible to the Government.  This section will ensure that boards get the necessary information and it will protect directors from unfair pressure to disclose information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Everyone agrees there is a need to restrict information coming from the board and staff in this and almost every company, particularly in the commercial area.  There are thousands of staff employed in depots all over the county.  This section says &ldquo;any information&rdquo;; we are not just talking about confidential <Col N="1869" /> information.  We should say exactly what we mean by using the phrase &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; or &ldquo;information of a confidential nature&rdquo;.  Section 4 explains what &ldquo;duly authorised&rdquo; means. As the section stands no person can give any information about the work of the Post Office unless he is duly authorised. Why have a section about authorisation of information when we should be restricting the area to cover confidential information?  If a person is looking for general information he should not have to approach an authorised person.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at the section again and insert the words &ldquo;information of a confidential nature&rdquo; to avoid possible niggling by managers, foremen or any other person.  If he accepts the phrase it would avoid unnecessary hassle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the point made by Deputy Mac Giolla and will look at it before Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the point made by Deputy Mac Giolla because this is a very dangerous provision.  I particularly object to subsection (2) which says that a person shall not obtain any information where he is aware, or has reasonable grounds for believing, that the disclosure of such information to him would be in contravention of subsection (1).  This subsection should be deleted because it is a restriction on the freedom of journalists. When this Bill becomes law a journalist would find it difficult, if not impossible, to get any information which might be of interest to his readers.  I strongly advocate that the word &ldquo;confidential&rdquo; be included and that subsection (2) be deleted because it undermines the freedom of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Opposition spokesman for Posts and Telegraphs I would have great difficulty carrying out my duties if I could not discuss with members of the board or employees of the company any difficulties they are experiencing, such as conditions, development and so on.  I will have to decide if the information given comes under section 35 (1).  It is difficult enough to do one's work as a Deputy without also having to worry if the <Col N="1870" /> information at one's disposal will contravene this legislation.  Most Opposition Deputies would oppose this section.  The Minister may be occupying these benches very soon and he may find it very difficult to carry out his responsibilities if this subsection is passed.</P>
    <P>I have in my possession information which under the terms of this Bill would be deemed to be illegal, but at the moment it is not.  At present I am entitled to be informed of developments and I receive a large volume of correspondence dealing with the Minister's Department. This company will employ thousands of people and every member will be governed by this Bill.  If a reporter from the media tries to interview an employee working for the Department he may never get that interview, because if he did the employee would have contravened this section.  The unions should fight this issue.  I ask the Labour Party to exert the maximum pressure on the Minister to delete the word &ldquo;any&rdquo; and insert &ldquo;confidential information&rdquo; and also delete subsection (2) because it restricts freedom and clamps down on information legitimately required and needed in a democracy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will consider taking some initiatives to bring about the early re-opening of a number of meat processing plants in the country, with particular reference to County Kildare which has been severely hit by job losses in the last three years and where there are now two such plants closed with a loss of more than 600 jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of re-opening the two meat plants referred to by the Deputy is primarily a matter for the proprietors. My objective is to create the conditions in which cattle production can expand and the trading environment in which the meat factories can prosper and develop.  With regard to the expansion of the cattle herd there are already a number of measures in operation such as the calved heifer scheme, the calf premium scheme and the suckler cow scheme, as well as the headage payments in the disadvantaged areas.  As regards the trading situation, EEC export refunds now favour exports as beef rather than as live animals.  Arising from the recent EEC price negotiations and this month's meeting of the Council of Agricultural Ministers the support price for beef is, of course, being increased by a total of over 14 per cent.  This should have a further stimulating effect on cattle production and on factory throughput.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fluctuations which the meat processing industry has gone through during the past few years would it not be opportune at this time to meet with the various interests <Col N="1876" /> involved in the two plants in County Kildare mentioned in the question in order to ascertain whether it would be possible to work out some kind of long-term strategy for the meat processing industry?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no objection to meeting the meat processors to discuss longterm plans.  The two factories mentioned in the question are the IMP factory in Leixlip and Premier Meat Packers in Sallins.  There are negotiations going on between the IMP management and the trade unions at present with a view to rationalising operations because the concern was losing a considerable amount of money.  Similarly I believe the Premier Meat Packers plant was also incurring heavy losses.  It was reported in the newspapers at the time of that closure that it would re-open in July and I hope it does.</P>

It has never been accurately calculated but the estimates are considerable.  We do not believe that the EEC would agree to such a proposal.  We have consistently objected to the operation of this premium where exports of beef to other countries are concerned.  Our objections still exist and talks will take place between officials of my Department and the British Ministry of Agriculture on 24 June.  I will be anxiously awaiting the outcome of these talks because there will be a need to take further action if we cannot have it resolved in bilateral discussions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that when £30 million of capital injection was advanced to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta in October 1982 the Tuam sugar factory was to be an integral part of the rationalisation plan submitted by the company and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 7 inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> In October 1982 a sum of £30 million was advanced by the Government to Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta subject to conditions to be conveyed to the company later.  In February of this year the company were notified of these conditions, which included the provision of a new rationalisation plan based on commercial criteria.</P>
    <P>This plan has only just been received and is at present being examined by the Departments concerned.  When that examination, which is likely to take some weeks, has been completed, the Government will consider the matter.  It is not possible at this stage to say when the Government's decision on the future of the Tuam factory will be made.</P>
    <P>In the meantime I do not consider it appropriate to make detailed comments on selected aspects of it relating to the Tuam factory or other company activities. I am, however, advised by the company that the net cost to them of operating the Tuam factory during the year ended September 1982 was approximately £2.5 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the operating loss is reported to be in the region of £1.5 million and not £3 million which was announced by the Sugar Company. The figure of £3 million seems to have been accepted by the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, in a recent article which he wrote for the <i>Irish Independent.</i> That is a very small figure out of the total loss of £22½ million announced by the Sugar Company.  Would the Minister not agree that it would be economic lunacy if the Government allow the Tuam factory to close down when the total loss to the Exchequer in PAYE and PRSI payments would be £2.2 million?  There are over 1,000 families depending on Tuam sugar factory being maintained.</P>

      <P>As regards changes in the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas in this country I would refer the Deputies to the reply to a question on the subject on 15 February. The criteria used in the classification of the more severely handicapped parts of the disadvantaged areas are laid down in detail in Article 3.4 of Council Directive 75/268/EEC which in the case of Ireland should be read in conjunction with Council Directive 75/272/EEC; they may be summarised as: adverse physical handicaps, such as infertility of the soil, low economic returns and low or dwindling population depending mainly on agriculture.</P>

      <P>For the purposes of the present review it has been decided that consideration should be given to townlands or groups of townlands, rather than to entire district electoral divisions as has been the practice heretofore.  The position in over 600 district electoral divisions comprising a total number of townlands estimated to be in excess of 10,000, of which 1,332 are in County Galway, is being given detailed consideration in the course of the present review.  The position in all the areas mentioned in the questions will be considered in the context of the present review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be necessary to await the outcome of the present boundary review before approaching the EEC authorities with any list of areas for designation as disadvantaged or reclassification as more severely handicapped.  It will take some months yet before the review is completed and I would not like to forecast at this stage how soon the question will be finalised by the Government or, eventually, by the EEC authorities.  Changes in the boundaries of the disadvantaged <Col N="1892" /> areas in member states have not been an issue in this year's EEC discussions on agricultural prices and no proposals from the Commission in this regard are before the Council of Ministers.</P>

Also, regarding the report which the Minister tells us he expects to be completed within the next two to three months, will that be submitted to Brussels before the next session of the Dáil?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first part of the question, up to now the method of calculation was based entirely on district electoral divisions but that has been found not to be very helpful and to have resulted in some peculiar results.  One can have a district electoral division with very good land and with very bad land. It is proposed to have townland divisions where necessary and one would hope that that system would be more appropriate to the type of terrain involved.  Regarding the timetable aspect, it will be two to three months before the survey is completed. After that it will be sent to the Government and then to Brussels, so I cannot give an exact time span.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Is the Minister aware that the appropriate forum for changing the criteria is at the annual agricultural price review by the Council of Ministers?

      <P>We would have an input in the sense that there would be certain proposals that we could put to Brussels and which in our view would be of the greatest advantage to us.  It is possible that at some future time it will be possible to have price fixing and so on on the agenda at EEC negotiations.  Because of the factors I have explained, it was not possible to have proposals of that kind on the agenda on the last occasion.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that up to now the officials have not been concentrating on the areas of population and fertility but instead have left out areas simply because of their being milk-producing areas even if the milk was produced on marginal land and where the heather was growing on the other side of the hedge?  We have had officials of the Department in the county but instead of taking note of the problems of the area, because the farmers concerned were by and large milk suppliers <Col N="1899" /> and because there were a number of creameries in the county, these officials considered the farmers to be in the higher income bracket.  Consequently, all we got was 20 per cent when we should have been getting 80 to 90 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to Deputy Leonard, the problem he raises was one that resulted from the district electoral division system.  That scheme produced distortions.  This was because a district electoral division can include a big area, perhaps two parishes.  It is conceivable that because there were good farmers, be they big or small farmers, in such division people who should be entitled for inclusion in the scheme were not included. This resulted from the standard way in which the criteria was used.  As a result of the system being broken down to townlands this problem may be overcome.</P>

      <P>I ask Deputy Woods to resume his seat.  It is a well established rule of the House over many years, a rule not made by me but by various Cinn Comhairle, that when a question is ruled out of order the reason for so doing is conveyed to the Deputy who wanted to raise it by way of private notice by the Ceann Comhairle's Private Secretary and that is an end of it.  I am satisfied my Private Secretary has given the Deputy a full explanation.  If the Deputy is not satisfied with that he is quite welcome to come to my office and discuss it with me and get again a full explanation.  If he thinks I am seriously wrong in some way there is a well known and established way of correcting me or censuring me and any further attempt by Deputy Woods to pursue the matter now is disorderly.  It is not doing the House or this Parliament any good.  What I have said is correct and the Deputy will have to obey the Chair.</P>

      <P>I was in possession when the debate adjourned.  I expressed disquiet in relation to the provisions of section 35 (1).  It appears to me to be very carelessly worded.  I also have strong objections to section 35 (2).  If this section is passed then a person shall not obtain any information where he is aware or has reasonable grounds for believing the disclosure of such information would be a contravention of subsection (1).  The 30,000 people employed by these two companies will be affected by this provision because, should they discover a situation <Col N="1940" /> existed which called for remedial action, they will not be able to disclose that information even to a member of the Garda Síochána.  That will have serious repercussions for the staff.  Should a member of the Department be interviewed by any of the media the person carrying out that interview will be liable to prosecution.  Such a section has appeared in no other legislation since the foundation of the State.  It is totally wrong.  It is against the interests of the staff and it is against the democratic right of access to information.  In future no constituent will be able to contact a public representative to raise a matter of possible serious import because the public representative will be liable to prosecution. I appeal to the Minister to withdraw this section forthwith.  If it is enacted it will make life absolutely impossible for the staff, for public representatives, for members of the media and for the general public.  It is outrageous and I am totally opposed to it.</P>

      <P>The purpose of section 36 is to enable the chief executives of the present non-statutory interim boards set up in 1979 to be appointed as the first chief executives of the State-sponsored companies provided that there would be no break in their service as chief executives.  In other words, if they are chief executive on the day before vesting day they automatically become chief executives in the new companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 62:</P>
      <P>In page 24, before subsection (1), to insert a new subsection as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) (a)  The postal company shall accept into its employment on the vesting day every person who immediately before the vesting day is a member of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and is designated by the Minister for employment by that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The telecommunications company shall accept into its employment on the vesting day every person who immediately before the vesting day is a member of that staff and is designated by the <Col N="1943" /> Minister for employment by that company.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Section 42 deals with the pay and conditions of service of staff in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who become employees of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  The purpose of the amendment is to require each of the two proposed State-sponsored companies to accept into its employment all persons who immediately before the vesting day were members of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and who are designated by the Minister for employment by the company.  The amendment is proposed in defference to a point made by staff unions and associations in the course of the ongoing consultations about the reorganisation, that is, that there was no explicit obligation on the companies to employ staff who would be affected by the transfer of ministerial functions to them.</P>
    <P>I give notice that this is a very central amendment to the security of tenure of the staff.  I have gone into this in great detail and we have come up with wording which I think cannot be bettered.  However, I have been approached again on quite a number of occasions, especially by Deputy O'Sullivan and, while I want the section and the amendments here accepted, I reserve the right to move an amendment on Report Stage if we can find any better format.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My view of this section 42 is that it is completely inadequate in relation to protection of the existing staff of the Post Office in relation to their conditions, pay and superannuation.  For that reason we have put down a number of amendments.  The Minister's amendment to subsection (1) would give the staff pay parity at the vesting day, whereas the amendments we are putting down seek to ensure that the pay of staff of the two companies would maintain <Col N="1944" /> parity with the civil service.  It must be remembered that these people are giving up employment in the civil service.  They are being transferred from the civil service to two semi-State companies and it is unreasonable to expect that they would give up conditions and take less favourable conditions or conditions which may deteriorate over a period of time whether it be months or years.  For that reason I am very anxious that the Minister accept the amendments we have put down, No. 64 in relation to pay and No. 67 in relation to the question of whether a person can be suspended and the conditions the staff are entitled to and can retain.  The Minister has a number of amendments down but I feel that his amendments do not go far enough in protecting the interests of the staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the central theme of the Bill and that is why I was very anxious to move through the sections just passed which I would have liked an opportunity to debate in more detail, but for the benefit of the House I am glad to have an opportunity to discuss this section 42.  My colleague, Deputy Wilson, on Second Stage gave specific undertakings which are being honoured now in relation to the wording contained here to preserve as far as possible the status of civil servants which the employees have at the moment.  The questions I pose to the Minister are as follows: (1) Will the staff at present employed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, 30,000 in all, be eligible in the intervening period to obtain transfers to other Departments within the State?  (2) After vesting day will the staff of both Bord Telecom Éireann and An Post be eligible to sit for the confined examinations in the civil service?  That will be the proof of whether they have retained civil service status which was guaranteed to them by both Government parties prior to the election in 1981.  For party political advantage they gave undertakings which they cannot honour.  Let us have no hypocrisy about this.  They can put whatever wording they like into the Bill but there can be no question that once the boards are vested the staffs will be semi-State <Col N="1945" /> employees and they will have all the rights and privileges of semi-State employees.  My colleague, the former Minister, Deputy Wilson, gave an undertaking that they would have no loss of benefit whatsoever by such a transfer, but to go along with the statement made by the General Secretary of Fine Gael on 8 June 1981, such moves will not involve loss of civil service status.</P>

      <P>I was anxious to make it clear to the workers involved what the situation will be.  Either they will be in the civil service or they will not &mdash; the Government parties cannot have it both ways.  We were endeavouring in the Bill to ensure that there will not be any loss of the benefits to an employee on transfer, that they would have the same benefits and privileges as they enjoyed as civil servants under the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  There are two crunch questions: can they transfer within the service after vesting day and are they eligible for sitting for the confined examinations which are open to civil servants?  The latter is a great privilege for civil servants because it gives them an opportunity of getting promotion. Those provisions should be inserted in the legislation.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil have been consistent in their approach.  I understand that Mr. Coleman is president of the POOA, a union of some sort, although Deputy O'Sullivan says it is not a union.</P>

      <P>Is it right that the electorate should be misled by the Labour Party?  Is it right that the Labour Party should write to people, using their headed notepaper, pretending they would be granted civil service status when they do not intend to do so?  This matter must be cleared up once and for all.  The people involved will either have civil service status or be employees of a State-sponsored body.  We have been honest about this and we told the unions that when the employees would transfer to a semi-State organisationt they would be considered to be employees of that organisation.  We tried to preserve to the greatest extent possible the rights and privileges of those people such as the <Col N="1948" /> pension schemes.  The Minister should respond to the questions I have put to him.</P>

      <P>There is an air of unreality about the debate when Deputy Leyden contributes.  Yesterday he referred to the legislation under discussion as their Bill.  The Bill which Deputy Leyden described as his party's proposes to take civil service status from 28,000 employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  He made that admission yesterday.  The Deputy cannot have the best of both worlds.</P>

Deputies Faulkner, Wilson, Reynolds and Leyden, in turn, when in charge of that Department assured Post Office workers that they did not have anything to fear regarding security of tenure but not one word appeared in print to confirm that.</P>
      <P>I acknowledge that the Minister has given an undertaking to consider the matter between now and Report Stage. Hopefully, he will come up with the correct form of words to allay the fears of those who feel threatened as a result of this Fianna Fáil provision.  I will continue to press on behalf of the employees.  I am not on the hook and my colleagues in the POWU will bear that out.  I have no doubt that the Minister will respond in a positive way.  I have more faith in Deputy Jim Mitchell as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs than I had in Deputy Leyden.</P>

      <P>The Labour Party played politics with this legislation on Second Stage.  I am convinced of that and I am not making that statement to exacerbate feelings.  I resent and repudiate the suggestion that I, as Minister, or my party were less conscious of the rights of workers than any other party in the House.  That is a modest claim.  In subsection (1) we provided that no member of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs transferred to either of the two boards on the vesting day would receive a lesser scale of pay or be subject to less favourable conditions of service than those applicable immediately before the transfer.  In subsection (2) we provided that existing scales of pay and conditions of service would be applied to the transferred staff by the companies until such time as they are varied following consultation with recognised staff associations and trade unions.  There are <Col N="1950" /> members of unions who will be transferred under this setting up of semi-State companies expecting better conditions when working under the new board.</P>
      <P>As far as subsection (3) is concerned, established staff transferred will be brought under the benefit of three Acts, the Holiday (Employees) Act, 1973, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973 and the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977.  That is the measure of the concern that we showed in Government for the workers.  I do not want to make a meal of this but I do not want people to be tricking around with words and pitching for favours with the trade unions, one trying to get ahead of the other and in some way casting me as Minister or the Fianna Fáil Party in the role of workers' enemy.  I reject it.  I repudiate it and I believe I have put on the record of the House the clear words of the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and I are the only people who have put down amendments to this section so it is interesting to listen to all the words being cast around about this particular section.  The fact is that the section as proposed in the Fianna Fáil Bill and as reintroduced by the Coalition Government, offers to those who transfer to the new companies conditions equal to those on vesting day, or immediately before vesting day.  There is nothing to prevent those conditions deteriorating.  We hope they will improve and that the parity in the new companies will not be with some other employment or industry.  I believe the employees of Posts and Telegraphs are entitled, in view of the fact that they have certain conditions in the civil service, to parity with the civil service and they are entitled to retain that parity in pay, conditions and security of employment.  The amendments which Deputy Mac Giolla and I have put down to seek to provide that that parity will be provided.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>Parity is not in the Bill.  There is a need to assure the staff that they will not be at a loss.  They could quite happily remain in the civil service with the conditions they have and with the assurance of their pension rights, pay, holidays, security of tenure and the various other conditions.  In this Bill we are asking them to transfer from that security into an area where there is no guarantee whatever that the people from private industry who have been put in charge will make a go of it.  I am fairly certain they will, but the fact is that in the Bill we must ensure that the people we are asking to move to those new companies retain at least the conditions they have and that the conditions they have will move in line with the conditions they would have had if they remained in the civil service.  That is the purpose of the amendments we have put down.  I hope to hear a debate on that aspect of the problem and not all of this playing to the gallery.</P>

      <P>I believe, when all is said and done, that there is broad agreement on all sides of the House on giving to the workers the same degree of security as they have at the moment.  It is a very fundamental point.  We cannot retain them as civil servants because the whole principle on which the reorganisation is based is to take those two businesses out of a civil service atmosphere into a commercial atmosphere.  That fundamental principle would be destroyed if the employees were to retain civil service status and they had to observe the traditional civil service regulations, conditions and so forth.  In order to allow for a movement out of the civil service but to retain the same security, pay, conditions, etc.  I am moving no fewer than three <Col N="1952" /> amendments to the section.  I want to pay particular tribute to Deputy O'Sullivan in relation to this section.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>He has had a great deal of success.  Most of the amendments can be credited to him.  There are three amendments to this section.  Amendment No. 66 states:</P>
      <P>In page 24, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  A member of the staff so transferred to either company shall not, while in the service of the company, be subject to conditions in regard to tenure of office which taken as a whole are less favourable to him than those for the time being prevailing in the civil service, not being conditions imposed by or under statute.</P>
      <P>If a dispute arises between either company and any such member as to conditions prevailing in the civil service the matter shall be determined by the Minister for the Public Service after consultation with the Minister.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are providing that the security of tenure shall not be less favourable and <Col N="1953" /> that there is an appeal to the Minister and the Minister for the Public Service. We are putting down two other amendments to section 42.  In amendment No. 63 we are deleting &ldquo;Subject to subsection (2)&rdquo; and we are substituting:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union or staff association concerned,&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have already moved amendment No. 62 which provides that the postal company and the telecommunications company shall accept into their employment on the vesting day the people designated to them.  I believe we have gone as far as we could to meet the very reasonable point made by the unions.  We are including amendments which make provision for conditions not less favourable.</P>
    <P>This section has been the subject of more discussion than almost any other section and perhaps any other group of sections.  It is clearly a matter of concern to the unions and to the workers in the Post Office.  As I said yesterday, very often it is not the facts that matter but the perception of the facts.  It is the perception of a threat to their security that is the problem here.  There is no threat.  In my view the unions under-estimate their power.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In modern days, management have to do much of what they do by agreement with the trade unions. That is an established fact.  The retention of civil service status, which is being sought here, would veto the main intent of the Bill, to reorganise the two businesses that we are now taking out of a civil service context and putting into a commercial context for the purpose of giving them a better environment in which to expand and in which to be more successful.  There are no other State companies that have such a guarantee but yet any reorganisation of manpower or any changes have to be the subject of agreement between the unions.  There are always agreed negotiating procedures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1954" /> I want to say emphatically, and to communicate this to every employee of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, that any fears they may still entertain are totally groundless and are rendered groundless by the three amendments I am moving on this section.  Indeed, I might add that their lot will be considerably improved by the whole series of amendments I have moved so far and will move later on in this Bill.  That is a very important message to have communicated.</P>
    <P>I have said that I believe we are not going to be able to improve on those words.  But because this question is so important I have been asked to keep open the possibility of a further amendment on the Report Stage.  I shall do that and give notice that between now and Report Stage I may find some better form of words; I do not think I can but I shall keep it open.  In the meantime I commend these amendments to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not reply to the two specific questions put to him. Will they be eligible for transfer within the civil service before vesting date and after vesting date and will they be eligible to sit for confined examinations within the civil service?  Will the Minister make any statement in relation to the agreement or undertaking given by his party in relation to loss of civil service status? The Minister has confirmed now that he cannot honour that commitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>To take the first point first, the situation up to vesting day in relation to transfers within the Department remains unchanged.  Of course that does not mean that any application for transfer will be granted because there may not be vacancies.  But that is the situation now and as it would be if the two businesses continued to operate as a Department of State.  There is no change in that up to vesting day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the post vesting day situation, there is nothing in this Bill which would prohibit that.  That is a matter for negotiation and discussion.  In relation to the third point &mdash; a fair point raised by <Col N="1955" /> Deputy Leyden about a commitment &mdash; a commitment was given by a general secretary in a letter; that is clear from what he said.  But I have had to take into account whether that should be a binding commitment and in the process destroy the very re-organisation, as I see it, or whether we should break that commitment such as it is and do what we believe to be the right thing, the right thing for the public, for the employees and in order to ensure the brightest possible future for the postal and telecommunications services.  I believe we have done the right thing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister clarify this for me?  Does he envisage that in the two new boards there will be employees of two types, (1) the employee who has been transferred, and will that which the Minister envisages here refer to him, because we are all hopeful that in what will be two expanding organisations there will be much recruitment?  Does the Minister's amendment refer only to somebody who is moved in, or will it apply also to those who will be recruited <i>de novum</i> after vesting day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a good point Deputy Tunney has raised.  This section <Col N="1956" /> deals only with pre-vesting day staff, staff who were recruited as civil servants.  Post vesting day recruitment will be on terms and conditions to be decided by the companies no doubt in agreement and consultation with the trade unions.  There could well be two categories, that those employed after vesting day will be employed under terms and conditions decided by the companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very important point.  We must be concerned with all civil servants, with all workers.  The Minister will appreciate that in any organisation there will be then this comparability. There will be then two people working side by side, the person who was there pre-vesting working alongside the person who came in post vesting.  Surely the Minister realises that any trade union worth its salt will move automatically and will be under pressure to have identical terms for all who are employees of the same organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate whatever arrangements the companies may make.  Indeed, it would be impossible to do so.  But it is clear that this section deals with those employees who were employed by the Government pre-vesting day.  They would have been employed at the time under terms and conditions applicable to civil servants. Anybody who is employed post vesting day will know at the outset that they are not being employed under the terms and conditions applicable to civil servants. Therefore, there is a big difference.  I have no doubt but that the companies in their wisdom will take into account the point Deputy Tunney has made about comparability and relativity which is such a big factor not only in industrial relations but in human life generally.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say that basically the statutory guarantees are here, something unique.  As the Minister said, we are all in general agreement that the employees should get the best possible deal.  But there is an interesting little <Col N="1957" /> side play going on with the Minister giving a leg-up to Deputy O'Sullivan to get him out of his embarrasment.  That is a horsey metaphor and I will change it if he wishes &mdash; the Minister burning a little incense in front of Deputy O'Sullivan to get him ahead in the deification of Deputy De Rossa.  It is a little game being played between the two of them.  But the fact is that the statutory guarantee has been there from the beginning.  If the Minister is strengthening it out a little by his amendments, well and good.  The illogicalities have already been emphasised by our spokesman, Deputy Leyden</P>
      <P>We are here talking &mdash; and rightly so &mdash; about the rights and privileges of approximately 30,000 people.  The whole purpose of the Bill, of what we are doing here, is to provide a good and efficient service on two fronts for 3,500,000 to 4,000,000 people and others affected outside the country.  We must not lose sight of that as well.  We have adequately covered the statutory guarantees, rightly covered them, and the little side games should be dispensed with now because I do not believe that two days were sufficient in which to discuss this very important Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £110,245,000 be granted to defray the <Col N="1963" /> charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Labour, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>Before I commence my speech, a Cheann Comhairle, I may say that the document I will be reading from has been abridged somewhat in the past hour or so, because of arrangements made by the Whips to confine this debate, which was to cover 1¾ hours to two hours.  The original document which was to be circulated was much larger and dealt in depth with the affairs of the Department of Labour. I am sorry this had to be done because the larger document would have been of much more value to Deputies and to the staff reporting the debate on the Estimate.</P>
    <P>The large increase over last year reflects the provision for youth training and employment which in turn reflects the increased yield expected from the youth employment levy in 1983.</P>
    <P>Since the bulk of the expenditure under the Vote for my Department is in the areas of training and employment, I propose to deal first with the general employment situation and in that context to outline the activities of my Department and of the agencies grant-aided from the Vote, the purposes of which are to alleviate and improve the situation.</P>
    <P>Hopes for an increase in the level of economic activity throughout the international community failed to materialise in 1982, as the recession continued for the third successive year.  Output in the European Community was little changed compared with 1981, while in the wider OECD area output actually declined slightly.  In Ireland as in other countries the impact of the prolonged downturn translated directly into a significant deterioration in unemployment, attaining levels unprecedented in recent years.</P>
    <P>Existing economic forecasts while pointing to a revival in growth led by an <Col N="1964" /> upturn in the US economy, have yet to show any substantial improvement in employment.  While it is not possible to predict the eventual impact of the upturn in Ireland we can anticipate, however, that the pressure on employment will diminish in the medium term and the rise in unemployment will decelerate provided the right policies are adopted and implemented.  While recent unemployment figures may indicate the first tentative signs in this direction, I am under no illusion as to the manifold problems that yet face us as a community before the trend can be halted and reversed.</P>
    <P>Measures aimed at improving labour market conditions in times of recession and population growth have been severely restricted by the necessity to implement policies geared towards adjusting public finance and external payment imbalances.  Notwithstanding these restrictions the Government have established the appropriate economic structures which are aimed at securing the environment for economic regeneration through proper economic planning and management.  These structures are centered on the Cabinet Task Force on Employment which brings a co-ordinated and integrated approach to the problem and also ensures that the competence and expertise available in the State are fully utilised.  Within my specific sphere of responsibility the thrust of policy in the manpower area has been the development of complementary strategies for employment and training.  These programmes have been expanded rapidly in recent years to meet the twin objectives of maintaining a dynamic labour market and making some reductions in the level of unemployment.  The programmes are costly, despite the level of European Social Fund assistance, which following last week's Council will continue to be available, on an increasing scale.  I propose therefore, to deal with this area in some detail.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise the particular concern with which this Government view the issue of youth employment.  A major initiative in the area of youth employment was taken by the previous Coalition Government through the establishment <Col N="1965" /> of the Youth Employment Agency, under the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981.  The agency are charged with bringing about a unified and concerted approach to training, work experience, educational and employment measures designed to tackle the problem of youth unemployment.  I believe that the Agency can exert a major influence on the provision of employment and training services for young people and I wish to express my wholehearted commitment and support, and that of the Government, to the agency in their important work.</P>
    <P>In general, the agency has looked mainly to the existing authorities such as AnCO, the National Manpower Service and the Department of the Environment to implement programmes, rather than itself assuming an executive role.  I see the agency playing a key role in co-ordinating the expansion of existing facilities arising from the additional financial resources available since the introduction of the youth employment levy in April 1982.  The agency will also be involved in encouraging the development of new schemes, so that a wide range of facilities will be available to cater for all categories of unemployed young people.  This year over 45,000 young people are expected to participate in schemes funded from the proceeds of the youth employment levy. This figure is approximately equivalent to the number of young people leaving second level schools to join the labour force.</P>
    <P>The current year will see a rise of approximately 100 per cent over 1981 in the numbers catered for by the programmes designed for unemployed young people under the auspices of the Department of Labour and their agencies and the Departments of the Environment, Education and Health.  These include general and apprentice training and the community youth training programme, administered by AnCO; training for the hotel, catering and tourism industries, administered by CERT; the work experience programme and the scheme for youth employment, administered by the Department of Labour; the environmental improvements scheme, <Col N="1966" /> administered by the Department of the Environment; the pre-employment and secretarial courses run by the Vocational Education Committees and the Department of Education; and a programme for the work experience placements in the health services, which is being planned by the Department of Health in consultation with the Youth Employment Agency.  The State investment in all these levy-funded activities is of the order of £61.3 million.  In addition, the Youth Employment Agency has a further sum of £15 million to expend both on expansion of existing schemes and on the launching of new activities.</P>
    <P>In 1983, the main thrust of the agency's activities is, first of all, to support the continued expansion of State-aided training and work experience programmes for young people.  Secondly, the agency will direct a major initiative at the longerterm registered unemployed in the 18 to 24 age group.  Of the total of the 57,000 registered unemployed in this age group it is estimated that about 20,000 have been unemployed for six months or more.  Priority access for this group is needed to the range of training, work experience and employment programmes provided for young people generally. Consequently, over the next year the agency's objective will be to move towards a situation where:</P>
    <P>Programmes providing State funded employment on community and environmental facilities will recruit exclusively from among the longer term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Up to 50 per cent of existing training places for young people will progressively be devoted to those out of work for long periods.</P>
    <P>Sufficient funding is available for a significant expansion of places in training and temporary employment programmes to cater for this group.</P>
    <P>The activities of the agency this year will also focus on the replacement of the current temporary employment activities with a new integrated approach; improved access to training for disadvantaged teenagers through the extension of <Col N="1967" /> the network of community training; support for the local and youth initiatives in job creation; and the promotion of priority developments in the education system relating to the transition from school to work.</P>
    <P>The agency have been given a specific responsibility for encouraging the creation of economically sustainable jobs through community, youth and voluntary organisations.  A major initiative planned in the enterprise field is the launching of the Community Youth Enterprise Programme. Community enterprise workers will be employed by community groups with potentially viable projects, to aid in bringing such projects to fruition.  A start will be made on this programme in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>The agency are supporting three pilot projects in Cork, Finglas/Dublin and Waterford providing back-up resources for young people starting their own enterprises and from this experience the agency intend providing a basic model for resource centres with defined agency supports which would be available for general application in 1984.  The agency are also considering a scheme for loans to potential young entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency organised last week a seminar of interested State, education, local authority, youth and voluntary organisations, employer and trade union representatives to discuss proposals on the question of a flexible framework within which community based activity can be given a role in the provision of manpower and employment schemes for young people. The proposals seek to bring about an integrated approach to the needs of young people from the point at which they are about to leave the school system right through providing assessment, guidance, basic training, work experience, job placement and job creation.  The outcome of the seminar is being considered.</P>
    <P>The Joint Programme for Government, 1982, contained an undertaking that the Cabinet Task Force on Employment would consult with the Youth Employment Agency with a view to removing any obstacles that may exist to <Col N="1968" /> their effective operation and would ensure that the resources allocated to the agency are used fully and effectively with particular emphasis on actual job creation. These consultations are currently taking place.  I am confident that they will give an added impetus to the work of the agency.</P>
    <P>In today's economic climate the provision of adequate training for our work force is vital.  It is a fact that the company with a well trained work force and the individual with skills are both able to weather the storm of economic recession and to take advantage of the upturn in economic activity when it comes along.</P>
    <P>In recognition of this the funds being made available to AnCO are being significantly increased.  AnCO will receive an Exchequer grant for non-capital of £9.5 million this year in addition to approximately £33 million from the Youth Employment Levy proceeds. These funds will attract matching grants from the European Social Fund, bringing AnCO's total budget for operational expenditure in 1983 to approximately £87 million.  This compares with £60 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>AnCO plan to train over 34,000 people during the current year &mdash; an increase of 25 per cent on 1982.  Over 24,000 of those trained will be persons aged under 25 years, many of whom will be seeking their first jobs.  In this area AnCO will be working closely with the Youth Employment Agency.  Despite the attention being focused on young people AnCO are concerned that the training needs of older unemployed people will not be lost sight of and plan to take special initiatives in 1983 to attract this category into training. In addition to the operational resources available to AnCO a further grant of £6.1 million is being allocated towards capital expenditure mainly on training centres. When these capital projects are complete AnCO will have a total in-centre capacity of 7,000 training places.  New centres at Baldoyle, Loughlinstown and Letterkenny will be completed in 1983 and a centre at Limerick will come on stream in 1984.  No further commitments for new centres will be entered into until AnCO <Col N="1969" /> complete a review of present and future needs.</P>
    <P>External training is becoming increasingly important in the AnCO training programme.  Under this scheme AnCO carry out or contract out training in industry, educational establishments and similar locations.  In 1983, AnCO plan a throughput of 12,800 &mdash; or over a third of total throughput &mdash; in external training locations.</P>
    <P>A very valuable training programme for young people is the Community Youth Training Programme.  This programme is important in that it provides training for people in small communities around the country, and the training leaves behind useful facilities in the shape of improvements to local amenities which might not, otherwise, have been undertaken, for example the renovation or construction of a community hall.  It is planned to expand the programme in 1983 to provide training for 5,000 young people.  This compares with 3,400 in 1982.</P>
    <P>AnCO are also involved in organising training courses for disadvantaged young people to enable them to meet standards in basic skills to help them to secure training places at an established training centre or alternatively low skill employment. AnCO plan to train almost 1,800 people under this programme during 1983.</P>
    <P>AnCO recognise the special needs of women in the labour force and are fully conscious of the role that training can play.  It is AnCO's policy to raise the skill level of women in the work force by training more women in a wide range of skills and for more highly skilled work. This policy is also geared to the special problems of women returning to work after a break in employment and to the difficulties involved for women in their dual role at work and in the home.  In recent years special efforts have been made to encourage and facilitate women who wish to train or re-train.  Consequently there has been an increase in the number and proportion of females participating in AnCO courses from 10 per <Col N="1970" /> cent of the total in 1975 to 33 per cent of a much larger total in 1982.</P>
    <P>The Government's commitment to ensure an adequately trained work force and to raise overall standards in the hotel and catering sector is reflected in the provision being made for CERT.  I have allocated £280,000 from the Exchequer to CERT for 1983 and when the grant of £1.426 million from the Youth Employment Levy proceeds and the allocations from the European Social Fund are taken into account over £3.3 million will be available to CERT this year.  CERT expects to maintain its education, training and recruitment services at around the same level it operated in 1982 when it trained 1,600 young persons in formal long-term craft and management training courses.  Some 4,232 hotel, catering and tourism workers were also trained by CERT on short courses and a further 219 unemployed persons participated in special eight week bar and catering courses at CERT's Roebuck Training Centre.</P>
    <P>A non-capital grant of £475,000 for management training is provided in this year's Estimates for the IMI.  This will be supplemented by grants from the European Social Fund which will amount to approximately £440,000.  Management training is also indirectly State funded by AnCO subvention under the technical assistance scheme towards the cost of attendance at management courses.  The Irish Management Institute provides a comprehensive programme of management development.  The success of the small business development programme in improving the efficiency and profitability of small companies is particularly heartening.  The Government in supporting IMI activities are anxious to see to it that business itself contributes its fair share to training its personnel, be it at management or operative level.  State aid, therefore, should be focussed on special training needs not catered for by business.</P>
    <P>The main function of the National Manpower Service is to help job seekers find employment and employers to find suitable workers.  At present priority is being given to helping unemployed persons and first-time job seekers to find <Col N="1971" /> employment.  Additional placement officers have been recruited and I am satisfied that the National Manpower Service is now well geared to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>I should say that the task facing the NMS in the eighties is difficult and formidable in view of the fact that a high level of unemployment and a relatively low level of job vacancies are likely to continue for at least some years.  Closer liaison between NMS and the Department of Social Welfare is being developed through giving priority to those on the live register in submissions for vacancies notified to the NMS.  This will also help to discourage unwarranted recourse to unemployment benefit or assistance.</P>
    <P>I appeal to all employers to use the NMS more by notifying vacancies and to help reduce unemployment by selecting unemployed persons as far as possible to fill vacancies.  In 1982 the service found jobs for a significantly greater number of people than in 1981.  In all 30,800 persons were placed in employment, an increase of over 12 per cent on the previous year. There has, however, been a decline in notified vacancies in the early months of 1983.</P>
    <P>I propose now to deal with some of the other matters involving new legislation which are in hand or in contemplation in the Department.</P>
    <P>An EEC Directive concerning the protection of employees in insolvency situations will come into operation on 22 October next.  Progress has been made in recent years to give legislative protection to workers who lose their jobs because of the insolvency of their employers.  Payments owing to employees in respect of wages, holiday pay and other entitlements now rank as priority claims in insolvency situations.  In some instances, however, firms may close down leaving insufficient assets to cover these priority claims.  In such circumstances, under present legislation the employees may not always receive the arrears of pay to which they are entitled.  I intend to rectify the situation by introducing legislation before the end of the year which will <Col N="1972" /> ensure that workers' interests in the matter of arrears of wages, holiday money and so on will be protected.</P>
    <P>Our legislation governing working hours needs updating.  I will be introducing a Bill in the near future which will fix the normal working week at 40 hours. This Bill will also impose restrictions on the working of excessive overtime.  The systematic working of overtime is something of an anomaly in a situation where so many of our people are unemployed. I would hope that the enactment of this legislation will encourage managements to review their work practices, to improve them where possible and to examine any possibilities there may be for expanding employment in their undertakings.</P>
    <P>A review of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, is under way.  I hope to be in a position to introduce a Bill in the next Dáil session which will provide for the amendments which are necessary in the light of the operation of the 1977 Act. Most of these amendments will be of a technical and legal nature, and as a result of extensive consultations which have been held with interested parties, I am confident that the amending legislation will substantially improve what is inherently good legislation.</P>
    <P>Turning to the protective aspect of the general conditions under which workers are employed, I am having a review carried out of the Holiday (Employees) Act, 1973, and of the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973.  On completion of these reviews I will introduce any legislative or administrative changes which may be found necessary for their more effective operation, having regard to the experience of their operation over the decade which has elapsed since they were enacted.  In this connection it is my intention to consult with the social partners and consider their views.</P>
    <P>Also a review of the employment equality legislation &mdash; that is, the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, and the Employment Equality Act, 1977 &mdash; has been initiated and I expect that a substantial amending Bill will be necessary. These Acts have operated successfully to reduce the general incidence of direct <Col N="1973" /> discrimination on the basis of sex or marital status, but there is no room for complacency. Further action is needed, particularly to attack the more subtle forms of indirect discrimination.  I hope that the new Bill will be a further step in the direction of full equality of opportunity for all.</P>
    <P>The Protection of Employment Act, which is administered by my Department, obliges employers contemplating redundancies to notify the Minister for Labour and worker representatives in writing at least one month in advance of the proposed effective date.  The purpose of the Act is to allow for discussions to take place between all interests to establish what possibilities, if any, exist to save the jobs at risk.  I have reviewed the operation of the Act since it was first implemented in 1977 and I intend as a result to strengthen its provisions in two areas.  The required one month notification of impending redundancies has been shown to be too short to allow for an exhaustive examination of possibilities for salvaging jobs at risk.  I intend to extend the required notification period. I am also concerned that the penalties for non-compliance with the provisions of the Act should constitute a real deterrent and I therefore intend to put proposals before the House which will increase their level, and broaden their ambit, to achieve this result.</P>
    <P>I attended a meeting of the Council of EEC Social Affairs Ministers on 3 June last in Luxembourg.  The Social Affairs Council was of crucial importance for Ireland because they considered the question of review of the rules of the European Social Fund.  As Deputies will know, the Social Fund has become of immense significance for this country. Our returns from the fund have increased each year from £4.1 million in grant approvals in 1973 to an expected £130 million in the current year.  The fund has enabled us to develop our vocational training facilities at a rate which would have been quite impossible if we had been obliged to rely on our own resources.</P>
    <P>The rules of the Social Fund which have been in operation since 1978 were <Col N="1974" /> drawn up before the onset of the current recession when the levels of unemployment in most Community member states were relatively low.  At that time there was a general willingness to allow the fund's resources to be directed to regions like Ireland which had special problems of structural unemployment and a lack of capacity to deal with those problems.  In the review of the fund which has just been completed a marked change of opinion was evident.  A number of other Community member states which had previously not shown a particular interest in securing fund benefits for themselves were now endeavouring to change the rules so that they would obtain more assistance to deal with their increased unemployment problems.  In the process they displayed a lesser concern for the special circumstances of the weaker areas of the Community.</P>
    <P>The end result was that at last week's Council there was a strong move to end the special status of the so-called regions of absolute priority, that is, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Greenland, Greece, the Mezzogiorno of Italy and the French overseas territories.  Ireland came under the most severe pressure to accept proposals which would have undermined the special position of those absolute priority regions, if not immediately, certainly within the next couple of years.  Basically, these envisaged the preparation of a sort of &ldquo;league table&rdquo; calculated on a statistical basis which would be used as the sole method for allocation of fund money.  This &ldquo;league table&rdquo; would have regard to unemployment levels in different Community regions but would have taken inadequate account of the relative economic capacities of the individual member states.  In addition, it would have placed a very strong emphasis on the regions of industrial decline at the expense of those parts of the Community, such as Ireland, which have suffered from long-term structural unemployment.</P>
    <P>Those proposals I strongly resisted, with little support from other member states.  As a result of my resolute stance, the proposals which would have been totally contrary to Irish interests could not be approved.  The idea of a &ldquo;league <Col N="1975" /> table&rdquo; will still be pursued, but for regions other than the absolute priority regions.  While I have referred to my defence of Irish interests, I was, in fact, fighting the battle for all the most deprived regions of the Community.</P>
    <P>A solution eventually emerged, but only after several hours of hard debate. The most important single element of that solution was that it was agreed that with effect from 1984 a specific percentage of 40 per cent of the fund, higher than the average percentage of recent years, would be reserved for the regions of absolute priority of the Community. This represents a substantial improvement on the existing fund rules so far as the absolute priority regions are concerned.</P>
    <P>Now, however, for the first time a percentage is legally guaranteed for the number of regions which are given absolute priority status.  The preference enjoyed up to now by the absolute priority regions when it came to allocation of the fund's resources was given only through the guidelines for the administration of the fund which are liable to change from year to year.  I have now secured for the first time a legal commitment in favour of those regions which, because it will be enshrined in a Community decision, cannot be changed except by unanimous vote of the member states.  I can assure the House that as long as I am Minister for Labour no weakening on that guarantee will be entertained.</P>
    <P>The result of the new arrangement will be to assure the various Irish bodies which have been benefiting so substantially from the fund that they will continue to receive that essential support for a number of years ahead.  These beneficiaries cover a wide range of bodies including the Departments of Labour, Education and the Environment, AnCO, CERT, the IDA, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the National Rehabilitation Board, the Youth Employment Agency, health boards throughout the country and numerous voluntary bodies engaged in vocational rehabilitation of the handicapped. These bodies will now be able to plan their future activities in the secure <Col N="1976" /> knowledge that social fund assistance will continue to be available for them. Indeed, with the prospects of overall increases in the fund budget over the next few years, the amount of fund assistance which will be available for Ireland can be increased significantly.  A major element of the social fund package which was eventually agreed, subject to concertion with the European Parliament, was the decision to commit 75 per cent of the fund's budget to programmes designed to help young people.  Ireland, in common with other member states, was anxious to subscribe to this firm commitment to youth, while we were concerned at the same time to ensure that sufficient funds remained to help other disadvantaged categories such as the long-term unemployed and the handicapped.  In the end, the balance adopted seems just about right from our point of view.</P>
    <P>Now that the review of the social fund has been completed, I can say that what I succeeded in achieving in Luxembourg should be a source of substantial additional benefit to Ireland in the years ahead.  I am sure that Deputies on all sides of the House will welcome the result of the review.</P>
    <P>The last important item on which I propose to speak is industrial relations and industrial disputes.  My policy as Minister for Labour in regard to industrial disputes has consistently been one of no direct intervention.  It was my judgment, when I first took office as Minister, that direct intervention was totally counterproductive in terms of fostering a generally healthy industrial relations climate in the longterm.  There was, at that time, plenty of evidence around to indicate that my judgment in this respect was correct, and its appropriateness has been underlined in more recent times as the skeletons of previous ill-judged interventions by some of those who are now on the Opposition benches have rattled ominously. I have adhered to this policy despite, even in recent times, pressure from Opposition spokesmen to interfere directly in dispute situations.</P>
    <P>The pattern of strike activity over the past 20 years has, regrettably, shown a consistent upward trend.  A particular <Col N="1977" /> feature of this period has been the disproportionate effect which the &ldquo;one major strike&rdquo; phenomenon has had on our strike record.</P>
    <P>Statistics recently published show that the number of days lost due to strike action in the first quarter of 1983 was down on the corresponding figure for 1982.  A further analysis of these figures indicated that, in the main, strikes this year were of shorter duration than has previously been the case.</P>
    <P>It is to be hoped that where industrial action is resorted to during the remainder of this year, the trend established during the first quarter will be continued and the long-duration major strike will not become a feature of 1983 statistics.  There is one sure method by which recurrence of this phenomenon may be avoided and one on which I intend to elaborate fully. Employers and unions must operate fully the range of machinery which has been built up at local level and is available at national level to achieve a resolution of their differences before resorting to industrial action in the first place.</P>
    <P>No one can be under any illusion that in the present economic difficulties industrial relations harmony is not of paramount importance.  Industrial harmony in the workplace is important for the protection of existing employment, the generation of new employment opportunities within firms, the maintenance and improvement of productivity levels. Our efforts to ensure that competitiveness of our products and to regain a competitive edge for our goods on foreign markets underline the importance of good industrial practices at local level.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the maintenance of industrial peace is easy. What is absolutely necessary in the present economic climate is, however, the exercise of a sensitive and responsible approach by both management and workers to a dispute situation, an approach which will take all the relevant factors into account including the possible effect on other industry and other jobs and which may, before strike action becomes inevitable, lead to a reappraisal of what avenues for settlement may yet be pursued.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1978" /> In regard to the range of machinery which is provided at national level to aid the resolution of disputes, it is extremely important to ensure that this dispute-settling machinery is effective and responsive both to the particular circumstances of each individual case and the national interest.  Were this not to happen the implications for the economy and the maintenance of jobs would obviously be very serious indeed and in the long-term would undermine the potential of the machinery to discharge the role for which it was initially established.  I am aware that there is room for improvement.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court and its Industrial Relations Service, the Rights Commissioner Service and the Employment Appeals Tribunal incorporate between them a considerable degree of expertise. These institutions have an impressive record in relation to their capacity to resolve disputes which often appear to be intractable.  It is of the gravest importance that this record and the credibility of the institutions should be maintained. It is my intention to keep the operation and functions of these publicly-funded institutions under continuous review. Measures to increase their efficiency and effectiveness will be implemented where necessary.</P>
    <P>In the broader industrial relations scene, I have already indicated my intention of holding early discussions with both sides of industry to examine the scope which exists for improvement.</P>
    <P>Invitations have issued to the Federated Union of Employers and to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the invitations include a suggested agenda which is open to change to cover other items which either side wishes to include in the discussions.  I have adopted this approach to ensure the maximum level of flexibility. This is important to facilitate genuine exchanges and the search for a consensus. I am under no illusion as to the difficulty in arriving at a consensus on some of the more sensitive issues.  I am hopeful that, with the commitment of the social partners, it will be possible to agree on worthwhile changes in our existing arrangements. The time for a fundamental <Col N="1979" /> review of Irish industrial relations is long overdue.</P>
    <P>The crucial importance of constructive action in the field of industrial relations must again be emphasised, especially in the context of our present economic problems.  The benefits of minimising industrial strike are not as immediately quantifiable as increases in costs but are, nonetheless, just as real and important for the future growth of our economy.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered the main issues of interest to Deputies.  If they want additional information I will try to meet them when replying.  I recommend the Estimate to the House and take the opportunity to assure Deputies of my co-operation at all times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the Minister I and my party would have wished for more time to debate this important Estimate. I was proud to be a member of a Government which, for the first time last year, introduced Estimates before the year to which they applied.  Events prevented them from being discussed in the House.  The general election took place at the time the Estimates were prepared. However, it was our intention that Estimates such as this one would have been discussed in the last Dáil session of 1982. This is an area where Dáil reform is badly needed.  I look forward to the Government introducing the 1984 Estimates in this year's autumn session.  We would have proceeded with that innovation last year had events not overtaken us.</P>
      <P>I am happy to respond to the Minister's speech.  I look forward to seeing action by the Department.  The Minister has no other responsibility such as I had for the Public Service when I was Minister and as he had when he was Minister in 1981. A Minister of State has also been appointed to the Department.  On previous occasions we had one Minister with responsibility for two Departments.  Now we have two Ministers with responsibility for one Department.  I am disappointed that during the months they have been there very little has emerged.  I realise that because of the time constraints the Minister had to shorten his speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1980" /> We cannot gloss over this Estimate without referring to employment.  I accept that the responsibility of the Minister for Labour in the general employment sphere is rather limited.  While he has responsibility for youth employment it would be impossible to refer to that without referring to the overall employment scene.  We are all aware that the position has deteriorated and is deteriorating. The trends are disturbing.  There was a slight improvement last month but the seasonal adjustment showed a deterioration. The National Manpower Service in the Department of Labour is probably the area most closely related to the employment situation.  Has the Minister appointed a national director to the National Manpower Service yet?  If not, why not?  What, if any, consideration has the Minister given to the development of the service?  I did not take any final decisions but I did give consideration to the introduction of the aireacht concept into the National Manpower Service as a unit under the aegis of that Department. There were many arguments in favour of such a move.  Obviously there were arguments against it.  Has the Minister any views on this?</P>
    <P>This is an area where the Department are under severe pressure no matter where their offices are located because of the unemployment situation and the number of job applications.  I urge the Minister to go back to the Government and explore the possibility of further recruitment.</P>
    <P>The university examinations, for the most part, are over as are the regional colleges examinations.  The intermediate certificate and leaving certificate examinations are in progress and the matriculation examination has yet to take place. One could say we are moving towards the end of the examinations.  Where do we go from here as regards employment, additional training and so on?  What progress has been made?  The Minister was very sketchy in his reference to the Youth Employment Agency.  Criticisms have been made of the agency from time to time and there are those who say it was born in the 1981 Labour manifesto without a lot of thought having been given to it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1981" /> There was public controversy soon after the board was established by the Minister in his previous term of office when some members publicly criticised him because of his appointment of a chief executive.  He was appointed the day before I took office in February 1982.  It can be said to my credit that I supported his appointment.  It was a good appointment and he has a most difficult task before him.  The Minister and the Government must accept some of the responsibility for the difficulty of that task because of the unclear way the agency was launched.  We all recognise that particular attention must be paid to youth, to training, the development of work experience and if at all possible to employment prospects.  We must realise the importance of employment prospects in the productive area.  It is imperative that training and at least temporary employment be provided for young people to accommodate them in the transitional period from school to work life. I can claim credit for having redirected the educational system towards industry. The establishment of the Manpower Consultative Committee in 1978 was a major step forward and brought industry and education closer together.  That needs to be continued.</P>
    <P>We all know that in some areas of modern technology despite high unemployment figures it can still be difficult to recruit suitably educated and qualified people.  We must be ever conscious of the need for closer co-operation between education and industry.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be critical in a destructive way of any schemes.  I worry when I read regular sniping at these in magazines.  Last Monday week on the front page of one of the daily newspapers the National Manpower Service and AnCO were described as protangonists competing for similar schemes and money.  The Minister has an obligation to state clearly that this is not the case.  I accept that it is not the case.  There are major difficulties which were not spelled out clearly at the beginning. In the Labour manifesto before the 1981 election, provision was made for a <Col N="1982" /> 1 per cent levy to be specifically used for the training and employment of young people.  Both the Government of which the Minister was a Member in 1981 and the Government of which I was a Member in 1982 believed that the bulk of that levy should be used for the existing services such as AnCO, CERT, the environmental schemes programme and the educational schemes programme and that the revenue should be given to the Youth Employment Agency to enable them to initiate schemes of their own.  It is extremely important that they initiate such schemes.  I am the first to admit that they have difficulty in identifying major new ways forward.</P>
    <P>I should be interested in hearing from the Minister as to the present position of the COMTEK development.  He tells us that something is happening in that regard but my understanding is that this development was to have been launched a month or so ago but that this has not happened.  I should like him to tell us the reason for the delay and also what exactly is this scheme.  How similar is it, for instance, to a scheme being organised presently by AnCO in West Cork where a useful new scheme is being developed? That is the link scheme which was announced in 1982 and which has come to fruition in recent months.  The difference may well be that the West Cork scheme is not confined to under 25s but incorporates under 25s and adults in about a 50-50 proportion.  That is probably more geared to the needs of that area.</P>
    <P>As there is a danger of over-lapping in regard to the new scheme, I should like the Minister to spell out clearly what is involved.  I am anxious to be supportive of any efforts on the part of the Youth Employment Agency.  I displayed that support while in Government although I inherited a vexed situation, a situation in which I refused to be pushed by people who had gone public prior to my appointment and who wanted me to pursue the Minister, which I refused to do in the interest of youth employment.  Therefore, I cannot be accused of being critical or unsupportive in this area.  In terms of training and retraining in all areas. AnCO have done tremendous work.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> There is a very high calibre of people in that Stage agency.  Their commitment is to be found regularly throughout the network of centres and also through the external training programme.</P>
    <P>I welcome the improvement in the numbers being trained through the scheme.  I would hope that there would be a guarantee of work experience and of training for every young person leaving the education system at any level.</P>
    <P>When I assumed office first, the chairman at the time was a very good friend of all of us here, the late Mr. Michael Mullen.  At that time CERT were experiencing difficulties but as Minister I restored a good deal of confidence to that body.  The results were very satisfactory and CERT embarked on new training programmes for the hotel and catering industry.  I am glad that the success rate of CERT is continuing.  Since those early years of my ministry in 1977 and 1978, they have made rapid progress.  I trust that any support the Minister may give them will not be hindered in any way by any thinking there may be in other Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Irish Management Institute continue to enjoy the support of the Department. The institute provide a very important function in training for management, especially in the very important area of industrial relations.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to the Social Fund.  Alongside his contribution of today I have some paragraphs from last year's contributions from the then Opposition in this regard and some of these make interesting reading.  Perhaps the rapid change from one side of the House to the other conditions the minds of people to the fact that one should be very careful about switches of policy.  Last year while speaking from this side of the House the Minister was claiming some credit for the scene he had created for me in relation to the Social Fund.  I accept that he was involved in that area but I am sure he will admit that I played my part in creating the climate for him to have the final run down the straight.  We both played our parts in achieving what appears to be a reasonably good solution <Col N="1984" /> to a situation that might have been serious. We have benefited well from the Social Fund.</P>
    <P>We must keep continually under review new legislation and the question of conditions of employment.  I am glad to hear the Minister say he is reviewing certain Acts but I am sure he will agree that the review was well advanced before he assumed office.  I should like some information regarding legislation that I had expected to be before the House. Now that the Minister has a Minister of State to help him I would have thought that after six months in Government we would have had quite a number of pieces of legislation from the Department.  I was surprised during an Order of Business question to the Taoiseach a week or two ago concerning an hours-of-work Bill when he said that some aspects of the Bill had to be discussed further.  My understanding was that that Bill would have been before us in this session.  I urge the Minister to have it circulated as soon as possible so that we may take it early in the next session.  We will be supporting the broad principles of the Bill but obviously I will have to reserve my position on the details until we have seen the Bill.</P>
    <P>Again I would impress on the Minister the urgency in relation to the Unfair Dismissals Act.  With all the advisers who have been appointed to help the Minister, both he and his junior Minister should be able to devote a good deal of time to these urgent matters.  I did not have the luxury of such a back-up.  I refer especially to the taint-of-contract problem which as the Minister knows is causing some concern as a result of decisions taken over a period by the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  I presume the Minister will tell me that we may expect the relevant legislation to be before us, if not during the remainder of this session, some time in the next session.</P>
    <P>I am worried about temporary people, for example, nurses, being laid off.  Temporary in their case could mean that they would be employed for a couple of years. There might be a danger of people deliberately trying to thwart the control of the <Col N="1985" /> Act by continuing jobs on a temporary basis.  I would be glad if the Minister would have a look at that.</P>
    <P>What progress has been made in the dangerous substances area?  The Minister referred to the great work that had been done by my predecessor in 1977.  However, when I came into office I found legislation covered in dust which had not been implemented because of difficulties to do with the Offences Against The State Act.  I was able to resurrect and introduce most of it and make some regulations but a lot remains to be done particularly in relation to petrol retail outlets.  I had a meeting last September to discuss all this and we had arranged to meet again late in October but by that time events had overtaken us.  I would ask the Minister to say what progress has been made since.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service have been extremely helpful.  The employment incentive schemes have been good.  We extended them from just manufacturing and agricultural industries to include building and services generally.  The building workers demonstrated on the streets yesterday and it has to be accepted that the building industry is in crisis.  At the end of year there will be about 50 per cent of building workers unemployed.  I know the Minister will say he has not enough money but on the Finance Bill we indicated that there would be money over and above what the Minister budgeted for.  A small proportion of that money should be used to restore that scheme to cover the building industry. The Minister will say that we did not provide money in the Estimates but I can quote from the Official Report of 3 June 1982 what the Minister said at column 1010.  The Minister, then Deputy, was speaking about the increased moneys being made available in our budget and he said:</P>
    <P>While I welcome the improvements made to this scheme and in particular the increased level of premia payable to persons over 25 years and over 26 weeks without a job, I have some reservations which I hope the Minister will allay when replying.  First, I would ask where the additional £4 million is coming <Col N="1986" /> from.  Secondly, expenditure on this scheme in 1981 amounted to only about £1.21 million.</P>
    <P>The then Deputy was asking why we wanted all that money.  Now a few months later the Minister will say that we did not provide enough money even though we provided more than what we are talking about here.  Deputy Kavanagh went on</P>
    <P>I am, nevertheless, interested to know if the scheme will be extended to the building industry which could use this level of incentive to encourage the employment of thousands of people presently unemployed in the industry.</P>
    <P>The building industry suffered from unemployment but it was not in crisis at that time.</P>
    <P>In regard to industrial relations, the Minister stated his own philosophy.  It is very difficult to lay down absolute procedures to handle industrial relations. What is suitable for today is not necessarily suitable for next week.  Disputes arise which cause problems for existing machinery.  I, as Minister, always stood behind the institutions of the State. I sympathise with the Minister because there are extreme difficulties on the horizon because of a Government who negotiate publicly and announce their decisions publicly rather than making moves in the most discrete and correct forums in which they should be made.  I support all disputes being processed through the normal machinery, as far as possible but the Minister knows that there are many times when a Minister will discretely urge parties so as to get them to the table or to move from a strong position.  A Minister may not claim credit for it and when I write my memoirs I will claim some credit.  Despite what this Minister may say publicly, he knows that he will have to intervene in certain circumstances, so let us not throw bricks across the House at anybody and talk about rattling over previous decisions.  I intervened in a certain dispute which was subsequently settled satisfactorily and certain organisations criticised me for being in breach of the national wage <Col N="1987" /> agreement.  I proved that I was not in breach of it but this is the kind of controversy a Minister for Labour will always face in such situations.</P>
    <P>We had a reasonably peaceful climate but the last six months have been tempestuous and most difficult.  It was not all caused by industrial relations but the trouble was contributed to by decisions of the Minister for Finance in his budget. I took the Minister's advice last year and did all the things he asked me to do in the House.  I am sorry that the Minister has allowed industrial relations to deteriorate. The Minister referred to what had been a comparatively peaceful period and he said at column 1017 on 3 June 1982:</P>
    <P>The Minister has had a period of industrial peace in which to formulate policy for wage agreements over his period of office.</P>
    <P>The Minister was claiming credit for the peace I was having then.  Deputy Kavanagh said that:</P>
    <P>Before the last election and during that election he promised to renegotiate the national wage agreement.</P>
    <P>I interrupted to say that I had not so promised but I did negotiate agreements in the public service area which the Minister and his colleagues should be able to use beneficially.  Strikes and threats of strikes have been numerous.</P>

      <P>I created a climate in which I had hoped we would see further peace but instead there has been much unrest.  The Minister belongs to a party who screamed for my resignation time and again when industrial disputes were in progress.  I have never called for the resignation of a Minister for Labour during an industrial dispute because I do not believe in doing so.  I cannot say that the present Minister ever asked for my resignation but certain members of his party did, as well as a number of Deputies who are now Ministers, notably the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who was Opposition spokesman at that time.  On many occasions in this House and outside he screamed for my resignation, yet the Minister now says that intervention can be harmful.  Circumstances are not the same in any two disputes and the apparent problem may not be the real problem. The Minister must take his own decision in relation to each dispute.  He is elected in the public interest and that must always be taken into consideration.  While he is guardian of the public interest he must take decisions at appropriate times.  He will always have my support and will never be asked by me to resign.</P>

      <P>The screams for my resignation were loudest while delicate efforts were being made to solve disputes.  They were emitted by a man <Col N="1989" /> who is not doing any good for himself or the image of politicians.</P>
      <P>The Labour Court is a tremendous institution but I must add in passing that I was somewhat taken aback at some recent comments by the court in relation to a certain appointment in the west and the criticism of one or two of my colleagues. This was a little strange and unusual.  I always supported the Labour Court on the industrial relations scene. They should leave the question of appointments to others.  The politicians concerned offered very satisfactory explanations and I understand they were not even heard as witnesses.  Having said that, I found the court to be an excellent institution and I added the fourth division during my period in office.  I was concerned to assure consistency and the role of the chairman in co-ordinating the various divisions.</P>
      <P>The conciliation service is composed of dedicated and committed people.  This is a specialised area and not everybody can adjust to that role because it needs a special type of commitment and patience which is not given to everybody.  For the most part the conciliation officers with whom I came in contact gave excellent service.</P>
      <P>There are now two Ministers in this Department and there may be times when they will have to lose a night's sleep or a weekend's relaxation.  They should keep their options open.  I remember being told from the Labour Party benches that I was not like my predecessor, Deputy Michael O'Leary, in standing back from a strike, because he always intervened.  I warn the Minister not to adopt too hard a line in what he says he will do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have skimmed over AnCO, CERT and the IMI.  I want to praise all those concerned, the boards and councils, including the personnel, who give of their time so freely.  I want to pay a tribute to the director of AnCO who retired during the year.  It was he who spearheaded with the then Minister for Labour, our President today, the Industrial Training Act through this House.  A few years later he assumed the role of director of that State <Col N="1990" /> body and helped to nurse it from being a very small organisation to being a major contributory factor in the training of youths or the retraining of youths.  As AnCO developed, new horizons were reached.  The Equality Acts were introduced. The role of women in society changed and training facilities for women became a major feature of AnCO.  That may have slowed somewhat now because of the recession but it was a development I certainly welcomed.  Jack Agnew gave years of service to the State and then moved into this State board.  I thank him for his contribution and I wish him a happy retirement.  He has been replaced by Malachy Sherlock and I wish him well.</P>
    <P>There may be occasions on which there will be overlapping and times when justifiable criticism may be made against one or other of the State bodies but once their priorities are right in training and work experience they should be given every opportunity to continue the good work they are doing.  With regard to adult unemployment, the age is now dropping to the late thirties and early forties.  These people need retraining and they must be given every opportunity to retrain.</P>
    <P>With reference to the protagonists referred to in that national newspaper, I dislike both the term and the inference. I believe the employment agency has difficulties. I criticise the structure of it.  It is understandable that there should be problems.  It was given a high profile for a very few reasons at the time and, because of that, it is wearing a mantle that may have increased the difficulties for it.  I would prefer to see comment emanating on the basis of co-operation, co-ordination and developing together in the interests of youth.  That is the function and purpose.</P>
    <P>I know there is difficulty for the Minister in regard to funding.  His Government have taken certain decisions.  My Government took certain decisions.  The levy would not be given directly to the board and I know there are people on the board who think the 1 per cent levy should go direct to them and they should have charge of its distribution.  The figure mentioned is £77 million.  It is a bit much to expect particularly at the beginning. <Col N="1991" /> The residue this year is £15 million.  There is a problem here and I am sure the Minister and his junior will be looking at it.  It is important when money is taken like that from workers that it should be spent in the best possible way for the development of young people.  Overlapping is inevitable.  It is difficult to find new programmes.  Like myself I am sure the Minister has been investigating various schemes in different countries.  We know what can be done.  The pilot projects are very good and I hope they will increase in the future.</P>

The injunction process is a growth concern.  These are areas that must be looked at.  I shall be helpful and co-operative in areas in which I can be both helpful and co-operative.  A great deal can be done and the Minister can be assured of our co-operation.  We will be looking forward to a very busy autumn. <Col N="1992" /> I would expect that with two Ministers there now.

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Opposition spokesman for allowing me time.  One of the major changes in the administration procedure which has taken place since the coming into office of this Government has been the decision to locate responsibility for youth affairs in the Department of Labour.  That decision was prompted by the recognition that the single greatest problem facing young people was youth unemployment. If anybody has any doubts about that, even this very short debate this evening will show just how true that statement is. That decision involved the transfer of functions from the Department of Education to the Department of Labour. Indeed it was already the case that much of the work of the youth section in the Department of Education bordered on the employment area through the administration of the temporary employment scheme.  We entered office with a commitment to regard the funding of the youth services as an area of priority.  We found ourselves with the Book of Estimates before us.  Deputy Fitzgerald made the point that those Estimates were published in the run-up to the election.  The Estimates revealed an increase of only 1 per cent for the youth service, a figure that seemed quite inadequate given the rate of inflation to which the State had been subjected.  In those circumstances, in order to comply with our commitment to regard youth services as a priority, it was necessary for us to allocate additional funding and that we did to the tune of some £550,000.  That has allowed a number of initiatives to be taken.  First of all, it has allowed us to move on the development officer front.  Development officers who were doing very worthwhile work in a number of youth and community organisations throughout the country had been in existence for some four years and their rate of remuneration had remained unchanged at £5,000.  The allocation of extra funds enabled us to <Col N="1993" /> increase that figure from £5,000 to £7,000 per head.  In addition, it enabled us to increase very substantially the grant-aids to the existing youth organisations that had historically received support from the State.  They received increases that averaged out at 18 per cent, which every Member of the House will agree was very substantial against the present economic climate.  In addition it was possible for the first time in recent years for us to admit a number of new organisations into the scheme.  Members of the House will welcome particularly the decision to admit An Óige and Macra na Feirme because they were organisations which had not in the first instance found their way within the scheme and had won the sympathy of all sides of this House in their efforts to secure support from the scheme.  In recent years, while there has been a degree of goodwill, it was not possible to make such a decision.  I am glad to say that it was possible to move this year, the decision was taken and both of those organisations received grant-aid from the youth section of the Department of Labour this year for the first time.</P>
      <P>A number of policy decisions are imminent.  The Government have a commitment, shared by the previous administration, to introduce a national award scheme to promote excellence and endeavour on the part of our young people.  The necessary decisions to put that into effect have now been taken and an announcement is imminent.  Equally the Government have been concerned and have expressed their commitment very specifically to the various youth organisations that a clearly defined national government youth policy would issue.  Again I am happy to tell Members of the House that an announcement will be made in the very near future in that area.</P>
      <P>There are a number of other areas both within the youth area and in the Department generally to which I would like to make reference but, given the time constraints, I will confine myself to what I have said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister said that <Col N="1994" /> the time for a fundamental review of Irish industrial relations is long overdue.  I concur very much with that particularly in the light of what was almost a calamity in the general area where I come from, the Ballina district, where because of an industrial dispute one of the major employers, Asahi, was in imminent danger of closing.  It is ironic and terribly wrong that a firm whose industrial relations are first class, with the exception of one fairly long dispute of about three weeks&mdash;their only dispute&mdash;should find themselves because of outside circumstances in danger of closing.  I would like now publicly to congratulate the Ballina Trades Council for the tremendous efforts they made in the solving of this dispute and I thank the Minister for the efforts he made when he was contacted by myself and the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry on this matter.  A situation should not be allowed to exist where people are quite willing to work, where the trade unionists in a factory are willing to work, and the factory finds itself almost at the point of closure.</P>
      <P>This factory was within two days of closing for keeps because of an industrial dispute over which they had no control. When the review the Minister is talking about is undertaken consideration of that should be one of the main priorities.  As a result of the dispute a number of suggestions were made.  Some tribunal should be set up to take into account the special problems relating to sensitive industries like Asahi where it can take three to four days to close down the plant and perhaps three or four weeks to get it open.  Here I pay tribute to the CIE drivers who gave up their dispute only because of the danger to Asahi.  These men's right to strike now seems to be ended for all time and I do not think that that is right either.  Therefore, people like them should also be covered by this tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That dispute was barely over before we had the dispute at Dublin docks whereby the same situation arose.  In the first dispute the Marine Port and General Workers Union agreed to let the raw material, acrilonitrile, through, but in the second strike it did not get through and <Col N="1995" /> again there was a very clear danger of a factory whose industrial relations in its own plant were first class closing because of a dispute in another area over which it had no control.  It is time that we had either a tribunal or a court which would look after sensitive industries in relation to the supply of raw material.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that the Minister said that there will be no new centres for AnCO. Here I will be a little parochial and say that in the Ballina area we have been looking for an AnCO centre for ages.  It was to be built even by private finance last year, and this would help the building industry in the Ballina area.  I understand that there is a proposal with the Minister's Department for a considerable length of time, going back to when my colleague was Minister for Labour, and the decision has not finally been made.  I know that private finance is available to build a new AnCO centre at Ballina and I would be grateful if the Minister would, not necessarily now but at some stage, let me know the position in relation to that. Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I congratulate AnCO for the tremendous job they have done.  I have had first hand experience of the work they do and I feel that their activities should be expanded considerably.</P>
    <P>I thank the Minister for giving me a copy of his speech before he made it. One thing he had not time to mention is something that Deputy Fitzgerald as Minister did a great deal about, and that is the question of dangerous substances. I feel from a glance through the Minister's speech that he intends to do something in the near future about this.  Something should be done and the Act which Deputy Fitzgerald brought in as Minister for Labour should be reviewed in the light of the tremendous amount of substances that are now coming into the country, particularly for the new chemical industries that have been established in the last few years.  The fears that people have stem from the lack of knowledge of the substances that are being carried.  Again, I will mention Asahi and the amount of bad publicity they got from people who did not know what they <Col N="1996" /> were talking about and who had for years put up with such substances much closer to them, which made all of us in the west pretty sick.  If the Dangerous Substances Act was updated and the provisions in it tightened the fears of many fire officers would be settled and the general public would not be as fearful.</P>
    <P>With regard to the National Manpower Service, like the Minister I appeal to all employers to advertise through that service.  Frankly, the feeling that many young people have is one of despondency with regard to that service.  They put their names down for any type of work but do not hear anything.  I am not blaming the service but any institution of State established to do a specific job should be permitted to do that work.  All vacancies, including temporary Government ones, should be filled through the National Manpower Service.  If that happened we would not have had the bad publicity that there has been in recent months.  There is a lot more I would like to say about this Department but in view of the decision to curtail the debate and the fact that Deputy Fitzgerald has put a number of questions to the Minister I will give the remainder of the time to the Minister.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank Members who have contributed to the debate on the Estimate. I regret that we have not had more time to debate the activities of the Department of Labour, a most important Department in view of the difficulties we are facing.  It is a key economic Department and it is unfortunate that the House must rush through this Estimate in less than two hours.  A number of questions have been raised by Deputies Gene Fitzgerald and Calleary.  I will not be able to deal adequately with them in the short amount of time available to me but I can assure Deputies that I will deal with their queries and communicate with them on the points raised.  I do not think it would be fair and reasonable to expect me in seven minutes to expand on the sizeable number of queries that were put to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald asked if a National Manpower director had been appointed.  That official has not been <Col N="1997" /> appointed.  A report was commissioned by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald when he was Minister last summer but certain things have happened in the meantime that made it difficult to make the appointment. For example, we have had a transfer from the Department of Education to the Department of Labour.  As the Deputy is aware, there are interests outside the Department who feel they should be considered.  I do not intend to deal with this problem without taking into account the various interests and the staff consultations and negotiations that must take place.  Obviously, I would prefer the appointment to be made with the full concurrence of those interested in that area.  For that reason I am considering the review but I hope to be in a position in the near future to make that appointment.</P>
    <P>One of the areas that caused some difficulty for Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was the operation of the Youth Employment Agency.  He suggested that the fact that it was not properly set up in the first place caused some of the trouble and he referred to the attitudes that have grown up about it since their establishment.  I must make the point that the agency have been in operation for one year.  When I was reappointed to the Department I was amazed to discover that the agency had a staff of eight.  That was not adequate to do.  If delays occurred in operations, and do.  If delays occurred in operations, and if the agency have not been able to operate in the areas they would have liked to and investigate the many projects that were piling up, one of the reasons was the lack of staff.</P>
    <P>It is strange to hear the agency being compared to AnCO when one considers the staff complement in AnCO.  The view has been expressed that the two State agencies should be performing similar functions but people who say that should read the debate in the House when the legislation establishing the Youth Employment Agency was being dealt with to understand that the body should be doing. A number of myths have developed about the agency and what they should be doing.  Many think they should be creating jobs but the intention was that <Col N="1998" /> the agency would expand training facilities, work experience areas and, where possible, create jobs.  It was the intention to extend existing institutions and that has been achieved in the AnCO area and in areas of the Departments of Labour and Education.  I gave the figures earlier tonight.  I have increased the staff considerably and as a result I have no doubt that the work of the agency in the future will be more effective.  Projects will be undertaken and decisions made quickly.</P>
    <P>The delay in setting up COMTEK was as a result of the staffing problem.  However, a successful seminar was held in the RDS in Ballsbridge two weeks ago to deal with the proposals for COMTEK. Many agencies attended the seminar and discussed the matter in detail.  I hope to see developments in this area very soon.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the work done by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald when Minister for Labour with regard to the social fund.  I have no doubt that if he was in my position in Europe two weeks ago he would not have adopted a different approach. I do not think we will fight over the social fund.  As a result of the work done by the officials in my Department, those who specialise in that area, our efforts in Europe were very successful.  I am happy with the work carried on in the various sections of my Department and the activities of the agencies associated with the Department.  They deserve our compliments.</P>
    <P>There may have been slight differences in the past in our approach in the field of industrial relations.  I disagree with Deputy Gene Fitzgerald who suggested that there had been a serious disruption in industrial relations in recent months. That is not so and the figures are available for inspection.  We have had difficulties, and we will always have them, but our active participation in the area of industrial disputes has been successful.  I am anxious to ensure that every effort is made to settle disputes and there has been a personal surveillance by me of any dispute that was brought to my attention. I am pleased to say that there has been a happy outcome to almost all the disputes that I have been involved in since I <Col N="1999" /> returned to the Department.  I hope that will continue.  I disagree with the Deputy when he said that there has been a decline in the area of industrial relations since I returned to the Department.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy Calleary, the people mentioned by him, and the Minister for the Gaeltacht, Deputy O'Toole, for their hard work in regard to the dispute at Asahi.  That help was crucial. I thank them for it.  I want to correct Deputy Calleary on one small item.  He said that I stated in my speech that there would not be any new AnCO centres built.  I said there would be a review of the situation after the completion of the present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We want to take another look at the whole situation, see how it is going, see where the shortfall is in the various areas and see where they are most needed.  It is obvious that one should review a situation after a fairly hefty burst of activity in that area and look at the gaps there are.  Certainly, if Mayo is one of the areas that turn up at the top of the heap after that review, I will be only too delighted in the years to come to be able to come back in here and tell the Deputy about that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £200,638,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Defence, including certain services administered by that Office; for the pay and expenses of the Defence Forces; and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Defence Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1983 is for a net sum of £200,638,000 of which £160,481,000, or <Col N="2000" /> 80 per cent, provides for pay and allowances. An additional sum of £1,898,000 will be provided from the Vote for remuneration to cover the cost of the arrears of the final phase of the Agreement on Pay in the Public Service.  The Estimate is based on an average strength of 1,519 officers, 104 cadets and 12,800 other ranks, a total of 14,423 in the Permanent Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>The net out-turn for 1982 came to £208,651,000, which includes £7,084,000 charged to the Vote for remuneration. The gross provision in the Estimate, at £222,438,000, represents an increase of 2 per cent on the 1982 out-turn and includes £61,957,000 for non-pay items. Allowing for increased appropriations-in-aid, offset to some extent by increased provision for pay and allowances, the net provision of £200,638,000 for 1983 is 4 per cent less than the 1982 out-turn figure of £208,651,000.</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate of £222.438 million includes in round terms an Army provision of £172 million, a Naval Service provision of £25 million and an Air Corps provision of £15 million.  The provision for Civil Defence is £1.365 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the demands made on officers and men of the Defence Forces.  While the primary role of the Defence Forces is to defend the State against external aggression their main preoccupation during the past 12 months has continued to be with internal security matters.  The Garda Síochána have primary responsibility for such matters and the involvement of the Defence Forces in this field derives from their role of rendering aid to the civil power.  The deployment of Army personnel and resources in this capacity in Border areas continues to be necessary and the current security situation makes it necessary for the Army to participate in a wide variety of difficult and dangerous activities.  Some details of these activities in 1982 are as follows:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Over 21,000 military parties were supplied in Border areas for checkpoint duties and over 17,000 joint Garda/Army checkpoints were set up;</P>
    <P>&mdash;more than 11,000 patrols were sent <Col N="2001" /> out into the road network along the Border;</P>
    <P>&mdash;escorts for explosives and blasting operations were provided on over 1,200 occasions;</P>
    <P>&mdash;about 150 requests for bomb disposal teams were handled.</P>
    <P>In addition certain vital non-military installations are protected either by permanent military guards or by military patrols.  The Army also provide guards and escorts for civilian prisoners and movement of cash and help in searches for arms, ammunition and explosives. These duties place a heavy burden on the Defence Forces and also on the Garda Síochána.  I would like to pay tribute to all members of the Defence Forces, and to the Garda Síochána, for the excellent manner in which they have carried out their allotted tasks.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, military custody of civilian prisoners has come to an end.  The few civilian prisoners remaining in the Military Detention Barracks in the Curragh were transferred to civil prisons last month.  This will, I am sure, be welcomed by Deputies on all sides of the House.</P>
    <P>Aside from the normal security duties, assistance to the community at large is provided in a variety of ways.  For example, during 1982 76 search and rescue missions were undertaken by Air Corps aircraft and a total of 180 air ambulance missions were flown conveying seriously ill patients to hospital.  Procedures are established whereby local authorities and health boards may call on the Defence Forces in situations involving major accidents, blizzards, fire, flooding, spillage of dangerous substances, and so on.  Work on a review and up-dating of these procedures is currently proceeding.</P>
    <P>Assistance has also been given on occasions to maintain essential supplies and services during industrial disputes involving public transport, refuse collection, fire fighting, petrol and oil deliveries, water and sewerage.  All of these activities make very heavy and continuous demands on the manpower and resources of the Defence Forces.  On the <Col N="2002" /> occasion of the annual debate on the Defence Estimate it is I suggest only right that we should acknowledge and pay tribute to the splendid manner in which the Defence Forces discharge the many duties they are called upon to undertake. They do so unobtrusively and effectively and whenever required to cope with a particular situation they respond quickly and competently.  It is clear that the Defence Forces are held in high esteem and deservedly so on their performance.</P>
    <P>The pay and conditions of service generally of members of the Defence Forces continue to be maintained at a high standard. The Government are concerned to ensure that the remuneration of the Defence Force keeps step with that of other sectors of the Public Service.  The pay of a recruit is now £100.98 a week, rising after about 14 weeks' basic training to £117.47.  On advancement to Private 3 Star gross pay rises to £121.22 while, after three years' service, the gross pay of a Private is over £132.  The second instalment of arrears due under the third phase of the Agreement on Pay in the Public Sector has been paid to other ranks personnel.  This instalment will be paid to officers in their &ldquo;end of June&rdquo; pay cheques.</P>
    <P>In addition special allowances are payable to officers and men who perform duties of a security nature.  The current rates of allowance for service in the Border area are £15.40 per week for officers and £13.30 per week for men.  Personnel involved in security duties such as duties in aid of the civil power and guard duties on vital installations are paid an allowance at the rate of £6.50 for any such duties undertaken on weekdays and at the rate of £13 for duties undertaken on a Sunday or Army holiday.  The overseas allowances payable to personnel on service with the United Nations were quite generous when first granted but have been eroded by inflation.  I would like to see them and indeed all allowances revised but the present financial climate is distinctly unhelpful.  This matter will, however, be kept under review.</P>
    <P>The current strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 14,000 officers and men is considered the minimum adequate for <Col N="2003" /> the tasks in hand.  Early last year, after the strength of the Permanent Defence Force had reached its highest level since the demobilisation in 1946, general recruitment was suspended.  This step was due mainly to the necessity to maintain strict financial controls because of the need to curb public expenditure.  The question of resuming limited recruitment to replace normal wastage has been kept under review in the interval and I am pleased to say that it is proposed in the near future to recruit 330 personnel to make up this wastage within the numerical limit of 12,800.  In addition 100 apprentices and 46 cadets will be enlisted later in the year.  It is intended that the recruits will be allocated to units in the Eastern and Curragh Commands where the operational strength of certain units has fallen seriously.</P>
    <P>There are about 2,000 civilians employed with the Defence Forces.  They are generally employed by my Department to do work for the Forces for a lot of which it would either be inappropriate or uneconomic to employ soldiers who are trained for specific military duties.</P>
    <P>This year as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure, it has been necessary to reduce annual training by seven days for members of the Reserve of Officers (First Line), the Reserve of Men (First Line), An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí.  Notwithstanding the reduced period of annual training I have decided that the gratuity payable to qualified members of the Reserve Defence Force who complete the maximum permissible period in 1983 will be at the full rates and not at the reduced rates which would normally apply in respect of attendance for training for the shorter period.</P>
    <P>As announced by my Department some time ago, it has been necessary to suspend recruitment to An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí.  The strength of both these elements, however, remains at a high level.  At the end of last December the strength of the FCA was 20,800 and of An Slua Muirí was 425. These measures in relation to the <Col N="2004" /> Reserve Forces were forced upon the Government because of the urgent requirement to reduce public expenditure this year.  The fact that it was necessary to do those things should not cloud in any way the value of the Reserve Defence Force as a whole or its potential &mdash; as the largest component of the Defence Forces &mdash; in regard to the defence of the country.  It would be my wish that normal training and recruitment should be resumed immediately resources permit and the position in that regard is being kept under constant review.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the Permanent Defence Force is making a significant contribution in the cause of international peace by way of participation in a number of United Nations peace-keeping missions.  This participation commenced 25 years ago in June 1958 when Ireland first sent officers to act as observers in Lebanon.  Since that time thousands of Irish personnel have seen service in the cause of peace in many parts of the world.  We have at present an Irish contingent of about 750 all ranks serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon.  This force is commanded by an Irish Officer, Lieutenant-General William Callaghan.  We have also an Irish contingent of eight personnel serving in staff appointments with the United Nations Force in Cyprus and 21 Irish officers serving as observers with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation in the Middle East.</P>
    <P>During the course of a recent visit to Lebanon, I was able to gain a substantial appreciation of the significant contribution that the Irish contingent is making in the cause of peace in that country.  I am very impressed by the selfless and conscientious efforts of our troops on these missions.  They have a heavy incidence of duty and have to work in terrain that is difficult and in circumstances which can at times be hazardous.  We must all be mindful that a number of Irish personnel have paid the supreme sacrifice in the cause of peace in the Middle East.  Others have suffered injury, indignity and hardship. Their consolation is the high esteem in which they are held by the local population <Col N="2005" /> who see them as friends and benevolent protectors and who are worried that an altered mandate might see a withdrawal.  I have recently received a letter from the community leaders in the Irish Battalion area asking that the Government use their influence to ensure a continuance of United Nations presence.</P>
    <P>I am proud to say that the contribution of these troops to United Nations peace-keeping efforts is well recognised internationally and was highly praised by the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Perez de Cuellar, in the course of his recent visit to Ireland.  Our officers and men are a credit to the Defence Forces and to Ireland.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent on us to support in every possible way the efforts of the Secretary-General towards finding the basis for a settlement in the Middle East which would lead to a lasting peace.  We must continue to hope that it will not be long before these efforts find some fruitful response.</P>
    <P>The overall effectiveness and efficiency of the Permanent Defence Force can only be maintained by a high level of training and education for all Army personnel. All personnel undergo constant training within their own corps or service and jointly with units of other corps or services.  In addition, so that the level of knowledge and expertise may be kept in line with modern developments in other armies, and to provide for the efficient maintenance and operation of the many sophisticated equipments in use in the Defence Forces, it is the practice to assign a number of personnel to courses of training in foreign military establishments.  It is anticipated that such courses will be undertaken in Britain, Holland and France during 1983.</P>
    <P>A scheme exists whereby personnel are registered with AnCO as apprentices in various trades such as fitter, motor mechanic, sheet metal worker, bricklayer, plasterer and painter/decorator. These personnel attend either fulltime off-the-job training courses, day-release courses, or block release courses.</P>
    <P>During 1982 a total of 91 officers attended full-time courses at third level <Col N="2006" /> educational institutions.  The practice of assigning officers to such courses will be continued in 1983.</P>
    <P>Competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army, Air Corps and Executive Branch of the Naval Service were conducted in 1982 and some 60 cadetships were awarded.  These cadets commenced training in November 1982.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made to train Executive Branch cadets of the Naval Service in Ireland in future.  Their training will be undertaken initially at the Cadet School in the Curragh but mainly at the naval base and on board Naval Service vessels.  A number of instructors are provided by Cork Regional Technical College on a part-time basis.  Ten officers have been commissioned to date under a cadet scheme which was introduced in 1978 for the purpose of providing the Naval Service with qualified marine engineer officers.  Four of these officers completed a course of training abroad late last year.  It is expected that they will be qualified marine engineer officers by 1986.  The remaining six officers will undergo a course of training abroad later this year and they will complete their training on return to this country.  In addition, under the scheme five engineering cadets are currently undergoing training in Cork Regional Technical College and these will be commissioned this year.</P>
    <P>Further competitions for the award of cadetships in the Army, the Air Corps and Naval Service will be held this year.</P>
    <P>The competitions for 28 Army, eight Air Corps and four Naval Service Executive Branch cadetships will be advertised shortly.  The number of Army cadetships to be awarded in 1983 is lower than the norm for recent years.  Because of this and the necessity, in times of scarce resources, to concentrate on building-up the operational strength of the Defence Forces, the competition will, regretfully, have to be confined to male applicants.</P>
    <P>A separate competition will be held this year for the award of six cadetships in the Equitation School and will take place at the same time as the other competitions. The purpose of the competition, which is a new one, is to effect an <Col N="2007" /> improvement in the number of satisfactory riders available to the Equitation School.  It is a special scheme and its principal features are:</P>
    <P>(i)  the competition includes a riding test and applicants are expected to have some experience of, and have competed in, equestrian events;</P>
    <P>(ii)  the educational requirements are not as high as normally required for Army cadetships;</P>
    <P>(iii)  those successful will undergo a one-year course at the Cadet School; following which</P>
    <P>(iv)  they will be commissioned as Second-Lieutenants for a three year period;</P>
    <P>(v)  if suitable and willing, they may be appointed to commissioned rank without limitation as to time on completion of the three years as officers;</P>
    <P>(vi)  they will be paid a special gratuity on completion of their three years commissioned service.</P>
    <P>This competition will be open to male and female applicants.</P>
    <P>Twenty-four non-commisioned officers were commissioned in October 1982 after completing a potential officers' course.</P>
    <P>The non-pay provisions for this year are just under £62 million gross.  These provisions have been set at the levels necessary to maintain Defence Force capabilities and to meet commitments already entered into.</P>
    <P>Contracts for five twin-engined helicopters were signed last December with the French aircraft manufacturer, Aerospatiale. The model ordered is a Dauphin 2, which will accommodate up to ten persons, including the crew.  The aircraft has a fast cruise speed of over 150 knots and an endurance of about 4½ hours.  The helicopters will have a rescue hoist and radar equipment capable of detecting small craft in rough seas.  The helicopters will also have an electronic flight instrument system and will be able to fly at night and in conditions of reduced visibility.</P>
    <P>Two of the helicopters are due for delivery at the end of 1984.  These two <Col N="2008" /> helicopters will be used in conjunction with the new patrol vessel for the Naval Service.  That vessel, which is at present under construction at Verolme Cork Dockyard will be fitted with a deck and hangar suitable for the operation of a helicopter.  The EEC will be contributing to the cost of the vessel and the helicopters.</P>
    <P>The other three helicopters are being acquired to replace three Alouette helicopters also manufactured by Aerospatiale which are now 20 years old and which have given sterling service over the years.  One is due for delivery in 1985 and the other two in 1986.  The replacement helicopters are intended mainly for search and rescue, air ambulance and transport missions.  No payments in respect of the contracts for these helicopters fall due in 1983.</P>
    <P>Provision is also made for a stage payment for a new radar system for Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel.  This system was ordered last year as part of a programme to modernise the aerodrome facilities at Baldonnel and is due to come into operation in 1984.  It will assist landing in conditions of reduced visibility.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Estimate for buildings which includes new works, repairs, renewals and maintenance is £5,621,000 against an out-turn last year of £5,400,000.  Included in the provision is a sum of £3.5 million for new building works to improve accommodation and facilities for the Defence Forces.</P>
    <P>Improved accommodation for the single soldier continues to receive attention. New billets with central heating have been built in recent years at the Curragh Camp, Finner Camp, Dundalk Barracks, Gormanston Camp, Renmore Barracks, Galway; Fermoy and the Naval Base, Haulbowline.  At Casement Aerodrome a modern well equipped technical stores has recently been completed and work is at an advanced stage on a major extension to the apprentices' hostel.  Both of these buildings will be heated from a new central boiler using natural gas.  Tenders have recently been invited for major new works including a brigade headquarters and officers' mess at Gormanston Camp. <Col N="2009" /> Further works at Casement Aerodrome and at Gormanston Camp to meet the needs of the Air Corps are planned.</P>
    <P>The continuing development of the Naval Service will also require additional buildings and facilities.  Since the necessary space is not available on Haulbowline, it is planned to provide these buildings and facilities on Spike Island and certain works there have already commenced. Site investigations in the area between Spike Island and Haulbowline have been carried out to provide certain information required for the design of a bridge between the two locations.  However, the actual work of building will have to wait the availability of the necessary resources.</P>
    <P>Significant works completed in the last year included new cookhouses and dining halls at Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, and at Finner Camp, a new building for motor transport classes at the Apprentice School, Devoy Barracks, Naas, a new vehicle servicing area at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin, and a new FCA headquarters at Portlaoise.  The modernisation of the swimming pool at the Curragh Camp has also been finished and the new Army sports pavilion at the Phoenix Park will shortly be ready for use.  In Collins Barracks, Dublin, billets are being converted to cubicles and central heating is being installed.  Billets are also being converted to cubicles at McKee Barracks, Dublin, and are to be so converted at Custume Barracks, Athlone. Improved sanitary and ablution facilities for single soldiers are being provided at Cathal Brugha Barracks, Dublin; Casement Aerodrome; Kickham Barracks, Clonmel; and McDonagh Barracks, Curragh Camp.  Amongst the other works in hand are the modernisation of men's canteens at McKee Barracks, Dublin; Custume Barracks, Athlone; and McGee Barracks, Kildare, and improvements to the men's cookhouse at Collins Barracks, Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is customary in this context to refer to the position regarding married quarters for the Defence Forces.  Over the years some 346 new married quarters have been provided at various locations but a considerable number of the old type <Col N="2010" /> married quarters&mdash;more than 550&mdash;still remain.  It is very easy to subscribe to the proposition that these old quarters should be replaced and that this should be done with all speed.  I would, however, question whether soldiers should be housed by the Department of Defence as a special group rather than be treated as citizens in the normal way and be provided with houses in the same fashion as other members of the community.</P>
    <P>Over the years the line adopted by my Department has been that the provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities and that married soldiers have an equal claim on such housing with other members of the community in the same income category.  The Department's policy has been stated as being that of supplementing the efforts of local authorities where soldiers' housing needs are greatest.  The system, however, under which married quarters are allocated at present leads inevitably to the problem of overholding of such quarters &mdash; a situation which arises when, on termination of military service, for example, the occupant of married quarters continues, with his family, in irregular occupation of quarters.  At present some 110 married quarters are overheld &mdash; many of them for several years past.  The problem is most acute at the Curragh where 60 quarters are overheld.  The number in Dublin is about 30 while in Southern Command the figure is 17.  There are four quarters overheld in Western Command.</P>
    <P>Overholding is an inevitable consequence of the system under which the occupants of the quarters are expected to surrender possession within a matter of weeks of the termination of service. Through the co-operation of the local authorities much has been done over the years to alleviate the problem by the provision of local authority housing for over-holders. The overholding problem is still a substantial one, but one which I consider must be looked at in the whole context of whether the present system of providing houses specifically for soldiers should continue.  I would welcome the views of the House on the matter.</P>
    <P>The Equitation School had an extremely successful year in 1982.  Army <Col N="2011" /> riders and horses competed in 18 international shows and won 12 first places and nine second places, 13 third places and 13 fourth places.  Total prize money came to approximately £36,000.  At this stage I would like to mention the achievement of Captain Mullins in finishing fourth in the World Showjumping Championships in Dublin in June 1982.  This was a highly commendable performance in a competition involving the best riders in the world.  Also, Army riders competed at a considerable number of provincial horse shows and gymkhanas, achieving a total of 154 places with winnings in excess of £12,000.</P>
    <P>One of the constituent elements in the make up of the Defence Estimate for 1983 is the provision of £1,365,000 in Subhead G for civil defence.  Central to the organisation of the civil defence service is the ideal of voluntary service and in practice we rely heavily on the volunteer component of the organisation. Not only are the volunteers in civil defence on call when the occasion arises but they also give freely of their own time in training to acquire and maintain skills in fire fighting, rescue techniques, casualty treatment, welfare and, most importantly, the ability to measure and monitor radio activity from nuclear sources.  Civic-minded people such as these are deserving of the highest praise and the State and the community stand indebted to them.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the provision will be used on grant-aiding training, equipment maintenance and administration expenditure by local authorities but there will also be sufficient to finance this year's outgoings in the Department's programme to replace their entire Civil Defence stock of radiation monitoring equipment by the end of the first quarter of 1984.  The contract under which this supply has been secured was placed with an Irish firm last December, and, I am glad to say, provides for the manufacture of the equipment in Ireland.  I am also glad to say that it is hoped to begin the introduction of improvements in the style of the Civil Defence uniform in the last quarter of 1983.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2012" /> In spite of a less substantial allocation than I would wish, I hope to accelerate progress in this important area of our national defence.  At a very low cost much has been achieved but undoubtedly there is scope still to strengthen the organisation and promote recognition of the fact that an efficient Civil Defence is vital in wartime and extremely valuable in peacetime.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude on Civil Defence I wish also to express my appreciation of the Irish Red Cross Society, the Order of Malta and the St. John's Ambulance Brigade, whose ready co-operation with Civil Defence is very welcome.</P>
    <P>The sail training vessel <i>Asgard II</i> completed her full programme of cruises planned for 1982, covering a total distance of over 9,000 miles of which about 4,000 were entirely under sail.  Almost 500 people, including about 250 boys and over 100 girls, participated in the cruises and there were about 200 other young people who applied to go on cruises but unfortunately could not be accommodated.</P>
    <P>The highlight of the 1982 season was the international race of sail training vessels in which <i>Asgard II</i> participated in August.  She first sailed from Cork to Brest and from there through the Bay of Biscay to Lisbon where the international &ldquo;fleet&rdquo; of sail training vessels assembled, including several large square riggers from North and South America.  After a few days at Lisbon the entire fleet took part in a cruise-in-company to Vigo in Northern Spain.  This provided an opportunity for the young trainees to spend some days on vessels from other countries, while young people from Poland, Germany, Holland and Britain sailed on <i>Asgard II.</i>  The Cutty Sark Tall Ships Race from Vigo to Southampton started on 14 August 1982.  <i>Asgard</i> participated and did well in finishing second in the smaller square rigger class.</P>
    <P>A full programme of cruises on <i>Asgard II</i> is planned for 1983.  Once again some of the cruises will include visits to ports abroad.  Passages will be made through the Kiel Canal in Germany &mdash; when the vessel visits the Baltic &mdash; and through the Caledonian Canal in Scotland in the <Col N="2013" /> course of the return journey.  <i>Asgard II</i> will also take part in an international tall ships race from Weymouth to St. Malo in August.</P>
    <P>And now I turn to the Army Pensions Estimate for the year ending 31 December 1983, which is for a net sum of £34,502,000.  This includes a total of £729,000 to cover increases in pensions and allowances from 1 July 1983 in accordance with the principle of maintaining parity in public service pensions.</P>
    <P>The net out-turn for 1982, which includes a sum of £1,184,000 charged to the Vote for remuneration, was £30,764,500.  The 1983 provision of £34,502,000 is, therefore, an increase of £3,737,500, 12 per cent, compared with the 1982 out-turn.  The more significant increases in terms of overall cost occur in subhead C &mdash; allowances and gratuities to dependants; subhead E1 &mdash; Defence Forces Pensions Schemes; subhead K &mdash; Concessions for Veterans of the War of Independence, including free travel, free electricity allowance and free telephone rental, and subhead L which contains provision for funeral grants.</P>
    <P>There is also a significant increase in the provision in subhead I &mdash; Post Office Services.  Ordinarily, the expenditure under this subhead is the cost of postage of the pensions warrants, but on this occasion the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have raised a charge in respect of an additional service which it has rendered for some years past &mdash; that of cashing warrants for the Department's pensioners.</P>
    <P>A token sum of £10 is provided in subhead J for special compensation payable by way of lump sum to or in respect of members of the Defence Forces killed or wounded while serving with the United Nations or who died or were disabled by disease contracted during that service.  It is customary to make provision for a token sum only as it is not possible to estimate the demand on the subhead. Amounts paid, however, are recoverable from the United Nations.</P>
    <P>As regards military service pensions, subhead D, and special allowances, subhead G, the numbers involved continue to decrease as death is taking its toll of <Col N="2014" /> those who served in the War of Independence. The number of military service pensioners on pay is now fewer than 2,000, representing a reduction of about 250 in the past year.  There are now about 4,000 special allowance holders on pay and here, too, there has been a decline &mdash; about 500 in the past year. There is, however, a substantial increase in the number of widows, mainly of veterans, for whom provision is made under subhead C, so that the total number of pensioners and allowance holders remains static at just over 20,000.</P>
    <P>I have been Minister for Defence for seven months or so and in that time have gained considerable knowledge of, and insight into, the Defence Forces and their affairs.  As a result I am in a position to appreciate in a particular way the many fine qualities of the Defence Forces and, in particular, their loyalty and patriotism not merely as abstract concepts but as ideals put into practice as manifested by a willingness to behave in a disciplined way, to discharge their obligations not, as in common nowadays, to the minimum standard necessary but always with the objective of doing the best possible job. It has been a pleasure for me to visit units of the Defence Forces, for I find Army installations to be oases of order and discipline and tidiness in this agitated and untidy world.</P>
    <P>Theoretically, the primary role of the Defence Forces is to defend the territory of the State against external aggression, but in practice its role consists of coming to the aid of the civil power in the apparently never ending fight against subversion and terrorism.  The general military training which the Defence Forces undergo qualifies them to discharge both their roles.</P>
    <P>It is the policy of the Government not to be allied militarily to any particular alliance, and in pursuing this policy they are following the expedient of successive Governments for a long number of years. I use the word &ldquo;expedient&rdquo; deliberately because it is quite clear from my survey of our stance in this regard, that though some commentators would see our neutrality as a matter of high principle, the majority of people and the historical evidence <Col N="2015" /> would suggest that it is a matter of expediency.</P>
    <P>It suits us to be neutral militarily.  Our territory is not desired or required as a base by the Western alliance and we are in the happy position that, being ideologically and geographically allied to the Western Block, we can confidently rely on it to protect our territory should any state or combination of states hostile to the Western world threaten it.  Our economic, political and cultural interests lie very definitely with the Western world. This is entirely consistent with our historical stance and it is apposite to recall that during the emergency our neutrality was biased in favour of the Allies. Indeed, we are fortunate that we can have the privilege of being militarily neutral with the special status that that can give us, for example, in the United Nations and in the eyes of the Third World countries, while at the same time we can have our economic alliances as a member of the European Economic Community.</P>
    <P>At the same time, for the twin reasons of vindicating our sovereignity and of being prepared, alone if necessary, to defend our independence, there is a need for us to maintain our Defence Forces in the most effective manner possible both as regards training and equipment and to ensure that the conditions of service and the morale of the members are kept high. In this regard I am happy to know that there is an ever increasing emphasis on the need for good personnel policy within the Defence Forces, and I am satisfied that attention to this aspect will ensure that full regard will be paid to the individual members as individuals, to their personal and professional needs, and that they in turn will find their careers in the Defence Forces to be satisfying and rewarding.</P>
    <P>The Defence Forces do not have, and more importantly do not want, any form of organised representation, and in this situation it is particularly important that the Minister for Defence of the day would remain sensitive to the needs of the Defence Forces and when possible respond as fully and as effectively as possible <Col N="2016" /> to those needs.  By my contacts, formal and informal, with members of the Defence Forces in all ranks I hope to keep myself informed of those needs and to be able to deliver the appropriate response.  While on the opposite benches, on a similar debate some time ago, I indicated some matters that were of concern. I mention those matters to reassure personnel that they have not been forgotten.</P>
    <P>I am sure I speak for everyone in the House when I say that the country can be proud and grateful for its Army, Naval Service and Air Corps.  I commend these Estimates to the favourable consideration of the House.  I look forward to the debate which will ensue and I will be happy to supply any further information that may be requested in the course of it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Clare) Mr. Barrett (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> First of all I should like to take this opportunity to wish the Minister a successful career in the Department of Defence.  I omitted to do so the other evening, the first occasion when we were in the House together since his appointment.</P>
      <P>Before commenting on the existing structure of the Defence Forces I should like to make a suggestion to him with regard to the activities of the Department and the Army.  In the present time of severe financial constraint it is very easy for a Department such as Defence to concentrate on the maintenance of the <i>status quo</i> while fighting desperately, perhaps, for a share of the kitty, so that the main level of activities in regard to national security matters would be maintained. Such a situation is not helpful to the morale of the officers, and it offers no opportunity to encourage the vitality and enterprise which should be in the Army.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to examine the possibility of extending the role and the activities of the forces into areas other than those conventionally delegated to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The crisis of confidence and the resulting despair among the young people throughout the country at the lack of job opportunities has been a source of worry for all of us in this House who are concerned <Col N="2017" /> for the preservation of the traditional standards and values with which we grew up and accepted as our Irish way of life.  It is said that the breakdown in law and order, the spread of vandalism, car thefts, drug abuse and the development over recent years of envy and intolerance and the general state of bloody-mindedness that are parts of the unacceptable face of Irish society, derive in part from a sense of frustration which is engendered by a sense of despair about the economic future.</P>
    <P>Army training, which establishes a sense of discipline and order in the individual, has helped many young men to develop a sense of personal confidence and, in many cases, has given them the opportunity to learn useful skills and trades which provided thousands of men on leaving the Army with the necessary level of technical confidence to enable them to make a significant contribution to the economic development of this country and has been the foundation for the creation of a stable family life for the men concerned.</P>
    <P>Short-term training courses at present provided by AnCO give some opportunity of work experience.  On balance, the amount of money being spent on such short-term courses is not really producing the results necessary at present.  The youth employment levy and the contributions from the European Regional and Social Funds are generating a very high level of revenue for the State.  I think it is now time to review the way these moneys are being spent.  The expansion of the vocational education system and the institutes of technology have created opportunities for suitable training for youth to equip them to offer the skills necessary in the world which has made unbelievable progress in the technological sense.</P>
    <P>Some of the hardware and equipment used by the Irish Army is of a very sophisticated nature.  It covers a wide range of electronics, sophisticated high technology engineering, microchip technology and complex communications equipment. All these are relevant to everyday activities in a modern industrial economy.  Would it not be worthwhile to <Col N="2018" /> offer the Army expanded recruitment opportunities specifically directed towards training in the skills I have outlined?</P>
    <P>I would welcome the Minister's interest in setting up a study which would examine the feasibility and the cost of establishing a special corps which could absorb at least some hundreds of young people each year.  Such a study could examine in detail the feasibility of establishing a multi-purpose Army technical corps.  Not all the recruits need be accommodated in Army establishments, which is the case in other countries.  Most advanced industrial countries utilise their forces' equipment needs as a basis for civil industrial developments.  The use of satellites for international phone and telex communications as well as television relays is one example of effective transfer of technology to significant and worthwhile civil industries.</P>
    <P>We already have a good example of civil application for a technology which was evolved because of a defence need. I refer of course to the involvement of Messrs.  Adtec Teoranta, County Meath, a company in which the State has a substantial shareholding.  The high level technology that evolved through the manufacture of armoured personnel carriers is now being utilised, providing nearly 100 jobs in the manufacture of a range of sophisticated safety and fire-fighting vehicles for use at our airports. The range of vehicles are recognised as being probably the most advanced in the technical sense available anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will continue to equip the Army with personnel carriers manufactured in Ireland and that he will agree with my suggestions.  I recognise that many factors might have to be taken into account.  There are modern industries which are not and cannot be staffed by personnel trained through the historical craft channels.  Here, in my opinion, is an opportunity to offer worthwhile careers in a disciplined orderly structure which could provide a flexible corps trained to understand and maintain a wide range of sophisticated technical equipment, a task in which they could <Col N="2019" /> play their part in all sorts of emergency situations which require wide-ranging technical abilities.</P>
    <P>During this time of Government financial retrenchment we should ensure that we get maximum value from a national point of view for any expenditure in the State sector.  I would argue that the money spent establishing such a corps would be well worthwhile and would be even more worthwhile from a long-term point of view than many of the schemes of an extremely short-term nature where there is simply no lasting benefit to anyone other than those employed to administer these short-term schemes.</P>
    <P>It would be feasible to recruit more people into existing batallions.  Works which could be regarded as semi-military could be undertaken by Army personnel. For different reasons these works are not being carried out at present but if they were, they could relieve our unemployment situation.  This happened in other countries.  Perhaps the Minister would consider it because the Army personnel numbers are way below establishment level and there is plenty of accommodation for more recruitment.  I realise recruitment had to be restricted because of the financial situation over the last year or so.  I would like the Minister to look at these suggestions and see if they have merit.  A study could be carried out on my first suggestion because I contend it would not be very costly to put it into operation.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the improvements which have been carried out in the physical structures within the Army and many improvements have been made. We still have some barracks which are really and truly outdated.  Sarsfield Barracks is in the middle of Limerick city. This is a very old barracks.  Efforts were made in the past to make it more comfortable and to create a better environment but, from my observation, they were not a success.  The 12th Battalion need to be provided with a new barracks. I know there are financial restraints, but I do not think it would cost very much to solve this problem.  On the borders of Limerick and Clare we have Knockalisheen <Col N="2020" /> Camp constituting approximately 200 acres.  This site is owned officially by the Minister for Defence and the Defence Forces.  It would be an ideal site for a new barracks.</P>
    <P>The cost of building the barracks would be the major consideration.  If the existing site of Sarsfield Barracks were disposed of, because of its location this would put a sizeable hole in the cost of a new barracks.  It would be interesting to get an estimate of the two sites.  I thought of this in my short term in the Department of Defence but, unfortunately, I was not here long enough to take it any further.</P>
    <P>I could mention other barracks.  Spike Island was mentioned.  Everybody would be glad if this could be proceeded with in the not too distant future.  When the Minister is replying he might let me know about the situation in Cavan barracks.  It was at a fairly advanced stage when I left the Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the Equitation School.  The recruitment of six cadets into this school is most welcome.  I congratulate the Minister on this.  In the past many people who joined the Equitation school had no experience of horses and many people who had never sat on a horse before became excellent international riders.  I could name quite a number of them, including the present OC of the Equitation School, who reached great heights.</P>
    <P>Others who had experience of horses before joining the Army were outstanding as international riders.  I will just mention Colonel Dan Corry and my fellow countyman, Mick Tubridy, who is no longer with us.  It is right to recruit people with experience of horses, who grew up with horses and rode them at shows and gymkhanas, to see how successful they will be.  I am delighted this is happening. We are all delighted with the successful year our Army personnel on the jumping team had jumping internationally.  Like the Minister, I should like to congratulate Captain Mullins on finishing fourth in the World Championships.</P>
    <P>Has anything transpired as a result of the discussions between the FCA and the Revenue Commissioners about taxing <Col N="2021" /> their gratuities retrospectively?  This was a very sore point with these people who are volunteers, as we all know.  The annual training period is being cut to one week.  I am sure the Minister will agree that one week's training is not of great consequence, particularly for recruits who had no training in the past.  They go to camp on Saturday.  As I understand it the weapons are not delivered or issued to them until Monday and have to be handed in on Thursday.  This is a very short period for weapon training, which is all important from a soldier's point of view.  The camp breaks up on Friday.  A week's training is not of great benefit. Two weeks' training would achieve much more.  That is one of the major drawbacks in cutting the two weeks' training to one. It takes 14 days training at one of these camps for a volunteer with no star to acquire one star.  This is another drawback.</P>
    <P>There is no recruitment at the moment and this is a pity.  Many young men relish soldiering for a period and really enjoy FCA life, and look forward to joining the FCA.  There are also people who drop out so there is certain amount of wastage in the personnel of the different companies.  The Minister might ask the military people instead of cutting the two weeks' training to one week to consider cutting the field days which average about two a month during the summer in the good weather.</P>
    <P>I come now to the question of FCA officers being permitted to wear Sam Brownes like their fellow officers in the Permanent Defence Forces.  Officially they have never been allowed to do so. There would be no cost involved to the Department, I understand.  The officers in the FCA are quite willing to purchase the Sam Brownes themselves but they require official permission to wear them.</P>
    <P>Our involvement in fishery protection has expanded rapidly in recent years because of the EEC fisheries agreement. Because of their responsibility for the agreement, there is no reason why the EEC should not contribute towards the cost of fishery protection.  I understand their contribution to the fishery protection <Col N="2022" /> vessels but the everyday cost is a serious matter.</P>
    <P>The people in the Civil Defence are great people.  They are volunteers, like the members of the FCA.  For some time there has been a bone of contention.  I think Civil Defence is the responsibility of the Minister of State.  I hope something can be done about the uniforms.  Any soldier or any volunteer likes to have a uniform he can be proud of.  It would be a great boost to Civil Defence if something could be done fairly quickly about providing these uniforms.</P>
    <P>The recruitment of 330 personnel is very welcome.  As the Minister said, they will be concentrated in the Curragh Command and the Eastern Command where I presume the greatest need is.  I wonder if he would let us know the situation with regard to more personnel for the Air Command and the Naval Service.  In regard to the Naval Service there is more equipment and a further ship coming on-stream and it is not sufficient just to be able to man these.  There should be people available to step into the breach because of the type of service it is.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister that the Department of Defence should not have to be in the business of providing housing. Army personnel are just as entitled to be considered for local authority houses as any other person or family in the community.  Quite a lot has been done with regard to replacing existing married quarters but there are still some which badly need to be replaced.  The local authorities should play a greater role than they have done with regard to housing Army personnel and their families.  If some of them had played a greater role it would have helped to solve the overholding problem which has gone on for some years.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would let us know the position with regard to people who, having completed their three years service, which is the minimum, opt to stay on.  Is the percentage increasing or decreasing?  I would ask him to consider the suggestion I have made on the technological side and also the expansion of the existing units many of which are <Col N="2023" /> below strength.  Additional personnel should be recruited into these units and they should be given duties apart from the duties of peace time soldiering.  Work can be found quite readily throughout the country such as road building.  I am not talking about dual carriageways but there are islands off our coasts badly in need of roads and it would be a well worthwhile training exercise for Army personnel to take on such tasks.  There are small bridges and other works which in an emergency situation would become part of their duties.  The training involved in carrying out the works at a not very great cost to the Exchequer would be well worthwhile and the extra recruitment would help to alleviate the unemployment situation.  I know that people would much prefer to be serving in a disciplined force rather than queueing for the dole week after week.  I have no doubt that many of the young people who would be recruited would become better and more responsible citizens because the present economic conditions create great frustration among our youth today.</P>

      <P>I was not so aware.  I will be very brief.  I was pleased to hear our spokesman on Defence mention the much-needed military barracks in Cavan. I, too, look forward to the Minister's comment on it.  I understand that an arrangement has been made to exchange a site at Pollamore for a site at Drumellis, that the legal documentation is with the solicitors and that there should be no hold up in finalising the legal arrangements and getting the building under way.  Anybody who has visited the military barracks in Cavan will have seen the need for this.  It is a very old barracks, probably the worst in the country according to people who have more expertise in this matter than I have.  The men who are there deserve all our gratitude for putting up with such poor conditions over such a long period.  They have been trying in <Col N="2024" /> their own dignified and unique way to get new accommodation, not elaborate accommodation but a good sound structure for their operations in Cavan.  Most of the soldiers who serve in Cavan come from the south of Ireland.  They are certainly a very welcome addition to the population in that town.  I am glad to say that the vast majority of them come single but are not single for very long.  They marry local girls and integrate in the community. Their total absorption is an indication of the welcome they receive in the area and the good example they set as soldiers.  Cavan is virtually a Border post and many of the operations mentioned by the Minister have to be carried out by the soldiers there.  This they do with great expertise, unobtrusively but efficiently.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned the aspect of using the Army for civilian duties at times of national need.  When they were called on on one occasion when we were in Government their efficiency and the expedition with which they carried out their duties was a revelation to all, a great credit to them and the compliments that were paid to them then were well deserved.</P>
      <P>With regard to UN service, would the Minister care to comment on whether the UN owes this country any money for the operation?  At one time we were very much in their debt.</P>
      <P>I am glad that recruitment has been resumed.  I hope there will be more soldiers recruited than the 330 mentioned by the Minister.  The Minister said that An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil is not being strengthened any further.  Its strength is over 20,000.  During the increased activity in my area the services of the FCA were called on and they were not found wanting.  Perhaps we could concentrate a good deal more on the Slua Muirí.  A strength of 425 is small for a country which, in the words of Behan's song, is surrounded by water, and for a country that has some ambitions to be regarded henceforth, if not historically, as a seagoing nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike Deputy Barrett I did not have any military experience, but at one time I had doubts about the wisdom of sending our soldiers abroad when they were disarmed <Col N="2025" /> and shot in the head when serving in the Middle East.  However, the whole <i>modus operandi</i> has now changed and Lieutenant-General William Callaghan has a reputation of being a very positive and able military leader.  The circumstances which obtained when our soldiers were killed no longer exist.</P>
    <P>Many journalists who did tours in the Middle East reported that certain citizens there went out of their way to be insulting and offensive to our soldiers.  Because of that I understand what the Minister means when he spoke about indignity in his speech.  I hope that Senor Perez de Cuellar will, if necessary, &ldquo;ante up&rdquo; if the United Nations owe us money and his visit here should encourage him to do so. The whole purpose of the exercise in the Middle East is to maintain a fragile peace in a very dangerous area and we all agree that our soldiers have developed expertise over the years for handling very difficult situations.  Because they use peaceful methods to solve disputes one would not like to see them being cockshots for anybody.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that our personnel are getting opportunities of training in foreign military establishments.  Britain, Holland and France were mentioned.  I am sure there is a choice for using those countries but there are other countries with problems similar to ours which might also be chosen and which would be of benefit to our people.  Without giving an exhaustive list, Sweden and Switzerland come to mind.  I do not know if the Swiss would accept anybody, but they have a unique system of defending themselves and it would be worth looking at their methods.</P>
    <P>I fully agree with the sentiments expressed by the Minister and our spokesman with regard to providing expertise for our soldiers through AnCO and other organisations.  The enlightened idea of sending our officers to third level institutions, which has obtained for some years now, is highly commendable. Through personal friendships over the years I have had contacts with our Army, especially the Curragh Command officers, and it was always a revelation to see how <i>au fait</i> they were with world affairs, <Col N="2026" /> how interesting and positive they were in their thinking and how dedicated they were to their profession.</P>
    <P>We are all pleased when the Equitation School is maintained and strengthened. Deputy Barrett, in his modesty, did not claim any friendship with a man who belonged to the Equitation School and who acquitted himself with great distinction. I played in an All-Ireland final against him in a different code and we all regretted that man's death.  From my own area, Commandant Ahern was a member of one of the great old successful Army jumping teams.  Every Irishman, even if he does not know a good horse, takes great pride in the achievements of the Army Equitation School.  I hope the Minister will soon have news about the military barracks to be built in my area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanBarrett" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire) Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett, Dún Laoghaire)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Mr. Barrett,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> As Minister of State responsible for civil defence, I should like to join in the comments of the Minister for Defence on that subject.  In wartime it is very easy to convince people of the need for the Civil Defence organisation.  However, we must not forget that the provision of such an organisation on a meaningful level has to be ongoing in peacetime and cannot be conjured up when war is declared.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies are well aware that the Civil Defence organisation is largely comprised of volunteers.  In that regard I should like to pay a tribute to the people who served all over the country.  I have had the pleasure of meeting many of them over the last couple of months at various activities organised by Civil Defence and I appreciate the efforts they put into these activities.  Not only is Civil Defence involved in the vital area of monitoring radiation and the communication of information to the authorities and the general public in the event of nuclear war, their skills also extend to first aid, rescue, fire fighting and welfare for refugees and other distressed persons. These skills are invaluable in all kinds of emergencies.  I am glad to see an increasing practical acknowledgement of the volunteer organisations' potential in the framing of local emergency contingency <Col N="2027" /> plans.  Meanwhile, the Department in conjunction with the local authorities, under whose aegis the volunteers are organised and function, are addressing the question of how to put the volunteer organisations to better use in peacetime so that the community and the volunteers themselves will have a more immediate and obvious return for the training and preparation they have undergone to respond to the needs of a wartime situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence has rightly adverted to the modesty of the provision in the current Estimate to maintain what we have come to regard as an acceptable level of Civil Defence.  The organisation is in need of an increase in their transport facilities and replacement of much of their equipment which is now showing its age.  But for the careful maintenance it receives it would be on its way to the scrapyard.  I should like to have greater means to provide more facilities, but this year we have made some movement by providing and replacing the old stock of radiation survey meters with new stock which are manufactured here.</P>
    <P>The Opposition spokesman also referred to uniforms and I am glad to say that some progress has been made in that area.  The new uniform was on display at the recent national competition awards in Malahide.  I hope that when times get better and more moneys are made available, further facilities and the replacement of equipment will be forthcoming. I would like to put on record my deep appreciation of the support given by the media in the coverage of the various Civil Defence functions throughout the country and in particular to the RTE programme &ldquo;Countrywide&rdquo; which has covered a number of the events throughout the year.  I again thank the many volunteers throughout the country for the support which they have given to Civil Defence and we are endeavouring to continue to increase the numbers and, it is hoped, to provide better equipment when finances are made available.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney) Patrick M. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that we must have a necessarily <Col N="2028" /> truncated debate highlights the need for reform of our procedures so that a matter such as a debate on the Department of Defence and, indeed, other Departments, could get the time and length of contribution which the subject requires. The Defence Forces happily do not have a high profile, but that is not to understate their importance in the fabric of national life.</P>
      <P>I want to thank the Deputies who have contributed to this necessarily short debate and on a personal note to thank Deputy Barrett for his good wishes to me in office.  I look forward to working in co-operation with him and availing of his experience as my predecessor to work for the good of the Defence Forces.  Deputy Barrett in his opening remarks raised an interesting concept, one which has surfaced from time to time, in this time of unemployment and scarce resources whether some extra use could be made of the potential of the Defence Forces as a training place for young people.  He did not go so far as to grasp, or indeed offer to grasp, the nettle of national service or anything like that, although his ideas run somewhat on those lines except, of course, with the very important difference between the concept of national service and what he is mentioning here for discussion &mdash; that his ideas would be based on a volunteer system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What, in effect, I think he is suggesting is that with the quite extensive funds which are available and the multitude of activities being funded by them for various agencies, for youth employment, youth training, work experience &mdash; the whole range of activities &mdash; thought might be given to employing some of those funds via the Defence Forces in the formation of a technical corps where, in addition to receiving training in particular skills, the young people concerned would have the benefit of service in a disciplined body with the advantages that would bring for their personal characters. This is an idea which has attractions, but it also obviously has certain difficulties. An immediate difficulty for the Defence Forces would be the capacity to organise and deal with the numbers needed to make such a scheme significant.  It would <Col N="2029" /> have to be fairly widespread and this, of course, would require the setting up of new organisations and, inevitably, a certain amount of scarce resources would have to be allocated towards the very organisation itself.  Nevertheless, the idea is an interesting and novel one and one which I will certainly arrange to have examined.</P>
    <P>I share the Deputy's concern with the level of national <i>malaise</i> manifesting itself in so many unpleasant ways in our society today and anything that we could do or the Defence Forces could be involved in doing to cure that would be a high national duty.  As I say, I will arrange to have that particular thought examined and I will keep in touch with the Deputy in regard to whether it will be found possible to advance it, or if it is feasible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barrett mentioned the matter of the Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick being a very old barracks and the possibility of relocating it in Knockalisheen. As he knows and very fairly pointed out, it boils down to a question of finance.  At the moment, we have a higher priority in regard to providing a new barracks in Cavan.  For Deputy Wilson's information, he is quite up-to-date on the present position.  The title to the site of the new barracks is now being completed. The cost of the new barracks we estimate will be somewhere in the region of £4 million, which is significant.  One would have to assume that a similar installation in Limerick to replace Sarsfield Barracks would be of that order or probably more, being a battalion headquarters Obviously, there would be significant capital involved in both of these developments. Because of the scarcity of resources, the Limerick barracks unfortunately has to be regarded as being not for immediate attention but as soon as possible.  The Cavan barracks is particularly urgent because the present barracks there, as Deputy Wilson pointed out, is literally just not fit for the accommodation of troops.  As a matter of priority between it and Limerick, it would have to come first.</P>
    <P>On the question of the FCA, I share <Col N="2030" /> Deputy Barrett's regret that the annual training had to be reduced to a week.  I do not necessarily agree with him that a week is useless because the people coming for the week's annual training will be dedicated members who will have had a high record of attendance at weekly parades and at field days.  The weekly training is to put a gloss and final polish on what they would have received during their year's attendances.  I will have his point examined of perhaps fewer field days and if the savings which might be effected by reducing them might enable resources to be released so that we could perhaps next year come to consider restoring the second week.  It will be purely a question of whether there are sufficient savings to be achieved financially and we will also have to have military advice as to whether the extra week would be militarily of better value than forfeiting the field days.  That is something on which I would have to get expert advice.</P>
    <P>On the question of tax, I understand that the gratuities are not subject to tax. The annual payment, of course, is and the wages that the FCA members receive are liable to income tax in the normal way.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Sam Browne, it is an item of dress which is not in as common use as it used to be among officer ranks.  The broad belt is now being worn increasingly frequently.  The Sam Browne, of course, was hardly a suitable item of dress when the FCA officers wore the tunic&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Clare) Mr. Barrett (Clare)">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the blouse type tunic.  Now that these have gone and the men are wearing the longer tunic, as they call it, the Sam Browne would obviously be an appropriate addition.  This is something which I will have looked at.  Smart uniforms are good for morale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not in a position to give the precise statistics of those who leave at the termination of their three years' engagement. We will know more precisely at the end of this year, because three years ago there was a heavy incidence of recruiting and quite a large number of men are <Col N="2031" /> coming to the end of their three year engagement this year.  However, the level of wastage is not any greater and, in fact, is somewhat less than normal.  That is possibly because of the unemployment situation outside.  This leads me to mention how important it is that we keep the wastage replaced so that the figure of 12,800, the approved strength, be maintained. To fall significantly below that means that in some units there has to be a very heavy level of duty incurred by men and constant incidence of heavy duties will drive men out of the Defence Forces.  It is important that we maintain our recruits at the approved level.</P>
    <P>I am particularly pleased to hear both Deputies Barrett and Wilson extend good wishes to the Equitation School. From time to time, particularly in times of recession and scarce resources, some Members are inclined to say that this is a luxury that we cannot afford.  Those who know the entire horse industry will realise the important part that the Equitation School plays in that industry.  If it were to be terminated there would be a great void.  I was very pleased to hear the welcome and complimentary views that were expressed.  Again, I was pleased to hear Deputy Wilson welcome the presence of military personnel in Cavan.  It is heartening to know that soldiers are welcome in any community.  This is as it should be as they are a credit to our community and should be welcomed at all levels in which they serve.</P>
    <P>The United Nations owe us some money.  The sum at the moment stands at £10 million odd pounds but payments are taking place on an ongoing basis.  By the end of the year that sum will be down but it will be replaced possibly by other liabilities incurred.  We do regard the situation as being unsatisfactory and our budget is geared to take account of the method of scaled rate of payments from the UN.  I thank Deputies for their contributions and I assure them that the good wishes they extended to the Defence Forces are appreciated.  I thank Deputy <Col N="2032" /> Barrett for his personal good wishes and I look forward to working in co-operation with him.</P>

Ag an am céanna tig liom a rá nár thug sé aon sásamh domsa a fhógairt go raibh an ciste a bhíodh ar fáil do bhóithre laghdaithe agus go gcaithfí díriú go príomha ar bhóithre a raibh deontais ceadaithe ina leith anuraidh ach nach raibh an obair orthu críochnaithe.

Tar éis dom soláthar airgid i bhfad níos mó ná mar a fuair siad riamh roimhe sin a chur ar fáil anuraidh ar mhaithe leis na comharchumainn is cúis díomá dom nár éirigh le roinnt acu eagar sásúil a chur ar a gcuid gníomhaíochtaí.  Is iad féin a bhíonn i mbun oibre ar an láthair agus is orthu atá an cúram féachaint chuige go mbeidh <Col N="2035" /> eagar ceart ar na gnóthaí a bhíonn idir lámha acu: ní féidir leo an fhreagracht sin a chur ar an Stát ná ar aon dream eile. Caithfidh siad a aithint chomh maith go bhfuil teorainn leis an gcúnamh is féidir leis an Stát a thabhairt dóibh.</P>
    <P>Is é mo thuairim, áfach, gur fiú iarracht eile a dhéanamh chun comhairle a leasa a chur ar chomharchumainn a bhfuil fadhbanna móra acu agus gur trí choiste oifigiúil, mar a bhí ag feidhmiú cúpla bliain ó shin, is fearr is féidir é sin a dhéanamh.  Dá réir sin beidh coiste leis an ionadaíocht chéanna á thabhairt le chéile agam gan mhoill.</P>
    <P>Is é an ceann is tábhachtaí agus is costasaí&mdash;£900,000 measta i mbliana&mdash;de na scéimeanna cultúrtha agus sóisialacha a bhíonn á reachtáil ag mo Roinnse ná Scéim na bhFoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge faoina n-íoctar deontais díreach le mná tí cáilithe sa Ghaeltacht a mbíonn foghlaimeoirí aitheanta ar iostas acu.  Bhí ar mo chumas anuraidh an deontas sin a mhéadú go dtí £2.25 in aghaidh an lae do gach dalta ach, le cúrsaí airgeadais mar atá, bhí orm cloí leis an socrú a bhí déanta sular ceapadh mé, is é sin gan aon mhéadú a thabhairt i mbliana.  Ar ndóigh, níl sa deontas ach cuid den teacht isteach a bhíonn ag dul do na mná tí i leith na bhfoghlaimeoirí: bíonn an chuid eile le fáil ó lucht na gcoláistí Gaeilge a ghearrann táillí cuí ar na tuismitheoirí.  Is mian liomsa go mbeadh luach saothair maith ag na mná tí a chuireann cóiríocht shásúil ar fáil do na daltaí agus go bhféachfadh lucht na gcoláistí chuige sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an dá nuachtán sheachtainiúla, <i>Inniu</i> agus <i>Amárach</i>, ní miste a rá nach bhfuil éileamh mór ar cheachtar díobh agus nach bhfuil ar mo chumas, leis an nganntanas airgeadais, an cúnamh atá á lorg acu araon a sholáthar dóibh. Tá coiste beag bunaithe agam chun staid an dá nuachtán a scrúdú agus moltaí praiticiúla a chur ar fáil dom a luaithe is féidir maidir leis an tslí is éifeachtaí chun nuachtán fiúntach amháin, a ghlacfadh ionad an dá nuachtán sin agus a thuillfeadh ioncam maith, a chur á fhoilsiú le deontas réasúnach.  Tá dóchas agam go mbeidh lucht <i>Inniu</i> agus <i>Amárach</i> páirteach in aon nuachtán nua a bhunófar.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2036" /> Chomh maith le Bord na Gaeilge bíonn deontais le fáil ag eagrais dheonacha Ghaeilge as Chiste na Gaeilge&mdash;Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge, Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge, Gael-Linn, Conradh na Gaeilge, an tOireachtas, Cumann na bhFiann, An Comhlachas Náisiúnta Drámaíochta, Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe, Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair agus an Gael-Acadamh.  Tig leis na heagrais dheonacha cúnamh nach beag a thabhairt i gcur chun cinn na Gaeilge.  Beidh tuilleadh le rá agam ar ball faoi Bhord na Gaeilge agus faoin bplean a foilsíodh le déanaí don teanga.</P>
    <P>Is cúis sásaimh dom a rá gur méadú a tháinig anuraidh ar an bhfostaíocht lánaimsire faoi scáth Údarás na Gaeltachta; sna tionscail ar chabhraigh Gaeltarra Éireann agus an tÚdarás leo tharla méadú 133 go 4,144 i rith na bliana 1982. Ní beag an dul chun cinn é sin mar tá obair an-deacair le déanamh ag an Údarás chun deiseanna fostaíochta a chur ar fáil&mdash;go háirithe ag féachaint don chúlú domhanda eachamaíochta.</P>
    <P>Tig liom a lua freisin go bhfuiltear ag súil le roinnt mhaith post eile i dtograí a bhí ceadaithe gan a bheith faoi lánseol i ndeireadh na bliana seo caite agus i dtograí a ceadaíodh ó thús na bliana seo. Chomh maith leis sin tuigim go bhfuil tograí á bplé faoi láthair le sprioc fostaíochta de thart ar 450 post.  Anuas air sin tá roinnt deontas ceadaithe ag an Údarás ó thús na bliana chun a chumasú do chomhlachtaí atá i mbun gnó cheana féin obair thaighde agus fhorbartha agus staidéir fhéidearthachta a dhéanamh agus, dá dtiocfadh gnóthaí trádála dá mbarr, d'fhéadfadh fostaíocht a bheith i gceist do 200 duine breise.</P>
    <P>Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeadh an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú le barr éifeachtachta ar mhaith leis an nGaeltacht agus is é sin an aidhm atá againn go léir.  Tig liomsa a dhearbhú go ndéanfaidh mé gach uile rud a bheidh ar mo chumas le féachaint chuige go mbeidh an tÚdarás ag feidhmiú chomh héifeachtach agus is féidir.  Bíonn cruinnithe agam go rialta le comhaltaí agus lucht bainistíochta an Údaráis chun cúrsaí a phlé agus fadhbanna a réiteach.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach, beidh <Col N="2037" /> Comhchoiste um Chomhlachtaí Státtionscanta Tráchtála le ceapadh go luath agus beidh deis acu díriú ar an Údarás aon uair is mian leo chun tuarascálacha agus cuntais agus torthaí oibríochta i gcoitinne a scrúdú agus moltaí a dhéanamh más cuí.  Is deimhin liom go mbeidh an comhchoiste ag iarraidh moltaí a chuideoidh leis an Údarás a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Tá Bord na Gaeilge ag feidhmiú anois ón mbliain 1975 i leith &mdash; ar bhonn <i>ad hoc</i> i dtús báire &mdash; agus tá cúram trom leagtha air.  Baineann an cúram sin, ar ndóigh, le mórchuspóir tábhachtach náisiúnta atá chomh fairsing agus chomh hiltaobhach le saol an phobail.</P>
    <P>Faoi mar is eol don Teach ghlac an Rialtas leis an bplean gníomhaíochta ceithre bliain don Ghaeilge a d'ullmhaigh an bord agus bhí de phribhléid agamsa é a chur i láthair an phobail cúpla mí ó shin.  Is fada atáimid ag feitheamh le córas faoina bhféadfaí an teanga a chur chun cinn ar bhonn náisiúnta pleanáilte.  Tá ceithre mhórréimse i gceist sa phlean &mdash; an Ghaeltacht, an Pobal, an Stát, agus réimse an Oideachais.  B'fhéidir nár miste a rá nach plean cuimsitheach atá i gceist ag an bpointe seo ach plean oibre teoranta ceithre bliana a bhfuil cuid mhaith de na spriocanna ann aontaithe leis na daoine a bheidh á gcur i bhfeidhm.  Aon áit nach raibh deis ann na spriocanna a aontú beidh an obair sin ar siúl go leanúnach le daoine agus le heagrais éagsúla i dtreo go mbeidh barr feabhais agus foirfeachta á chur ar an bplean.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom gur glacadh go maith leis an bplean tríd is tríd agus go mbeidh fonn ar an bpobal comhoibriú lena chur i bhfeidhm.  Is é sin an chuid is tábhachtaí den obair, dáiríre: is beag is fiú plean, dá fheabhas é, mura bhféadfar na spriocanna ann a bhaint amach.  Is gá gach uile dhream sa tír a chur ag obair as lámha a chéile agus beidh páirt thábhachtach san obair sin ag Teachtaí Dála ní amháin in úsáid na Gaeilge sa Teach seo ach sa tacaíocht is féidir leo a thabhairt ina gcuid oibre agus ina saol príobháideach ar fud na tíre.  Beifear ag brath ar Theachtaí <Col N="2038" /> dea-shampla agus comhoibriú mar sin a thabhairt go fial.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom aird a dhíriú ar an ráiteas gairid ón Rialtas a foilsíodh i dteannta leis an bplean: sílim nach miste cúpla abairt a léamh as:</P>
    <P>Glacann an Rialtas leis gur gá, i dtreo go mairfidh an teanga, féachaint chuige go mbeidh an Ghaeilge á húsáid mar ghnáthmheán cumarsáide ag go leor daoine lena chinntiú go mbeidh sí slán feasta.  Dearbhaíonn siad mar sin go bhfuil de chúram orthu timpeallacht a chruthú a thacóidh dáiríre leosan a roghnaíonn an Ghaeilge mar phríomhtheanga nó mar theanga bhunúsach ina saol laethúil.</P>
    <P>Is ábhar sásaimh domsa go bhfuil aitheantas tugtha ag an Rialtas don chúram atá orthu i leith na teanga agus tá dóchas agam go mbeidh an plean mar thús uruna leis an áit is dual di a bhaint amach don Ghaeilge i saol na hÉireann.</P>
    <P>Is mór an chúis áthais dom féin, mar fhear Gaeltachta, go bhfuil sé de phribhléid agam leas na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta a bheith mar chúram orm faoin Rialtas seo agus tig liom a ghealladh go ndéanfaidh mé mo dhícheall ar mhaithe leo araon.  Mar chabhair chuige sin iarraim ar an Teach glacadh leis an Meastachán seo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom ar dtús tréaslú leis an Aire i ngeall ar gur toghadh é mar Aire na Gaeltachta.  Sílim gurb é seo an chéad uair go raibh deis agam an moladh seo a dhéanamh sa Teach.  Tá súil le Dia agam go n-éireoidh go geal leis mar Aire agus go bhfeichfidh mé cúrsaí na nGaeltachtaí uile ag dul chun cinn fhad is a bheidh sé i gceann na Roinne sin.</P>
      <P>Ach ní shin an méid atá le rá agam faoin Mheastachán seo.  Sílim go dtig liom a rá go fíreannach nach bhfuil tús maith déanta ag an Rialtas, ar dtús, an chaoi a rinne siad fo-Roinn den Ghaeltacht.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Toghadh an tAire ach tugadh cúraimí eile dó, cúraimí i dtaobh Iascaigh agus Foraoiseachta, agus sílim gur céim chun deiridh é sin maidir leis an Ghaeltacht agus maidir le cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.  Cé gur féidir a rá i leith na n-aireachtaí, an Ghaeltacht, iascaireacht <Col N="2039" /> agus a leithéid, go bhfuil dlúth-cheangal eatarthu, ach san am chéanna, nuair a ceapadh Aire don Ghaeltacht don chéad uair, tugadh aitheantas don Ghaeltacht agus seans don Ghaeltacht teacht chun tosaigh.  Ach anois tá céim chun deiridh tugtha mar deineadh faillí air: tá cúraimí breise ar an Aire anois, agus faoi Roinn amháin de na cúraimí atá ar an Aire, Iascaigh, tá na deacrachtaí comh mór go bhfuil sé deacair do Aire ar bith teacht i dtír orthu.  Dá bhrí sin, tá a fhios agam go n-aontóidh muintir na Gaeltachta liom nach mbeidh deis ag an Aire tada a dhéanamh don Ghaeltacht.  Ba cheart go mbeadh an Ghaeltacht amháin mar chúram aige.</P>
    <P>Is é trua é nuair a bhí gearradh le déanamh gurb é an Ghaeltacht a chaill. Tá a fhios againn, má theastaíonn uainn an Ghaeltacht a choinneál slán, má theastaíonn uainn go leanfaidh sí ar aghaidh sa chaoi go mbeimid in ann an Ghaeilge a chosaint agus a chaomhnú, go gcaithfimid saol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú.  Níl bealach ar bith le sin a dhéanamh ach trí neart airgid a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta le cúrsaí na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn.</P>
    <P>Nuair a cuireadh Ghaeltarra Éireann ar bun i 1965 tháinig feabhas mór i gcursaí eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta.  Bhí cúram faoi leith ag Gaeltarra faoi obair a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.  Tuigean chuile dhuine na deacrachtaí atá ag tionsclóirí a thagann isteach i nGaeltacht ar bith, is cuma cén áit in a bhfuil siad, i dTír Chonaill, i Maigheo, i nGaillimh, Ciarraí, áiteacha atá i bhfad ó na calafoirt, bailtí móra, tá deacrachtaí faoi leith acu maidir le tionscail a chur ar siúl agus a choinneáil gníomhach iontu.  Is maith liom a fheiceáil ó na figiúirí atá curtha os ár gcomhair ag an Aire, cé go bhfuil deacrachtaí ar fud na tíre maidir le tionscail, nach é sin an chaoi a bhfuil sé faoi chúram an Údaráis i láthair na huaire. Beidh tuilleadh le rá agam faoin Údarás amach anseo.</P>
    <P>Nuair atáimid ag plé cúrsaí Gaeltachta, caithfimid cuimhniú ar an tír ar fad. Go minic nuair a bhíonn daoine ag caint faoin Ghaeltacht, cuimhníonn siad ar an Ghaeltacht mar áit ar leith.  Dár ndóigh tá sí ar leith ar bhealach amháin, ach <Col N="2040" /> cuimhníonn siad uirthi mar áit nach mbaineann leis an saol, gur daoine iad sa Ghaeltacht atá sáite amach sa bhFarraige Mhór agus gur sórt dream iad a dteastaíonn cúnamh faoi leith uathu i gcónaí agus gur ceart dearcadh orthu mar sórt leanaí.</P>
    <P>Má theastaíonn uainn an Ghaeilge a choinneáil slán caithfimid Gaeltacht a bheith againn.  Amach ó na Gaeltachtaí tig linn dearmad a dhéanamh ar shlánú na Gaeilge, ar Ghaeilge ar fad agus ar chúrsaí na Gaeilge.  Dá bhrí sin nuair atáimid ag caint ar na Gaeltachtaí, táimid ag caint ar na daoine a choinníonn an Ghaeilge beo sa tír seo, a choinníonn an seod is luachmhaire atá againn slán; agus dá bhrí sin ba cheart don phobal uile a thuiscint céard tá ar siúl againn nuair atáimid ag iarraidh an Ghaeltacht a chosaint agus a shlanú.  Táimid dá dhéanadh ar mhaithe linn féin, ar mhaithe na tír uile, agus ní ceart a bheith ag dearchadh ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta, mar a bhíonn cuid de na seoiníní a bhíonn ag caiteamh maslaí le mhuintir na Gaeltachta go minic.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí ann i láthair na huaire maidir leis na Gaeltachtaí agus maidir leis an Ghaeilge a choinneáil slán.  An deacracht is mó atá ann ná go bhfuil brú damanta ar phobal na Gaeltachta ó chuile áird, go mór mhór ó na meáin chumarsáide, Nuair a cuireadh RTE2 ar bun, thuigeamar go mbeidh áit faoi leith le fáil ag an Ghaeilge, ag cultúr na Gaeilge sna cláracha ó RTE2.  Ach foraoir, ní mar sin a tharlá sé, agus tá sé ag éirí níos measa in aghaidh an lae.  Níl aitheantas ar bith dá thabhairt ag RTE don Ghaeilge ná don chultúr sa chaoi a rabhamar ag súil leis ins na cláracha a chuir siad amach nó atá á gcur amach acu i RTE2.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios againn uile an buntáiste a tháinig chuig na Gaeltachtaí nuair a cuireadh Radio na Gaeltachta ar bun, an chaoi ar thug sé na Gaeltachtaí le chéile, an chaoi a thug sé deis do muintir na tíre uile éisteacht le Gaeilge ghlan, bhinn mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí go léir.  Thar rud ar bith eile a rinneadh do na Gaeltachtaí, thug Radio na Gaeltachta deis dóibh iad féin a chur os comhair an phobail agus tuiscint níos fearr a fháil orthu féin.  Tá brí anois ó mhuintir na Gaeltachta <Col N="2041" /> féin gur ceart stáisiún theilefíse Gaeltachta a chur ar bun.  Agus ó tharlamid a bheidh ag caint ar bhreis stáisiún áitiúil radio a chur ar bun, sílim gur cheart don Aire agus don Rialtas cuimhniú ar phlean le stáisiún teilefíse a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go speisialta, nuair nach bhfuil an t-aitheantas riachtanach á fháil ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Labhair an tAire faoi thithíocht, faoi bhóithre áise agus mar sin de.  Aontaím leis go bhfuil cuid mhaith déanta i dtaobh na seirbhísí ar fad le cuidiú muintir na Gaeltachta.  Tá moladh muintir na Gaeltachta tuillte ag an Roinn agus ag oifigigh na Roinne i ngeall ar an chaoi a rinne siad comhoibriú le muintir na Gaeltachta agus leis na scéimeanna uile atá dá reachtáil acu ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Ní shílim go bhfuil aon rannóg Stáit eile go bhfuil an ceangal céanna acu leis an phobal agus atá ag Roinn na Gaeltachta le muintir na Gaeltachta agus leis an heagrais atá ag obair ar mhaithe leis an nGaeltacht.  Tuigeann an Roinn meon na ndaoine.  Tuigeann siad cén cuidiú atá ag teastáil ó na daoine, agus ón am a chuir mise eolas ar Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ag oifigigh na Roinne don chéad uair tá mé in ann a rá go raibh tuiscint acu i gcónaí ar shaol na Gaeltachta, agus má bhí scéim fhiúntach ar bith ag dream ar bith bhí an Roinn sásta éisteacht leis na moltaí a bhí acu agus cuidiú a thabhairt dóibh má bhí deis acu an cuidiú sin a thabhairt dóibh.  Molaim iad dá bharr agus tá súil le Dia agam go leanfaidh siad ar aghaidh mar sin.</P>
    <P>Is é an trua é nach bhfuil níos mó airgid ar fáil le haghaidh bhóithre áise.  Go deimhin tá go lcor airgid caite ar bhóithre áise leis na blianta anuas agus duine ar bith a théann thart ar fud na Gaeltachta tá sé le feiceáil go soiléir an bhuntáiste a tháinig chun na Gaeltachta i ngeall ar an airgead a chaitheadh ar na bóithre sin.  Is é an trua nach bhfuil sé sin le rá faoi bhóithre móra na Gaeltachta, mar a déarfá, agus is é an trua arís b'fhéidir nach raibh deis ag Roinn na Gaeltachta go dtí seo ar aon nós, airgead a chaitheamh ar bhóithre den chineál sin.  Ní raibh an cúram sin orthu agus is dócha chomh maith go bhféadfaí a rá nach <Col N="2042" /> bhfuair siad go leor airgid sna Meastacháin riamh le freastal ar bhóithre den chineál sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na comharchumainn, tá chuid acu atá ag déanamh go maith agus tá cuid acu nach ndéanfaidh go maith choíche.  Ón éolas atá agam féin ar na chomharchumainn, sílim dá dtógfadh siad faoin rud atá siad in ann a dhéanamh agus iarracht a dhéanamh ar dtús agus dul chun chinn éigin a dhéanamh go n-éireodh níos fearr leo.  Ach tá chomharchumainn ann agus dá mbeadh siad ag brath ar na tuairimí atá acu féin faoi céard ba cheart dóibh a dhéanamh, theastódh Meastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta uilig uatha gcuid lena pleananna a chur i gcrích.  Ní bhíonn morán céille le cuid de na moltaí a bhíonn ag go leo acu, ach iad sin atá ag déanamh a gcuid oibre i gceart agus a thugas faoi scéimeanna go ciallmhar éiríonn leo.</P>
    <P>Is trua é nach féidir leis an Aire ardú a thabhairt do na mná tí.  Tá obair an-mhaith a déanamh anseo i leith na Gaeilge agus is mór an chabhair do na mná tí agus don Ghaeltacht agus do shaol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta an t-airgead a fhaigheann siad i gcóir na bpáistí seo a dhéanann freastal ar na cúrsaí Gaeilge sna Gaeltachtaí.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor ráite faoi na nuachtáin Ghaeilge ach is é an tuairim atá agam féin nach féidir an dá pháipéar atá ann faoi láthair a chomhnascadh.  Sílim go m'bhfearr iad a fhagáil mar atá siad agus airgead breise a thabhairt dóibh más féidir leis an dá cheann a chur ar aghaidh. Tá an pháipéar Gaeltachta <i>Amárach</i> ag freastal ar phobal na Gaeltachta.  Sílim go bhféadfaí níos mó a dhéanamh leis an pháipéar a scaipeadh thart ar fud na Gaeltacht &mdash; rud nár deineadh go dtí seo; tá díol ar an pháipéar i gConamara ach sílim go bhfuil sé fíor a rá nach bhfuil ach díol beag air i gcuid de na Gaeltachtaí eile.  Tá an nuachtáin <i>Inniu</i> ann le blianta fada.  Tá obair mhaith déanta ag an pháipéar agus is é an trua nach bhfuil éileamh níos mó aige, ach tá a fhios againn uilig cen chaoi a tharla sé nach bhfuil an díol céanna ar <i>Inniu</i> agus a bhí sna blianta atá caite.  Nuair a rinneadh neamh-shuim den Ghaeilge san Ardteist agus sna scrúduithe poiblí ní raibh an <Col N="2043" /> díolachán chomh mór agus ní raibh éileamh air.  Sin an fath nach bhfuil ag éirí chomh mhaith leis agus a bhí.</P>
    <P>Is léir ó na figiúirí atá curtha os ár gcomhair ag an Aire go bhfuil obair mhaith á déanamh ag an Údarás le fostaíocht a chur ar fáil sna Gaeltachtaí cé go dtuigimid uilig na deacrachtaí atá ann i láthair na huaire.  Tá cáineadh á dhéanamh ar an Údarás ó cuireadh ar bun é ach ní shílim go bhfuair sé deis riamh ón phobal nó cuid den phobal ar chor ar bith.  Tá sé cáinte ag cuid mhaith daoine; bhí sé cáinte sa Teach seo.  Níor tháinig mise riamh leis an gcáineadh sin agus níor phromhaíodh riamh cuid de na ráitais a cuireadh amach maidir leis an Údarás. Ba cheart don Teach seo chuile thacaíocht a thabhairt don Údarás san obair mhaith atá á déanamh acu ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.  Is rud úr é daoine a bheith tofa ón Ghaeltacht le feidhmiú agus le hoibriú ar mhaithe leis an Ghaeltacht.  Bhí siad ag iarraidh sin le fada an lá.  Níl siad ansin ach le cúpla bliain agus ba cheart dúinn seans a thabhairt dóibh an obair thábhachtach atá acu le déanamh a chríochnú agus a chur chun cinn.  Nílim á rá go bhfuil mé sásta le chuile rud san Údarás.  Bhí rudaí san am atá caite nach raibh mé ró-shásta leo Sílim go bhfuil b'fhéidir easpa smachta san eagras féin.  Tá mé cinnte go bhfuil rudaí ann go bhféadfaí a fheabhsú ach san iomlán tá obair mhaith á dhéanamh acu.  Tá daoine tofa ag muintir na Gaeltachta iad féin le cuidiú leis na Gaeltachtaí agus ba cheart chuile sheans a thabhairt dóibh an job a dhéanamh mar a theastaíonn uathu.</P>
    <P>Tá locht amháin agam ar an Údarás i láthair na huaire maidir le tionscal atá i dtrioblóid agus tá ceann i mo Dháilcheantar féin.  Sílim nach bhfuil an tÚdarás ag tabhairt an tacaíocht ba cheart dóibh le cuidiú le tionscal atá lonnaithe agus atá ag obair sna Ghaeltachtaí a thabhairt slán.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil eolas breise ag an Aire ar an tionscal atá i gceist agam.  Tá a fhios aige an tionscal a bhfuil mé ag caint faoi agus b'fhéidir nuair a bheidh sé ag tabhairt freagra go mbeidh sé in ann eolas a thabhairt dúinn faoi céard atá in ann don tionscal seo.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine eile atá ag iarraidh teacht <Col N="2044" /> isteach anseo agus ní theastaíonn uaim níos mo moille a choinneáil ar chursaí go dtí go mbeidh deis labhartha ag chuile dhuine go bhfuil suim aige sa Ghaeltacht agus san Ghaeilge anseo.  Ach ba mhaith liom focal amháin a rá faoi Bhord na Gaeilge agus faoin Ghaeilge.</P>
    <P>Sílim go bhfuil plean an-mhaith curtha amach ag Bord na Gaeilge agus go mba cheart dúinn lán-tacaíocht a thabhairt don phlean sin.  Maidir leis an Ghaeilge féin, thosaigh Bord na Gaeilge go luath tar éis iad a bhunú le phlean poiblí a rinne an-mhaith don Ghaeilge agus is é an trua é nach raibh níos mó airgid le fáil acu le leanúint ar aghaidh leis an phlean agus le tacaíocht níos fearr a thabhairt do na smaointe a bhí acu agus leis na scéimeanna a bhí acu maidir leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn a chur os comhair an phobail.  Ní maith ar bith dúinn a bheith ag caint faoin Ghaeilge mura bhfuilimid sásta lán-tacaíocht a thabhairt do na scéimeanna agus na pleananna atá ag an mbord.  Sílim gur féidir linn uilig anseo sa Dáil i bhfad níos mó a dhéanamh le dea-shampla a thabhairt i labhairt na Gaeilge.  Tá áthas orm a rá go bhfuil Teachta úr sa Teach anseo &mdash; An Teachta Prendergast &mdash; a thug cuid againn le chéile agus go bhfuil sé i gceist aige amach anseo tuilleadh cainte a bheith againn faoi céard is féidir linn labhairt na Gaeilge a chur chun tosaigh anseo sa Dáil.  Sílim nach bhfuil bealach ar bith níos fearr le cúrsaí a chur chun cinn ná go dtabharfaimid féin dea-shampla don phobal ar fad maidir le labhairt na Gaeilge.</P>
    <P>Arís tá diomá orm nach bhfuil níos mó airgid le fáil ag an Aire le cuidiú leis an nGaeltacht agus iarraim air ceist na mbóithre áise a fheabhsú le tuilleadh airgid a fháil ón Rialtas am éigin i gcaitheamh na bliana.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire toisc é bheith ceapaithe mar Aire na Gaeltachta agus is é mo ghuí go mbeidh sé ábalta job maith a dhéanamh. Ní bheidh mé ag caint ach ar taobh amháin de scéal na Ghaeltachta agus is é sin Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Aontaím le cuid mhaith a bhí á rá ag an Aire agus ag an iar-Aire, ach ní aontaím leis an iar-Aire, <Col N="2045" /> an Teachta Gallagher, i dtaobh Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Go deimhin, measaim féin go bhfuil a lán nithe mí-cheart le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta.  Ní bheidh mé ag caint anocht ach ar feadh 20 no 25 nóiméad de bharr go bhfuil cainteoirí eile anseo agus is dócha go bhfuil fonn cainte orthusan freisin.  Beidh mé ag caint trí Ghaeilge agus trí Bhéarla.</P>
      <P>Tá na milliúin púnt caillte ag Údarás na Gaeltachta, breis is £100 milliún ar fad.  Is é an cheist atá ag cur isteach ar mhuintir na hÉireann agus ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta ná, cá bhfuil an t-airgead imithe?  Níl an t-airgead ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is fair to say that that £100 million which has been lost by Údarás na Gaeltachta has been squandered by fly-by-nights, chancers and the devil knows what who came into the Gaeltacht.  The question that everybody is asking now is why are Údarás na Gaeltachta under suspicion? Why are the Fraud Squad actively investigating some of those companies? Why did the Director of Public Prosecutions put a number of cases from the Fraud Squad to be examined to see if prosecution will take place?  That is the burning question asked by everybody at the moment who speaks about the Irish language.  It is most unfortunate because the Údarás had a tremendous potential if they had snapped up that potential.  I must say here tonight that I do not accept what the Minister said to me, that so many extra people are working in the Gaeltacht.  I would like to know the PAYE numbers and the PRSI numbers of that mythical figure that he called out and I am quite sure that if all the PAYE and PRSI numbers were counted they would not amount to the figure that we are led to believe.  The days of public relations and gimmicks have outlived their usefulness as far as the Gaeltacht is concerned.  Indeed, it is safe to say that in the last 23 years in Gaeltarra Éireann and Údarás na Gaeltachta the money spent in industrial development has been in investments which have proved unsound.  The strategy of bringing some of those developments to the Gaeltacht must be seriously looked at and examined to see if a proper research was carried <Col N="2046" /> out when the money was granted to them originally.</P>
    <P>If the Gaeltacht is to survive it must be in a practical way.  By all means if you can attract industry there, bring that industry in, but we must look at the response to recent Dáil questions that at the moment there are over 27 empty factories in the Gaeltacht.  Tá 27 gcinn agus deirtear linn go bhfuil daoine áirithe anseo is ansiúd chun teacht isteach iontu. Tá sé cosúil leis an seanfhocal, &ldquo;Mair, a chapaill, agus gheobhair féar&rdquo;, nó seanfhocal eile, &ldquo;ní chothaíonn na briathir nó bráithre&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Some of the money spent in the Gaeltacht was spent as if there was no limit to it, as if it came from a bottomless pit. The result of all of that is that the language has been undermined and the people have suffered, yet Gaeltarra Éireann and Údarás na Gaeltachta have not yet seriously reconsidered their strategy. It is safe to say that by 1980 many of the Gaeltarra and Údarás companies had got into trouble.  It is of no use for any Government, the Fianna Fáil Government or the Fine Gael Government, to prop up lame ducks because some of those ducks are dead already.  I feel very sorry here tonight at the way the money has been tossed into the Gaeltacht, yet the ordinary man, woman and child in the Gaeltacht never saw that money.  As I said at the outset, a few chancers walked away with millions of pounds and hence now we have the Fraud Squad and the DPP actively pursuing some of those people.  I hope that some of these cases will come to the courts and that those who conned the people of the Gaeltacht will face the sentence due to them.  When I was Minister for Tourism and when the present Minister, Deputy O'Toole, was in opposition ní raibh mé sásta leis an tslí ina raibh an tÚdarás ag dul.  Ní raibh mé sásta leis an tslí ina raibh an t-airgead á chaitheamh acu.</P>
    <P>We decided and the Government of the day decided that there should be an inquiry into Údarás na Gaeltachta to see what was going wrong and to improve it if at all possible.  Lo and behold, if we took that action, then the chief executive of Údarás na Gaeltachta, Frank Flynn in <Col N="2047" /><i>Business and Finance</i> of 23 September 1982, was shooting from the hip and the mouth.  Everybody generally got it in the neck from Mr. Frank Flynn: current affairs, <i>Today Tonight,</i> the Irish people and the two Fine Gaelers, Paddy O'Toole and Michael Begley, and one man who slipped out from this paper, the finest man I ever met, Seán O Foghlú.  Mr. Flynn said: &ldquo;There is a conspiracy against Údarás na Gaeltachta.&rdquo;  It is all there in <i>Business and Finance</i> of 23 September 1982.  It is amazing how this individual came into prominence in the role of chief executive of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  The man who was there, Cathal Mac Gabhann, resigned and made off to other fields and the Údarás met to appoint a chief executive officer.  It is very significant that the six Government nominees of the day, nominated by the Government of the day who were a Fianna Fáil Government, voted against Mr. Flynn's appointment but the seven people who were democratically elected by the Údarás following the Údarás elections voted for Mr. Flynn and he was elected by seven votes to six.  His election was called &ldquo;a healthy exercise in democracy&rdquo;. He promised straight away that he would be more responsive to the demands of the economic-socio culture from the local communities.  The first thing that this chief executive officer did when he was appointed was to attack the man who was there before him, Cathal Mac Gabhann.</P>
    <P>Less than a year after that the Coalition Government under the Taoiseach, Deputy FitzGerald, decided to hold an inquiry into the affairs of an tÚdarás but we lost the election and that finished that for the time being.  The new Minister appointed, Deputy Pádraig Flynn from Mayo, within hours of his appointment said there would not be any investigation into Údarás na Gaeltachta.  Deputy Flynn jumped too quickly.  After the fraud squad investigation a big question remains unanswered.  Why has nobody &mdash; that goes for all sides of the House &mdash; consistently monitored in the Dáil the failure of Údarás na Gaeltachta and Gaeltarra Éireann?  I am aware that there were structural handicaps, that we did <Col N="2048" /> not have the roads, the telephones or the infrastructure, but why did we not monitor the industries that were established in the first instance?</P>
    <P>It is no harm to say an chúis a bhí i mo cheann nuair a bhí mé ag caint leis an Aire, An Teachta O'Toole i dtaobh an fhiosrucháin san Údarás.  I was not satisfied about the way the money was going. I was not satisfied that £150,000 of taxpayers' money could be paid for land in Ballymackeera of 10 acres, £15,000 per acre.  We already have an industrial estate run by an tÚdarás.  I was not satisfied that £61,000 could be paid for 20 acres of bogland in Ballyferriter.  It is strange to relate that about two months ago when that 20 acres went for auction the amount bid for 12 months grazing was £160.  That is an indication of the value of that land which was bought for £61,000.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that when we have four empty Údarás houses in Dingle we should have embarked upon another course of expenditure.  We have embarked on an expenditure of £41,000 to develop a site for a regional manager in my own area.  Yet an tÚdarás have vacant houses in the town.  That is not good enough.  The houses that are there are good enough for anybody and we should not have embarked on any expenditure for a new house or pay £41,000 to develop a site.  It is not good enough that in last Friday's <i>Irish Times</i> there was an application for planning permission to carry out an extension to a factory in Miltown.  I cannot understand why the advance factory that has just been completed there was not put up for tender.  I cannot understand how more than £200,000 was spent on that advance factory.  Why were other people not asked to tender for that work?</P>
    <P>I could go on for hours about this matter. It is only right to switch into the record of the House that over the last three years the Exchequer paid out to an tÚdarás and Gaeltarra the following figures: in 1980, £15,770,000; in 1981, £17,200,000 and in 1982, £13,162,000.  Not one penny of the borrowed £71 million has been repaid to the Exchequer.  Worse still, not one penny interest has been paid back to the Exchequer on the money borrowed. <Col N="2049" /> A former chief of Gaeltarra Éireann on a television programme said that the State did not have any hope of getting any of that money back.</P>
    <P>Despite the cumulative losses and the audited accounts of the Comptroller and Auditor General an tÚdarás continues to have a loan of £71 million from the Exchequer to the full liability and by right that should be a State asset.  It is about time that we challenged an tÚdarás to reply to the question, where has the £71 million gone?  The people deserve an answer.  The people of the Gaeltacht certainly have not seen that £71 million.  The time has come for the Minister, Deputy O'Toole, to get a firm of independent financial consultants of international repute to go into an tÚdarás for the purpose of investigating the companies, the balance sheets and the annual reports and ask them if they are satisfied with the way the figures are presented.  Just two weeks ago I tabled a question to the Minister for the Gaeltacht asking him when the 1982 annual report of Údarás na Gaeltachta would be published and if a copy would be circulated to Members. Other semi-State bodies give us copies of their annual report but any Member who is looking for a copy of the Údarás report must go to the Library for it.  The reply I got to my question was that the report will be ready next month.  According to the law of this land the report should have been in this House on 31 March 1983 but although three months have elapsed since that date we are told it will not be ready for another month.  We do not have any guarantee that it will be ready within another month.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister where the report is being held up?  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General refusing to sign that report?  Is it not true that the Comptroller and Auditor General in a reserve comment accompanying the report said that he was not happy that the write-offs were properly accounted for? Is that the reason we are not being presented with the 1982 annual report of Údarás na Gaeltachta, something that could have been debated tonight?</P>
    <P>We all read in the newspapers the other <Col N="2050" /> day that £217,000 had been give to a company in Galway for making hurleys. An explanation is required as to how that money was spent.  The taxpayers are due such an explanation.  If what appeared in the newspapers is correct &mdash; I have no reason to doubt it &mdash; then somebody has a lot to answer for.  I do not know how so much money could go for retraining grants, a fire engine or to buy a factory that had already been grant-aided, was sold and bought from the company concerned for more than £206,000.  I hope the Minister answers those questions in detail.</P>
    <P>The Fraud Squad investigation originally prompted by the Eamon Delaney &mdash; RIP &mdash; letter is still under way and the findings of the investigation into a number of those companies have been referred to the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration.  In May 1982 Mr. Delaney was suspended pending the outcome of the Fraud Squad investigation but Mr. Delaney died tragically of a heart attack after been publicly identified in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> as the person behind the Fraud Squad investigation. The source of this information was, ironically, Frank Flynn himself.</P>
    <P>That month also the RTE current affairs programme transmitted a two-part programme on Údarás and they asked a number of questions.  Furthermore, both the ex-Minister, Deputy Paddy O'Toole, and myself publicly exonerated Mr. Delaney and said he was motivated by concern for the national interest and he was not in any way involved in any type of fraud whatsoever.  In July 1982 the Government set up an Oireachtas committee to investigate the matter.  Deputy Paddy O'Toole informed the Dáil that a document had come into his possession which he handed over to the Fraud Squad.  The Minister called for a judicial inquiry into Údarás.</P>
    <P>In September 1982, as I have already mentioned, the chief executive, Mr. Frank Flynn, of Údarás accused Begley, O'Toole, Seán Ó Foghlú, RTE and the Irish people of a conspiracy.  The Minister here present and I publicly denied that we were involved in a conspiracy.  It is very significant that RTE did not issue <Col N="2051" /> any statement.  In December 1982 there was a change of Government and Deputy Paddy O'Toole was reappointed Minister for the Gaeltacht.  In June 1983 the Oireachtas sub-committee investigation was reactivated on the Order Paper.  It is about time it was set up.</P>
    <P>The chief executive officer of Údarás, despite his behaviour over the last 18 months, is still chief executive officer and he is a law onto himself.  Recent replies to Dáil Questions tabled by me are completely unsatisfactory.  They demonstrate a contempt for the collective intelligence of the Members of this House.  I am told privately, truly or falsely &mdash; the Minister, can refute it in his reply &mdash; that the chief executive officer has apologised to the Minister, Deputy Paddy O'Toole, and that in no way was he as Minister involved in a conspiracy and that his good name has been cleared.  It is sad to relate that one man is dead, Lord have mercy on him, and I am here tonight and my name has not been cleared yet.</P>
    <P>Public representatives have been smeared in a disgraceful fashion and concerned citizens and professional broadcasters of RTE have been subjected to unsubstantiated slander and calumny from a person holding high public office. Now I not only publicly demand from the Minister responsible for the administration of Údaras na Gaeltachta the complete exoneration of the late Eamon Delaney, but I publicly demand that the Minister, who was accused of plotting against Údarás by Mr. Frank Flynn, state catagorically that there was not and there is not any conspiracy against Údarás na Gaeltachta and that people like myself, Mr. Seán Ó Foghlú and the Minister as well as all public representatives, acted in the common good and in the interests of the nation as a whole.  Furthermore, I demand that the Minister immediately request the resignation of Mr. Frank Flynn, a man who has not only failed clearly as chief executive officer of Údarás na Gaeltachta, who has lost the confidence of his staff and the people of the Gaeltacht but a man who has defied the authority of the Oireachtas and <Col N="2052" /> defamed Members of Dáil Eireann and regards himself as accountable to nobody.</P>
    <P>In urging the Minister to exercise his statutory powers in this regard I further demand the reactivation of a wide ranging Oireachtas inquiry into the function and performance of the semi-State body charged with responsibility for the Gaeltacht development since 1957.  When Mr. Frank Flynn was appointed chief executive officer of Údarás na Gaeltachta he was appointed for a two year probation period which will expire on 6 July next. What do they now do?  The next meeting is fixed by Údarás na Gaeltachta for 9 July when Mr. Flynn will be over the probation period.  He will get in the back door and they cannot do anything about it.  I hope the members of Údarás will sit up, waken up to their responsibilities and take the action that I have outlined here tonight.</P>

      <P>Tá trua agam don Aire leis an méid a bhí le n-éisteacht le tamall fada ó ceapadh é mar Aire.  Tá ráiteas fada, an-láidir tughta ag an Teachta Begley anseo anocht, agus tá a fhios agam ó bheith ag caint leis go gcreideann sé go daingean agus go láidir an méid atá ráite aige anseo anocht.  Ar ndóigh, tá an cead sin aige mar Chomhalta den Teach seo agus mar dhuine pearsanta freisin.</P>
      <P>Creidim féin gur súireach an Meastachán atá os ár gcomhair anseo anocht I gconaí tuigimid gurb é an Meastachán do Roinn na Ghaeltachta an ceann is lú a thagann os comhair an Rialtais.  Mar sin, nuair a bhíonn gearradh siar le déanamh, 10 faoin gcéad nó 20 faoin gcéad, ar aon Roinn Stáit eile ní bhíonn ann ach fíor-bheagán i gcomparáid leis na milliúin a fhaigheann siad sna Meastacháin ag tús na bliana, nuair a cuireann tú ciorrú 10 faoin gcéad nó aon chiorrú ar chur ar bith ar Mheastachán Roinn na Gaeltachta is ciorrú mór é mar is Meastachán an-bheag é cheana féin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar sin, ceapaim gur mór an trua é gur ghéill an tAire don Aire Airgeadais.  Tá a fhios agam an brú mór a bhíonn ar aon Aire Gaeltachta agus é ina shuí le baill eile an Rialtais ag scrudú na Meastachán <Col N="2053" /> ach trua mór é, ar aon nós, gur ghéill sé agus gur ghlac se le haon ciorrú ar Mheastachán na bliana seo.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach rud a rá faoin méid a dúirt an tAire i dtaobh na gcomharchumann. Tá an-suim agamsa, agus ar ndóigh ag chuile Theachta anseo atá ag obair sa Ghaeltacht nó atá as an Ghaeltacht, i gcúrsaí na gcomharchumann, mar creidimid ar fad nach bhfuil aon dabht, in aon eagras poiblí Stáit, más é an tÚdarás atá i gceist, nó an tÚdarás Forbartha Tíonscail nó aon eagrais eile atá ag deileáil le tionsclaíocht no cúrsaí forbartha tionscail, go gcaithfidh deacrachtaí a bheith ann ó am go ham.  Mar sin, más féidir eagrais ar nós comharchumainn a mhéadú, más féidir iad a choinneáil gníomhach, iad a chur ar bhun-chloch láidir, ba cheart don Stát é sin a dhéanamh, agus aon chúnamh gur gá a thabhairt dóibh ba cheart é a dhéanamh.  Bhí mise i gcónaí go láidir den tuairim nár thug an Stát nó Rialtas do Roinn na Ghaeltachta, fiú amháin nuair a bhí mo pháirtí féin i gceist, a ndóthain cúnaimh nó cuidithe do na comharchumainn chun iad a chur ar bhun-chloch maith.</P>
    <P>Sin í an chúis gur cuireadh ar bun le mo linn mar Aire na Ghaeltachta coiste chun féachaint isteach i gcúrsaí na gcomharchumann, le moltaí a chur ar aghaidh, tuairisc a fhoilsiú agus a thabhairt don Aire.  Nuair a bhí mise imithe as oifig i 1981 agus an Teachta O'Toole tagtha isteach tháinig an tuarascáil oifigiúil sin os comhair an Aire.  Ní fhaca mise é, ní dóigh liom go bhfaca éinne éile sa Teach seo é nó éinne taobh amuigh de. Níl a fhios agam céard a tharla dó, ach cuireann sé an-iontas orm, díomá orm, go gcreideann an tAire gur gá an coiste idirmheánach céanna, leis an mballraíocht céanna a chur ar bun arís le tuarascáil eile a thabhairt chun cinn.  Níl a fhios agam céard a tharla ó shin i gcúrsaí comharchumainn Gaeltachta gur gá go mbeadh an coiste céanna ag iniúchadh na gcursaí céanna don dara huair.  Bheadh sé i bhfad níos fearr agus i bhfad níos éiteachtaí dá bhfoillseofaí an chéad tuarascáil, dá bpléifí é b'fhéidir le coiste na gcomharchumann féin&mdash;creidim go raibh go leor plé acu leis an Aire le deanaí agus <Col N="2054" /> go nglacfaí le moltaí uathu féin, mas iad moltaí gur fiú caint orthu.</P>
    <P>Rud eile a chuireadh isteach orm go mór agus mé mar Aire&mdash;agus tá mé cinnte go n-aontóidh na hiar-Airí eile liom, agus b'fhéidir an tAire é féin&mdash;ná nach bhfuil aon deighilt sásúil idir an chaoi a bhfaigheann na comharchumainn deontais, idir dheontais ó Údaras na Gaeltachta agus ó Roinn na Gaeltachta. Chreid mé féin i gcónaí go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos fearr dá dtiocfadh na deontais ar fad ó cheann amhain nó an ceann eile, ach nach mbeadh cuid den airgead le teacht ón Údarás agus cuid eile le teacht ón Roinn.  Bhí dúil agam nuair a thiocfadh an tuarascáil ar fáil gurb shin ceann de na moltaí a bheadh ann, nach rachadh na comharchumainn nó coistí na gcomharchumann ach ag dul ag phlé le dream amháin.</P>
    <P>Sin an méid atá le rá agam ó thaobh cúrsaí na gcomharchumann ach go gcreidim nach ceart go gcuirfí an coiste idirmheánach seo ar bun, gur cheart go bhfoilseofaí agus go dtógfaí cinneadh ar na moltaí a bhí sa chéad tuarascáil.  Mar sin ba mhaith liom ceist a chur ar an Aire agus freagra a fháil uaidh, cá bhfuil an chéad tuarascáil nó cé hiad na moltaí a bhí ann.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na mná tí, níl aon dabht ná go bhfuil géarchéim airgeadais ann agus b'fhéidir go gcreideann an tAire agus an Rialtas nach féidir arduithe a thabhairt dóibh ach creidim fhéin i ndáiríre, má bhreathnaíonn tú ar an méid oibre a chuireann siad isteach ní amháin lena dtíthe a mhaisiú agus béilé maithe a chur ar fáil do na scoláirí a bhíonn acu i rith an tsamhraidh, go ndéanann siad an-job ar fad le staid na Gaeilge a chur chun cinn agus gur ceart tuilleadh cúnaimh a thabhairt dóibh agus a chur ar fáil.</P>
    <P>Deireann a lán daoine liomsa, agus tá mé cinnte go ndeireann siad le na polaiteoirí eile atá anseo, nach fiú dáiríre scoláirí a choinneáil níos mó.  B'fhéidir, mar sin, gur gá breathnú ar an scéim le feabhas a chur air ar bhealach éigin, b'fhéidir í a chur ar bhun níos seasta nó níos éifeachtaí an chuid de atá mar dheontas don bhean tí féin.</P>
    <P>An chuid den Mheastachán is mó a <Col N="2055" /> chuir olc ormsa ná a laghad airgid atá ar fáil do bhóithre áise.  Níl aon airgead ar fáil le caoi a chur ar aon bhóthar nua áise ar fud na nGaeltachtaí ar fad i mbliana agus an t-aon bhealach amháin a bhí ag muintir na Gaeltachta go dtí seo le caoi a chur ar bhóithre áise ná cuid den scéim a bhí ann ó Roinn na Gaeltachta nó cuid den scéim feabhsucháin áitiúil a bhíonn ag na comhairlí contae.  Mar sin, níl sé sách maith mar fhreagra ar cheist Dála domsa nó d'éinne eile a rá gur gnó don chomhairle contae é caoi a chur ar na bóithre áise.  Caithfidh Roinn na Gaeltachta airgead sásúil a chur ar fáil le caoi a chur ar na bóithre.  Nuair a bhí mise ann, tá a fhios ag an Aire, chuir mé béim faoi leith go gcaithfí an méid agus a b'fhéidir den airgead a chur ar fáil chun caoi a chur ar na bóithre.  Tá sé tábhachtach gur féidir le daoine a bhfuil móin bainte acu í sin a chur ar an mbóthar, agus ní féidir é sin a dhéanamh i gceantair i gConamara faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Bord na Gaeilge, táimid le tamall fada ag fanacht, ag caint agus ag plé agus ag cúiteamh faoi phlean don Ghaeilge, an chaoi is fearr leis an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn agus mar sin de.  Bhí an-áthas orm gur cuireadh plean an bhoird ar fáil.  Ba mhaith liom tréaslú le cathaoirleach Bhord na Gaeilge mar sílim go ndearna Seán Ó Tuama go leor den obair chun an plean a chur chun cinn. Is cinnte gur chuir sé brú mór ar go leor de na daoine a raibh plé acu le Ranna Stáit agus le húdaráis áitiúla ag an am. Creidim go mbeidh sé féin agus an príomh-fheidhmeannach nua in ann an plean sin a chur i gcrích mar go gcreideann siad féin sa phlean i dtús agus go bhfuil siad sásta í a bhrú ar aghaidh.  Is é an t-aon rud amháin ba mhaith liom a rá leis an Aire ná go bhfuil súil agam go mbeidh an t-airgead atá riachtanach leis an phlean ar fad a thabhairt chun críocha ar fáil ó Roinn na Gaeltachta agus ón Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Easaontaím le mo urlabhraí féin faoi chúrsaí na nuachtán i leith ligean don dá nuachtán dul ar aghaidh.  Bhí sé de thuairim agam nuair a bhí mé im Aire go mba cheart nuachtán amháin maith, breá folláine, seachtainiúil a bheith ann.  Dá <Col N="2056" /> mbeadh nuachtán amháin ann a díolfí ar fud na tíre, taobh amuigh de na Gaeltachtaí comh maith le istigh iontu, go bhfeicimís an fás a thiocfadh air sin agus b'fhéidir go bhfásfadh nuachtán nó dó eile as sin.  Creidim go mbeadh sé i bhfad níos éifeachtaí dá mbeadh ceann amháin folláin ann ar dtús agus, ar ndóigh, go mbeadh an tacaíocht ceart Stáit le fáil ag an nuachtán sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le Radio na Gaeltachta, tá a fhios againn go léir an mhaitheas atá déanta aige do mhuintir na Gaeltachta mar snaidhmeann sé sin na Gaeltachtaí uile le chéile, nach mbíodh aon cheangal acu le chéile, daoine nár thuig canúintí a chéile.  Tá sé i bhfad níos éascaí orainne anois tuiscint a bheith againn nuair a théimid ó thuaidh go Tír Chonaill nó ó dheas go Corcaí nó Ciarraí tuiscint a bheith againn agus léiriú a bheith againn ar chanúintí na nGaeltachtaí sin agus creidim go bhfuil go leor den chreidiúint faoi sin ag dul do Radio na Gaeltachta as an &ldquo;teilifís&rdquo; iontach a chuireann siad ar fáil do na Gaeltachtaí.  Cuirim an locht anois ar mo Rialtas féin chomh maith agus a chuirim ar an Rialtas atá ann faoi láthair nár cuireadh i gcrích uaireanta breise craolta do Radio na Gaeltachta.  Cé go n-aontaím gur maith an rud é agus gur deas a bheith ag caint faoi theilifís Ghaeltachta, creidim gurb é an rud is tábhachtaí a bheith ag caint faoi i láthair na huaire ná níos mó uaireanta craolta a chur ar fáil do Radio na Gaeltachta. Ansin d'fhéadfaimís bheith ag caint faoi theilifís Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Bhí iontas orm nach raibh tada le rá ag an Aire faoi Arramara Teoranta ina oráid.  Creidim go bhfuil athrú dá dhéanamh ar bhaill an bhoird faoi láthair agus ba mhaith liom go labhródh an tAire faoi sin.  An bhfuil aon fáth speisialta nach bhfuil daoine áirithe ag seasamh don bhord, an cathaoirleach ina measc, nó an bhfuil fírinne ann nach bhfuil siad ag seasamh?  Cé hiad na daoine atá an tAire ag ceapadh ar an mbord.  Creidim gur ceann de na Stát-chomhlachtaí ab fhearr a bhí againn sa tír ná Arramara Teoranta, Stát-chomhlacht a bhí ag plé le hachmhainní nádúrtha cosúil le feamainn agus slata mara.  An laghdú a tháinig ar chúrsaí fostaíochta sna monarcha <Col N="2057" /> a bhí acu, cé go raibh sé go dona ag an am, láidrigh sé an comhlacht féin, agus tá súil agam nach bhfuil sé i gceist go ndéanfaí aon chiorrú nó gearradh siar ar an airgead atá ar fáil ag an gcomhlacht nó ar an líon fostaithe atá sa chomhlacht faoi láthair.</P>
    <P>Anois tagaimid go dtí cúrsaí fostaíochta sna Gaeltachtaí.  Ar ndóigh tá a lán cainte déanta, ní hé amháin taobh istigh den Teach seo ach ar fud na nGaeltachtaí ar fad, maidir le cúrsaí fostaíochta, an plean nó an straitéis fostaíochta atá ag Údarás na Gaeltachta faoi láthair.  Nuair a bhíonn cúlú eacnamaíochta domhanda ann cuireann sé isteach ar chúrsaí fostaíochta nó ar mhéadú fostaíochta in aon tír ach go mór mhór i dtír atá ina hoileán.  Mar a dúirt An Teachta Gallagher, cuireann sé isteach i bhfad níos mó ar áiteanna i gceantair Gaeltachta mar atá siad i bhfad ó bhailte, ó chathracha, ó aerfoirt agus mar sin de.  Luíonn sé le réasún mar sin go gcuirfeadh an cúlú domhanda atá ann faoi láthair isteach i bhfad níos mó ar na Gaeltachtaí na mar a chuireann sé ar aon áit eile.</P>
    <P>Mar sin féin, ba mhaith liom a fháil amach céard iad na hiarrachtaí speisialta atá ar bun ag an Údarás nó atá curtha ar bun ag an Údarás anois le deileáil leis an chúlú domhanda sin.  Tá iarrachtaí speisialta dá ndéanamh ag an Údarás Forbartha Tionsclaíochta agus ag SFADCo agus ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire céard atá á dhéanamh ag an Údarás.  Ba mhaith liom freisin a fháil amach céard iad na difríochtaí atá idir an gcéad cnodán deontais atá ar fáil ón Údarás, mar shampla, ag tionsclóir Éireannach agus ag tionsclóir eachtrannach a thagann isteach, agus na deontais atá ar fáil ón Údarás Forbartha Tionsclaíochta nó SFADCo.  Bhíodh difríocht mhór ann ach ní chreidim go bhfuil an difríocht céanna anois ann.  Níl a fhios agam an maith an rud é sin nó an dona an rud é sin.</P>
    <P>Tá deacrachtaí margaíochta i gcónaí ag a lán monarchana ar fud na tíre agus credim nuair a chuirtear deontais ar fáil do mhonarchana go bhfuil sé tábhachtach go gcuirfí breis deontais ar fáil le deimhniú a dhéanamh de go bhfuil cúrsaí margaíochta folláin sna tionscail sin.  Ní chuirimid an oiread béim agus ba cheart <Col N="2058" /> dúinn ar an taobh sin de chúrsaí fostaíochta go dtí seo.</P>
    <P>Maidir le fostaíocht i gConamara féin, tá eastáit i gConamara faoi láthair a bhfuil dífhostaíocht mhór iontu, cuir i gcás, an ceann sa Cheathrú Rua.  Bhí go leor deacrachtaí ann ar feadh na mblianta agus níl a fhios agam cén iarracht speisialta atá á déanamh faoi láthair ag feidhmeannaí an Údaráis lena cinntiú nach neartóidh na trioblóidí sin.  Creidim ó thionsclóirí a raibh teangmháil agam leo le déanaí go bhfuil deacrachtaí móra agus moill mhór á cur ar thograí a thagann chuig an Aire le ceadú an Aire a fháil.  Anois tá a fhios agam nach é an tAire a thug isteach é sin ach gur Aire eile a thug isteach é, Aire Gaeltachta as an pháirtí seo.  Teastaíonn uaim a fháil amach an bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Aire O'Toole leanúint leis sin, go mbeadh ceadú an Aire i gceist i gcónaí nó an bhfuil sé i gceist aige uasleibhéal áithrid a chur ar an líon tograí go bhféadfadh an tÚdarás iad féin a cheadú gan cead an Aire a fháil ar dtús.  Aon rud a chuireann moill ar fhostaíocht a mhéadú i gceantair Ghaeltachta sílim gur ceart deireadh a chur leis chomh fada agus gur féidir leis é sin a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Údarás féin mar adúirt mé ar dtús, bhí go leor rudaí láidre le rá ag an Teachta Begley.  Tá neart le rá agam féin ar an Údarás ní hé amháin sa Teach seo ach ar chláracha agus mar sin de taobh amuigh den Teach.  Nuair a bhí mé mar Aire rinne mé tréan-iarracht deacrachtaí a bhí ag an Údarás ag an am nó a cuireadh ar mo shúile dhom a bhí acu a réiteach.  Níl sé easca rud den sórt sin a dhéanamh nuair nach mbíonn agat ach am gearr, ach faoi láthair táimid ag fanacht leis an dtuarascáil bhliantúil. Creidim féin go láidir agus aontaim leis an Teachta Begley faoi seo, ba cheart go mbeadh an tuarascáil bhliantúil ar fáil ar an 31ú lá de mhí na Márta na bliana seo. Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil sé curtha ar fáil fós do oifigigh na Roinne ag an Údarás féin nó a bhfuil sé fós ag an Údarás nó cá bhfuil sé.  D'fheileadh sé don Aire agus dúinn ar fad dá bhféadaimis eolas a fháil faoi sin.  Creidim go bhfuil sé sin tábhachtach agus ar ndóigh nuair a bhímid ag caint ar Mheastacháin eile <Col N="2059" /> anseo faoi Stát chomhlacht go hiondúil bíonn an tuarascáil bhliantúil ar fáil. Chuir mé ceist ar an Aire tamall ó shin faoi chúrsaí poiblíochta an Údaráis agus faoin rannóg chumarsáide go ginearálta. Mar atá a fhios ag an Aire agus mar atá a fhios ag chuile dhuine anseo tá fadhbanna móra ag an Údarás faoi láthair sa rannóg chumarsáide agus tá na fadhbanna sin ag dul chun cinn.  Tá siad ann le tamall fada anois agus níl a fhios agam céard atá ag tarlú mar gheall air, céard atá an tAire ag déanamh mar gheall orthu, nó céard atá baill den Udarás ag déanamh chun deireadh a chur leis na fadhbanna atá ann.  An bhfuil fadhb leis an NUJ mar gheall ar an bhfadhb san Údarás féin agus má tá, an bhfuil sé i gceist é sin a leigheas? An bhfuil cúis dlí ag feitheamh nó céard atá ag tarlú?  Tá a fhios agam go ndúirt an tAire go raibh sé i gceist aige comharleoir poiblíochta a cheapadh dhá Roinn nó don dá Roinn agus theastaigh uaim a fháil amach an mbeadh Gaeilge ag an gcomhairleoir sin &mdash; creidim anois go mb'fhéidir go bhfuil sé ceapaithe, an bhfuil Gaeilge aige, cé hé féin agus an mbeidh sé ag obair don Údarás nó an mbeidh sé ag obair go príomhdha don Aire féin?</P>
    <P>Maidir le go leor de na rudaí atá ráite ag an Teachta Begley agus ar dúradh anseo sa Teach seo go minic cheana agus taobh amuigh dhe faoi Fly-By-Nights, cuir i gcás, &ldquo;Devil Knows Who&rdquo;, rudaí den tsórt sin ar labhair an Teachta Begley futhu, is rud é a chuireann an-imní ormsa agus tá mé ag ceapadh go gcuireann sé imní ar go leor daoine.  Ag an am nuair a fógraíodh rudaí den tsórt seo, nuair adúradh go raibh airgead curtha amú, níor chreid mé gur cheart go mbeadh fiosrúchán poiblí dlí i gcúrsaí feidhmiúcháin an Údaráis nó in oibreacha an Údaráis ach d'fhógair an Rialtas é; chuaigh siad ar aghaidh leis, socraíodh go gceapfaí an bord seo le fiosrúchán a dhéanamh agus ansin thit an Rialtas agus tá siad ar ais anois arís.  Tuigim nach bhfuil sé i gceist ag an Rialtas dul ar aghaidh leis an bhfiosrúchán poiblí seo; nach bhfuil sé i gceist acu fiú amháin dul ar aghaidh le fiosrúchán ó choiste na Stát <Col N="2060" /> Chomhlachtaí atá againn sa Teach seo ach amháin san ghnáth shlí.  Sílim gur ab shin é aduirt an tAire ina oráid:</P>
    <P>Beidh Comhchoiste an Chomhlachtaí Stáit Tionscail agus Tráchtála le ceapadh go luath agus beidh deis acu díriú ar an Údarás aon uair is mian leo.</P>
    <P>Cuirim béim ar na focail sin &ldquo;aon uair is mian leo&rdquo;.  Tá go leor cainte déanta faoi chúiseanna dlí.  Tá a fhios againn go raibh an Fraud Squad istigh san Údarás. Rinne mé iarracht eolas a fháil ón Aire agus ón Aire Dlí agus Cirt faoi cén áit a raibh Tuarascáil an Fraud Squad anois, an raibh sé leis an DPP, mar a deireann an Teachta Begley, nó an raibh sé fós leis an Fraud Squad.  Tá scamall mór os cionn an Údaráis agus creidim nach n-éireoidh linn an scamall sin a ardú go dtí go mbeidh fiosrúchán ceart againn isteach in oibreacha an Údaráis.  Tá mise ag iarraidh ar an Aire anois agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Údarás an fiosrúchán sin a chur ar bun láithreach.  Iarraim ar an gComhchoiste seo mar ghné antábhachtach ar fad agus an-phráinneach an fiosrúchán seo a chur ar bun.  Creidim go bhfáilteoidh feidhmeannaigh an Údaráis agus go bhfáilteoidh muintir na Gaeltachta le fiosrúchán den chineál sin. Mar adeirim, ní laghdóidh an scamall atá os cionn an Údaráis agus ní imeoidh sé uainn go dtí go mbeidh an fiosrúchán ann agus go mbeidh a fhios againn an bhfuil rudaí mí-cheart leis an Údarás nó nach bhfuil.</P>
    <P>Tá go leor cainte déanta ag an Teachta Begley faoin &ldquo;bottomless pit&rdquo; mar a thug sé air nuair a adúirt sé go raibh airgead á chur amú agus airgead á chur isteach i dtionscail agus gan súil ag éinne go n-éireodh leo aon phinghin airgid brabach a dhéanamh i gcaitheamh na dtréimhse.  Níl aon chall domsa a chur in iúl don Teachta Begley ná don Teach seo ná do mo Dháilcheantar féin ach an oiread céard a tharla domsa go polaitiúil nuair a shocraigh mé go dtógfainn cinneadh an bhoird agus go nglacfainn leis, nuair a shocraigh siad ar thionscail áithrid in mo Dháilcheantar féin &mdash; níl sé ach cupla míle siar an bóthar uaim &mdash; a dhúnadh síos.  Nuair a ghlac mise le cinneadh <Col N="2061" /> an bhoird agus nuair a shocraigh mé é a dhúnadh síos mar gheall gur chreid mise ag an am agus gur chreid Bord an Údaráis ag an am go raibh dóthain airgid caite ar an dtionscal agus nach raibh aon bhealach ar chor ar bith go bhféadfadh sé brabach a dhéanamh le linn a shaoil agus gur cheart deireadh a chur leis.  Tá a fhios againn ar fad céard a tharlaíonn do dhuine nuair thóghann sé cinneadh mar sin.  Creidim go bhfuil sé i bhfad níos macánta do Aire Rialtais ar bith cinneadh den tsórt sin a thógáil ná, mar adúirt an Teachta Begley más fíor, a bheith a leanúint ag cur airgid i monarchain nach bhfuil aon tseans dá laghad go n-éireoidh leo.</P>
    <P>Creidim dáiríre gur thosaigh an tÚdarás an t-am sin le ar chinní den tsórt sin a thógáil nach leanfádh siad ar aghaidh le deontais a chur ar fáil do mhonarchana nach raibh aon cheist nó aon tsúil ag éinne go n-éireodh leo.  Dá bhfaigheadh siad an tacaíocht an t-am sin ón gComhrialtas deireannach nó dá bhfaigheadh siad anois é le cinní den tsórt sin a thógáil agus leanúint leo, go n-éireodh leis an Údarás an sprioc a cuireadh rompu nuair a cuireadh ar bun iad a bhaint amach.</P>
    <P>Tá daoine eile le caint agus tá a fhios agam go bhfuil go leor acu a mbeidh rudaí suimiúla le rá acu.  Caithfimid glacadh, is dócha, leis an Meastachán atá anseo os ár gcomhair tráthnóna ach, mar adeirim, is suarach an lear airgid atá ar fáil nuair a chuireann tú i gcomparáid é leis na milliúin atá ar fáil do na Rannaí Stáit eile. Ghéill an tAire ró-bhog don Aire Airgeadais nuair a tháinig an brú air agus cuireann sé sin iontas orm ó tharla gur as Maigh Eo an tAire, mar chreid mé i gcónaí go raibh an-teacht aniar in éinne a tháinig as taobh thiar den tSionainn. Bhí an-áthas orm go raibh ar a laghad Teachta amháin ar bhall den Rialtas a tháinig as taobh thiar den tSionainn, agus ba mhaith liom mo chomhghairdeas a dhéananh leis an Aire, ó tharla gurb é seo an chéad uair a rabhamar ag caint anseo go h-oifigiúil ó toghadh é mar Aire Gaeltachta, a bheith ar ais mar Aire Gaeltachta. Ceapaim gur maith an rud é an duine céanna a bheith ar ais mar Aire Gaeltachta ar feadh píosa, mar creidim go dtuigeann sé na fadhbanna atá ann <Col N="2062" /> agus nuair a thagann duine éigin nua isteach go mbíonn air b'fhéidir sé mhí a chaitheamh ag foghlaim faoi na bhfadhbanna agus ag iarraidh aithne a chur ar dhaoine a bhfuil sé ag obair leo.  Ba mhaith liom chuile ádh a ghuí air agus, ar ndóigh, agus muid ag caint air sin, tá mé cinnte go nguímid ar fad chuile ádh ar Rúnaí Roinn na Gaeltachta, fear a raibh timpist fíor dhona aige le deireanach, fear a bhfuil a shaol caite aige féin ag obair thar cheann muintir na Gaeltachta agus a bhfuil ard-mheas ag muintir na Gaeltachta air.</P>
    <P>Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh an tAire le cuid de na pointí.  Níl mé ag iarraidh bheith ag teacht salach ar éinne agus mé ag caint orthu.  Mar adúirt mé, níor aontaigh mé le mo urlabhraí féin i gcuid de na rudaí a bhí sé á rá ach, ar ndóigh, sin duine Gaeltachta amháin agus a tuairimí féin aice agus fear Gaeltachta agus a thuairimí féin aige.  Sin mar is fearr, agus b'fhéidir go mbíonn plé agus díospóireacht níos fearr ar Mheastacháin Roinn na Gaeltachta dáiríre sa Teach seo ná mar a bhíonn ar go leor de na Meastacháin eile, mar bímid go léir ag iarraidh an rud is fearr a dhéanamh do mhuintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DinnyMcGinley" hpid="Mr. McGinley Mr. McGinley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liomsa comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire as é a thoghadh mar Aire arís agus tá súil agam gur fada a leanfaidh sé i mbun an dualgais sin agus, chomh maith leis sin, comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Gallagher as a thoghadh mar urlabhraí ar son an Fhreasúra.  Sílim go bhfuil an bheirt acu as iarthar na hÉireann agus tá an bheirt acu as ceantair Gaeltachta.  Tá tuiscint acu ar na fadhbanna agus na deacrachtaí a bhaineas leis an nGaeltacht agus sílim gur maith an rud é sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nuair a bhí an Teachta Gallagher ag caint dúirt sé gur mheas sé gur céim síos a bhí ann go mbeadh níos mó ná freagarthacht Roinn amháin ar Aire na Gaeltachta. Ba mhaith liomsa a rá nach í seo an chéad uair a tharla sé sin go raibh níos mó ná freagarthacht amháin ar Aire na Gaeltachta, agus an dara rud ba mhaith liom a rá, go bhfuil freagarthacht cúpla <Col N="2063" /> Roinn ar Aire na Gaeltachta ach cúpla Roinn iad a bhaineann go dlúth leis an nGaeltacht, iascaireacht agus foraoiseacht; tá dlúth-bhaint acu leis an nGaeltacht agus le ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus sílim gur maith an rud é go mbeadh an duine amháin i gceannas go speisialta ar Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Roinn na hIascaireachta, mar sílim gur sin tionscail go bhféadfar níos mó forbartha a dhéanamh air i gceantair Ghaeltachta.  Le blianta anuas sílim go bhfuil athrú mór agus athrú bunúsach tar éis teacht ar shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus ar shaol na Gaeltachta féin; is é sin tá forbairt mór eacnamaíochta tar éis tarlú agus anois is beag daoine atá ag fagáil na Gaeltachta agus ag dul thar lear mar a bhí leis na glúnta romhainn.  Tá an chuid is mó acu ag fanacht sa bhaile anois ina dtimpeallacht féin agus is breá an rud go bhfuil fostaíocht agus gléasra le cur ar fáil dóibh ina gceantar féin.  Sílim gur ceann de na rudaí is suimiúla a dúirt an tAire nuair a bhí sé ag caint, ná in ainneoin na géarchéime eacnamaíochta atá sa tír faoi láthair agus an uimhir mhór daoine sa tír atá dífhostaithe &mdash; agus táimid buíoch de Dhia agus den Aire &mdash; nár dearnadh laghdú ar bith ar an líon daoine atá fostaithe sna tionscail sa Ghaeltacht, na tionscail sin a raibh baint ag Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ag Gaeltarra Éireann a tháinig rompu.  Lena mbunú tháinig ardú ar an líon daoine atá ansin.  Agus mise ag teacht as Dáilcheantar Iar-dheisceart Thír Chonaill, ceann de na rudaí a thug faoiseamh áirithe dom i rith na bliana seo ná go bhfuil tionscail an Dáilcheantair féin, tionscail a raibh monarchana eile ins an tír seo i mBaile Átha Cliath, agus cé gur dhún an mhonarcha i mBaile Átha Cliath síos, go bhfuil an ceann i dTír Chonaill oscailte go fóill agus é ag dul ar aghaidh go maith.  Tá súil agam gur fada a mhairfidh an scéal mar sin.</P>
    <P>Sílim gur ceann de na rudaí gur cóir do Údarás na Gaeltachta a dhéanamh as seo amach ná béim ar leith a chur ar achmhainní nádúrtha na Gaeltachta.  Mar adúirt an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn ansin, ceann de na hachmhainní nádúrtha atá againn sa Ghaeltacht ná iascaireacht agus sílim gur ceann de na rudaí a <Col N="2064" /> d'fhéadfaí dhéanamh sna ceantair Ghaeltachta in iarthar na tíre ná monarcana le haghaidh próiséail a chur ar fáil a chuirfeadh fostaíocht agus obair ar fáil don líon daoine atá ansin gan obair i láthair na h-uaire.</P>
    <P>Ceann de na rudaí eile go bhféadfaí béim a chur air sna ceantair Ghaeltachta ná turasóireacht.  Tá cuid de na radharcanna is deise agus is áilne sa tír ansin agus sílim gur chóir níos mo poiblíochta a thabhairt do na ceantair Ghaeltachta leis na daoine a tharraingt siar ó thuaidh agus ó dheas lena gcuid saoire a chaitheamh ansin.  Fá choinne an fhorbairt sin a thabhairt chun críche tá gá le cúpla rud. Ba chóir go ndéanfaí forbairt ar chúrsaí cumarsáide; is é sin bóithre ag dul isteach sna ceantair chomh maith le cúrsaí teil-eafóin agus mar sin de.</P>
    <P>Cheana féin, ceann de na scéimeanna a mhealeann a lán daoine chun na Gaeltachta ná scéim na gcoláistí Gaeilge agus tá áthas orm a fheiceáil go bhfuil beagnach milliún punt curtha ar fáil i mbliana don scéim sin.  Tá mé féin buartha, caithfidh mé a rá, nach bhfuiltear ábalta ardú ar bith a thabhairt do na mná tí thar an méid a bhí acu anuraidh ach sílim go dtuigimid cén fáth.  Tá géarchéim eacnamaíochta ann agus is dóigh gur sin an príomh-fáth atá leis ach ba mhaith liom moladh a dhéanamh do úinéirí na gcoláistí Gaeilge.  Ní hé amháin go bhfaigheann siad deontas ná go bhfuil ioncaim acu ón Stát Chiste ach chomh maith leis sin faigheann siad táillí ó na tuismitheoirí a chuireann na daltaí go dtí na Gaeltachtaí.  Níl a fhios agam ar tháinig ardú ar na dtaillí sin i mbliana nó nár tháinig ach b'fhéidir go bhféadfadh únéirí na gcoláistí rud éigin a thabhairt do na mná tí.  Tá siad ar fud na Gaeltachta agus tá luach na n-earraí ag dul suas gach bliain agus mura dtugtar rud éigin dóibh ní bheidh oiread proféid acu i mbliana agus a bhí acu blianta eile.  Ceann de na rudaí, agus tá an t-am teoranta tuigim tráthnóna&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be as brief as I can and I will just take a few more minutes.</P>
      <P>Ceann de na rudaí ba mhaith liom a rá ná tagairt a dhéanamh anseo do rud a chuireann isteach orm féin mar ionadaí Gaeltachta agus is é sin na deontais títhe a thugtar do na daoine a thógann títhe sa Ghaeltacht agus sílim gur ceist anchonspóideach í, gur ceist í a chaithfidh an tAire agus a Roinn amharc isteach ann agus rud éigin a dhéanamh mar gheall air.  Faoi láthair tugtar dhá mhíle punt do dhuine a thógann teach sa Ghaeltacht agus sílim go bhfuil sé sin an-íseal.  Go minic má tá tú i do chónaí i bpáirt eile den tír ní hé amháin go bhfaighidh tú míle punt ón Roinn Comhshaoil ach go minic faightear trí mhíle punt eile mar fhor-dheontas ar iasacht.  Is beag duine sa Ghaeltacht a fhaigheann an for-dheontas sin agus ní bhíonn le fáil acu ach dhá mhíle punt.</P>

    <P>Mar sin is é an chéad rud ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire agus ar an Rialtas b'fhéidir, nuair a bheas cursaí eacnamaíochta níos fearr ná rud eigin a dhéanamh le ardú a chur ar an deontas sin, agus an dara rud &mdash; agus b'fhéidir an rud is tábhachtaí &mdash; ná mar a thugtar an deontas sin amach.  Mar adúirt mé, tá daoine ag teacht ar ais go dtí an Ghaeltacht anois agus b'fhéidir go mbíonn Gaeilge ag duine amháin sa teaghlach agus nach mbíonn an Ghaeilge ar a thoil ag gach duine sa teaghlach ní thugtar an deontas, agus tá mé cinnte go bhfuil sí ar eolas ag na Teachtaí Gaeltachta eile na deacrachtaí móra a dheineann an scéim seo.  Tá a fhios agam féin daoine go leor nar fhág an Ghaeltacht ariamh agus nar éirigh leo an deontas sin a fháil.  Tá sé ar eolas agam go bhfuil cigirí ag Roinn na Gaeltachta sna ceantair agus go dtéann siad thart go dtí na tithe agus go minic go mbíonn siad ag braith ar chumas páistí óga nach bhfuil fiú amháin ar an scoil go fóill, go mbíonn sé ag braith ar a gcumas sin iad féin a chur in iúl i nGaeilge an bhfaigheann siad an deontas nó nach <Col N="2066" /> bhfaigheann.  Agus muid i 1983 is náireach an scéal é sin, go mbeadh sé ag braith ar pháiste óg nach bhfuil a trí nó ceithre bliana d'aois an bhfuil an deontas le fáil ag na tuismitheoirí nó nach bhfuil.</P>
    <P>Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé sin a tarlú i dTir Chonaill; is dócha go bhfuil sé ag tarlú i gceantair Ghaeltachta eile agus sílim go bhfuil sé ag déanamh dochar mór do cheist na Gaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht. Tá a fhios agam cad adéarfaidh an Roinn &mdash; go bhfuil siad tar éis scéim úr a chur ar bun, scéim spreagtha na Gaeilge ach is beag maitheas a dhéaneann sé sin do mhuintir na Gaeltachta mar bíonn an t-airgead ag teastáil uathu nuair a bhíonn siad ag tógáil an tí. Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire &mdash; a thagann ó cheantar Gaeltachta é féin agus a bhfuil tuiscint aige ar an Ghaeilge agus ar an Ghaeltacht &mdash; amharc a thabhairt ar an scéim sin.  Nuair a bhí mé anseo anuraidh agus mé ag labhairt ar an dtaobh thall den Teach rinne mé an moladh céanna agus ní dóigh liom gur tugadh aird dá laghad air.  Má tá an Roinn i ndáiríre faoin Ghaeilge sílim go ndéanfaidh siad dearcadh isteach ins an scéal sula dtagann an chéad Mheastachán eile os comhair na Roinne.  Níl mé ag cur an locht ar na cigirí.  Níl na cigirí ach ag iarraidh an riail atá ansin a chur i bhfeidhm agus murar féidir athrú a chur ar an scéal b'fhéidir fá choinne muinín mhuintir na Gaeltachta a fháil go gcuirfí bord éigin ar bun go bhféadfaí a theacht chucu agus iarraidh orthusan dearcadh isteach sa scéal.  Sílim gur olc an rud é go bhfuil sé ag brath ar thuairim duine amháin an bhfuil an deontas sin le tabhairt amach nó nach bhfuil.  Mar a dúirt mé, tá an t-am teoranta agus níl am agam mórán eile a rá, ach tá áthas orm gur Aire as iarthar na hÉireann atá ann.  Sílim gur ócáid stairiúil é seo mar ní hé amháin go bhfuil Aire na Gaeltachta anseo ach tá triúir iar-Airí i láthair &mdash; beirt acu atá taréis labhartha &mdash; agus b'fhéidir go labharfaidh an duine eile nuair a shuímse síos. Mar sin, go raibh míle maith agaibh agus tá súil agam nár labhair mé ro-fhada.</P>

      <P>Ar an gcéad dul síos ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an Aire, an Teachta O'Toole, agus guím gach rath ar <Col N="2067" /> a chuid oibre.  Maidir leis an Meastachán seo, cuireann sé díomá orm go bhfuil sé chomh lú le £20,000.  Taispeánann sé sin an tsuim atá ag an Rialtas seo sa Ghaeltacht agus i Roinn na Gaeltachta. Tá a fhios agam go rí-mhaith go bhfuil an-suim ag an Aire féin sa Ghaeltacht ach níl san Aire ach guth amháin sa Rialtas. Níl aige ach vóta amháin san Rialtas agus tá a fhios againn go rí-mhaith go bhfuil sé deacair aigesan an t-airgead a fháil ón Rialtas.  Is féidir leis an Aire bheith cinnte de go bhfaighidh sé lán-tacaíocht uainne ar an dtaobh seo den Teach &mdash; b'fhéidir nach bhfuil mórán maitheasa ansin &mdash; chun brú a chur ar an Rialas níos mó airgid a thabhairt dó.</P>
      <P>Is é an rud is tábhachtaí maidir leis an Ghaeltacht agus an cúram atá orainn go léir ná cuidiú le muintir na Gaeltachta an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo.  Chun é sin a dhéanamh tá dualgas orainn go léir agus dualgas ar Aire na Gaeltachta fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil go leor deacrachtaí, go háirithe faoi láthair leis an cúlú domhanda atá againn.  Caithfidh Roinn na Gaeltachta agus Aire na Gaeltachta gach cuidiú a thabhairt do na monarchana go léir chun na jobanna atá acu a choinneáil.  Ba mhaith linn cur leis na jobanna sin ach an chéad chúram atá aige i rith cúlú domhanda ná na jobanna sin a choinneáil.  Ceapaim gur cheart deontas spesialta a thabhairt do na monarchana sin chun costais iompair a laghdú.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Gallagher, táimíd cuid mhaith míle ó na calafoirt éagsúla le haghaidh allmhairithe agus onnmhairithe agus ba cheart smaoineamh air sin, deontas a chur ar fáil do na monarchana seo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá monarcha amháin againn sna Doirí Beaga agus tá eagla ar na hoibrithe go bhfuil seans ann go n-aistreofar an tionscal sin go Baile Atha Cliath.  Ba mhaith liom go ndéanfadh an tAire cinnte de má tá athrú san equity ansin go mbeidh an mhonarcha sin fágtha san Doirí Beaga. Tá foirgneamh sna Doirí Beaga a tógadh le haghaidh stiúideo nua Radio na Gaeltachta. B'fhéidir go gcuirfidh Aire na Gaeltachta brú ar an Aire Poist agus Telegrafa airgead a chur ar fáil chun an stiúideo a oscailt chomh luath agus is <Col N="2068" /> féidir.  Tá Radio na Gaeltachta ag déanamh an-obair agus labhair an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn maidir le sin. Tá an ceann atá againne i Dún na nGall ró-bheag agus is ceist phráinneach é go n-osclófaí an ceann eile chomh luath agus is féidir.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na bóithre áise, cuireann sé díomá orm gur laghdú an méid a tugadh ó £200,000 go £50,000.  Cuireann sé andíomá orm go bhfuair mise freagra inniu maidir leis na bóithre ar oileán Árainn Mhór.  Leis na blianta anuas thug Roinn na Gaeltachta cuidiú don chomhairle chontae agus thaispeáin Roinn na Gaeltachta an tsuim a bhí acu sna hoileáin. Táimid buíoch gur tugadh airgead do hoileán Thóraigh ach le blianta anuas thug gach Aire Gaeltachta £15,000 do hoileán Árainn Mhór ach inniu dúradh liom nach bhfuil airgead ag an Roinn i mbliana le caitheamh ar na bóithre sin. Ba mhaith liomsa go ndéanfadh comhairle chontae Dhún na nGall aon obair is gnáth a dhéanamh orthu.  B'fhéidir go ndéanfar ath-smaoineamh air seo agus airgead a chur ar fáil le haghaidh na bóithre ar oileán Árainn Mhór.  Tá an chomhairle chontae ag brath ar airgead a fháil ón Roinn.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis na mná tí is féidir leatsa a bheith cinnte agus an milleán a chur ar Aire na Gaeltachta ag an am sin, An Teachta Denis Gallagher, ach an Teachta O'Toole atá mar Aire na Gaeltachta anois agus thug sé geallúint do mhuintir na Gaeltachta agus do mhná tí na Gaeltachtaí go dtabhairfadh sé ardú dóibh gach bliain.  Is mór an trua nár tugadh an t-airgead sin agus b'fhéidir go ndéanfar ath-smaoineamh air sin.</P>
    <P>Caithfidh mé seans a thabhairt do na daoine eile atá ag teacht isteach anois. Arís ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an Aire agus tá súil agam go bhfaighimid seans eile agus go mbeidh i bhfad níos mó ama againn chun díospóireacht a bheith againn maidir le Roinn na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasGODonnell" hpid="Mr. O'Donnell Mr. O'Donnell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donnell</NameTxt>
      <P>Seo é an ócáid amháin chuile bhliain nuair atá seans againn díospóireacht cheart Ghaeilge a bheith againn sa Teach seo.  Tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann gnó na Dála a shocrú níos fearr an bhliain seo chugainn ionas <Col N="2069" /> go mbeidh am go leor ag Teachtaí an Meastachán a phlé go ceart, gan trácht ar na Meastacháin eile.  Ar an gcéad dul síos gabhaim mo chomhgairdeas leis an Aire as ucht a cheapúcháin mar Aire na Gaeltachta. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go han mhaith leis san obair thábhachtach atá idir lámha aige.  Níl aon amhras agam go bhfuil cúram an-thábhachtach ar Aire na Gaeltachta &mdash; cúram na teanga agus cúram na nGaeltachtaí.  Tá a fhios agam go dtuigeann muintir na hÉireann uile gurb í an Ghaeltacht tobar agus foinse ár gcultúir.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta Denis Gallagher, brathann ceist na Gaeltachta agus na Gaeilge ní hé amháin ar mhuintir na nGaeltachtaí ach ar pobal na hÉireann go hiomlán.</P>
      <P>Tuigim anois, agus tuigeann gach éinne, go bhfuil deachrachtaí eacnamaíochta ag brú isteach orainne agus dá bhrí sin tá sé an-deacair ar fad tionscail a bhunú.  Ach tá sé i bhfad níos deacra tionscail a bhunú agus fostaíocht a chur ar fáil i gceantair iargúlta cois farraige ina bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí suite.  Tá áthas orm a fheiceáil go bhfuil méadú beag ar an líon atá fostaithe sna Gaeltachtaí thar bliain ó shin.  Is maith é sin a chloisteáil.</P>
      <P>Beidh deis ag mo chara, Deputy Tunney, cúpla focal a rá, ach caithfidh mé ceist a chur ar an Aire: an bhfuil aon rud beartaithe aige chun dul i gcomhairle le Comhphobal na hEorpa chun airgead breise a fháil chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun chinn?  Faoi mar is eol don Aire, nuair a bhí mé ag caint ar an Mheastachán seo an bhliain seo caite, rinne mé tagairt do socruithe nua atá déanta ag an gComhphobal.  An bhfuil aon bheartadh ag an Aire dul i gcomhairle le Coimisiún an Chomhphobail chun cabhair a fháil chun forbairt na Gaeltachta a chur chun cinn?</P>

      <P>Níl mórán agam le rá ach tá mo dhóthain ama agam chun mo chuid dhíomá a chur in iúl don Aire agus don Teach maidir leis an díospóireacht seo. Tá díomá orm freisin, agus mé ag éisteacht le cainteoirí, faoin béim uafásach atá ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta.  Chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé liomsa is í an Ghaeltacht an áit amháin ina bhfuil Gaeilge mar ghnáth <Col N="2070" /> theanga.  Is í an Ghaeltacht an áit ina bhfuil scoth na tíre seo ina gcónaí.  Is í an Ghaeltacht an áit ina bhfuil a fháganns againne dár gcultúr agus saol sóisialta na tíre.  Is cuma liomsa go dtarlaíonn sé go bhfuil sé i nGaillimh nó í Maigh Eo nó i dTír Chonaill: ní bheadh sé ann mura mbeadh an Ghaeilge ann.  Baineann an Ghaeltacht leis an tír &mdash; ní hé áilneacht na háite, bochtanas na háite atá ann &mdash; agus más rud é go mbíonn an iomad béime ar chúrsaí eacnamaíochta, gan socrú dá réir a dhéanamh muna bhfuil ann ach go bhfuilimid ag cur isteach na mílte gasúir ag labhairt Béarla tá brabach ansin do na mná tí ach tá an-chailliúint ann maidir leis an Ghaeilge.  Má bhímid ag chur tionscal isteach agus muna bhfuil socrú déanta roimh ré go mbeidh an duine is tábhachtaí ann in ann a chuid oibre a dhéanamh trí Ghaeilge, cén mhaith é?  An rud is luachmara beidh sé ag éirí níos lú de réir an lae agus ní bheidh Gaeltacht ann ach Galltacht.  B'fhearr liomsa airgead a thabhairt do mhuintir na Gaeltachta ach an Ghaeilge a choinneáil beo.  Bhí mé i nGaillimh agus i gCiarraí agus i dTír Chonaill le déanaí agus thug mé faoi dearadh nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge sna háiteanna sin mar a bhíodh agus sin an rud go mba cheart dúinn bheith ag díriú ár smaointe air.  Muna ndéanaimid é sin, i sé nó seacht mbliain beimid ag caint faoin Ghaeltacht ach ní bheidh aon Ghaeltacht ann.  Níor cheart dúinn bheith ag breathnú ar an Ghaeltacht agus ag rá gur áit congested atá ann.  Tá sé tábhachtach de bhrí go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ann.  Ní bheidh sé tábhachtach níos mó má imíonn an Ghaeltacht agus chomh túisce agus a n-aithnímid gur mar sin atá, is fearr a bheas sé don Ghaeltacht.</P>

      <NameTxt>Aire na Gaeltachta (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom i dtosach mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachtaí a ghlac páirt san díospóireacht.  Tá díomá orm nach bhfuil ach cúig nóiméid agam le freagraí a thabhairt ar na ceisteanna a cuireadh orm ach déanfaidh mé mo dhícheall, agus táim cinnte go mbeidh díomá ar dhaoine nach bhfuil mé ábalta plé go mion leis na pointí uile sa ghnáth <Col N="2071" /> bhealach.  Theastódh uair a chloig uaim dul trí na pointí ar fad.</P>
      <P>Aontaím le Deputy Tunney go bhfuil an iomairce béime á tabhairt againn ar chúrsaí airgeadais agus gur rud eile ar fad í an teanga.  Ach, ar ndóigh, muna mbíonn daoine ann ní bheidh teanga ann agus ní choinneofar daoine sa Ghaeltacht muna mbeidh fostaíocht ann.  Tá, mar adéarfá, &ldquo;inevitable logic&rdquo; ag baint leis an rud seo.  Ach taobh amuigh de sin, ba cheart go mbeadh níos mó béime ar mheon i leith na Gaeilge agus dá mbeadh an meon ann bheadh an Ghaeilge slán.</P>
      <P>Dúradh go raibh cúraimí breise agam agus nach féidir liom an t-am atá ag gabháil leis an Aireacht a chaitheamh air. Ní thagaim le sin ar chor ar bith.  Is é an Teachta McGinley a dúirt go bhfuil anbhaint ag an iascaireacht agus an bhforaoiseacht le ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus tá, agus tá daoine sa Teach seo ar aon intinn, a thuigeann ón méid atá déanta agam gur fearr go mór bheith ag plé liomsa ar ghnóthaí iascaireachta, cuir i gcás, atá ar bun sa Ghaeltacht toisc gur féidir liom na ceisteanna a chuireann na daoine seo a fhreagairt agus aon chúnamh is féidir liom a thabhairt mar Aire Iascagh chomh maith le bheith im Aire Gaeltachta.  Mar sin, ní dóigh liom go dtagann an dá Aireacht salach ar a chéile.  Tá siad ag cuidiú le chéile agus tá súil agam go bhfeicfear go mbeidh siad mar bhuntáiste don Ghaeltacht.</P>
      <P>Maidir le bóithre áise, tá an ceart ag an Fhreasúra a bheith ag gearán agus ag clamhsán faoi easpa airgid le haghaidh bóithre áise.  Dúirt an Teachta Geoghegan-Quinn nach raibh aon mhaith agamsa bheith ag caint faoi chomhairlí contae agus ag caitheamh anuas orthu toisc nach bhfuil siad ag déanamh a job féin sna Gaeltachtaí.  Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin fíor.  Is maith an rud dúinn mar Theachtaí Dála go bhfuil suim againn i bhforbairt na Gaeltachta, an mhéar a shíniú ag na comhairlí contae agus a rá leo nach bhfuil a gcion agus a ndualgais á ndéanamh acu ar son na gceantar Gaeltachta go bhfuil siad freagreach astu ina gcontaethe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tá fhios agam le blianta fada anuas gur <Col N="2072" /> tháinig Roinn na Gaeltachta isteach, chuir siad airgead ar fáil do bhóithre áise agus áiseanna eile, agus gurb iad na comhairlí contae a bhí i ndáiríre freagrach as na seirbhísí seo agus shleamhnaigh siad amach as a ndualgais.  Faoi seo, tá comhairle chontae amháin sa tír seo nach bhfuil sásta cúig faoin gcéad den chostas iomlán ar áis faoi leith sa chontae sin a chur ar fáil.</P>

      <P>The position in relation to the list of excluded items is not static.  The list is <Col N="1922" /> constantly under review and the number of items excluded will depend on the date on which the count is made.  For instance, some of the items originally listed for removal from the scheme in March were retained after further consideration.  The attached lists show as on 1 June 1983 the drugs withdrawn since 1 January from the list of reimbursable items.  They number 233.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit on 6 March 1983 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an accident at work on 3 March 1983.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of investigations arising from the accident he was paid disability benefit on an interim basis from 8 March 1983, the fourth day of incapacity.  He was also paid pay-related benefit from 18 March 1983, the thirteenth day of incapacity.  Following completion of investigations, injury benefit was awarded from the date of the accident at the rate of £71.55 a week increased to £79.95 from 17 March 1983 in respect of an additional child dependant.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 4 October 1973 to 21 January 1981 when he qualified for a contributory old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where a person has less than 156 contributions paid since entry into insurable employment payment of disability benefit is limited to 52 weeks.  According to <Col N="1927" /> the records of the Department during the period of the claim he had a total of 148 contributions paid since his entry into insurable employment and his entitlement to disability benefit was exhausted on 28 September 1974 after a period of 52 weeks.  In the meantime he continued to submit medical evidence of incapacity for work until reaching pension age.  Further contributions in respect of employment during 1954 were however submitted by the claimant in February 1982. This had the effect of giving him a continuing title to disability benefit up to 20 January 1981.</P>
    <P>The claimant had been in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance and disabled persons maintenance allowance from the Eastern Health Board during the period from 30 September 1974 to 20 January, 1981.</P>
    <P>A cheque for the arrears of benefit payable on his claim less amount advanced by the Eastern Health Board was issued to the claimant on 27 April 1983.  All benefit due under the claim has accordingly been paid to the person concerned. The delay in making the payment was due to the late surrender by him in February 1982 of his 1954 insurance card.</P>

      <P>A grant of £100 is payable following the death of the sister of the person concerned.  However, the deceased had been in receipt of an invalidity pension before her death, which occurred on 10 February 1983.  It then transpired that three pension orders dated 10 February 1983, 17 February 1983 and 24 February 1983 had been cashed.</P>
      <P>Payment of the death grant was delayed while the inquiries into the cashing of the three orders were in progress. The payment is, however, now being made.  A form on which to claim invalidity pension was forwarded to the person concerned on 2 May 1983.  It has not been returned and a further form has now been forwarded to her.

He appealed against the amount of the means assessed against <Col N="1929" /> him on 4 June 1983 and his case has been referred to the social welfare officer for further inquiries before being submitted to the appeals officer.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 21 February 1983.  Her claim was disallowed initially because, according to the records of the Department, she had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in 1981-82, the contribution year governing her claim.  Only four paid contributions were recorded in respect of her at that stage.  She was informed of this on 10 March 1983.  No response was received.</P>
      <P>It has now been established that the person concerned was entitled to 23 credited contributions in 1981-82 and a cheque for £207.54 representing payment of disability benefit for the period from 24 February 1983, the fourth day of incapacity, to 6 June 1983, the date of the latest medical certificate received, was issued on 14 June 1983.</P>

He appealed against the amount of means assessed and following further inquiries an appeals officer reduced his means assessment to £38.  He is therefore entitled to unemployment assistance of £12.50 a week being the maximum of £50.50 less means £38.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided by an appeals officer that the person concerned is not entitled to an old age pension as the assessment of his means, consisting of half the estimated letting value of a holding, his wife's occupational pension and capital exceeds the statutory limit of £38 weekly.</P>
      <P>However, as the upper means limit for receipt of old age pension will be extended with effect from 1 July 1983 the Deputy's recent representations have been accepted as a repeat claim to pension on the person's behalf.  The claim has been referred to the social welfare officer for investigation and referral to the local pension committee for decision.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance application of the person concerned was authorised at the weekly rate of £34.05 on the basis of an old qualification certificate with means of £10.25 derived from the income from his farm notionally assessed, pending the investigation of his means on a factual basis by a social welfare officer.  Payment covering the period up to 17 May 1983 was made to him on that date after deducting the amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid to him during the period which was due to be refunded to the Western Health Board.</P>
      <P>On completion of the social welfare officer's inquiries, his means have now been factually assessed at £38 a week derived from self-employment as a builder and from his land.  This entitles him to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £37.35 and arrangements are being made to pay all arrears due to him in the coming week.  His present entitlement is calculated by reference to the (higher) standard rates of unemployment assistance which apply in the case of factual assessment.</P>
