  <MainHeading Type="GD" LHead="Merchant Shipping (Light Dues)" RHead="Bill, 1983: Second Stage">
    <Title>Merchant Shipping (Light Dues) Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan) John F. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Transport by order to give a statutory basis for the levels of light dues collected in respect of ships calling to ports within the State and to enable him to vary the levels of light dues from time to time.</P>
      <P>The provision and maintenance of the lights services, comprising lighthouses, beacons, buoys, and other aids required for general maritime navigation, around the coasts of Britain and Ireland, including Northern Ireland, are governed by the provisions of sections 634 to 669 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, as adapted.  The Act vested responsibility for the lights services in three bodies known as general lighthouse authorities.</P>
      <P>The three general lighthouse authorities are Trinity House, London, which has responsibility for the lights services throughout England, Wales and the Channel Islands, and also the adjacent seas and islands; the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses whose responsibility extends throughout Scotland, its adjacent seas and islands and the Isle of Man; and the Commissioners of Irish Lights who are responsible for the lights services throughout the 32 counties of Ireland and its adjacent seas and islands.  The 1894 Act also confirmed the three authorities in the ownership of the lights and other property held and maintained by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local harbour lights, buoys and other navigational aids, which are used only by vessels entering or leaving a particular <Col N="720" /> harbour or pier, are provided and maintained by the individual harbour authority or other local body concerned, subject only to the technical supervision of the appropriate general lighthouse authority.</P>
    <P>While the lights in the three areas are separately owned and managed by the three general lighthouse authorities, who have wide discretion in local matters, the whole system of lights around the coasts of Britain and Ireland is administered as a single self-supporting financial unit.</P>
    <P>All ships using ports in Britain or in Ireland, except those specifically exempted, pay light dues on a uniform scale, fixed by the British Department of Trade, to the general lighthouse authority within whose area of jurisdiction the ports lie.  Light dues in respect of vessels calling to ports within the State are collected by local Customs officers, acting as agents of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  They are remitted via the Department of Transport to the British Department of Trade, by whom they are paid, together with the light dues collected by the two other lighthouse authorities, into a statutory General Lighthouse Fund established under the Merchant Shipping (Mercantile Marine Fund) Act, 1898. Expenditure incurred by the three general lighthouse authorities is met from this fund.</P>
    <P>The fixing or altering of the level of light dues is governed by the Merchant Shipping (Mercantile Marine Fund) Act, 1898, as adapted.  Section 5 (2) of that Act provides that light dues may be altered by Government order.  Since the foundation of the State, however, the practice has been that the light dues fixed from time to time by the British Department of Trade have been applied on an administrative basis to vessels calling to ports within the State.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the anomalous position of the Commissioners of Irish Lights was raised by the British Comptroller and Auditor General in his report for the years 1979-80 and 1980-81, in which he drew attention to the fact that there was no legal basis for the collection of light dues in the State at rates in excess of those in operation in 1922.  He also referred to the loss of revenue to the <Col N="721" /> General Lighthouse Fund by virtue of the fact that since Ireland joined the European Monetary System on 13 March 1979 light dues had been collected in Irish pounds as though they were equivalent to pounds sterling.</P>
    <P>Preliminary discussions took place last year between the British Department of Trade and my Department about various legal and financial anomalies of the situation of the Commissioners of Irish Lights.  It was agreed at the time that the whole complex question of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and their relationship with the British and Irish authorities should be the subject of further bilateral discussions after the matter had been considered by the Department of Transport in consultation with other Government Departments and other interests concerned.  It was also agreed in principle that light dues charged at Irish ports should be fixed as soon as possible at a level in Irish currency equivalent in value to the sterling rate fixed in Britain.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General, who has been consulted by the Department of Transport, has confirmed that there is no statutory basis for the charging of light dues at Irish ports at a level in excess of that prevailing at the time of the transfer of powers from Britain to Ireland in 1922. It is necessary, therefore, to take steps to remedy this position and, as already mentioned, that is one of the purposes of this Bill &mdash; the other being to enable the Minister to vary the levels of light dues from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to the provisions in the Merchant Shipping (Mercantile Marine Fund) Act, 1898, whereby light dues may be altered by Government order.  Section 5 (3) of that Act provides, however, that, before any such order is made, the draft order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for not less than 30 sitting days and may be rejected by resolution of either House.  Because of the excessive delay which would be involved in following the procedure laid down in the 1898 Act, the Government decided to introduce the present Bill for the purpose of amending and updating the relevant provisions of the 1898 Act.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a short one and is primarily <Col N="722" /> of an enabling nature.  Section 2 of the Bill will empower the Minister for Transport to make an order amending the scales, rules and exemptions set out in the Second Schedule to the 1898 Act for the levying of light dues, with retrospective effect to the date of introduction of this Bill.  The purpose of the retrospective clause is to prevent a shipowner from claiming that he was not obliged until the ministerial order was made to pay light dues at a level higher than that existing in 1922.  Under section 2 (4), any such order will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas in the customary manner. Section 3 provides for the repeal of certain parts of section 5 of the 1898 Act which will become redundant once this Bill has been enacted.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our intention to facilitate the passage of this Bill and the Whips have so agreed.</P>
      <P>It is interesting that we have to go back to 1898 for the statutory authority for the operation of the Irish Lights charges.  In researching for this Second Stage debate, I could not help but notice that the 1898 volume of Bills contained the Local Government Act which had far-reaching effects on the administration of this country and, in particular, in allocating responsibility for local administration to local elected authorities.  This may not be irrelevant in considering what we are doing here with regard to the amendment of the 1898 Act.</P>
      <P>One thing that is pleasing as far as the system is concerned is that the administration is on an all-Ireland basis, the Commissioners of Irish Lights dealing, as is only rational and sane, with the whole country as a unit.  That is something which would be pleasing to all sides of the House and I am sure it could be a pointer to what can happen in the future because, as the Minister said, this matter comes up for consideration in the future. The year 1898 was a significant one with regard to taking powers from the Westminster Parliament and allocating them to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to look at the original <Col N="723" /> Act, and the Second Schedule, which lays down the fees because this gives an idea how necessary it is to update many things. The House will be interested to know that the scale of fees as laid down in the 1898 Act shows how technology has changed in 85 years, even at sea, beyond all powers of conception at that time.  I read the debate in the British House of Commons at that time and I do not think they could have envisaged what was going to happen with the ships.  In the 1898 Act a scale of fees was laid down: 1d per ton per voyage for home trade sailing ships; 2¼d &mdash; even that charge shows how times have changed because the farthing is a collector's piece in Britain and Ireland &mdash; per ton per voyage for foreign-going sailing ships; 1½d per ton per voyage for home trade steamers &mdash; a distinction is made between sailing ships and steamers; 2¾d per ton per voyage for foreign going steamers; 1/- per ton per year for tugs, pleasure yachts and so on. The very scale of the charges, the mention of sailing ships, and the idea that a substantial amount of money could be got from dues on sailing ships, bring us back, and are a pointer to the need for updating many things in our legislation and in our general relationship with the UK.</P>
    <P>I want to make a few points because there has been a certain amount of aggro with regard to Ireland and its enjoyment of certain financial privileges as a result of the arrangement made in 1898.  One of the good old criteria applied in all these cases is <i>cui bono</i>, who is gaining.  When we hear strong arguments from Westminster, and criticisms of the advantages we have here as a result of the arrangement made in 1898, we should bear in mind that all the lighthouses and other appurtenances for the safety of and benefit of sailors, benefit greatly the very large UK merchant fleet.  It is well to keep that in mind.</P>
    <P>As of now I do not want to go into this point in any great detail, or to speak strongly about certain remarks which were made by various people in positions of importance in the UK.  As the Minister said, consultations are going on at the <Col N="724" /> moment.  It is well to indicate that there are arguments on our side as well.  For example, the Minister mentioned that our customs people provide a service also which is of benefit to the system.</P>
    <P>At one stage since we joined the European Monetary System the punt went ahead of the pound sterling and was stronger.  Admittedly that was not to the advantage of this country, or of our exporters, but it happened.  What happened once might happen again.  The powers being taken by the Minister in this Bill will enable him to deal with such an eventuality.  As the Minister said, the whole complex question of the Commissioners of Irish Lights and their relationship with the British and Irish authorities is the subject of further bilateral discussions. I have confidence in the Minister and in his team.  I am sure they will make the points which will strengthen our case, and that they will be able to resolve any difficulties which may have arisen as a result of the comments and remarks made by the British Comptroller and Auditor General with regard to the drop in income to the fund as a result of the fees being paid in punts rather than in pounds sterling.  This Bill will regulate that anomaly, and the payments from our side will be at the same rate and will be the <i>pro rata</i> equivalent.</P>
    <P>I have not got very much more to say on this Bill.  When the whole system comes up for consideration, and perhaps reorganisation, it will be important that the new body, if there has to be a new body, established on the Irish side will be subject to democratic choice and that the Dáil will have a say in the structures of any boards which may be established, and will have control over such boards. There may be no need for such a development. The negotiations and discussions may wipe out any difficulties which may have arisen.  It is important to keep in mind that this House should have a strong say in any administrative unit which may be established to deal with this in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to tie that in with the original comments I made about the 1898 Act.  In that year people were talking about giving local government to this <Col N="725" /> country.  They actually delivered a Local Government Act.  We have had a kind of <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement since then for the Commissioners of Irish Lights with regard to the facilities provided for sailors around our coast.  If it comes to a reorganisation, it should be on the basis of democratic control by this House over appointments and activities.  I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to raise the limit of borrowings by Irish Steel Ltd. which may be guaranteed by the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, from £75 million to £100 million.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel Ltd. is a wholly State owned company with share capital of £30 million held by the Minister for Finance.  The total amount of borrowings covered by ministerial guarantee at present is £75 million.  The principal activity of the company is the manufacture of steel from ferrous scrap.</P>
      <P>The Dáil will be aware that Irish Steel's old plant has been replaced by a modern plant whose production efficiency compares favourably with the best in western Europe.  The development project was initially approved by the Coalition Government in February 1977.  In the event, the commencement of work on the project was delayed because of the necessity to notify the European Commission of the project, and the importance of ECSC loans, which would be contingent on Commission approval, to the project.</P>
      <P>The project was finally approved by the Fianna Fáil administration in June 1979 when they approved the legislation to provide funding for the project.  A total amount of almost £125 million has been provided to Irish Steel since the commencement of the project, of which £75 million has been by way of guaranteed borrowings.  The company now have 630 employees.</P>
      <P>The production of reinforcing bars, merchant bars and sections, which had ceased completely in order to facilitate the installation of the new plant, was recommenced in July 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to the cost of the development project, the company incurred losses from 1974 to 1980 due to the obsolescence of the old plant.  Losses were also incurred during the installation of <Col N="727" /> major items of plant when production was suspended for 18 months, and since July 1981, in commissioning products, re-entering old markets and breaking into new export markets.  The combination of these factors has resulted in borrowings amounting to £75 million at the end of May 1983.</P>
    <P>A Government grant of £25 million was made available to Irish Steel in 1982 to reduce their cumulative losses.  Taking this grant into account, the company's accumulated losses at 30 June 1982, amounted to almost £23 million and their anticipated losses for the year to 30 June 1983 are of the order of £21 million. Further losses are expected to be incurred in each of the years up to 30 June 1985 even if substantial additional funding, to which I will refer, is provided. Earlier this year the Minister for Finance invested a further £5 million in the share capital of Irish Steel.  In addition the company have recently negotiated a loan facility for £3 million and are now in the process of negotiating further borrowings amounting to £17 million to cover their requirements until early 1984.  Their ability to raise these borrowings is dependent on the enactment of legislation to provide for an increase in the limit to which the Minister may guarantee borrowings by the company.</P>
    <P>Increasing the amount of borrowings which may be guaranteed will not solve the company's financial problems.  It is clear that the level of borrowings is far too high for the company to bear and corrective measures are obviously needed.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that in July 1982, the Minister and the European Commission jointly appointed consultants to assess the viability of Irish Steel.  The consultants who reported in September 1982, concluded that Irish Steel's production costs were not competitive.  However, on the basis of certain assumptions in relation to prices, reduction in production costs and growth in sales and revenue, electricity costs and the provision of State funds of up to a maximum of £89 million, the company could, in the consultants' opinion, be viable and should be <Col N="728" /> allowed to continue in operation.  The consultants warned, nevertheless, that if it were decided to keep the plant in operation and to provide the necessary funds, there remained the risk of failure due to the difficulty of adequately breaking into the export markets.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that no financial aid, and that includes both equity investment and the guaranteeing of borrowings, may be provided by a member state to a steel undertaking without the prior approval of the European Commission, and aid for the continued operation of a steel undertaking cannot be paid after 31 December 1984.  I emphasise that the Government have not taken a decision in relation to aid to Irish Steel in respect of any period after 1983. Their decision, in due course, will be influenced by the viability prospects having regard to the company's performance up to the end of this year.</P>
    <P>A notification of the maximum level of aid which the Government might contemplate was sent to the Commission at the end of September 1982, the latest time for receipt by the Commission of such notifications.  That included the period right up to the end of 1984.  The maximum aid envisaged in the notification &mdash; and this was just a permission we were seeking, not necessarily a decision we were taking &mdash; was the guaranteeing of further borrowings of £25 million to be replaced by share capital &mdash; that is what this Bill is about &mdash; and the provision of share capital of up to £89 million.  That is not something taking place at this point and, as I have already indicated, the decision will have to be taken before the end of this year, namely, 1983.  Whether that £89 million is put in will be dependent on that decision.  The Commission is required to give a final decision on all aid notifications by 1 July 1983.  The Commission will not approve aid unless the basic viability of companies is established. Therefore, while the Commission might give us permission we are not necessarily bound to avail of that permission. It is a decision we have to make before the end of this year on the basis of the performance of the company, indeed not just the performance of the company <Col N="729" /> but also our view as to the future of the steel market and so on.  Then the point I made was that the cost ot the State of closing Irish Steel could be of the order of between £80 million and £100 million.</P>

      <P>Were they given something earlier this year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, £5 million I think was the figure.  That was equity, this is the borrowing.  The Commission has already given approval for the equity investment of £5 million made earlier this year and has also approved the drawdown by the company of a further £7 million in guaranteed borrowings which will be sufficient to cover the company's requirements pending a final decision by the Commission on aid notification.</P>
      <P>The situation in the international steel market continues to be extremely depressed.  Recent forecasts, which revise downwards forecasts made in October 1982 indicate that world steel consumption in 1983 is now expected to be only about 1 per cent above the 1982 level, while that for the European Community is expected to be down by 1.2 per cent.  The problem of over-capacity in steel production in the Community, estimated at 40 million tonnes per year, has yet to be solved and demand for steel is now &mdash; within the EEC &mdash; at an even lower level than in 1982.  It is in the context of this difficult market situation that Irish Steel must export some 70 per cent of their production.  It is clear that the future of Irish Steel will continue to depend on the way in which the markets for their products develop and on the costs and efficiency of the company's operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1974 enormous imbalances have been created in the Community between supply and demand in all the main steel product categories.  This excess of supply over demand, which has pushed up costs and caused prices to drop below the break-even point in many companies, and the severe competition on export markets have seriously eroded the financial viability of the European steel industry as a whole.  As a result the European Commission has had to take a number of <Col N="730" /> measures designed to prevent the situation deteriorating into a state of chaos and to set in place the mechanisms to adapt the structure of the industry to the new situation.  The main measures currently being operated by the Commission are restrictions on investment in steel production, restrictions on State aid to steel undertakings, restrictions on steel production, measures to raise steel prices, aids for redundancy, short time working and early retirement, loans to industries which can help to replace employment lost through steel plant closures and loans to help steel undertakings to carry out restructuring plans, involving a reduction in capacity.</P>
    <P>The present system of monitoring production and deliveries of a number of steel products, and the system of production quotas for certain steel products is due to expire on 30 June 1983.  The Commission has made a proposal for the extension until 31 December 1985, of these measures but with the inclusion of plate and heavy sections in the system of compulsory quotas.  In discussions on this proposal our aim has been, and will be, to ensure that Irish Steel which, carried out their restructuring plan with Commission approval, should not be prevented from being viable by the application of the measures proposed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>This relates to the application of quotas, to the types of products produced in large quantity by Irish Steel not presently the subject of quotas.  If the quotas are based on historical production trends obviously Irish Steel would be at a disadvantage because, for much of the base period, they have either not been in production or producing at a relatively low level.  Therefore, the introduction of quotas at this point would have serious effects on the viability of Irish Steel one way or the other.  I am hopeful that a satisfactory arrangement can be worked out which will take account of Irish Steel's position in this regard.</P>
    <P>It will be clear to Deputies from what I have said that the difficulties facing Irish Steel are enormous and it would be misleading of me to minimise them.  The company must achieve an increasing level <Col N="731" /> of sales at a time when the international steel market is deeply depressed and at a time when established producers are being compelled to reduce their production capacity because of the imbalance between supply and demand.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel now have a very modern and versatile plant and have commssioned 65 of their intended range of 85 products.  As far as sales are concerned, the company have made substantial progress in the past year with the result that, in the year to 30 June 1983, the volume of sales is expected to be more than double that achieved in the previous year. While this aspect of the company's performance is encouraging, it must be pointed out that much more remains to be accomplished in relation to costs and prices and to further increases in sales, if the company are to succeed as a viable and competitive producer.  The difficulties facing the company in the market place should not be under-estimated and the prospects for the international steel market simply cannot be viewed optimistically. In the interest of the taxpayer and the country as a whole both the Government and I will continue to keep the performance of Irish Steel under review. I would hope, however, that the essential performance required to safeguard the future of the company can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am confident that the Bill will commend itself to the Dáil and I recommend its approval.</P>

      <P>It is very difficult to form an opinion of what the Minister is trying to get at here because, from his own words, it appears that this is no more than a holding operation.  The Government have taken no decision on the future of Irish Steel at present.  It would appear also that they are awaiting a decision from the EEC as to whether they will or will not allow the amount of aid they are proposing to give them, that that decision will be taken by 31 July next, that Irish Steel will continue until 31 December 1983 but beyond that the Minister is not prepared to say here today what will be the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a rather curious position for the <Col N="732" /> Minister and the Government to take up. One would have thought that, in any holding operation &mdash; as is being proposed under this Bill &mdash; there would not be a certain lack in the information available to the Government.  I do not think either the Minister or anybody else would deny that that is the case.  Judging from the figures given about the steel industry it appears it has worsened since last year, when it was approximately 30 million tonnes in excess of capacity within the EEC, to what the Minister says today is about 40 million tonnes.  The outlook for the steel industry is apparently very clear to the Minister, as are all the facts relating to Irish Steel.  I cannot understand the Minister shaking his head because it was only this time last year that we were considering Irish Steel in this House, when very shortly after I took over as Minister for Industry and Energy the position of Irish Steel was that they had borrowed approximately £24.5 million. They had exceeded their figure in relation to bank borrowing.  They were in a crisis situation and a Bill had to be introduced to give them State aid of £25 million.  This amount was provided in the Estimates by the previous Government.  At that time I said this situation could not continue unchecked.  I set up a monitoring committee to look at the projections of Irish Steel for that year.  I had lengthy discussions with the chairman and chief executive of the company.  I told them there was not a bottomless purse in relation to money for Irish Steel and I said we would have to take an in-depth look at their operations.</P>
    <P>There seemed to be a feeling that the taxpayers' money was endless and that unlimited sums were available.  From May last year we monitored the operations of Irish Steel.  Subsequently the Government decided, after consultations with the EEC, who were very concerned about the future of Irish Steel, to set up a joint consultancy into their operations which was to report back within three or four months.  The monitoring committee were also to report to the Government before 31 December 1982.</P>
    <P>The consultancy report came in.  I got a preliminary view of that report in September <Col N="733" /> because we had to put forward a conditional situation to the EEC as a holding operation until the full facts regarding Irish Steel were known to the Government.  At that time the Government would consider them carefully and decide whether a package should be put forward to the EEC.  A conditional holding situation was accepted by the EEC and the report came in shortly before I left office.  A memorandum for circulation to all Government Departments, the normal procedure, was being put together at the time of the election.  There was a change of Government after the election.</P>
    <P>I fail to see why the Minister is not yet in a position to say where the Government stand in regard to Irish Steel.  I can understand his political reluctance in view of the tragic unemployment situation that is developing in Cork city and the Cork region but what he is doing today is of no help to the future of Irish Steel or to the morale of the work force or the management.  Here they are being told that if there is not a major upswing in performance between now and 31 December their future looks bleak.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what factors he sees that can dramatically change the performance of Irish Steel between now and the end of July or December this year?  In his speech he has outlined the difficulties in relation to the steel market.  We know that will not change dramatically overnight.  Have the management got their hands on segments of the market?  Do they hope they can increase their sales in a certain section of the market between now and the end of December?  This is a short time in marketing terms, as I am sure the Minister will appreciate.  It is not possible to jump in overnight into a sector of the market. The Minister could have given much more information to the House that would have given us some insight into the Government's thoughts on this matter. Many more facts could have been put before the House.  Very little has been said about the report of the consultants. I know they were looking at various options.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants to check the sequence of events I suggest he should look at the files in the Department. There was an EEC deadline to be met by December.  As the Minister said, the consultancy was set up in June.  A period of three months is a short time for consultants to get into action and report. They gave us an initial look at their report, at which time we adopted a holding situation with the EEC.  Those facts cannot be denied.  The final report came to me shortly before the election.  That had to be considered by the monitoring committee and, as is the practice in such matters, a draft memorandum had to be prepared.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is ludicrous for the Minister to suggest he is not in a position to take a decision and that he will wait until he sees how Irish Steel perform between now and 31 December. I do not believe there will be any dramatic change, from what the Minister has told us today.  I am not in possession of all the up-to-date facts in relation to that company but from a business point of view I do not see a dramatic change taking place in Irish Steel between now and 31 December.  In my view the prescription given by the Minister is a prescription for a lingering death for Irish Steel.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they would. In his speech the Minister has said that Irish Steel have over-borrowed.  Yet, we introduce a Bill today allowing them to increase their borrowing from £75 million to £100 million.  This Minister when he was Minister for Finance and this Government for a long time lectured this side of the House and the nation about borrowing for current expenditure.  This is another exercise in borrowing for current expenditure but it is transferring the borrowing from the Exchequer to Irish Steel, a company the Minister knows are not in a position to service that borrowing.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us about their losses in 1982 and their projected loss of £22 million at June 1983.  It is a crazy, daft decision to give such a company the facility to borrow another £25 million when they cannot service their existing debts.  This is no more than a prescription for the slow lingering death of Irish Steel. Who will pay the interest, never mind the repayments?  Worse than that, the Minister is coming in with a Government guarantee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole matter of Government guarantees for loans in relation to certain semi-State bodies and operations like this should be called into question.  The Minister and the Government have lectured the nation and this party time and again about borrowing money recklessly, about borrowing money that cannot be repaid and about getting value for money borrowed. I ask the Minister to apply the criteria he has preached on many occasions. What answer does he come up with in relation to the proposition before the House?  I ask him to apply it.  Will there be a return on investment?  Can this company service the borrowing?  Is he not transferring the Exchequer borrowing right on to the semi-State company while at the same time the Government guarantee it?  If that is not an exercise against all the Minister and this Government <Col N="736" /> have ever preached then I do not know what is.  The Minister knows quite well that nothing will change.  I heard no observations from him in relation to the items that could give Irish Steel a chance regarding their future.  If I recall correctly, the consultants talked about 40 per cent ESB charges.  Out of line with their competitors Irish Steel were paying 40 per cent more than their competitors in energy costs.  I heard no mention of what the Minister might do about that, and he is also the Minister for Energy. That area can help the competitiveness of Irish Steel and he has spoken a great deal about Irish Steel having to become competitive.  They are paying 40p a therm for gas.  Maybe the Minister considers that a fair enough price, maybe not, but he does not refer to it.</P>
    <P>I recall also that the consultants talked about the possibility of viability being at a much later stage than the Minister spoke about here today.  The Minister talked about 1987 &mdash; is that right?  I did not have the opportunity of the benefit of his script earlier.  Was it 1986?  Anyway it was around that period.  I would have thought that the report suggested a couple of years later than that.  I would like to know the company's view of when they see viability around the corner.  I think it is on the record of this House that last year we talked about a breakeven situation in 1986-87, yet three or four months later when I monitored the performance of Irish Steel in relation to the projections we had been given earlier in the year they were a long way short on their projections.  I do not know if the position has improved or worsened since then, but enough information is available to the Minister to enable him to make up his mind as to where this Government are going in regard to Irish Steel rather than bringing in a makeshift operation of allowing them to borrow more money that he knows quite well they are not in a position to service, and he knows that they are not in a position to carry on under those circumstances.  He is in effect imposing a further burden on the management board and workers of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>If the Minister believes that Irish Steel <Col N="737" /> is an industry that Ireland should have in the future and that the Cork region should retain &mdash; in the present traumatic unemployment situation in Cork you would have an argument to go on there &mdash; then why not do something sensible in relation to getting money to Irish Steel? If he believes in what he is saying, that they should be kept in operation, then they need State equity, not borrowing that they cannot service and repay.  It is interesting to look back at what happened earlier this year.  At one stage the Minister gave them £1 million in State equity, and he, I and everyone else knows how long £1 million would help in the dire financial situation of Irish Steel.  It was followed later by £4 million.  We saw every sign of Government indecision that one could look for.  First he gave them £1 million, then £4 million and now, instead of State equity which the Minister should have continued if he believed in the future of Irish Steel, he takes the easy way out and tells the company to borrow £25 million, keep going for the rest of the year and we will look at them later this year.  He has been postponing the decision since he came into office and he and the Government are continuing to do that here.</P>
    <P>We all know the problems of the steel industry and that they have existed for quite a long time.  We know that the best projections for the future are pretty gloomy indeed.  During my short stay in the office of the Minister for Industry and Energy I made my own inquiries in relation to what the business community and the people involved in the steel industry might see in relation to Irish Steel.  On my first visit to the UK I had a long discussion with Ian McGregor who is well known in the steel business.  His view was that whatever chance steel had in the future was in a mini mill, a modern steel mill, but that marketing and penetration of the market would be extremely difficult. We know about the joint marketing operation with a French company.  The Minister today has not given any indication of how that is working or whether it is working at all.  We also know that the firm involved there was latterly nationalised. Maybe it is not operating as effectively <Col N="738" /> as might have been foreseen at the start.  I would like to hear from the Minister as to the present position in relation to that French joint marketing agreement. Is it proving effective for Irish Steel?</P>
    <P>On a visit to Norway in September I had a long discussion with the man who had taken on the unenviable task of putting the Norwegian steel industry back on its feet.  I had also a long discussion with the Minister concerned.  The man I have referred to promised that before the end of the year he would come over and take a look at the operation on my behalf and give me what he believed would be a true and factual assessment of the situation and advice as to what he would do if he were given the responsibility for them.  He was not looking for any consultancy work or anything like that.  He was coming purely on the basis of assistance because there is a great deal of goodwill in Norway, in Norwegian industry and in the Norwegain Government towards development in Ireland and he was only too happy to spend a week or two over here and have a look at this. With the change of Government he may or may not have come.  I do not know.</P>
    <P>On my last visit to the US in October I met two senior vice-presidents of US Steel.  While they were throwing up their hands in anguish at the state of the steel industry, nevertheless they too said that whatever chance a steel mill had in the present state of the market, it was the modern steel mill that had some chance of success, provided costs and manning were right and marketing was strong.  I asked them if they would be interested in having a look at Irish Steel or any sort of joint package or joint venture, as I had mentioned in other areas also.  They said that in the present situation they would not, but they would be only too glad to provide any help or technical assistance that might help Irish Steel out of its present situation.</P>
    <P>I was prepared to go to any lengths to find out what the people in the market place felt about the future of Irish Steel, because the decision is a big one.  A great deal of taxpayers' money has been invested in Irish Steel, there is quite an <Col N="739" /> amount of expertise in the work force, and this is not a decision that anybody would take lightly as to where the future lies.  However, in this situation the Minister apparently is trying to put the gun to their heads and say, &ldquo;We are giving you the opportunity to borrow money to keep going and if there is not a drastic improvement in your company's performance between now and 31 December it looks as if all is up for you&rdquo;.  That is an impossible position to put Irish Steel into.</P>
    <P>I have outlined the areas that would help them in their efforts to become competitive, such as a reduction in their ESB charges of 40 per cent to put them in line with their competitors, and maybe a reduction in the charge for gas although probably that is not a major factor.  I have mentioned the consultants' views that I am aware of in relation to the manning levels, comparatively speaking with their competitors in the market place.  The whole area must be looked at to see what can be done to improve it.  Apparently the Minister is not taking any steps within his power or the power of the Government to improve that situation and to give Irish Steel the opportunity of improving themselves.  He is putting them in the position that they will not be able to improve themselves and, furthermore, more and more taxpayers' money will be lost in the process.  If, as it appears this Government have made up their minds in principle to close Irish Steel, then they should have the moral courage and honesty to come out and say so and not give them any more money.  However, the Minister is not saying anything one way or the other.  He is saying that if the EEC have a decision by 1 July the Government are not bound to go along that road.  They have their options open. All they say is that, unless performance dramatically improves between now and 31 December, they do not see much future for Irish Steel.  That is postponing decision day.  The Government have been in office for six months and have had the opportunity to study all the facts. They should be in a position to make up their minds and give a decision.  Coming in here with the minimum of information <Col N="740" /> is not becoming to a Minister who talked so much about Dáil reform, the effectiveness of this House and what we should and should not do.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount of taxpayers' money involved.  The losses this year will be somewhere in the region of £21 million.  How does that line up with the corporate plan which the company had this time last year?  The cost of closure &mdash; £100 million &mdash; was mentioned. Are these the consultants' costs, the company's costs or the Minister's costs? Could we have a breakdown of figures? It would be interesting to know what size of redundancy payments we are talking about.  We heard last week, in a different debate, that they were being offered a half week's pay for every year of service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Was this figure mentioned to prove that it is as cheap to keep Irish Steel open as to close it?  I do not know whose figures they are and it is a bit naive to come in here and toss a figure of £80 million or £100 million at us.  We are entitled to more information.  The Minister and the Government should think very seriously about what they are doing here.  They are tying a noose around the neck of Irish Steel.  They are not taking the necessary decisions to enable Irish Steel to prove themselves in the market.  This is an efficient, modern plant and surely the percentage of the market that Irish Steel needs is so minimal that there must be every reason to believe that marketing experts can be found to sell it?  If not, one must seriously question the ability of the management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another way into the market &mdash; piggy back on another firm who have entry into the market.  That is a well known phrase and it is a very common practice.  The way to break into highly competitive European markets is to get a joint venture in the marketing area with a stronger company.  There are markets for very heavy components that could marry the marketing of Irish Steel products which are minimal in relation to <Col N="741" /> the total market place.  The production of Irish Steel could be geared to tie in with a very strong company in that market. I do not know whether this has been tried but it is one of the areas I would have pursued if I had remained in office because it is a successful way forward for many companies who are weak in the European market.  Has that course been tried and, if so, with what result?  There is always a small opening in the market which can be exploited by an aggressive marketing team.  What segment of the market are Irish Steel going for?  What has been the result of the joint venture with the French company, especially since they have been nationalised?  Have any approaches been made for a joint marketing operation or a piggy back operation with another company?  Has the Minister taken any decisions in relation to production costs to make them more competitive?  Has he any intention of reducing ESB costs which are 40 per cent higher than those of competitors?</P>
    <P>There was another assumption made by the consultants that there would be an increase of 10 per cent in prices over the July figure of last year and, furthermore, that there would be an allowance made in the projections of 2½ per cent rebate to allow Irish Steel marketing strategy to penetrate the market.  What has happened in relation to all those areas?  We must have the answer before we know whether the Government are right or wrong in what they are doing.  This is a holding operation.  We believe that approaches could have been made and that Irish Steel could have been directed on another road.  They have not been given that opportunity and all we have heard today is that another £25 million will be borrowed which will keep them going for this year.  There must have been more than one option in the consultants' report but we did not hear about them. Is the Minister saying that Irish Steel can be viable in 1986-1987 and, if so, on what does he base his assumption?  Are the company saying it?  Are the monitoring committee saying it or is it the consultants' view?  I should like to know the answer because, from what I recall, it will be a long time before they are viable, but <Col N="742" /> it is six months since I was in office and perhaps there is more up-to-date information. The Minister's decision is bad; he should have given the company State equity if he believed in their future or, if he did not believe in their future, he should have had the honesty and courage to stop borrowing for day-to-day expenses.  That policy is against what the Minister has been preaching since he came into office.  Perhaps it is the pressure from Cork Deputies that is forcing him to do this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is well known in Cork that a decision had been made by the previous administration which affected the future of Irish Steel.  That was reflected in a speech made by Deputy Reynolds early this year.  That is all I am saying.</P>
      <P>We are all concerned about the future of the Irish Steel work force.  That work force of 630 have gone through a traumatic time since 1977 or 1978, when the construction work started on the new mill.  The commissioning of this universal rolling mill took some time and everybody acknowledged that management and work force went through difficult times with short-time lay-offs during the commissioning process.  The plant and its work force have come through that experience honourably.  The largest task then facing Irish Steel was to win back old markets and open up new ones.  However, this was during a recession, with a depressed market place.  Irish Steel found it difficult to gain a foothold once again in that market place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="745" /> At last, Irish Steel are progressing well with a highly versatile plant.  They have changed their galvanising sheet process to a more modern type which has resulted in a great advantage to our agricultural industry.  The 1982 loss amounted to approximately £22 million, but production was low because of the commissioning process.  The industry was also affected by the prevailing interest rates.  Productivity has increased between 1981 and 1982 from 9,000 tonnes to 61,000 tonnes. The Minister said that losses will continue up to 1985 and borrowings up to 1984 and that the continued borrowings will not solve the industries problem.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds mentioned energy charges.  From memory, costs for gas make up 3 per cent of the overall production costs and for electricity 20 per cent.  I have not had an opportunity to check out these figures and would ask the Minister to refer to this matter when replying.  Gas energy costs at 40p per therm are away above those charged to other industries here.  Would the Minister let us know what discussions have taken place with An Bord Gáis in relation to the price of gas and with the Electricity Supply Board in relation to their charges.</P>
    <P>Last year, in our debate on the 1982 Estimates, we dealt with the importation of steel, figures being produced in relation to importation from third world countries and the eastern bloc, Since then, a problem has arisen over the United States Government taking action against EEC countries in relation to the dumping of steel.  I would like to know what discussions have taken place since last year at Commission level in this regard, especially the importation of steel form third world countries.  Is there any way of stopping this importation of cheap steel? There may be reciprocal agreements in relation to other products.  This is an important issue and it is hard to explain to the Irish Steel work force why Argentinian and Far Eastern steel is used here.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that steel consumption had dropped by 1.2 per cent within the EEC over the last 12 months, whereas the worldwide demand has increased by 1 per cent.  If taken in isolation, <Col N="746" /> these figures are not too encouraging for the future of Irish Steel.  The Cork area as a whole has suffered over the last three years with the demise of many traditional industries.  A campaign has been waged in Cork in recent months alleging that this Government have commenced to downgrade Cork.  The people who make these allegations should remember that in my constitutency we have seen many traditional labour-intensive industries being run down over the last ten years.  The Government were not in power for much of that time.  We must remember that unemployment in Cork is above the national average and in that context I ask the Minister to take every step necessary to ensure the future of Irish Steel.</P>
    <P>The Minister should make the House aware of the exact position of Irish Steel. At what stage is the examination of the consultancy report?  Have any decisions been made?  The morale of the work force in Irish Steel is not great.  The introduction of this estimate, like last year's one, is merely a holding exercise.  We should try to give some encouragement to the work force.  There are indications that the world wide recession will be soon over and there will be a demand for steel and other products in the coming months. I appeal to the Minister to consider the future of Irish Steel.  I recognise that a cash injection must be given to keep the industry going.  I ask the Minister to give some form of encouragement to the work force in the near future.</P>

      <P>I thought Deputy Barry might have wished to avail of the floor before me.  I offered purely as a gesture to a Cork colleague and no more than that.  I welcome any assistance to employment in the Cork area.  Despite the limits which this Bill imposes on Irish Steel, I share my colleague's concern that there will be an extra burden placed on the company because of the financial interests repayments.  This is a company in the Cork area which, despite the weak efforts of the previous speaker to indicate to the contrary, is beleaguered and threatened by the attitude of the Government. I emphatically deny the suggestion <Col N="747" /> made by the previous speaker regarding decisions taken by the Government of which I was a member in relation to Irish Steel.  He was incorrect in his reference to what Deputy Reynolds said in Bantry. Deputy Reynolds said that it was his understanding that the present Government had taken the decision.</P>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his consideration to date about this industry.  I heard some of his outbursts when he was Minister for Finance.  He is obviously susceptible to strong right wing approaches.  I want to strenghten his arm to resist the current campaign being waged against some industries to which Deputy Allen referred.</P>
      <P>In the current issue of <i>Success</i> there is an article by Robert Merchant.  I want to steel the Minister's hand, if &ldquo;steel&rdquo; is the correct term to use in this debate about Irish Steel.</P>

      <P>I do not know what the Minister is referring to but if he wishes to draw me on tongue-in-cheek I will spend the next hour drawing his tongue and the Taoiseach's tongue in cheek.  I am endeavouring to assist the Minister because from what I hear the Minister may well be in a difficult position. I want to strengthen his hand.  The summary of the article states: &ldquo;The Irish economy dies of commercial cancer because our illustrious politicians haven't the guts to pick up the surgeon's knife.&rdquo; I respond to that by saying doctors differ and patients die.  They die from various diseases, surgeon's knife and otherwise. This article is one of a number of similar articles which I have read recently.  Many of them were inspired by the Minister when he was Minister for Finance.  They refer to the difficulties of State enterprises such as Irish Steel Holdings.  In Cork harbour we have a number of these industries and it is understandable that Deputies on all sides would endeavour to keep them.  I offer no apology to people like Robert Merchant who is obviously aiming his article at a readership who like <Col N="748" /> that type of line.  He states: &ldquo;But there is a large element of posturing in his recent statements&rdquo;&mdash; that refers to the Minister &mdash;&ldquo;which suggest he is not half the man that Mrs. Thatcher is&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Let me finish. &ldquo;If Bruton could nationalise Clondalkin within a matter of weeks in response to political pressure, is there any reason to believe he has the guts to take on the three white elephants that underpin Cork's tottering economy &mdash; Whitegate, NET &mdash; Marino Point, and Irish Steel&rdquo;. That is unfair and terrible journalism.  I do not deny the gentleman's entitlement to print that.  As a politician I have the right to defend the political approach.  He has taken a completely economic approach to it, one of financial rectitude and getting the arithmetic right.  However, there are other issues involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister spoke about the fact that earlier this year the Minister for Finance invested a further £5 million in the share capital of Irish Steel.  He stated that in addition the company have recently negotiated a loan facility for £3 million and are now in the process of negotiating further borrowing amounting to £17 million to cover their requirements until early 1984.  This is the kind of inconsistency that has prevailed in relation to Irish Steel, not only this year but for quite a while and it does not help the company in their present loss-making situation. The Minister has told us that their losses amounted to almost £23 million at the end of June last and that their estimated losses for this year are of the order of £21 million.  I should like the Minister to tell us what the interest charges are within that loss-making situation.  If we are to have regard to the figures given here, the borrowings will increase by £20 million in terms of the company's present requirements. Obviously, this will contribute to the loss-making situation.  It is the sort of situation that has hindered the development of Irish Steel in the present very difficult European situation.  I was the Minister with responsibility for social affairs when Luxembourg, because of its <Col N="749" /> heavy dependence on the steel industry, and France to a lesser degree, suffered very big redundancies and cutbacks in production because of the problem of the world steel market.</P>
    <P>I support Deputy Allen when he says that we have been somewhat too kind in the area of imports from places that are of little assistance to us.  This situation hinders companies such as Irish Steel. The company employ 630 people.  From long before the time I entered political life I have been associated with the company. During the major development of Haulbowline Island in the mid-sixties my work involved me in almost daily contact with Irish Steel.  A year or two later the bridge was built which linked the island to the mainland of my constituency.  I know personally a very big proportion of the work force at Irish Steel.  I know also many of those who were employed there but who have lost their jobs.  Among those were many fathers of families who were the only wage earners in their families. Obviously, there are a large number of people depending on the 630 people remaining with the company.  In addition there are a big number of service jobs depending on that industry.  I am sure the Minister will agree with me that one service job per one production job is a conservative ratio in this connection.  In all, 1,300 jobs are dependent on Irish Steel in the Cork area.  This is why it is extremely important that we make every effort to protect employment there especially having regard to the very depressed employment situation in Cork.  The May figure in this respect for the city and county region is 19,100.  That is the biggest problem facing us whether we are in Government or in Opposition.</P>
    <P>This is not the time for talking about examinations.  Our young people have their own pressures and problems in that regard during this month but let us talk about the people of my generation who depend on Irish Steel for their livelihoods. These people would find it extremely difficult to find alternative employment.</P>
    <P>The question of Irish Steel has been before this House on many occasions.  I accept that Mr. Justin Keating, as Minister <Col N="750" /> for Industry and Commerce, was the one who first sanctioned the plans in 1977.  His decision is referred to in a rather derogatory way in the article I have mentioned.  Our Government in 1979 made the moneys available.  There had been delays in the intervening periods.  We now have a very modernised and up-to-date mainland plant, one which I am confident can contribute to our economy if given a reasonable chance.</P>
    <P>When we talk about losses we must ask ourselves what exactly we are talking about.  Interest charges are a major problem where capital investment is concerned. Must we find a new way forward for setting up our State and public companies? We must look for possible alternatives though I accept that these may be few because of the way in which the money market is governed.  On the other hand, there is no investment indicated in this Bill for Irish Steel.  Deputy Allen referred to a cash injection but what the Minister says is that he is allowing the company to borrow further.  I welcome that for the reasons I have stated but I am concerned that it is too short a term and that we are placing an added burden on the company that will make it more difficult for them to achieve positive results and will be grist to the mill for the sort of article I have referred to.  For management to be attacked continuously in the way in which they are attacked in that article is not good because it has an effect on their morale and ultimately on the company and on the most important aspect of it which is the maintenance of employment.</P>
    <P>Cork Deputies of both Labour and Fine Gael trooped through the lobbies last week to vote against a Private Members' motion tabled by us in an effort to have orders placed with Verolme Cork Dockyard.  I do not wish to move Private Members' motions here regarding Irish Steel but I urge my Cork colleagues to be careful and to keep pressure applied on the Minister in order to ensure that none of his Cabinet colleagues harbour bad ideas about Irish Steel.  We have a commitment to the Cork Harbour industries <Col N="751" /> and we will continue to have that commitment.</P>
    <P>The Minister concluded his statement by saying that:</P>
    <P>Irish Steel now have a very modern and versatile plant and have commissioned 65 of their intended range of 85 products.  As far as sales are concerned, the company have made substantial progress in the past year with the result that, in the year to 30 June 1983, the volume of sales is expected to be more than double that achieved in the previous year.  While this aspect of the company's performance is encouraging it must be pointed out that much more remains to be accomplished in relation to costs and prices and to further increases in sales if the company are to succeed as a viable and competitive producer.  The difficulties facing the company in the market place should not be under-estimated and the prospects for the international steel market simply cannot be viewed optimistically. In the interests of the taxpayer and the country as a whole both the Government and I will continue to keep the performance of Irish Steel under review.</P>
    <P>These are the sort of damaging comments that are undeserved so far as the hardworking management in some of our State companies are concerned.  There may be weaknesses.  No organisation is perfect, but these companies were set up for specific purposes.  They are going through difficult times.  The line of thinking enunciated by the Minister is permeating many Government Departments, many political minds and the minds of people who write articles such as the one I have referred to.  One would think from this article that all was perfect outside the public sector.  This is not and never has been the case.  There are mistakes in every sector but successes also and I welcome successes in any sector. There are references to a &ldquo;windy&rdquo; Taoiseach and I would be worried about his commitment to industries such as this.</P>
    <P>Irish Steel are ideally suited for inclusion in any extension of the Worker Participation <Col N="752" /> (State Enterprises) Act. During my period as Minister a review of that Act was being carried out and I am sure it is still in progress.  I look forward to supporting the Minister for Labour when the matter comes before the House.  I was complimentary earlier to the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, Justin Keating, but I would suspect that it was his strength pitted against the then Minister for Labour which prevented Irish Steel from inclusion in the list of enterprises covered by that Act.  They were in my opinion ideally suited for such inclusion because all their workers were in one location and I would urge the Minister to think seriously as to whether the advice given then was correct. Certainly I would question it.</P>
    <P>I know many people working in Irish Steel at all levels and their only concern is the future of steel.  They realise that their own personal well-being is tied up with the future of the company and they have a generous commitment to that company.  I am sure that it has some weaknesses, as have all organisations but the ideas of the workers could be channelled through to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Reynolds, probably made more progress in trying to curb imports than any other holder of that office during the past decade.  He made great efforts to prevent imports and foster import substitution.  Why do we take such a lenient view of imports which are damaging our own State enterprises and threatening jobs?  Why do we not adopt a more aggressive approach?  Let us look at France and Canada and see what they are doing.  There is an obligation on the Minister to continue the aggressive policy begun by my colleague, without much commitment from people in high places.</P>

      <P>I hope the Minister's commitment to stopping imports is more serious than those frivolous remarks would indicate.  A former Fine Gael Minister referred to this and many other industries as the frivolous industries of Cork Harbour.  I hope that sort of mentality is not still permeating through the Government.</P>
      <P>The number of employees in Irish Steel has reduced from a peak of 1,026 in 1972 to 630.  This represents a cut-back of approximately 40 per cent over a ten-year period and it lessens the opportunity of any further cut-backs without imposing severe hardship.  The average age of workers is much lower now because the older people would have been among those who became disemployed over the years.</P>
      <P>Irish Steel could only be improved by an inclusion in the worker participation legislation.  The vast majority of workers live in the immediate region and are interested in continued employment there.  I have had a number of meetings with the worker directors of other State boards.  Where there have been difficulties they may have been helpful in some way but certainly the scheme has not done any harm.  We are talking about Dáil reform.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been talking for some time about Dáil reform and I know the progress he has made to date and the commitment he has to it.  He is now introducing a temporary measure to enable Irish Steel to borrow further in order to maintain their position until early 1984.  I am entitled to ask what the Minister sees beyond that time. Deputy Reynolds has asked him already to spell out the contribution to losses represented by interest charges.  What is <Col N="754" /> the scenario?  I would ask the Minister to give a commitment to the continuation of Irish Steel.  He talks about £80 million or £100 million which it would cost to close the company and Deputy Reynolds has asked for a breakdown of that figure.  We must also consider the trauma caused by job losses.</P>
      <P>We raised the issue last week in a Private Members' motion on Verolme. Some progress was made, though we did not have the support of the Cork Deputies on the other side of the House.  I hope we do not have to resort to the same type of motion in regard to Irish Steel, that the Minister will help that company to make further progress, particularly in regard to the placing of orders.  I can assure him that he will have the full support of all Deputies on this side.  We hope the management will not find themselves beleaguered by comments of the sort I have referred to in articles which do not help managements, particularly when they are in a loss-making position.  That creates a climate of a certain type in regard to companies such as this and I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will agree that there is danger created by such a climate.</P>
      <P>I can tell the Minister that the closure of Irish Steel should not be contemplated. I am sure he is not thinking about it and I request him to fight his colleagues in the Government so that this company will be saved.  I appreciate that Fine Gael Deputies could not vote with us last week on the motion on Verolme.  I hope that motion succeeded in progress being made in getting that company some orders and, as I have said, I do not think we will have to resort to a similar motion on Irish Steel.</P>
      <P>Deputy Reynolds asked the Minister to clear some points arising from his opening statement.  For instance, it is not clear what the EEC will be taking on next July.  I accept that there is urgent need for this legislation.  The £20 million will keep the firm going.  I understand that the legislation must be enacted before the EEC decision on 1 July.  Is there some other angle&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We cannot afford to lose even one of these 630 jobs in Cork.  We heard about the need to curb imports, and Deputy Allen agreed.  I ask the Minister to look very closely at this. When we were in Government, the co-operation of the Ministers for Industry and Energy, Trade and Commerce, and the Environment, resulted in the setting up of a working unit to watch the use of imports in State enterprises and Government Departments.  This needs watching. This is extremely important particularly in the depressed building industry.  That industry needs further injections.  It is a great user of reinforced steel.  I do not make allegations because I do not have any special knowledge but we should guard against the use of imported steel in <Col N="756" /> the State-assisted construction and building industry, a big user of steel.  I am pleading for an industry which is particularly depressed in Cork.</P>
      <P>I have covered most of the points. However, I am appealing again to the Minister to be a little more positive.  I welcome this measure because it will help to continue employment in the company. I am concerned at the additional burden this further borrowing will place on the company, which I am afraid will further encourage or aggravate the attacks being made on it.  Therefore, the Minister has an obligation to spell out clearly how much of the company's losses are related to interest payments and how much interest payments will amount to in the coming year.  I am asking the Minister to say positively that he believes in the future of Irish Steel.  Whatever some of his colleagues might say around the Government table, the Minister will have our support, and the workers at Cork harbour will appreciate it.</P>

      <P>I firmly believe there is a future for this company.  I say that for several reasons.  It has the most modern plant of its kind in the world.  It has the advantage of being able to produce a range of 85 products, more than any other plant in Europe.  At the moment only 65 are being produced but the company is gearing itself for the full range of 85 products.  The company's sales record has been very good.  It is estimated that Irish Steel have doubled their sales in the past year.  That is very heartening for the people of the area.  In Cobh they have a very well-trained, skilled work force. They are a very responsible group of workers. What Deputy Reynolds seemed to be suggesting, not to give loan facilities of £25 million, would be ridiculous.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Members for their co-operation in dealing with this legislation.  Deputy Reynolds suggested that, rather than having the interest borne by the company through allowing them to undertake the loans, it would be better to give them equity.  The Deputy omitted to point out, although he is well aware of the position, that if the State gives the company equity the State will have to pay the interest on the money.  It is not as if the State has a budget surplus and could put money it has in reserve into Irish Steel from which it would not be paying interest.  Any money we would put into Irish Steel as equity instead of allowing them to borrow the money would be money on which the State would have to pay the entire interest.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;they will then be in a position to make a contribution towards the payment of the interest.  I do not see the distinction as starkly as Deputy Reynolds between equity and loan facilities.</P>
      <P>The idea of a piggy-back operation was suggested by Deputy Reynolds wherein they would market through somebody else or in co-operation with somebody else.  I am not sure whether the Deputy had in mind the arrangements that have been entered into with the French firm or something else.  The arrangements with the French concern are working reasonably well from the point of view of the sale of Irish Steel products in France. However, the French company have not been able to supply their products for sale on the Irish market from time to time.  That problem is not a major one. The arrangements are working reasonably well.  In fact, sales are not really the problem.  Sales are up in the year ending June of this year by 10 per cent in volume terms on Sofresid's projections but the unfortunate thing is that prices are down by 10 per cent on Sofresid's projections. What is going astray is not actual volume sales but the price one is able to get for them.  While sales are, to some extent, within one's own control in that one can go out and work hard to get business, but the going price declines due to a variety of factors most of which are external to Ireland &mdash; Ireland is only producing about 0.2 per cent of European steel &mdash; one is not in a position to do as much about that problem as one would be if it was simply a question of getting volume sales up and increasing the market share at a reasonable price level.</P>

      <P>Deputy Reynolds asked me to outline facts we do not know now but expect to know later in the year to enable us to make a decision that we cannot make now.  Two basic elements require to be examined.  First the possibility, which is the subject of active discussion, of reducing the energy costs paid by Irish Steel.  Reference has already been made in the debate to problems that exist in this regard.  Active discussions are taking place but, naturally, this has to be done in a way that is consistent with normal competitive practice in this market. Secondly, there is the question of sales.  It could be argued that what we will know about sales trends by the end of the year is not going to be immeasurably better than what we know now but it will be somewhat better.  We must recollect that we are dealing with a plant which is only gearing itself up to its production capacity; it is only producing 65 of the 80 products it is capable of producing at present.  It is a plant which is in the process of reaching its technical efficiency level and hence it is difficult to make a final decision on whether it will be able to meet viability.  That is the reason why we are engaged in what has been correctly described by Deputy Reynolds, and others, as a holding operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We should recollect that the problems Irish Steel face relate to a considerable underestimation of the cost of the project initially.  When the project was undertaken initially the estimated cost was about £40 million, including the initial working capital to get it going, but the actual cost turned out to be about £80 million.  A large part of the problem of Irish Steel is the interest rates being paid on the money that was borrowed to finance the extra cost over what was budgeted for building the plant.  I could spend some time dealing with the factors involved in that serious underestimation of the cost of this plant but I am not sure it would serve any great purpose at this point.</P>

      <P>We have to ensure that it does not happen again.  As Minister for Finance I initiated a measure which will be a contribution in this regard, the commissioning of a report on cost-overruns in major capital projects.  That report has been approved for publication and will be issued shortly.  It will provide new guidelines for State companies to help them avoid the type of overrun which can totally throw off course a project which, in the first instance might appear to be a reasonable bet although one can never be certain about any investment one is making whether it is in the public or private sector.  A project can cost twice what was budgeted for and a decision which might appear to have been a reasonable decision at the time can become a completely foolish decision in retrospect.  While it is impossible to unscramble the egg, we should learn from the lessons of Irish Steel, the IIRS building and other similar projects.</P>

This will ensure that company management and board must say what they hope to achieve over a period so that they can be tested against their own predictions.  I do not believe it is reasonable for the Government of the day to be the sole arbitrators on State companies' successes or otherwise.  State companies should become the arbitrators of their own success, setting out their targets in their annual reports and having to justify their achievement or non-achievement of those targets in the following years.  This approach will make a valuable contribution towards the improvement of performance by companies in the public sector.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned that further discussions are taking place in regard to energy costs and that we are monitoring sales to see how the company's performance can be improved, and I urge management and workers to make every effort to improve performance to the maximum extent in the period ahead so that the company's viability can be proved to the taxpayer, the person who ultimately has to put the money in or guarantee the loans being undertaken by the company.</P>

    <P>A number of questions were raised. Deputy Allen asked about imports from <Col N="762" /> third countries.  There have not been problems in this regard since last year when there were cheap Argentinian imports.  The EEC now have 14 steel agreements with third countries, determining quantities which may be imported from those countries.  We alone have not the capacity to prevent steel imports. This matter is basically regulated through the European Coal and Steel Community. However, as I indicated, arrangements have been made in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>A similar point was raised by Deputy Fitzgerald.  We are in the Common Market and the Community has given us substantial assistance towards building up the Irish Steel plant. The Community as a whole is trying to cope with the situation where there is very substantial over-capacity in the European steel industry.  As a new producer, it is in our interests to co-operate to the full in measures being taken by the Community to deal with the European steel industry in such a way that reasonable price levels can be obtained for steel. That can only be done by a major restructuring of the industry at European level and it is not possible to foresee good prices for steel without some considerable measure of success attending the Community's efforts to restructure the industry on a Europe-wide basis rather than in respect of Irish Steel alone.  Those are most of the points raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we put in equity all that happens is that the Minister for Finance pays the interest rather than the company.  As the money is being used for the operation of the company, it is more logical to have the responsibility for <Col N="763" /> meeting the interest resting with the company rather than with the taxpayer.  I do not see anything wrong about that.  It must be recognised that the borrowing, as a result of the statute we are passing here, is taking place with the benefit of a State guarantee and terms have been obtained for those loans which would not be as favourable if there were not a State guarantee.  It is not as if the company were not getting a considerable benefit by the passage of this legislation, because the guarantee allows them to obtain more favourable terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I failed to get a satisfactory response from the Minister on a number of points I raised.  The Minister says the company get better terms because of the State guarantee.  I put it to him that the State can borrow money at even better rates.  We all know that at the end of the day it is the taxpayer who will pay the bill.  What the Minister is doing is prescribing a slow, lingering death for Irish Steel and he has not the courage or the honesty to come out and say so.  He talked about niceties, overruns and so on.  I agree with him.  In my short time in that office I took action and tried to come to grips with some of the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One theme which runs through all these companies is that there appears to be an absence of a fixed price contract. The Minister did not say that if any of the money was recovered it would lessen the burden for Irish Steel.  Is any action being taken against the design people who carried out the work?  We all know the cost <Col N="764" /> doubled over what it was supposed to be, and this gave rise to borrowings, State equities and so on.  We have had no information on that.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned borrowing as a holding operation.  At the start I said it was a holding operation. Yet he admits that one basic assumption in the consultants' report and apparently in the company's own corporate plan, as I recall it, has not been realised in the first year.  I fail to see what further information he expects to get over the next six months which he has not got now, except that he will know whether the EEC are prepared to go along with the package he is now putting to them.  He failed to answer all the other questions.  He said there was a 10 per cent drop in sale prices, and a 10 per cent increase in volume.  As I recall it, production should have doubled from 37,500 tons to 75,000 tons in the first year.  There was no comment on that.</P>
    <P>I believe the £25 million we are talking about is a holding operation to give the Government an opportunity, at a different time and in different circumstances, to make the decision which I believe they have made in their own minds already, but they have not got the honesty to say so.  They are now about to do what they told everybody else not to do, that is, to borrow for current day-to-day expenses. If the company borrow, it looks better than having the State borrow, and this keeps the Minister's borrowing requirement down.  We all know that at the end of the day the taxpayer will pay.  It is a holding operation, and I look forward to a debate later on this year when I will be able to refer back to some of the things I said today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, before section 2, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;2. &mdash; This Act applies to a person (in this Act referred to as an &lsquo;offender&rsquo;) who is of or over the age of 15 years and is convicted on an offence for which, in the opinion of the court, the appropriate sentence would but for this Act be one of penal servitude, of imprisonment, of detention in Saint Patrick's Institution, or commital to an institution, but does not apply where any such sentence is fixed by law&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Second Stage I welcomed the Bill in general, despite some reservations I had on its limitations and the fact that it is not a total approach to the whole question of petty crime and juvenile delinquency. Our amendment proposes to reduce the age for eligibility for community service orders.  Since the minimum school leaving age is 15 years, and since 15 years is also the age at which the right to employment <Col N="766" /> is recognised, it is logical that community service orders should apply from that age.  The right to employment is recognised at the age of 15 years under the Protection of Young Persons (Employment) Act, 1977.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in my name is a separate amendment and reads:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 26 to 29, to delete all words from and including</P>
      <P>&ldquo;for which, in the opinion of the court,&rdquo; down to the end of the section and substitute the following &ldquo;in respect of which the court would be entitled to impose a sentence of penal servitude, of imprisonment or of detention in St. Patrick's Institution, but does not apply where any such sentence is fixed by law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Section 2, as drafted, means that the Bill will be applicable only where the courts have decided that it is appropriate to impose a custodial sentence on the offender.  This means it can be used only in more serious cases, or where the offender already has a bad record.  It means the Act cannot be applied in cases where the courts feel a suspended sentence or a fine is more appropriate than a custodial sentence, for example, in a case of larceny or burglary where small amounts of goods are involved, or in the case of a first offence.</P>
      <P>There are many instances where the courts might feel the offender ought to be punished or taught a lesson, but would baulk at imposing a custodial sentence they might otherwise wish to impose because of family circumstances.  For instance, the offender might have five children or elderly parents dependent on him or on her, and the courts would not want the offender to lose his or her job. In this sort of case the courts would probably value some intermediate punishment for a significantly large group of offenders.  I put down the amendment to give the clear option to the courts in cases where a lesser punishment might apply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As against that, the Bill provides that the offender must consent to a community service order.  It could be argued <Col N="767" /> that, faced with the choice of a community service order, a suspended sentence, or a fine, the offender would always opt against a community service order.  This point could be overcome if the courts were entitled to impose a suspended sentence in addition to a community service order.  Arguably there would be little or no advantage to an offender if he consented to a community service order.</P>
    <P>I put down this amendment in a spirit of trying to be helpful about the Bill and its future use.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  It must be borne in mind that the courts would be entitled to and would probably inquire from an offender whether he would consent to a community service order before indicating whether they were disposed to impose a custodial sentence, a suspended sentence, or a fine, in the event of the offender refusing such consent.  This would give a valuable flexibility to the courts.  I am concerned that otherwise the courts may be restricted in this to very serious cases, and the extent to which the courts could use this measure would be limited.  I put down the amendment in that context and I will be very interested to hear the Minister's views on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> On the amendment in the names of Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Mac Giolla, as a general rule persons under 16 years of age are not sentenced to detention in St. Patrick's, or to imprisonment and penal servitude. However, they can be committed to institutions under the control of the Department of Education.  In my view to accept the amendment would interfere with this, and I do not think the House should interfere with it at least until the whole area of child care comes before the House for consideration in the context of the Children Bill now being prepared by the Minister for Health.  The question of the proper way to dispose of a charge where the offender is under 16 years of age should more appropriately be considered in the wider context of the Children Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question arises: why pick 16 years of age?  Under English legislation the <Col N="768" /> minimum age is 17 years.  It is being reduced to 16 years as a result of their Criminal Justice Act, 1982.  The practice here is that St. Patrick's Institution caters for offenders between 16 and 21 years of age.  It suffers from serious over-crowding. Now, 16 years olds account for about a quarter of the committals to St. Patrick's, so there is a case for having the age 16 years rather than 17 years.  The suggestion in the amendment is that we should fix a lower minimum age.  As I pointed out already one of the objectives of the Bill is to reduce pressure on the prisons.  People under 16 years are not usually committed to prison.  They can be committed to schools under the auspices of the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>There will be another problem as well which is more of a general nature, that is if we were to pitch the age below 16 years it could raise a conflict with the spirit, if not the letter of existing legislation designed to protect young people in employment.  It would be difficult to have a situation where people under 16 were sentenced by the court, in effect to work, where there would be other provisions, the spirit of which would be to prevent young people from being in employment at too early an age.  I am opposed to the amendment for those reasons.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment in the name of Deputy Woods, to accept this particular amendment would be contrary to an important principle of the Bill.  The intention of the Bill is that community service should be an alternative to imprisonment or detention in St. Patrick's Institution, in the sense that a court should make a community service order only in a case where it feels it is its duty in accordance with proper sentencing practice to pass a sentence of imprisonment or of detention in St. Patrick's.  That is to say the offence must have been of such gravity that in the ordinary way a custodial sentence would have been called for.  This idea is brought out by the provision in section 2 that the court may make a community service order where in its opinion the appropriate sentence would otherwise have been a custodial sentence.</P>
    <P>The amendment would abandon this important requirement.  If the amendment <Col N="769" /> were adopted the mere fact that the offence could in law be punished with a custodial sentence, however trivial the offence was, would enable the court to make a community service order.  For example, the court might consider that the case is one that could be sufficiently dealt with by a fine or by probation.  In that event, it would be quite inappropriate that the court should make a community service order.  I do not mean to suggest that if the amendment were adopted the courts would act in a arbitrary way in exercising their new power. I have no doubt that the higher courts would, if necessary, lay down guidelines in this respect.  I should expect that the guidelines would be very much in line with the text proposed in the section.  At any rate that is what I hope they would do.  It makes it all the more desirable that the guidelines should be laid down in the Bill itself.</P>
    <P>I understand that the laws originally introduced in England allowed freedom to judges to implement community service orders as a sanction in general as a substitute for fines, suspended sentences or probation.  One of the objects of the Bill is to relieve pressure on the prison system.  One of the objects is that an alternative sanction would be available to the courts which they would exercise instead of sentencing somebody to prison.  If it were simply another sanction which could be implemented freely instead of probation, fines or a suspended sentence, there might be a tendency that many people who are now dealt with by means of fines and other sanctions would be put on community service orders. Obviously, community service orders will have to be operated and controlled by the probation and welfare section of my Department.</P>
    <P>One of the principles in the Bill is that it would be an alternative to a prison sentence.  In situations where somebody is before a court, where the normal practice would be to sentence somebody to imprisonment there is an alternative there, with the consent of the offender, to go on community service order.  Quite obviously, it has other advantages.  It would be a misunderstanding of my position <Col N="770" /> to say that this is the only reason why the Bill was introduced.  There are far wider considerations in community service orders than relieving pressure on prison space.  It is a consideration. Deputy Woods raised the matter of consent. I do not believe that a community service order would operate without the consent of the offender.</P>

      <P>In replying to my amendment looking for lowering of the age, the Minister referred to the possibility that as a result of lowering the age this could bring us in conflict with the spirit of the Protection of Young Persons Act.  I already made the point that the 1977 Act places the eligibility for work at 15 years of age.  In effect, our amendment would not be in conflict with that.  I whole-heartedly agree that many young people are working at 15 years and even younger in breach of the law.  These people should not be working and should be on some educational or training courses.</P>
      <P>The other point I would like to make is that our party have a further amendment down seeking to offer a choice to the courts either to require those people to do community service or to require them to involve themselves in an educational course or a training course under AnCO.  The two amendments are linked in that way.  I am surprised at the Minister's admission that one of the purposes of this Bill is to relieve the prison system. I understood it would certainly have that effect but I was not aware that this was one of the purposes of the Bill.  I am a bit unhappy that that is a purpose rather than an effect.  I assume that we are trying to find a more humane and progressive way of dealing with offenders rather than simply trying to relieve the State of the need to keep people locked up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister raised the question of fines and he said that in the United Kingdom there was originally an allowance for such orders instead of fines.  That is not suggested in the amendment. It is stated in the amendment:</P>
      <P>in respect of which the court would be entitled to impose a sentence of penal servitude, of imprisonment, or of detention in St. Patrick's Institution...</P>
      <P>It is quite clearly specified that we are talking about cases where the court would be entitled to apply such sentences. Apparently the situation is that quite often the court is left in the position that it has to apply custody, on the one hand or, on the other hand, to go to the other extreme and just apply the Probation Act, a fine or something else.  Therefore, in a case in which the justice would be entitled to impose a sentence, he would not then have the flexibility instead to make a community service order.  I appreciate the point the Minister makes in relation to not creating too many of these community service orders, but surely this is something that could be regulated.  There is another section dealing with that: that the court must satisfy itself that the wherewithal is available for such orders to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said that one of the objects would be to relieve pressure on the prisons.  We should examine the object of introducing a measure which will be there as a workable and useful one for the courts, for the administration of justice, and not be unduly concerned with relieving pressure on the prisons. We must find the appropriate sentence or punishment for whatever may be the crime.  That should be our first objective. In any event I think there is a section which would cover the Minister in regard to a flood of community service orders before he was ready to take them.  Therefore it would be important that there be this group in between.  Certainly my intention was not to replace fines with community service orders.  As is clearly stated in the amendment, the court would <Col N="772" /> be entitled to impose a sentence of penal servitude, of imprisonment, of detention in St. Patrick's Institution but, the court would have the option of introducing a community service order.  That is the basic point.  There is an element in between the case of just having a fine, on the one hand, and imposing a sentence on the other.  It is in that area I wanted to provide the flexibility for the court, that where they would be entitled to impose a sentence they could instead apply a community service order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Deputy De Rossa was quite right in pointing out that there is not a conflict between the letter of existing legislation designed to protect young people in employment but I suggest there is a conflict with its spirit. If one allows a court to impose what are, in effect, sentences to work at 15 years of age then the attitude to young people working could change in the community.</P>
      <P>One of the objectives of the community service orders is to divert people away from the prisons and from St. Patrick's Institution.  15-year-olds, under sections 102 and 103 of the Children Act, 1908, may be committed to prison for short periods but only if they have been certified by the court as being so unruly or depraved that they cannot be kept in special schools.  Such committals account for approximately 1 per cent of prison committals.  Most 15-year-olds are committed to special schools where the emphasis is on education and it would be proper that that practice would continue. The Deputy made the point that he has another amendment down and I should deal with the points he raised on it when we come to dealing with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill is to introduce another set of sanctions which in certain particular cases would be more effective, appropriate and humane to the offender involved.  Obviously there are cases where a community service order could be worked at weekends or during holidays. Consequently this would be of benefit to somebody who would be in fulltime education.  The 16- or 17-year-old in school, who is in court and in respect of whom a prison sentence might or could <Col N="773" /> be appropriate, would in a sense be doubly punished in situations in which he would be deprived of his education as well.  Community service work can fit in very well with somebody in fulltime training or education.  I do not see any conflict between the obvious desire which I and many others have to reduce the pressure on places in the prison with the main principle of the Bill which, as the Deputy so rightly pointed out, is to introduce another set of sanctions which may be more appropriate and humane in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I have drawn attention previously to the serious situation obtaining in our prisons where last year 1,200 offenders were shed from the system.  It is quite clear also that some people are committed to prisons now where, for example, a community service order would constitute a far more appropriate sanction.  Whether one contends that this constitutes one of the major beneficial side effects of the Bill or that it constitutes the purpose of the Bill is really to engage in semantics because the two are interlinked.  If a community service order is more appropriate and humane and also has the consequence of not committing a young person, for example, to St. Patrick's Institution, certainly it will also have the effect of exerting less pressure on prison places and creating the availability of prison spaces for more serous offenders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods thought I may have misunderstood the purpose of his amendment. The point I am making is that the mere fact that the offence could in law be punished with a custodial sentence, however trivial the offence was, would enable the court to make a community service order if the Deputy's amendment was adopted.  Quite frequently now a court will deal with a matter which could be punished with a custodial sentence by fining persons, putting them on probation, or by a suspended sentence.  If the Deputy's amendment was adopted it is not that a judge would in every case decide that he was making a community service order instead of a fine.  Part of the purpose of the Bill is to give another sanction which is an alternative to imprisonment and not an alternative to fines, <Col N="774" /> putting somebody on probation, or giving somebody a suspended sentence.  There are alternatives available to the courts already.  The suggestion is that this would constitute another alternative that would be available.  It would be much more beneficial both to offenders and to our system of justice, and indeed to the prisons, as I have said already, if it were operated as drafted in the Bill, where a community service order would be an alternative in a situation in which a judge had decided that an appropriate sanction would be a prison sentence.  Otherwise there is the difficulty that community service orders may be used in situations in which now somebody would be fined, put on probation or given a suspended sentence, and that is not the purpose of the Bill.  Its purpose is that it would be an alternative to a prison sentence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's point that it would act as an alternative to a prison sentence.  As I understand it, the courts often find themselves in a situation in which they would have this option of a prison sentence.  Probation would be too light a sentence, a fine, in the particular circumstances, might be too much, bearing in mind the person's financial circumstances, and, as an alternative to imprisonment, a community service order would be more appropriate in some of theses cases.  That is the kind of case I am trying to get at.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>While investment in agriculture declined in real terms after 1979 because of the recession, the fact remains that during the decade 1971-1980 total capital investment in agriculture amounted to some £2,700 million.  This substantial amount of investment largely reflected a catching up process from very low levels of investment in the pre-EEC era and as a result of it many farmers are now well-equipped to benefit from any <Col N="779" /> upswing in the farming sector without recourse to further heavy investment.</P>
      <P>A key element of capital investment is investment in breeding stock and to a large extent investment in buildings, land and machinery is influenced by changes in breeding stock numbers.  It is, of course, a prime aim of Government policy to increase the breeding herd and various measures to achieve this are already in operation.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen the findings referred to and I welcome this as further evidence of renewed development in the dairy industry.</P>
      <P>The question of product diversification is primarily a matter for the industry itself.  Investment aid towards diversification of processing facilities is available from the Industrial Development Authority and, in certain circumstances, from the Guidance Section of FEOGA as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister admit that the effort at diversification of dairy products has been less than adequate? For example, our effort at marketing Irish cheese has been a dismal failure.  A comparison of the ranges of cheese in Europe and their presentation shows the amount of leeway we have to make up.  With those figures would the Minister accept that it is essential that we diversify rather than, as at present, increase the emphasis on butter making?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree fully with the Deputy.  He is absolutely correct.  It is the major problem facing agriculture in this country, and facing particularly the agricultural processing sector.  We suffer from a gross restriction on diversification, but it is up to the industry itself to do it.  It astounds me on going abroad to see the number of different varieties of dairy products which are available and then to see the restricted number in this country.  Some firms in this country are attempting to diversify.  It is a very costly exercise, but I would agree with everything the Deputy has stated.  There is a greater need for it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first part of the question is in the negative.</P>
      <P>The Greyhound Industry Act, 1958, provides for the control of coursing by the Irish Coursing Club, which operates under the general control and direction of Bord na gCon, and is responsible for enforcing the rules for the proper conduct of coursing meetings and for the protection of hares.</P>

I am assured by the Hare Coursing Club that they are taking every possible measure to ensure that there is no undue cruelty. Nevertheless, as the Deputy has stated, there is very great concern among people here and in other countries about the element of cruelty involved.

      <P>Imports of the main cereal substitutes from third countries are governed by EEC rules and arrangements including agreements negotiated by the Community with the supplying countries. The import duties on the main substitutes are bound by the Community under the GATT.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the effect of the substitutes on the market for Community grain, the Community has negotiated voluntary restraint agreements with the main supplying countries.  Within the limits <Col N="800" /> imposed by these agreements, it is a matter for traders throughout the EEC to decide on the quantities of substitutes which they import and I am not empowered to impose additional unilateral restrictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know how the Deputy can interpret my reply in that way.  There have been restrictions on the amounts of the concentrates being imported from third countries.  I might point out also that the total amount of cereal substitutes imported into the Community annually is 16.5 million tonnes. We import a reasonable proportion of that total&mdash;600,000 tonnes.  As a result of talks which the EEC has had with third countries supplying these concentrates, there has been a cutback on the amount of the imports into the EEC.  We are pressing for further restrictions on these imports and we made that point at the recent negotiations in Brussels.</P>

      <P>An existing facility of £100 million under the Exchange Rate Guarantee Scheme remains in operation until 1985.  Funds from this facility are available for relending to farmers according as earlier loans are partially or totally repaid.  Consideration of the introduction of any new facility must have regard to experience in connection with the present scheme and to the potential liability for the Exchequer.  As I indicated in the Dáil on 26 January last it is estimated that the present scheme will cost the Exchequer between £20 million and £25 million in return for which farmers will have obtained variable and uncertain interest rate benefits.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have expressed their concern about the fate of the three members of the African National Congress who are currently under sentence of death in South Africa.  Ireland has appealed for the commutation of these sentences at the United Nations, both at the General Assembly and in the Security Council.  On 7 December 1982 Ireland supported the adoption by the Security Council of a resolution calling on the South African Government to commute the death sentences.</P>
      <P>Yesterday, the Security Council adopted a further resolution, Resolution 533, expressing grave concern about the decision of the South African authorities on 6 June to refuse executive clemency in respect of three members of the ANC, and calling on the South African authorities to commute the death sentences.  We fully support this resolution.</P>
      <P>Ireland does not have diplomatic relations with South Africa.  Nonetheless, we and our partners in the EEC are deeply concerned about these sentences and we have been co-ordinating our actions in urging clemency.  In fact, Ireland, for its part, earlier today urged further action by the Ten on the lines suggested in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>I hope that the South African authorities will now heed the many calls for clemency from all over the world so that the lives of these three young men may yet be spared.</P>

Is he aware that the three people concerned left South Africa in 1976 as a result of the massacre in Soweto?  Is he aware they have pleaded not guilty to these charges, that they were tortured by electric shock and that the confessions extracted from them were accepted by the judges?  Does he agree that this is a question of human rights against racism?  I am sure the Minister will agree that in international affairs South Africa stands apart from all other <Col N="807" /> nations, irrespective of ideology, and that it is most important that Ireland as a neutral country should play its part through the EEC to try to ensure that these executions will not take place.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 2, lines 26 to 29, to delete all words from and including</P>
      <P>&ldquo;for which, in the opinion of the court,&rdquo; down to the end of the section and substitute the following &ldquo;in respect of which the court would be entitled to impose a sentence of penal servitude, of imprisonment or of detention in St. Patrick's Institution, but does not apply where any such sentence is fixed by law&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We were discussing the contents of this amendment before the break.  The Minister has told us that the purpose of the Bill is to provide community service orders in serious cases.  The courts should have the flexibility to make such orders in cases where they would be entitled to impose sentences.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was anxious that community service orders would not replace a fine or an order putting an offender on probation.  I was anxious to make the point that in certain instances probation is too light a penalty &mdash; we have had instances of that in recent times &mdash; and a fine may not be appropriate when the financial circumstances of the defendant are taken into consideration. In such a case a court should have the option of making use of a community service order.  I appreciate the Minister's point, that he does not wish to replace fines or probations with community service orders but there are many cases where a court has to pass a sentence which it does not want to impose, or release a defendant on probation.  The courts would welcome being able to apply a community service order in such cases. My amendment sought to meet that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is concerned that there may be too many community service orders and he stressed on a number of <Col N="906" /> occasions that he wants such orders for the more serious offences.  As far as the more serious offences are concerned custodial sentences should apply but orders should apply to offences that are not so serious.  The courts should have flexibility for the area in between and the Minister can rely on them to use their discretion. The Minister has the safeguard in that no order can be made unless it is clear and it can be carried out.  The amendment covers a substantial area and because of that it would be a valuable addition to the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I have substantially dealt with the point, that where a law provides for a prison sentence it usually provides for an alternative to that sentence, a fine. The intention in the community service order is that it would be imposed as a sanction, as an alternative to a prison sentence.  The risk I can see in accepting the amendment is that it would be used as an alternative to fines, or probation orders.  As a result it would not fulfil one of the needs for which the Bill will cater. I should like to draw the Deputy's attention to Community Service Orders by Warren Young, in which he stated:</P>
      <P>If, for example, the community service order is used often as an alternative penalty to a fine, or as a rehabilitative measure in lieu of a probation order, but at the same time a custodial sentence is regularly being imposed for breach, the result could easily be an increase rather than a reduction in the population of penal establishments. There is, indeed, some suspicion that that is precisely what occurred following the introduction of the suspended sentence in 1967 (Sparks, 1971; Radzinowicz, 1971).  Ambivalent policies can produce consequences which satisfy no one.</P>
      <P>It is because of the logic of that argument that I oppose the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I place my trust and confidence in the courts in the operating of such orders.  I accept the point the Minister has made about the risk of them <Col N="907" /> becoming alternatives to fines.  I am aware of the dilemma the Minister faces in practical terms in relation to this.  I would rather have orders available for cases where a court may not have any alternative but to opt for probation or a sentence although the court would prefer to have an intermediate step.  A considerable amount of sentencing occurs in that intermediate area.  I appreciate the Minister's concern and, having made the point clearly, I will leave the matter at that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> If a judge finds himself in a situation where it would be a fine on the one hand or a prison sentence on the other and if he thinks a prison sentence is an appropriate sentence in the case then he can use a community service order instead of a prison sentence.  What is in the Bill substantially meets the point the Deputy has raised.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3.</P>
      <P>In page 3, to delete lines 1 to 4, and substitute the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2) A community service order shall require the offender to:</P>
      <P>(a)  perform in accordance with this Act unpaid work for such hours as specified in the order and are not less than 40 and not more than 240;</P>
      <P>or</P>
      <P>(b)  attend at an educational course approved by the Minister for Education, or a training course approved by the Minister for Labour, for such time and under such conditions as the court may decide.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amendment seeks to expand the idea of a community service order by adding a subsection to the effect that a community <Col N="908" /> service order shall require an offender to perform unpaid work for a specified number of hours or attend an educational course approved by the Minister for Education or a training course approved by the Minister for Labour for such time and under such conditions as a court may decide.  I am moving the amendment in the knowledge that most of the offenders who appear before our courts are young people.  In most cases they are under-educated, left school at an early age or, more often than not, are unemployed.  We felt it would be an advantage to them and to society if the courts were in a position to recommend them to training or educational courses. It is not necessary that the courses should be full-time day courses because the VEC organise a wide range of courses that could be utilised.  It would be better if such people attended courses run by the VEC or AnCO and obtain a skill rather than did what might turn out to be menial work under a community service order. We are anxious to broaden the scope of the order requiring people against whom a community service order is made to pursue an educational or training course where the courts consider such courses would be beneficial.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am opposed to the amendment which would enable the courts to order an offender to attend an educational or training course as an alternative to ordering the offender to do some unpaid work for the community. The amendment presumably envisaged that the offenders would have to consent to attending these courses.  The offender is already required by section 4(1)(b) of the Bill to consent to the making of an order.  If an offender genuinely wants to continue his education or undertake further education or training then he has nothing to fear from the Bill because it already provides in section 7(3) that directions given by a supervising officer in regard to community service order shall so far as practicable avoid any interference with the offender's attendance at school or other educational or training establishment.  If the intention of the amendment is to enable the courts to <Col N="909" /> compel the offender to attend such courses, I think as a matter of policy this would not be desirable.  This is the view of many people whose function it is to provide such courses.  They take the view that the element of compulsion destroys the necessary motivation which is essential for any success in the field of education.</P>
      <P>As the law stands the courts may take into account the offender's educational or training requirements.  If the offender wishes to pursue an educational or training course the courts may put him on probation.  For this purpose a probation order is more appropriate than a community service order.  The ethos of a probation order is to try to keep the offender out of trouble for the duration of the order.  The role of the supervising officer, the probation officer, is to befriend the offender and to encourage him to do whatever is necessary for that purpose, at least for that period.</P>
      <P>This Bill is designed to ensure that offenders who would otherwise be committed to prison carry out unpaid work on behalf of the community as a penalty &mdash; and I stress the fact that it is as a penalty.  I do not think it would be appropriate or desirable to include in this Bill any sanctions which do not have this effect.</P>
      <P>The point I am making is that it would not be desirable to force people to attend training or educational courses because they would lack motivation to benefit from them.  On the other hand, if their consent is given a judge can implement a probation order and under the Probation and Welfare Service a young offender can attend the type of course the Deputy has in mind.</P>
      <P>I am not accepting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Minister's point to a degree.  However, the element of compulsion does not come into it.  The Bill makes it necessary for the offender to consent to the community service order in the first place.  It is not likely that anyone who has an order made requiring him to do work will do work which he is unwilling to do.  He may be as unwilling to dig a hole in the ground as to attend <Col N="910" /> an educational or training course.  It would be more beneficial for society and a young person &mdash; most people who come before the courts are young people &mdash; if he had acquired a skill rather than simply to have paid a debt to society.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned probation orders.  If the judge makes a probation order and the probation officer indicates that it would be of value for the person to attend an educational or training course, is the offender required to do so? Does he have free choice?</P>

      <P>My intention was to make it possible to have a community service order in addition to being bound to the peace for a specified period of time or to have a community service order in addition to a suspended sentence conditional on the offender's good behaviour for a specified period of time.  This could give flexibility to the courts.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In my opinion there would be no advantage and there could be considerable disadvantages in fixing up sentences in the way the amendment proposes.  Under the Bill as it stands the court makes a community service order on the basis that this is in all the circumstances a suitable alternative to a custodial sentence.  The offender then has a clear and definite prospect before him: either he performs the work, in which case that will be the end of the matter for him, or he does not, in which case he may be fined for the breach of the order or taken back to the court and punished for the original offence.  This is explained to the offender who knows exactly what his position is, in particular he knows that if he complies with the order he will not be in danger of being sent to prison for the original offence.</P>
      <P>This is the logical position given the principle that a community service order should be an alternative to imprisonment. If the court were to pass a suspended sentence of imprisonment as well as making a community service order in respect of the same offence and the offender were to fail to comply with the community service order, then since the breach of the order would itself be an offence the suspended sentence of imprisonment would presumably be activated. This would limit the discretion of the court before which the offender is brought for the breach of the order.  That court should obviously consider that is the right course to take in the light of the situation at the time when the offender is before it for the breach.  If, for example, he has worked satisfactorily for the greater part of the time, the court might well decide that a fine is a sufficient punishment for the breach.  Even if the court decides he should be dealt with for the original offence, it may consider he should be sent to prison for a shorter term than that specified in the suspended sentence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the offender during the currency of the community service order commits a fresh offence other than a breach of the order, he can in any event be prosecuted for that offence and no doubt the court <Col N="912" /> in considering sentence will take into account the fact that he was treated leniently for the early offence by having the community service order made against him instead of being imprisoned, and yet he failed to benefit from that leniency. Similar arguments apply to the proposal to enable the court to combine an order binding the offender over to keep the peace with the community service order except that in this case no period of imprisonment in default of compliance with the binding over order will have been specified in the original sentence.</P>
    <P>I am not accepting the amendment.</P>

      <P>The community service order might last only a limited number of hours which are specified &mdash; from between 40 and 240.  A person could be bound to the peace in addition for a period of two years or whatever.  Does the Minister not recognise that this could provide a degree of flexibility which the courts could find useful in certain circumstances?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not see any particular merit in it.  A community service order is a sanction which will normally be applied instead of a prison sentence.  If a community service order was not applied the convicted person would be sent to prison.  There is an element of seeking to punish somebody twice for the same offence in the Deputy's suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has to accept that a community service order is a lesser sanction than being sent to prison, or that in many instances it would be.  The Minister is talking about this new measure as a replacement for a prison sentence.  The community service order has to stand on its own.  The Minister is saying that, in addition to a community service order, the courts cannot bind a person to the peace.  Since the Minister accepted that the courts may have the option of applying a community service order instead of a prison sentence, why should the courts not have the option of binding a person <Col N="913" /> to the peace in addition to applying a community service order since the alternative measure will be there when the Bill is enacted?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I do not accept that a community service order is necessarily a more lenient sentence than a prison sentence.  The point I have been making is that it might be a more appropriate sentence in a given case.  A maximum of 240 hours work may be prescribed for somebody who is a full-time student or working full time.  This could involve somebody working eight hours every Saturday for 30 consecutive Saturdays. That could be much more severe than a month's imprisonment.  It could be equated with a prison sentence.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the argument that a community service order is a softer or more lenient approach in a scale of penalties. The argument I am putting forward is that it is an alternative sanction which will be available and, in the cases where it will be applied, it will be a more appropriate sanction in the circumstances, but not necessarily a more lenient one.  I come back to the point I have made already.  Since it is an alternative to a prison sentence I do not accept that something should be added on, like binding somebody to the peace.  That would imply an element of seeking to have two sanctions for the same offence when in effect, the community service order is conceived in the first instance as an alternative to a prison sentence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to be very careful about the use of words because as soon as I mention a word like &ldquo;lenient&rdquo; the Minister is likely to jump in, take up the word, and say that it is not lenient.  Being deprived of your freedom is the first element so far as prison sentencing is concerned. Not being put behind bars for most people would be a lesser form of punishment.  The order has to be related to particular kinds of sentences, and the courts will have to decide that, as appropriate. The community at large would be happier if they knew that under this new measure a person who has offended against the community could be bound to <Col N="914" /> the peace for two years, say, as well as having a community service order applied to him.</P>
      <P>I find it very hard to understand why the Minister cannot see this point.  The amendment is intended to introduce some flexibility.  It seems to me to be a valuable addition to the Bill.  I proposed the amendment in a helpful spirit.  My predecessor on this side of the House dealt with this Bill and the Minister's side of the House was involved with it as well. We are in general agreement on the Bill and its suitability.  This seemed to me to be a helpful suggestion on Committee Stage.  I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister is taking such a hard line on proposals made in a helpful spirit.  I believe the courts would be glad to avail of the option of binding a person to the peace in addition to applying a community service order.  If the Minister insists on not accepting any amendments, I will not press this any further.  There is no point in it.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The probation and welfare section of my Department will be implementing the community service orders scheme.  They work directly under the Department of Justice. The preliminary discussions necessary for <Col N="915" /> agreement have taken place and there is a willingness to operate the scheme.</P>
      <P>Section 14 provides:</P>
      <P>(1)  The Minister may make regulations for the purpose of giving effect to this Act.</P>
      <P>(2)  Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section may&mdash;</P>

      <P>(e)  provide for records to be kept of the work done under such orders.</P>
      <P>Section 14 enables the Minister to regulate the performance of community service orders.  The regulations will be drafted as soon as the Bill is passed. Between now and the coming into operation of the Bill, discussions will be conducted by the probation services and interested bodies.  A chief probation officer has been involved in this all along.  I am also considering the setting up of a small committee to monitor the work of the community service orders.  Any new scheme has teething problems.  There is a necessity to implement this scheme throughout the country at the same time so that similar sanctions will be available for all citizens in all areas.  There would be a difficulty if it were implemented on a pilot scheme basis.  The regulations will be drafted when the Bill is passed.  I am considering setting up a committee to take into account the points raised by Deputy Cosgrave, and similar points. Obviously we will learn by experience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A White Paper was published on this. <Col N="916" /> It outlined some of the different tasks that could be done under a community service order.  There were responses to the White Paper.  In August 1981 the Probation and Welfare Officers Branch of the UPTCS replied.  Various other people replied and made submissions on the White Paper.  While I take the general point made by the Deputy and I am aware of what he has in mind, I believe a combination of the drafting of the regulations and the consideration I am giving to a small committee to monitor the situation will meet the point.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have made proposals to the Department of the Public Service and there will be discussions on an increase in staff which will be required in the Probation and Welfare Service in order to implement community service orders.  As the Deputy is aware, when we came into office there was not an allocation in the Estimate for community service orders.  If I am to implement community service orders later this year, when the regulations are drafted and when the organisational work is done which will enable me to implement community service orders, this will have to be financed out of savings under some other <Col N="917" /> head in my Department.  The kind of money which I consider might be necessary to implement this later in the year might be between £80,000 and £100,000. I am not sure at the moment, with the progress of the Bill through the Dáil and later through the Seanad, the discussions which will have to take place and the drawing up of the regulations, at what exact point in the year I will be able to implement it even if there was money in the Estimate.  Money will certainly be provided in next year's Estimate for its implementation.</P>
      <P>Now that we are coming into mid-summer, with the Bill having to go through the Seanad, the organisational structure, which is a probation and welfare service around the country, has to be supplemented. Particular types of work and particular tasks in different areas have to be identified.  Consultations will have to take place locally with local voluntary groups. That kind of preparatory work can proceed. I know the Deputy understands the problem.  There will not be any reluctance to implement the Bill once it is passed, and money will be provided for it.</P>

      <P>We have pleasure in supporting this Bill and we wish the Minister every success in implementing it.  It is a new measure which is long overdue.  It will give greater flexibility to the courts in the administration of justice but it would be a mistake to regard it as a solution for the problem of prison space. We believe this problem will have to be tackled separately.  Since the Minister has spoken a lot about the possibility of using this instead of prison sentences would he review the situation in relation to holidays for offenders and make sure there <Col N="918" /> are suitable criteria adopted in such cases? We have recently seen some examples which would lead one to be a bit concerned about that.</P>
      <P>We regard this Bill as an overall programme for a general crackdown on crime.  We welcome it in that respect.  We also look forward to the Minister taking further action in relation to the police on the ground, community policing, the new legislative powers which are needed and the provision of adequate prison space which we believe will be necessary.  Notwithstanding the fact that this Bill will obviously relieve some prison space, there will still be a need for further prison space to be made available.  I hope the Minister will press the Government to allow him to proceed on those lines.  We welcome the Bill as a very useful measure.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I would like to thank Deputy Woods and the other Deputies who contributed today as well as on the Second Stage.  This Bill is one which many Administrations and a number of Ministers have had a hand in.  I am pleased to be able to bring it into the House with the co-operation of all sides of the House. It is not to be seen as a solution to the problem of lack of prison space.  The reopening of Loughan House and the opening of a new wing in Cork prison have provided extra prison space, as the Deputy is aware.  A combination of those two events and the implementation of community service orders will certainly improve the situation in a major way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take the point the Deputy made about holidays for offenders.  The main problem is the actual shedding from the system. The idea of a person being sent home from an open institution for 10 days or a fortnight and then having to come back and complete his or her sentence has been working reasonably well because the sanction of returning to the system is there.  The problem has arisen where people are completely shed from the system due to lack of prison space.  If the Deputy has any particular case in mind where the holiday scheme has broken <Col N="919" /> down or has given rise to concern I will check the particular case.  I accept, in the overall package in the fight against crime, that this is one portion of it.  It is a significant portion and I do not think it is to be under-estimated.  It is something new which has worked well in other countries. It is an alternative sanction to the courts and I believe it will help by providing a more appropriate sanction, a more humane sanction in many cases, and a more beneficial sanction for the offender and the community.  It will also help in connection with the pressure on prison space.</P>
    <P>I take the point made by the Deputy that it is part of an overall programme of policing, greater contact between the police and the community, higher visibility of police on the beat, and it is legislation which is necessary.  Certainly there is need for a major Criminal Justice Bill which would give extra powers to the Garda and which would deal especially with the problems of offences committed while on bail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to add a number of observations to what I said on this Bill last week.  Its essential aspect is that it affords, for the first time in any real sense, some degree of discretion to local authorities in relation to means of raising revenue.  Some effects of the provisions of the Bill have been either misinterpreted or misrepresented.  I submit to the House that, in essence, it is a very positive initiative in so far as it gives back some of the power taken from local authorities over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there has been opposition to the Bill on the basis that it is giving to <Col N="920" /> local authorities the power to introduce widescale charges which would be a burden on people.  In fairness one must look at the facts.  That kind of emotive talk simply is not in line with the true position. Total local authority expenditure for 1983 is of the order of £1,350 million. The total revenue to be raised under the provisions of this Bill will be of the order of £21 million.  It is a small price to pay for affording our councillors &mdash; and I am sure all of us would agree that by and large they have given the country good service &mdash; some degree of autonomy, some degree of responsibility.  Accordingly I welcome it without qualification or without equivocation.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that Members of this House have apparently changed their minds overnight with regard to this Bill. There is a very strong tradition, if you like, on all sides of this House of giving credit to local councillors and showing them some degree of gratitude for the work they have done.  But it would appear from what has been said recently that either we do not have confidence in our councillors &mdash; and I do not think that that lack of confidence in them as a body, if it is there, is justified &mdash; or else we are simply being deceitful.  I do not think there is any essential difference between any of the parties in this House on the measure, or if there is, it is going to be very difficult for the Opposition to explain repeated statements, written and otherwise, that they would introduce such a proposal.</P>
    <P>In essence this Bill is a good one because it affords local authorities some modicum of responsibility for their actions.  However, in passing, I would like to make a brief plea for a more widescale reform of local government.  If I had any regret about the measure it would be that it is not accompanied by some more widespread proposals.  Local government in Ireland at present &mdash; and many of us who serve or have served on local authorities will readily admit &mdash; is neither local nor central.  The financing of local authorities around which essentially this Bill revolves is intrinsic to such reform.  Therefore, there is some basis for arguing that this proposal, in a sense, <Col N="921" /> is being taken out of context, that it would be better had it been presented in a more comprehensive package of reforms about local government generally. However, I am consoled by the commitments of the present Minister and Minister of State in relation to real, radical and genuine reform of local government. If that reform does not come about gradually we will see more and more centralisation, more and more demoralisation at local level and eventually a local authority structure becoming increasingly irrelevant.  It is going in that direction at present.  That is the only qualification I would have about it, that it is not part of a package, but that is not a reason for condemning it <i>per se.</i></P>
    <P>We all espouse the cause of local democracy; for example we all assert that people should have more autonomy in relation to their welfare, in relation to events, situations, their environment locally but the structures do not exist by which to bring that about.  At present the local authority structure is creaking, it is antediluvian and warrants reform and overhaul.  I hope we shall see strong evidence of that within the next 12 months. The local elections next year will afford us an opportunity of having a much more widescale debate in that respect.  I would be very pleased indeed if, to some extent, those elections hinged on such proposals for radical reform of local government here.</P>
    <P>Until recent times there has been a tendency at local authority level to have some degree of power but without any great degree of responsibility, for example, I always felt uneasy about striking a rate which implicitly meant one was raising taxation without any input or indeed any responsibility for deciding from whom that money was to come or how it was to be raised.  The clear implication of the provisions of this Bill &mdash; which is very much in line with Government policy nationally and which is commendable in itself &mdash; is that from now on, if money is to be raised for certain specific services, then the councillors involved will have to indicate where it is going to come from. And they will have to take the sometimes unpleasant, difficult and politically <Col N="922" /> unpalatable decision to actually levy that charge.  That imposition of responsibility, that onus of responsibility is good for us all.  It is particularly good for local authorities who up to now had scant responsibility in that area.  It will sharpen their reflexes and their sense of responsibility in that respect.</P>
    <P>Interestingly enough, despite all the complaints that have emanated from a wide range of sources about the proposals involved, if one reads the literature in relation to the financing of local authorities or to local government reform generally, one will discover that there is a wide range of reference material supporting the concept of this Bill.  The Opposition have repeatedly inserted this concept &mdash; in White Papers, in 1972, in <i>The Way Forward</i>, which was their policy document in recent elections and, indeed, the former Minister, Deputy R. Burke, in this very House committed his party to the introduction of a Bill to charge local rates.  I think he was quite right and all I am asking of them today is to be consistent.  I do not deny that they may find that the Bill will have some technical deficiencies from their point of view &mdash; I am being a little charitable about that &mdash; nor would I deny them the right to visualise, envisage or conjure up some reason for finding a difference with the Government on this Bill.  But I should like to think that they would unequivocally restate what has been their policy in recent years and, in a nutshell, that is that the day of the free dinner is gone. From now on people will have to pay for services they get, and not by some kind of illusory, conjuring trick supported by massive foreign borrowing but by paying as we go.  That is a good principle.  It is a good principle for a child in its upbringing and is a good principle for the way local authorities conduct their affairs.</P>
    <P>I have a very high regard for local authorities and for councillors &mdash; I suppose I have a vested interest since I have been one since 1974 &mdash; but I honestly believe they do very good work.  The General Council of County Councils applied themselves to this thorny question of the financing and powers of local authorities.  In a report which they published <Col N="923" /> in January 1983 &mdash; in which the views of the vast majority of the parties, certainly all the larger parties, in this House were well and adequately represented &mdash; they stated clearly their view of what local authority financing should be. I should like to quote from that report where it is said:</P>
    <P>As the bulk of the finance is provided and controlled by central Government and as the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1978 has again controlled the balance being provided from local funds &mdash; the cumulative domestic increase allowed has fallen at least 10 per cent behind the rate of inflation and has led to a resulting cutback in the services provided.  The conclusion of the White Paper on Local Finance and Taxation was that the power of local authorities to levy and collect rates was the best system available suitable to improvement.</P>
    <P>The essence of that is that there is unease among local authorities at the tendency towards central funding which removes from them much of the responsibility and power which they consider should be theirs.  The report continued as follows:</P>
    <P>The following suggestions are made for that improvement:</P>
    <P>1.  The elimination of statutory demands placed on councils for items over which they have no control or alternatively the handing over of these functions but also the decisions relating to them to the Local Authorities, with adequate budgetary arrangements to cover these functions independent of other functions of the Council. .bqe</P>
    <P>That is a very reasonable demand.  It is quite extraordinary to ask local authorities, as has happened in my area, to support financially items such as the Special Criminal Court which is surely a national charge or, in some cases, to support national amenities depending on where the local authority is based.  Such charges are more properly in the area of central government funding.  The second suggestion in the report was as follows: <Col N="924" /> Charges to be levied for local authority services.  For example:</P>
    <P>(a)  Refuse collection, particularly trade refuse.</P>
    <P>(b)  Fees for planning applications.</P>
    <P>(c)  Fees for issuing licences including the issuing of local radio licensing which should be devolved to the local authorities.</P>
    <P>(d)  Charges for advertising space provided for local authorities.</P>
    <P>(e)  That rates remissions be carried by the Department of Social Welfare where the relieved are needy persons and by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce where the relief is an industrial incentive.</P>
    <P>The report also states that there should be charges for water supply in urban areas.  That is no more than ridding the country of an anomaly.  I speak as someone who represents an intensely urban area but I make no apology whatever for this Bill.  The General Council of County Councils earlier this year made it quite clear&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The report was issued under the aegis of the general council and the representational nature of the report is not in doubt.  It emanated from a process of consultation and deliberation set up by and presided over by the General Council of County Councils.  The report was written by one of their members, Seán Fitzpatrick from Mayo.  All I can say is that it reflects quite accurately the thinking of county councils generally.  It may not have the official stamp of endorsement as yet but I have not seen any reaction from any county council against it.  All I am trying to point out is that even those with the unpleasant task of imposing these decisions have said that <Col N="925" /> generally they are good proposals. County councils are composed of sensible people.</P>
      <P>This brings me to a major point to which the Opposition have not referred. If we raise revenue in this way clearly that same revenue will not have to be raised in another way.  In other words, if we raise the money on the basis of county, one may assume there will be less need to increase taxation or take other measures to make up the shortfall.  It is not as if we were adding a burden of taxation: it is simply a different system of raising the same revenue.  In 1975 I wrote a paper on local authority financing and in that paper I argued strongly for a more sensitive and more individually considered system of raising such funds.  I always felt it anomalous that the rates system which we abolished had no bearing on ability to pay but the tragedy was that when the system was abolished in 1977 we pretended the massive shortfall did not have to be made up.  To some extent that is the reason why we, as a country, are bailing water since then and will be doing so for some time.</P>
      <P>On the evidence before us it is wrong for the Opposition to cry havoc about this measure.  It was their proposal from the beginning.  Secondly, with regard to the burden that will fall on people, this has been widely misrepresented by some commentators.  However, I would point out it is not an additional burden but it is raising money in a different way which will allow for easing the burden elsewhere. Thirdly, from the evidence available to me in the document I have before me, it is obvious that local authorities do not have any fundamental objection to the proposals we are making.  Indeed, if their proposals are endorsed in due course, as I suspect they will be, they will go much further than what is proposed in this Bill.  When we consider that we are talking of raising a total sum of £21 million out of a total budget for the local authorities of more than £1,300 million, we will get some idea of the scale and significance of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Naturally there are concerns and anxieties about any Bill.  In some cases the concerns about this measure have <Col N="926" /> been sensible and moderate.  I read a submission from the Confederation of Irish Industry which put forward a sensible concern about certain aspects of the Bill and I am sure the Minister will pay attention to that concern.  However, I was very unhappy with the tone and content of comments made by ACRA, a body that purports to represent residents associations throughout the country.  I discussed this measure with one of their senior officers.  I took objection to the fact that their opposition was, in my view, extremely unreasonable, lacked balance and was a calculated provocation to break the law.  I do not care about the political cost of standing up to that kind of tactic.  All of us in this House have a duty to help and support any institution or organisation involved in legitimate protest, legitimate objection or legitimate concern about measures like this. For example, I think we would have a healthier democracy if we assisted more actively the trade union movement in certain ways.  However, the corollary of that is that we should stand up against the kind of tactics which say, &ldquo;We do not care what the Government introduce. We are not going to pay for this measure and we will get our members to refuse to pay&rdquo;.  I am not happy about that.  When I discussed the matter with the officer from ACRA it became clear that he had no idea &mdash; as none of us has &mdash; of what would be the precise charges or where they would fall.  That is a matter for local discussion by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>I say to ACRA and to other similar organisations that they are doing their members a disservice.  At least I am one resident for whom they do not speak when they take instant, Pavlovian-like objection to measures about which they have only the most vague notion.  When it comes to inciting people on that basis to break the law, I think they should take stock of themselves.  Such an organisation is helping to undermine our institutions. It is doing a disservice to the law-making process.  That process is not perfect but it is the only process we have.  All of us have certain concerns about it: however, I do not believe we should throw out the system, rather we should try to improve <Col N="927" /> it.  I was unhappy with the stand taken by ACRA.  I told them so at the time and I am repeating it now.  I believe other Members of this House should tell ACRA that that tactic will not work and is irresponsible in the extreme.</P>
    <P>Lastly, we have been called to say in this House that none of us wants to impose extra taxes or to be perceived to be imposing extra taxes.  I am not sure about that.  If a better way of raising funds comes about I have no hesitation in suggesting it and standing over it.  Perhaps for too long we have tried to evade our responsibilities in this respect.  One reason we are in the difficult economic mess we are in is that four years, with respect to local authorities, central Government shelled out year after year and local authorities had very little awareness in many cases of where the money was coming from.  In some cases we could ask questions about the value we were getting for it, but that is another day's discussion.  It is an obligation on us all here to say that all we are doing now is introducing a more sensitive measure of raising funds and giving power back to the local authorities.  I am quite certain that, given the chance, they will accept it readily and act responsibly when they have it.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it will be good for local authorities to have this Bill.  The scale of it in financial terms is as yet very small, being something like £21 million out of about £1,350 million.  In that context those of us who are unhappy about the Bill in principle &mdash; I am not one of them &mdash; must keep some scale on their objection to the proposal.  Perhaps the fact that we have to go through this tortuous process which arises largely out of the very good decision to abolish rates as we know them &mdash; but also out of the reckless and irresponsible evasion of responsibility of doing nothing about replacing that source of revenue by any other means which would have been fairer and more just than the rates system and which would have brought in the same necessary revenues &mdash; will bring us to a picture of the Bill if we keep these points in mind.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his public <Col N="928" /> comments on the Bill.  He has made it clear that he does not see this Bill as being on the stocks forever.  My view is that no Bill as introduced should be on the stocks forever and that there should be a built-in mechanism for ensuring that all measures are reviewed regularly.  The Minister said that he was determined to ensure that there would be an overhaul of local Government functions and structure at an early stage.  That is already overdue and I suggest to him that that is a matter of urgency, not because it is about whether there are ten councillors or six councillors here or there, but because local government is an essential part of a democratic system if it is a true local government system that is local in terms of its geographic and other scope and truly governmental in terms of the delegation of powers to the local body. At present it is neither.  It is central and it is certainly non-governmental and councillors all over the country are becoming increasingly demoralised by the prospect of being associated with a system which is a charade and a mockery of the two words &ldquo;local government&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Today and in the days that we have been discussing this Bill much play has been made of the need to give local bodies the powers to raise their own funds and to assume a greater sense of authority over their own affairs.  In recent times we have had the introduction of planning charges which in their very principle will do much to discourage people from building their own homes but instead to look towards the local authority to provide them with houses.  The SDA loans scheme has been in operation here for many years now and it has been a very useful vehicle to help people to build their own homes, even though at present the amount of money available under this heading is inadequate to help them even to contemplate building for themselves.  If the Minister would consider increasing the amount of the loan he would do very much to assist the ailing building industry at this time.  The planning charges, introduced at the time they were introduced, will simply be a further disincentive to people to look towards <Col N="929" /> the possibility of providing a home for themselves.</P>
      <P>The £1.75 per square metre planning charge for farm buildings and commercial buildings will mean that many of these buildings will either be erected illegally or simply will not be built at all.  The expenditure of money on farm buildings has meant a great deal to builders' suppliers down the years.  The fact that the Farm Modernisation Scheme has been virtually withdrawn taken in conjunction with this very severe imposition of the planning charge must be viewed as a further disincentive to farmers to undertake the much-needed building of outhouses that are so essential for the future development of agriculture.</P>
      <P>Commercial buildings at this time, particularly when we are being told that the proper thing to do is to encourage local entrepreneurs to erect their own buildings and start small industries in their own areas, will not be built due to the planning charge.  In the long term planning charges will prove to be selfdefeating and will have a very bad effect on the overall development of the economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local charges proposed in this Bill must be seen in their proper context. They must be seen as the re-introduction of rates.  In my county this year we had a shortfall of £275,000.  It was proposed in the estimates that £35,000 of that would come from the recently introduced planning charges and £240,000 would be raised by way of water charges.  In the county we had just 6,000 homes on the public water supply.  As a member of that authority I feel that if the water rate had been opposed those people naturally would feel very much discriminated against.  Other people in the community would not be, as it were, contributing anything by way of local charges while people who lived in places like Ardee and the built-up areas in the county would be faced with this proposed charge of £40. I have always felt that the best and most equitable way of local financing is from the national Exchequer.  We have had rates in this country before now.  They have been abolished and since then, 1977, the Exchequer has financed various <Col N="930" /> local authorities.  Inflation has meant that the cost of the provision of services has been much greater than normally it should be.  That is not the fault of the method of financing.</P>
    <P>If the imposition of these charges proceeds there will be very serious problems in the collection of the money.  In the longer term the collection may prove unworkable.  People might not avail of the normal range of services that local authorities would provide.  Would such people be obliged to pay the local charges?  If it is decided that they must pay I foresee tremendous problems for those with responsibility for the collection of this money.  People by their very nature will resent being asked to pay for water or refuse collection if they are not availing of them from the local authority. I understood that originally the intention was that the power to impose these charges would be an executive function to be exercised by the county manager without any reference at all to the elected members of the various authorities.  If this is the intention of the Bill, the question of giving back more power to county councils in their respective areas sounds very hollow indeed.</P>
    <P>I am very worried and frightened at the increasing number of people in County Louth who have been unable to meet their SDA loan repayments to the county council.  Is this the tip of the iceberg?  Are building societies and other lending institutions who have been making money available for housing encountering the same difficulties with people who have problems meeting the repayments deadline? At this time people cannot afford to pay for services from local authorities. We have been told that there is a waiver scheme to cater for those who might not be able to meet the charges.  As a member of a local authority in my own county, I appreciate the difficulties there are with regard to local finance and with the availability of sufficient funds to provide the services annually.  Also, as a public representative I appreciate the problems that people have in meeting the day to day demands on their pockets and their difficulties in making ends meet.</P>
    <P>Tremendous infrastructural work has <Col N="931" /> been achieved throughout rural areas by the group water schemes and they have engendered great community spirit. People have organised themselves to provide these schemes.  However, a considerable amount of work still needs to be done and people who might be tempted to organise schemes in their own areas will be put off by the prospect of having to pay water charges in the future. It would be very unfortunate if this happened, because community spirit should be fostered.  I ask the Minister to rethink some of the provisions in the Bill and to make good the shortfall of moneys to Louth County Council and others who are being forced to impose these charges. I make a special appeal to him to make available £240,000 shortfall to Louth County Council.  As they have not yet struck a rate, they hope the Minister's attitude will soften towards their dilemma and it would be very much appreciated if he made the money available to them.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the statutory demands on local authorities.  This year in Louth we had a demand from the Office of Public Works for £148,000 for drainage schemes.  I am sure that money will be spent wisely but the members have no option in the matter &mdash; they simply pay up.  This question of accountability is an area which the Minister should look at immediately.</P>
    <P>Perhaps what I am going to say now is not relevant to the Bill.  However, because of the crisis in the building industry the Minister should seriously consider the possibility of making more money available for individual SDA loans.  The sum of £14,000 is simply not enough any more to assist people to buy houses.  If the Minister could increase the amount of money made available to an individual to build a house it would act as a great stimulant to the building industry.  Hand in hand with that we would have to have an extension of the mortgage subsidy.  If there are difficulties with the repayments of the existing SDA loans it is reasonable to assume that there would also be difficulties with new loans.  The mortgage subsidy has been a very useful mechanism <Col N="932" /> to reduce the problems people have with their repayments.  It is universally recognised that the building industry is seriously in need of a gee-up.  If we checked with various local authorities to establish the length of housing lists, in most cases they would not be an accurate reflection of the need or demand for housing.  One can appreciate the possibility that exists in this area.  There are anything up to 2,000 people on the housing list in my own county.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I was merely taking an opportunity to make a brief reference to these matters.  On the overall question of local charges and the serious problems that they will pose for people who have commitments to existing repayments and the normal domestic calls on their salary, it is the worst possible time to impose such charges.  Even at this stage, I ask the Minister to reconsider the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The crucial question for local government at present is finance.  Our system of local government needs to be properly financed, properly operated and more member orientated. It must enjoy the confidence of the people, particularly of the public representatives. We want real local government, not local administration.  Unless the local authorities get a new injection of finance, there can be no progress.</P>
      <P>Recently, public representatives appear to have become more aware that the changes which have taken place in past years have eroded their powers in no uncertain way, but have increased the powers of central authority.  Both the general councils and the Irish County Council Association have expressed concern at the diminishing role of their members which still continues to diminish.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present-day local authority is a provider of many services.  All these services can be made available to everybody, but must be paid for.  It is only right, proper and just that those availing <Col N="933" /> of the services should pay for them, where feasible.  The alternative would be to pass the cost back to the general pool of taxation or, as in the past, impose rates.  There is no other way in which the money can be found.  There is no such thing as a free service.  For many years people in remote, and occasionally not so remote, areas have had to pay for services which they do not enjoy.  It is hard to question the equity of the principle that people no longer have to contribute to a service for somebody else which they themselves do not have at present and may not have in the future. There is some advantage in the present proposals in that the charge would only arise where the service has been provided.</P>
    <P>Every local authority member agrees that over the past 15 years the conditions of our roads have left a lot to be desired but they carry out repairs.  In 1978, the domestic rates were abolished and the then Minister of the Environment took upon himself to decide the increase in aggregate expenditure to be allowed to local authorities.  For many years this has been a fixed percentage, irrespective of the estimates made out by the county councils.  What could one expect after that?  Many county councils have the same experience as mine.  An increase of 11 per cent on the previous year did not take inflation into account.  As a result, all our services deteriorated.  Whatever Government are in power should introduce increases and just not talk about them.  This is crystal clear from my reading of <i>The Way Forward.</i>  It is grossly irresponsible for the Members opposite to be critical of these services and charges.  If they are members of local authorities they have to admit that no money is available.  It is not right to ask the man who has no water supply, sewerage system or lighting to make his contribution to the national Exchequer to help out somebody with perhaps ten times his income.  The last speaker, Deputy Kerr, referred to something which may not have been relevant &mdash; group water schemes.  I do not see what effect this legislation will have on these schemes.  However, I share his view on <Col N="934" /> the cost of these schemes.  Seven or eight years ago the contribution to take part in a group scheme was around £50 to £70. Today we speak in terms of £600 or £800. The amount raised in charges will not do any harm to these schemes.</P>
    <P>This has been described as rates in by the back door.  However, this is a completely different system.  Where rates were concerned, irrespective of one's income or of how one utilised one's premises, one paid.  There was no escape. Today, under these charges&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What alternative is there?  No member of the Opposition has told us how to raise this money.  Local authorities have been starved of money for a number of years.  Very little effort was made in the past ten years to finance local authorities.  As a result they became redundant.</P>
      <P>I cannot speak for cities or urban areas, but I can speak for rural ones.  Many people have wrecked their cars on the county roads because adequate money was not made available to repair these roads.  Deputy Mac Giolla probably has very little experience of rural Ireland and may never have been down there.  I speak for rural Ireland.

He probably does not remember, but <i>The Way Forward</i> made it very clear that charges would be made. If they were in power today they would do the same thing.

      <P>It has been said that this Bill reintroduces rates.  I do not agree with that.  It is far worse.  It is the total reverse.  Originally when rates were introduced in the last century by the British Government the concept was that the wealthy property owners would pay for the services of the local authorities in order to provide free water services and so on for those who could not afford them.  The valuation system became so eroded over the years that rates were inequitable in many cases. They were not based on the value of the property or on the income of the person who was rated.</P>
      <P>Rates were abolished.  They were objectionable to the vast majority of people as an inequitable form of taxation. The charges being introduced under this Bill are the very reverse of that system. Now people are being asked to pay for services without any reference to the property they own or their income.  It will be the same for a person who owns a property valued £10,000 as it will be for a person who owns a property valued £100,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not the reintroduction of rates because, inequitable as they were, they were far more equitable than this system of charges.  Small farmers are excluded from paying rates.  The abolition of rates on large farms means that these charges are transferring more of the burden from the already under-taxed farmers to the already over-taxed workers and people living in urban areas.  This additional burden is coming at a time when the savage budget has decreased their incomes further through levies, VAT charges on essential goods, reductions in social welfare payments and so on.  Their level of income now is much less and charges are much greater.  No Labour Deputies have spoken on this or on any of the social <Col N="938" /> welfare financial Bills, perhaps because they have nothing to say.</P>

      <P>It contains a hardship clause which is a joke.  I should like the Minister to explain the word &ldquo;hardship&rdquo;. Does it mean that one is allowed water when on the point of death, or when does the hardship begin?  Is it hardship when one's total resources in any week are not sufficient to cover one's outgoings unless one is prepared to reduce the amount of food on the table or to have less clothes for oneself or one's family?  Is it hardship when one is hungry or when one is in rags?  There has never been a definition of hardship.  What is hardship for one is wealth to another.  Therefore, this clause in the Bill is totally inadequate and gives absolute power to the Minister to decide on what constitutes hardship and, consequently, who will have to pay and who will not have to pay.  It appears from the comments that have been made so far from the Government benches that hardship will not be a reason for not having to pay.  Therefore, if a person is not able to pay for services, they will not be available to him.  This is the thinking that has come from the Fine Gael benches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would need to be a member of a local authority to understand the provisions of the Bill.  Two or three months ago the Minister, without any authority for so doing, sent a circular to local authorities instructing them to impose charges for planning applications, for refuse collection, for water supplies and so on.  We in Dublin Corporation were instructed by the Minister to raise £3.1 million by way of the imposition of these various charges though at the time the estimates were being passed by the city council, the manager <Col N="939" /> had no authority to impose these charges.  Yet the estimates were passed with a £3.1 million deficit to be raised after the Bill has become law.  That was an outrageous imposition on local councillors. In addition, the city manager informed the councillors that there would have to be raised £5 million in order to take account of the cost of collection, the number of people who would not pay or in respect of whom there would be difficulty in collecting payment.  These estimates were probably based on the rates situation some years ago.  The figures will probably prove to be lower than the estimates. To have to raise £5 million in order to bring in £3.1 million is the worst possible way and the most wasteful way of raising revenue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating spoke in the harshest terms possible about ACRA's suggestion that people would not pay these charges and he said that this was a provocation to break the law.  The residents association were talking of advising people to refuse to pay the levies.  If they are doing that they probably took their lead from the IFA and the ICMSA who on two or three occasions have refused successfully to pay levies that were imposed by this House.  They refused to pay the 2 per cent levy and also the resource tax.  They simply announced that they were telling their members to refuse to pay.  This House sanctioned that refusal in May of last year by legislating for the refund of the small amounts which were paid and which totalled £700,000.  This was done by way of a special Act.  Recently the ICMSA have announced that they will tell their members to burn forms sent by the Revenue Commissioners requesting details of incomes and so on.  These are the sort of actions that were not condemned by this House but when ACRA suggest that their members should do the same, that are attacked viciously.  What is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander.  Increasing numbers of people are taking the lead from the farmers' organisations in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are different aspects of the proposal to introduce charges in respect of planning.  There is one area in which planning <Col N="940" /> applications make big profits for certain people, whether individuals or companies. I refer to situations in which an outline planning permission can increase the value of property by five, six or perhaps ten times.  This is an area in which local authorities should charge the cost of processing the planning application and they should be empowered also to impose a percentage charge on the increased value of the property as a result of the planning permission having been obtained.  In that way local authorities could bring in more revenue from a capital gain resulting from the local authority having granted planning permission.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of planning permissions which local authorities seem to be going after most of all is the ordinary domestic applications in respect of the building of a house or of an extension. These applications are being charged for by local authorities.  That is all right so long as the charge remains at some reasonable level, say £10 or £15, but who believes that that will be the case?  Once the levies are imposed they will be increased in subsequent budgets.  The domestic charges will probably increase at a faster rate than will the commercial charges.  Most of the money could be brought in by way of commercial charges if these were imposed in the correct fashion, that is, in the event of a property increasing in value four or five times as a result of a successful planning application, the local authority should take a percentage of the enhanced value by way of a tax.</P>
    <P>The other area of planning applications to which local councillors have much objection are the charges for third party objectors.  The whole point of the planning laws was to give local people some control over their environment, to be able to make objections to applications which they thought would be destroying a certain view or creating pollution, noise or traffic hazards.  Now, however, by ministerial direction under this Bill, third party objectors must pay £30.  This is totally against the whole concept of local democracy and of community participation in the development of their environment. <Col N="941" /> They were given such rights under the various Planning Acts.</P>
    <P>The Minister has even said that in certain cases local councillors who make objections must also pay.  That is total erosion of local democracy despite what we have been told about efforts to enhance the powers of local authorities, and it will increase the sense of frustration and enmity between local people and the local authorities.  This Bill reduces the powers of local authorities and the rights of local people right down the line.</P>
    <P>However, the provision which is causing most objection to this Bill is that which imposes charges for water services. The total nationwide amount to be raised by these charges is estimated at £23 million. Of course, people in urban areas will be paying the greater part of those charges and therefore will be bearing an increased burden.  The concept of free water supplies was expressed in the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, and confirmed by the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act, 1962.  Both Acts should be supplied to Deputies so that we can appropriately see how the Minister proposes to amend those Acts in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The concept in the 1878 Act is that water should be supplied free and charged for by rates or some other form of taxation, local or central.  The idea was that water should be as free as the air. Perhaps the Minister will think of some method by which air can be charged for. They have a new machine in Japan from which, if you stick your head into a slot, you can breathe free air.  Perhaps the Minister may be able to make some money from such a machine.</P>
    <P>Water is much more essential for human survival than even food.  I am not sure what the record is but I understand one can go 70 or 80 days without food but only ten days without water.  Therefore, it must be argued that water is the most important element for sustenance of life.</P>
    <P>At this point, I thank the Minister of State for arriving before the end of the debate and I would remind him that in the 1878 Health Act a public duty was imposed to give free water services.  In 1983, 105 years later, we are moving away <Col N="942" /> from that concept and giving Fine Gael power to charge for everything &mdash; living or dying, you will have to pay for everything. The Minister seems to be leaving again after a short interval, but we hope the views we are expressing will be conveyed to him by his deputy.</P>
    <P>This idea of charging for water supplies is a most reactionary one, but the manner in which it is being imposed is still more reactionary, coming from a Department controlled by two Labour Party Ministers, Deputies Spring and Quinn.  It is hard to imagine that they would allow such a concept as this to be even suggested in the Cabinet, that £40 or £50 per house would be imposed for supplying water.  Can they have any idea of what that will mean in inner cities and suburban areas?  It is much worse than rates because it does not relate to size of property or to incomes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment said in Kilkenny the week before last that this would be a temporary measure.  He specifically said that it would last for only two years.  That was not reported publicly but it was jotted down at the time and reported to me.  I was asked to ask the Minister about it and I am now asking him through his deputy if this measure will last only for two years.  If that is not so, will the Minister go to Kilkenny and tell them he made a big mistake, that this is not a temporary but a permanent measure? It is important the House should be told this.  If this is only a temporary measure that should be inserted somewhere in the Bill and the Minister should be given power to change or to abolish any charges at any time.  Once this measure has been passed unamended in this respect the Minister can decree any orders he wishes to make charges for &mdash; this, that and the other.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating made the point that this was another way of raising money. He said that if we raise the money in this manner we will not have to raise it in another way.  What does he mean by that?  Does he mean that if the money is raised by imposing a £40 or £50 charge for a water supply we will not have to raise it by a wealth tax?  That is probably his view.  The money should be raised by <Col N="943" /> a wealth tax or increasing our capital taxes which have been reduced consistently since 1974.  In that year capital taxes amounted to 11.2 per cent of our total revenue but last year they amounted to only 4.7 per cent, almost one-third of what they were in 1974.  If the money is raised through wealth tax or capital taxes it will not be necessary to charge for a water supply.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is putting through the most reactionary measure of any of the taxes which have been described by Members on all sides as inequitable.  This is the most reactionary measure introduced in the House, worse than the Social Welfare Bill or the Finance Bill, because of the impact it will have on householders who are already pushed to the limit by lower welfare payments and higher taxes.  The imposition of a charge for water will be a tremendous burden on them.  The Minister should tell the House what he means by hardship and when it occurs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>All members of local authorities are aware of the increased demand for services and the difficulty about financing them.  We are concerned about the way the Minister will use the powers in the Bill in future.  Will those powers be used annually when the Exchequer grant is being allocated to local authorities?  The Minister in future years may substantially reduce the grant to local authorities leaving it to them to raise the remainder of the money they require through charges for services.  We are also deeply concerned about the levying of charges and the waiver scheme being executive functions.  We have heard of the need for more autonomy for local authorities and to give to local representatives more responsibility in their own affairs but the Minister, instead of indicating a return of powers to local representatives, is seriously curtailing their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Local authorities must also meet the demands of local ACOT committees, the VEC, health boards, maintain courthouses and fund works to be carried out under the direction of the Office of Public <Col N="944" /> Works.  Local authorities will have to be relieved of those functions because the money for them must come from local rates.  In 1981 local authorities were limited in the increased rates they could strike but the Office of Public Works demanded three times the rate struck for the maintenance of rivers.  Fianna Fáil, who were in Government, stepped in and made up the shortfall.  At that time we were faced with the situation where a body outside the ambit of the county council was expecting that local authority to contribute more for work on rivers.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that some counties provide fewer services than others.  In Cavan and Monaghan most of the water supplies in rural areas, including many villages, come from group water schemes which the councils have not taken over and those schemes are still the responsibility of the committees who initiated the supply.  I have no doubt that many people will refuse to pay for the services and cease to use them.  On the day Monaghan County Council were increasing the rate to £15.46 in the £ &mdash; it went up from £8.77 in the £ over five years &mdash; on commercial and industrial premises we met deputations who pointed out that their business had been reduced by between 30 and 50 per cent because their customers were flocking across the Border to buy their requirements. That has changed since due to the difference in currency and not because of any relief from the Government.  It was the luck of the game.</P>
    <P>Before we introduce these charges we must look at many aspects of the work of local authorities, particularly in regard to housing.  Some years ago, when a Coalition Government were in office, the grants for the repair and maintenance of houses were withdrawn.  I visited many houses which were built shortly after the Second World War and I was shocked to see their condition.  The number of people on our housing list does not give a true picture of the need for houses because new houses will have to be provided for those whose homes are in a bad state of repair as a result of the decision to discontinue housing repair and maintenance grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> At our estimates meeting we reached a figure of £4.49 for the average weekly rent, much higher than the national average. Massive subsidies have to be provided for local authority rented housing accommodation.  We will have to look at the provisions for servicing sites and helping those who want to build their own homes by way of SDA loans.  These loans are granted at very attractive terms &mdash; 12 per cent plus ½ per cent to meet administration expenses &mdash; but many people are unable to meet their loan commitments due to short-time working, redundancies and so on.  We have heard many suggestions from Ministers.  We have village settlements where local authorities provided land for services.  The idea was good but the serviced sites were very expensive with the result that half of the SDA loan of £14,000 was spent on the site and the services.  The amount of arrears due on local authority loans is increasing.</P>
    <P>Another area which is causing a great deal of concern is the special charges for malicious damages.  In my area we have had more than the average amount of malicious damages, some of it politically motivated and these damages were recouped in full from the British authorities, but the normal malicious damages claims, which were not politically motivated, had to be met by the local authority. We have a maximum addition of 20p in the pound in rates to meet legal and other expenses incurred in examining and contesting those claims.  In my view the time has come when this will have to be a national charge.  None of the Border counties should be saddled with this extra 20p in the pound to meet malicious injuries damages.</P>
    <P>If a local authority contest a claim at a cost of £x thousand that money has to be paid by the local authority, but if the technical staff of the local authority agreed to the claim, costs would be lower. Any claims I have seen have been pursued very conscientiously by the county officials who did everything in their power to ensure that the council would not be saddled with additional expense. The Minister should examine the situation. I mentioned this point at an annual <Col N="946" /> county council meeting when we were discussing our contribution to the Office of Public Works and An Foras Forbartha. Both organisations are monitoring the same rivers and streams but for different reasons &mdash; the Office of Public Works from a drainage point of view and An Foras Forbartha from the point of view of quality control.  In my view there should be co-operation between State agencies.  On the Blackwater River within three or four miles there are two separate monitoring stations.  Officers from each organisation have to go weekly to these stations to change their charts. At a time of scarce finances there must be more co-operation and integration between Departments.  In this way we could probably introduce overall costs.</P>
    <P>The local authorities are facing growing problems in the area of environmental protection.  Some counties adjoining mine have litter collections for the rural and urban areas, but we have collections only for towns and villages.  Despite the introduction of measures to cope with unauthorised dumps we have a very serious situation.  Recently our technical staff told us there were 45 unauthorised dumps in our county, but we could not afford to provide a refuse collection service for everyone in the rural areas.  Indiscriminate dumping is becoming a very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Government allocations to the local improvements scheme are causing great concern.  In 1980 we hoped that there would have been a substantial increase in the allocation for the 12 western counties. In 1979 we got £2,750,000 under the local improvements scheme.  In 1983, without recognising the fact that the cost of materials doubled, the Minister gave us an allocation of £3 million.  He made that allocation for the constituency I represent where there are almost 1,000 applications, and in Monaghan we have a ten-year waiting list.  How does the Minister expect to develop resources in an area if there are 1,000 applications? These roads accommodate two, three and sometimes four families.  We are talking in terms of 4,000 people.  We had hoped for a substantial increase to take <Col N="947" /> account of inflation, but we got only £250,000 in four years.</P>
    <P>There are demands on local authorities for payments to regional development organisations.  We paid about £5,000 to finance a regional survey.  Over the past ten years we seem to have done nothing but carry out surveys.  Every State agency must be packed to the brim with reports on examinations and surveys. There should be one survey of each region covering roads, soil, water schemes, and so on.  We should have a regional examination of the development potential covering agriculture, tourism, and so on, rather than having this fragmentation year after year.</P>
    <P>The cost of maintaining courthouses has been mentioned.  This maintenance should be financed by the Department of Justice and not the local authorities.  Most local authorities are faced with road structure problems.  The problem is to ensure that the road surfaces are usable. We have had a number of very severe winters.  About a month ago we had a visit from a European study group.  The technical staffs of Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal and Louth County Councils carried out a survey.  We were told that about 17 per cent of the road surfaces in Monaghan are seriously deficient.  Our allocation at present would cover only 50 per cent of the requirements.  Therefore we will have a steady deterioration in our road surfaces.  In that county over the next five years we will require £57 million for roads, water supplies and sewerage schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister should pay special attention to the scheme introduced a few years ago when the task force operated through the health boards.  That scheme was of terrific benefit.  Essential repairs were carried out to the homes of many old people.  In some cases major repairs were carried out and sewerage schemes were provided.  I understand from a discussion at a health board meeting over the past few days that the money is beginning to run out.  I saw many houses where work was done for a very small amount of money through AnCO, or small contractors, <Col N="948" /> or people working under supervision. The repairs carried out on some homes will last for the remainder of the pensioners' lives.  Before this, local authorities were building groups of old people's dwellings at a very high cost, roughly £16,000 or £17,000 each.</P>

      <P>In this Bill the Government had a golden opportunity to hand back real power to the elected members of all local authorities.  Rates on domestic dwellings were removed and now rates on agricultural land no longer provide a means of raising revenue for local authorities. The Government should have grasped this opportunity.  We are now at a crossroads.  Somebody said the Minister suggested this could be looked at again in two years' time.  Knowing the love local authority officials have for power, I know it will be very hard to break the link.  I respect the managers, county secretaries, county engineers and staff, but the slogan should be no taxation without representation. This little country will be the laughing stock of Europe.  I wonder what the people who went out from the boreens and out-of-the-way places and the cities to gain the freedom we now enjoy think of the Members of this House.  In an indirect way we are giving back power to officialdom, people who are not responsible to anybody, and who have not got to answer to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members of local authorities should have sufficient power to operate and do <Col N="949" /> their duty.  I am disappointed at the Minister for the Environment who was a member of a local authority for many years.  He is introducing this rather shortsighted Bill.  This will be regretted in years to come.  Local authority staffs will be very slow to relinquish the power they will grasp from this Bill.  We should not lose this golden opportunity to give real power to the elected representatives.</P>
    <P>I question the Minister's judgment. Does he not trust the ballot box?  These people were elected to manage the affairs of their own towns and to decide what should be charged for to provide services. I will not bore the House with the various charges which may be levied by the managers if this Bill is passed.  If the Minister does not trust elected representatives this is a sad day for democracy.  We have the youngest electorate in Europe.  This Bill will discourage young people from getting involved in their own communities and becoming members of their local authorities.  They will not play an active part when they see all this officialdom foisted on them.  I heard some Members on the other side saying that we have a duty to collect this money.  Of course we have.  There must be some means provided for collecting money to run the affairs of every county, borough and corporation.  We are not so silly as to think that we can pluck millions out of the sky.  We are objecting to the manner in which this is being done.  It is very unfair to have Government spokesmen saying that power is being given back to the local authorities.  That is not what is happening.  Power is being given back to county managers who are not responsible to anybody.  County managers cannot be questioned about their position unless they abuse the funds of which they are in charge.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this matter again before he pushes it through the House.</P>
    <P>We talk about an abuse of power.  The managers in many counties have abused the power they already have.  In some council areas they have jacked up the levy for water connections, sewerage connections, planning applications and development charges.  That is only the tip of the iceberg in relation to what they will <Col N="950" /> do when they get this power to impose a levy for all these services.  All the local authorities in every party should rebel and suggest that this Bill is scrapped and not accepted by the House.  It is complete dictatorship.  We might as well be at home looking after our businesses as to go into council meetings like a bunch of turkeys and bow our heads to the managers' requests when they say so and so is the charge.  It is a waste of time and public money to have local authorities discuss something over which they have no power and the managers have complete power.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with the Minister. He is a rural man and was a member of a local authority for years.  He should not be so shortsighted in his attitude towards this Bill.  I would like him to tell us what it will cost to collect the various charges. Will we have another layer of red tape, another layer of appointments which will be non-productive?  Any money which we have to spend should be used in creating genuine jobs, not jobs that will take away the few pence left in people's pockets. Will we have another layer of staff officers and every kind of official in local authorities to collect those levies?  If that is the case we are making a very dangerous move.</P>
    <P>There is very little in the Bill to comment on.  It is just giving the authority to county managers to go ahead, charge what they like and we will stand behind them.  The county managers are very happy with that because they can sit back and laugh at the local authority members expressing anger about the various charges.  The county managers will just stand up and tell them that it is their function and not the function of the county councillors.  It is a disgrace to bring this Bill into the House when we are at a crossroads as far as local democracy is concerned.  We are handing the little bit of power we had right back to the county managers.  The Government are telling the county managers to carry on with the show, that the fellows in the local authorities cannot be trusted.</P>
    <P>What will it cost to administer?  We hear talk about the scheme that will be brought out in case of hardship.  If an old <Col N="951" /> age pensioner has a fire in her chimney she is supposed to pay £25 to have the fire put out.  What about the poor lady who cannot afford to pay that charge? Who will decide?  Is that another layer of the red tape and form filling that we have had over the years?  Application forms for grants and loans are being carried from Cork to Donegal.  They are the most travelled documents in Europe.  They are carried by civil servants who are responsible to nobody.  We talk about the paltry few million pounds we give to people to help them to house themselves.  I am sure the senior members of our society, who helped to gain the freedom we now enjoy, are shocked at the way the Members of this House treat the freedom which we have.  The way we are carrying on the people who gave their lives to gain our freedom did it in vain.  We are not grasping that power and using it for ourselves to help those weaker sections of the community.  We are giving an open ticket to county managers who are up on a pedestal.  I am not ridiculing county managers.  I am ridiculing this House for giving county managers more power than they had.  They have sufficient power at the moment.</P>
    <P>I seriously appeal to the Minister to think again about this Bill, because if he does not I can see the day coming when he will regret it.  We have enough red tape and we will not have any more of it if enough Members of the House do not agree with what is being done in the Bill. I am not here to score political points.  I respect the Minister and the position he holds, but I appeal to him to have a little bit of common sense.  We have only to cast our minds back to what has happened in local authorities over the year in relation to rates on our houses and rates on our land.  We are at a crossroads and something must be done sensibly without any kind of emotion or saying that we will stick in this Bill now, it will do for two years and it can be changed then.  Live horse and you will get grass. Let us do it now, especially when it is only a year before we approach local authority elections.  It would be a great encouragement to our youth to get <Col N="952" /> involved in local democracy if we do not pass this Bill.</P>

      <P>We have to take this Bill in conjunction with some other measures that have been perpetrated against the general public in the past few months.  This is being done in quite a calculated way to so inveigle the minds of the general public that they are not being savaged entirely in relation to what is in the minds of the Coalition Government in beggaring the vast majority of the people, particularly householders. The Bill cannot be taken in isolation. It must be remembered that this is part of the Coalition strategy so far as money matters are concerned during this financial year.  We have to realise that the question of prices, VAT increases and all the other delicacies the Coalition found in their hearts to bring against the people in their Budget Statement were followed up shortly afterwards by the Social Welfare Bill.  It has been hailed as the most anti-Social Welfare Bill ever moved in this House.  It must be to the shame of the minor party in the Coalition Government that they tolerated such a move being made.  It brought about a lessening of the standard of living of the people least able to accommodate themselves in the depressing and recessionary period we have experienced for the last couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The living standards of old age pensioners have been attacked.  This coming, amongst other things, from a Labour Party who could not find it in their hearts to give the miserable pittance they are now going to give in the first week in July, at the customary time, namely, April, surely must show that there is no concern about the impact of any measure being <Col N="953" /> introduced by this Coalition Government on the less well off.  As far as I am concerned the people under attack are the less well off.  This is being done by an uncaring Labour Party as the minor party of the Coalition.  The cutbacks in the benefits of that Social Welfare Bill must be incorporated in the arithmetic of all these measures brought forward by the Coalition to deal with what they say are the financial difficulties of the State at present.  The position was brought to its climax in the Finance Bill, the necessary legislation to inflict the levies, the residential property tax and the other elements of taxation on the unsuspecting and unfortunate taxpayers and householders.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that one must recognise what this Bill is all about &mdash; another extension of the moves being made by the Coalition against the ordinary worker, the ordinary occupier of property and it must be resisted in that context. Any of the measures I have mentioned, the budget, the Social Welfare Bill, the Finance Bill or this one, any one in isolation would have put a Government out of office 15 years ago.  But it is now being done in a deliberate and calculated way.  They are not being brought in in one package.  It has been decided that they will be separated in time and effect so that the maximum impact will be over the year as a whole.  I resist it for that reason.  It is unworthy of the Coalition Government and particularly unworthy of the pseudo-socialists who make up that Government, to allow this kind of provision and others which formed part of the effort to date to be brought against the people.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment is a member of the Labour Party.  His introductory remarks were short, three pages of the Official Report, but what his speech lacked in length it made up for in implications, those it will have on the hundreds of thousands of people living in this State at present.  It vests considerable powers in various people.  I am not so sure that such people are either accustomed to or have the competence to accept these powers at present, for reasons I shall give later.  As slow as one <Col N="954" /> might be to isolate any section of a Government, one must castigate the Labour Party in this regard.  I would have expected this type of legislation, I would have expected some of the monetarist attitudes outlined in some of the provisions this year to date from the Fine Gael Party; one expects that kind of ultra-conservativism from that grouping.  But one had come to expect something different when one listened to the pious hopes and platitudes being clap-trapped from the Labour benches, particularly when they were in Opposition, for the past couple of years.  According to them they were going to solve all our difficulties, bring a social aspect to our legislation, bring caring and concern to bear on the type of legislation we might be expecting from them.  That is why they keep asking: &ldquo;What were you, Deputy, going to do when you were in Government?  Were you not going to do something worse than this?&rdquo;  It is time they ceased that kind of clap-trap.  It means simply that they are devoid of any suggestions to put in the place of what we had carefully set down in <i>The Way Forward</i> which would have brought about a happier situation both for the national and local finances.  It is time the Government ceased this kind of cat-calling as to what they might or might not have done in the past.  Whether or not they realise it an election did take place at the end of last year and by a freak of electoral mishap, we lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Were they not lucky they lost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we did lose, we will have to accept that.  Unfortunately quite a number of people now on the Government benches are not fully aware of the fact that by a mixture of ideologies and of policies they happened to put a document together and sold it to some of their members, and so some of them are in Government.  It would be just as well if the majority of them did recognise that that election took place, that they are there and that it is their duty and responsibility to get on with the matter of governing. But they are reneging on that responsibility by continuously harping <Col N="955" /> back on what Fianna Fáil might or might not have done.  Of course, in all things in Irish life in the recent past Fianna Fáil have been the baddies and must be pilloried for being the baddies.</P>
      <P>It is contended also that if the Coalition partners, the Labour people in particular, had had the opportunity of getting in last year while we were doing something to run the country in a satisfactory manner, they would have altered all of that, they had the list of ingredients, if given the chance, to make this an easy passage for our people.  That has been their cry, both individually and collectively, for a long number of years: give us the opportunity and we will do something about it. Lo and behold, what have they done since they came into power?  They have perpetrated these evils against the people, by way of taxation, price increases, VAT increases and a whole range of impositions.  That is their answer.  There are no incentives given to anybody to do anything, no planned programme, no alternative to <i>The Way Forward</i>&mdash; our proposed plan &mdash; except to paraphrase the best parts of it and to put them across as some of their policy statements. We are still awaiting a planned programme under any Department head from this not useless Coalition but worse than useless.  I say that because they are making life hard, hard to the point of breaking for the vast majority of our people, to the point where ordinary people have lost faith and confidence in themselves.  As far as I am concerned that is the biggest crime one can commit against any population, that one destroys the confidence of the public to do something for themselves.  This is just another instance.  It is passed over as a minor instance but it has very big implications for the vast majority of people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, introducing the Bill, talked about restoring a proper degree of financial independence to local authorities. Those who have had the honour of serving on local authorities for a number of years recognise that as nonsense.  This Bill does not give anybody independence let alone financial independence.  When the Minister talks about financial independence <Col N="956" /> does that mean that you can raise any amount of money you like and spend it on any project you like, because that is what independence is all about?  I do not remember any single instance where a Minister of the day allowed that kind of financial latitude to Mayo County Council when I served on it for 17 years. There is no independence in that matter at all.  There is no administrative independence, no project independance, let alone financial independence attached to any local authority.  The only independence allowed as far as project independence is concerned is that in respect of minor schemes like local improvements schemes, minor roads, small amenity schemes during the summer and such like.  But, in respect of major road works, members of local authorities have no discretion whatsoever.  Department inspectors tell them the corner to be cut, tell them the road width, the alignment and the amount of money they may or may not spend.</P>
    <P>The same goes for all the large capital projects such as water, sewerage and so on.  They have to wait for the Minister to give his approval and he can be as generous or as ungenerous as he likes.  There is no independence for the local authorities and this Bill will not give them any financial independence.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Environment in his speech said that the reason this measure was introduced was that meeting the cost of rates relief was a major demand on the Exchequer.  The cat is out of the bag.  This proposal is not because of any new-found idealism for local authority autonomy.  The Minister has told us that rates relief is too much of a demand on the Exchequer, that it must be met in some other way rather than adding it to the national deficit.  It is very important in 1983 that the deficit be kept within the limits set out in the budget.  This is one issue on which the Government are determined to hang their hat.  The balance of payments and borrowing mean nothing: it does not matter so long as the budget deficit is within the limits outlined in the budget.  This will be done irrespective of what hardship has to be suffered by individuals who will have to pay to <Col N="957" /> make that possible for the Coalition.  The meeting of rates relief will have to be done by local rates, by charges, fees, licences or other measures.  All of this has been accommodated in this short but important Bill so far as fiscal planning is concerned.</P>
    <P>One Deputy suggested this would be a temporary measure and I understand this was carried in some section of the press, whether local or national I do not know. Does anyone in his wildest dreams think this will be a temporary measure?  How can it be when the Minister in his short statement gives the lie to that?  At column 287 of the Official Report of 1 June the Minister said, &ldquo;We are on the right track&rdquo;.  That does not sound temporary to me.  He also said the Government were not claiming that all that is needed to be done can be done at once.  In other words, the Minister is letting us know that more is in store for the unfortunate householder.</P>
    <P>A recent example will convey what I mean.  The VAT rate started at a nice low figure but it can be increased depending on the demands that are made.  I spoke about this in connection with the new fuel VAT of 5 per cent.  This will be an enormous burden on old age pensioners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

      <P>How does the Deputy explain his party's decision to abolish the wealth tax?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry if this is penetrating the socialist heart of the Minister of State.  It should penetrate his socialist heart if he had one but he does not have one if he is prepared to stand over this kind of legislation.  On Second Stage the Minister said a significant degree of local finance would be necessary henceforth in support of the Exchequer.  I hardly think that sounds like a temporary measure.</P>
      <P>At column 278 of the Official Report of 1 June the Minister refers to:</P>
      <P>...the legal basis for direct charges for services which have always been a feature of local finance and which, over the years, have existed side by side with the rating system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is not talking about a temporary <Col N="958" /> arrangement.  He is talking about solidifying something which he says has been there during the years and which he now says he will put on the right track. Thus, in the coming years he can increase the charges to deliver to him whatever amount of money is necessary to keep in line with the Department's figures as handed down by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>There are some elements of this Bill that are disquieting to say the least.  Section 1 deals with the interpretation of words such as &ldquo;charge&rdquo;, &ldquo;existing enactment&rdquo; and &ldquo;service&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;premises&rdquo; might also have been interpreted because it has a direct relevance to certain charges that can be made against premises.  For example, section 3 states that &ldquo;...charges may be made by such an authority in respect of persons, premises or services of different classes or descriptions&rdquo;.  It might have been useful if &ldquo;premises&rdquo; had been included in the definitions section.  Does it mean dwelling houses only or can it be applied to flats or institutions whether private or public?  Perhaps the Minister would consider this point.</P>
    <P>It is being stated that there will be different charges for different areas but I find this hard to understand.  This suggests that different charges could be applied in one part of County Mayo as compared with another part of the county.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not applying the charges.  The local authorities will do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I consider that totally unacceptable.  It suggests giving to a county manager a latitude which I do not think should be given to him in such a general way.  It will have a major effect on building and development in certain isolated areas.  The manager will be able to impose different charges because of the topography or the geography of an area.  That will be discriminatory and it should not have been incorporated in the measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was made to the difficulty of collection.  Two methods of collection <Col N="959" /> come to mind.  If it is done by sending out bills, presumably each bill would average out as between 30p and 40p.  I do not know of anyone who will respond quickly to the first bill they receive.  I presume a few bills will have to be sent&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very seditious.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably it will cost a few pounds for each bill.  Alternatively, we could have collectors.  I have no doubt that many doors will not be opened when they knock on them.  The collectors will become better known than the men checking on TV licences.  The collectors will have an impossible task in trying to collect the money.  The additional cost will have to be considered in the overall cost.  The whole thing will be a nonsense Section 6 of the Bill makes provision for payment by instalments.  We are entering the realms of fantasy now&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The collector arrives at the door and knocks in a nice, tentative way. He is responded to by the housewife and he tells her that he wants the water rent. She will respond, &ldquo;Certainly, Sir,&rdquo; and I presume he gets £1.  &ldquo;and will you come back next week?&rdquo;.  The collector will do his duty 50 times a year at every house in every town in Ireland.  People in the gallery are laughing and the Minister of State is laughing&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The question is what are they laughing at?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because he knows that if you are to collect this money by sending out bills you will get no response so the only other way is to have somebody call for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Table to the Bill provides that two months will be given.  Is it two months after the gale day of 1 April or 1 October or will it be two months after each successive contribution towards the total charge?  It is a laugh.  The whole thing is totally unworkable and the Minister of <Col N="960" /> State knows that.  Then he will take to the courts.  The courts are so cluttered up at the moment that they cannot deal with existing demands and I presume that these courts will now be asked to hand down judgments on poor individuals who will not be able either to pay the charge or to pay to be represented in the court. Without putting too fine a point on it, the Minister will be laughed out of court.</P>
    <P>It seems strange that £65 million can be talked about so glibly as a temporary measure.  That is quite a sizeable sum of money in anybody's language.  We might as well face up to the fact that this Bill is a form of taxation.  It has no recognition at all of the ability of the individual to pay.  This must be an inherent fault in the legislation.  It is a spending tax and it will affect the poorer classes to a much bigger degree than it will affect others.  How could a Labour Minister of State sit there and say to me that this taxation is to be placed on the unsuspecting householder when nothing is stated here about inability to pay except in the clause that says that the manager has the right to waive it?  To waive what?  This is the hardship clause which in effect means nothing at all.  This is under section 5 of the Bill.  In regard to people who are in subsidised rented dwellings or who are getting mortgage subsidies from the State to help pay their mortgages, who are unemployed temporarily, short term or whatever, how can the manager not apply section 5?  The way this Government are going about business as far as unemployment figures are concerned, there will be nobody left to collect it from anyway and the Minister will have to drag into court those who are willing to pay to get it out of them.  The whole thing is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>There was no means of assessing what the take would be in any county.  Mr. Chairman, you might indicate when I have a few minutes to go.  It was just take a figure out of the hat, and the way it was done in County Mayo where the Minister of State is going shortly to open some new urban council houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There was no recognition whatsoever of how many might or might not pay, what the shortfall might be, the administration costs, collectors' fees or whatever.  It was just a multiplier system.  That is how much thought was put into this legislation.  If it is not collected and if there is a shortfall at the end of this year from all the towns throughout the country, I presume that next year the manager as part of his executive function will have to increase the charge not just to cover next year's charges but also to take recognition of the outstanding debt&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the debit balance which would have accrued.  As I understand it, everything not said to be reserved must be an executive function, so I take it that as it is not stated specifically here it must be an executive function. That leads me to show up further the lie in part of what the Minister stated in his opening speech.  I quote from the Official Report of 1 June 1983, column 275, Volume 343:</P>
      <P>The basic responsibility for deciding on the amount to be raised by charges will fall to be exercised by the council members....</P>
      <P>I do not see that to be the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an executive function, and I will tell the House why.  If the members of a council at a meeting duly convened for the purpose of formulating these charges decide to chop the charge, the manager says that he requires £50 &mdash; whether he can get it or not is another story &mdash; and the members decide that they will not allow so much money.  The manager then says that he cannot run the services and asks where he is to get the extra money.  The members say that they <Col N="962" /> will not give it to him anyway, and the charge is formulated at the level the members require.  According to this Bill, in the next week the manager by his own executive function can levy the charge whether the members like it or not.  That is what &ldquo;executive function&rdquo; means.  That is not written in but it must be implied in the language of this Bill in that everything that is not reserved must be executive. This is only a sop generated by the Coalition partners in an effort to fob off on the councillors that some kind of new financial independence is being bestowed on them.  Nothing whatsoever is being bestowed on them.  The manager will decide what the charge will be and whether they can place the charge at any level they require.</P>
      <P>I resist particularly section 7 which provides for the setting off of unpaid charges against some sums due by an individual or individuals or for taxing the occupiers of certain premises against the sums due on foot of these charges.  What if there is a dispute regarding the charges, the occupier or who the official occupier of the property is?  What if there is a dispute with the manager about the type of service being granted or the capacity of the service which the occupier says he requires and is not getting from the authority?  What if the requirements of the individual are not being met in the simple instance where the water pressure is not up to the householder's requirements? I understand that this Bill allows the manager to differentiate the amount of charges to individual householders. Many people live at the top of a number of little hills where the pressure is not too strong, and I presume there will be a <i>pro rata</i> de-scaling of the charge to accommodate their requirements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole concept is daft.  It has not been thought out clearly.  It has been thought out purely as a means of getting £65 million by hook or by crook to accommodate the fiscal policies of this Government. I say to the Minister of State as a Labour Minister of State supporting this Bill, that it is a further example of antisocial legislation being moved against the householders and the less well off of this community.  He should be ashamed of <Col N="963" /> promoting this legislation.  It will be impossible to implement it.  It will be administratively impossible and cost more by way of collection than it will eventually bring in.  The sooner the Government withdraw it the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I have one question which perhaps the Minister would answer. Recently at a meeting of Cork Corporation on estimates members of the council decided by a majority vote to reject the manager's request to put a charge on the collection of refuse and the supply of water.  What is the position now?  Can the manager override a majority ruling of the members of Cork Corporation?</P>

      <P>I should like to reply to all the points that have been made.  Having been impressed by the flights of oratory of Deputy Flynn, I cannot avoid making the observation that the Irish playwright and dramatist, John Millington Synge, is now running the risk of being turned into an acrid social historian, so far did Deputy Flynn stray from the realities of local government, including that of his own county, and from the powers contained in this Bill.</P>
      <P>We are standardising and bringing into this part of the 20th century the powers of all local authorities, urban and rural, particularly the powers they have to charge for services.  A large number of anomalies followed the abolition of domestic rates in 1977-78.  Deputy Molloy, in reply to my interjection and quoting me somewhat out of context, referred to the point I made in the debate in 1978 that, with the abolition of domestic rates, water charges were made in rural areas but there were no charges for water in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I wanted to standardise them at that time because, as Deputy Molloy knows, about 30 per cent of the urban population while living in towns <Col N="964" /> are outside the functional areas of those towns and were subject to water charges following the piecemeal abandonment of legislation at that time.</P>

      <P>We are giving a formal commitment to review this legislation within a period of two years and, subject to the views of the House and the way in which it is considered to be operating, we can make whatever changes the House feels are necessary at that time.  If it is the majority view of the House that the making of charges should be a reserved function, then under existing legislation, as Deputy Molloy knows from his tenure in the Custom House, the Minister for the Environment now has the power to designate those functions of a local authority which could be considered to be reserved functions.  So we do not even need legislation in two years' time to transfer the powers that the manager will have as executive functions under this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy Molloy will allow me to make my contribution I shall try to clarify some of the misconceptions that the other side of the House have in relation to the operation of local authorities in general.  I am not surprised that they have misconceptions because the systematic undermining and destruction that Fianna Fáil have visited upon local authorities over the last 25 years is such that it takes more than six or seven months to repair the damage.  Specifically on the question of review, in two years' time or thereabouts, subject to the <Col N="965" /> majority views of this House, we will review how this legislation is in operation. It is our clear intention that the managers of every local authority will work in co-operation with their local members, and I will come to the point raised by Deputy Wyse in the context of Cork Corporation.  If it is the view of the House that it should be a reserved function, we have the powers under existing legislation to transfer from the managers this executive function to the elected members.</P>
      <P>I want to put on record what powers the elected members have in relation to the whole question of local charges and local finances.  At present the striking of a rate is the reserved function of the local elected members of a county council or rating authority.  The striking of a rate is done in conjunction with the estimates and, as most Deputies who are members of local authorities are aware, there are two basic votes, usually taken together, in each fiscal year for a local authority. The first is the fixing of the estimate and the second is the striking of the rate. Perhaps Deputy Flynn's absence from Mayo County Council has distorted his understanding of these matters but no doubt he is aware that, for the first time since 1978, local authorities this year have the power in respect of commercial premises to fix whatever rate they choose, a power that was taken away from them by Fianna Fáil and given back to them by this administration in less than four months in office.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The truth sometimes hurts and Deputy Flynn will get a bellyful of it now.  This is the first removal of the shackles that were put on local authorities by Fianna Fáil when they abolished rates and the ham-fisted way in which they brought in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1978.  Every local authority was in credit and paying their way in 1977-78 when the 1978 Bill was put through this House by the majority Fianna Fáil Government.  Now the reverse is the case.  All local authorities <Col N="966" /> are heading towards bankruptcy unless there is a major change in the system of operation of local authority finances.</P>
      <P>The House, perhaps unintentionally, has been repeatedly misled by members of the Fianna Fáil Party when they talk about the need to raise £65 million by local charges.  That is not the case.  The charges referred to in this legislation are not expected to bring in much more than approximately £20 million, which must be set against a figure of £1,000 million or thereabouts, which has been made available through general taxation to local authorities throughout the country for the operation of their current account services.  We are talking in terms of 2 per cent of the requirements of local authorities, not the extraordinary draconian amount of money which Fianna Fáil Deputies pretend it is.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn talked about this taxation starting off at a low base but inevitably being expanded and increased, because in his experience taxation is inevitably increased and never abolished.  I retain the memory of not just Deputy Flynn cheering on this side of the House but of every other Fianna Fáil Deputy cheering when their colleague, Deputy Colley, announced in his budget speech of 1978 that he was abolishing the wealth tax.  I recall the cheers at the Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis when the climb down in relation to the farmers' resource tax was signalled on the platform and not, where it should have been heard, in this democratic assembly but at the gathering of muintir na hÉireann, as Deputy Tunney referred to them at the last Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis.  There are historic precedents for the abolition of taxes but Fianna Fáil do not want to talk about them, because in both instances they referred to a benefit being conferred on the wealthy and not on the needy.  Indeed, if the farmers were paying their full share of local community taxation some of the enormous difficulties that local authorities are experiencing, including County Louth to which Deputy Kirk referred, would not be so acute as they are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I have great pleasure in introducing Private Members' Business on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  We have carefully studied all aspects of braodcasting and have prepared a Bill which will cater for development both in radio and television in the years ahead.  In bringing forward this important Bill, we have clearly given the lead to this incompetent Government. We are, in a sense, a Government by Opposition and in Opposition.  The Government are either incapable of responding or unwilling to respond to the crisis situation which has arisen in broadcasting due to the insensitive and highhanded action taken either by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Mitchell, or the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Nealon was given certain responsibilities in broadcasting, I then warned of the danger of control by him over RTE of propaganda on behalf of Fine Gael and, indeed, of the Coalition Government.  Seemingly, he wants to exercise a similar control over our independent <Col N="968" /> broadcasting.  The radio stations outside his control had to be silenced. Hence the harsh, ruthless, cruel measure adopted on a Minister's instruction without warning on Wednesday, 18 May, to close Radio Nova and Radio Kiss FM, followed by the closure of Radio Sunshine. I requested the Minister to state clearly who signed the order and if the instructions came from the BBC to the British Foreign Office and via our Department of Foreign Affairs.  Was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, aware of the instructions from London as outlined in the High Court case as reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 2 June, 1983?  In this report of the proceedings in the High Court, the officials from the Department stated:</P>
    <P>Most seriously, however, a specific complaint about the company's broadcasts had formally been made to Ireland by the Home Office of the United Kingdom.  It appeared from their letter that substantial interference had been caused by Radio Nova in areas of the UK and the Minister had been called on to remedy this situation...</P>
    <P>The instructions, in other words, seemingly came via the British Home Office to the Minister via the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I would like Minister Mitchell to state quite clearly when replying to the debate tonight whether he is under instructions from London as far as broadcasting within this State is concerned. I would regard that situation as a serious infringement of our democracy, our freedom of movement and of action. A Fianna Fáil Minister would never be under any control from the British Home Office.</P>
    <P>Minister Nealon has taken a certain amount of responsibility or, at least, credit or blame, which ever is applied, in relation to the closing down of the stations.  A Minister with responsibility for broadcasting has not been delegated authority under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926, and perhaps the Minister would again clarify exactly who is responsible for that area of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Various people have disclaimed <Col N="969" /> responsibility.  The Taoiseach seemingly was not aware of the action that was going to be taken by the Minister and I wonder if the Minister of State was aware of it.  Furthermore, on the signing of the order for the action taken, seemingly the Minister headed off for sunny Portugal to be away from the flak which would occur from our young people as a result of the action taken by the Government. In the last few days a statement has issued from the Minister to which I will come later.</P>
    <P>We of the Fianna Fáil Party took positive action in relation to broadcasting. We prepared our Independent Local Broadcasting Authority Bill which has wide powers and would give the facilities to provide an overall independent broadcasting within the State.  As far as reacting to a situation is concerned, I completely reject those allegations made by Minister Nealon and other Deputies on the Government side of the House.  When I was appointed front bench spokesman for Posts and Telegraphs in February 1983, the leader of our party, Deputy Haughey, requested me to give priority to independent local broadcasting. Because of the urgency of the matter we devoted our back-up committee meetings to preparing the legislation.  Our chairman of that committee, Deputy Cowen, the secretary, Deputy John Browne, and the committee must be congratulated on their work in assisting me in relation to the preparation of this Bill.  We worked on that legislation at every committee meeting for the last few months and had the Bill prepared and ready for printing at the time when the Government struck in relation to the closing of the stations in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Minister Mitchell has accused me, as spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs, of preparing a Bill which is a variation of the 1981 Local Radio Bill.  I accept that fully.  Again, it is the consistency and continuity within the Fianna Fáil Party and Government &mdash; we believe in following up good legislation.  In this case we revised it to cater for modern needs in relation to broadcasting.  We have allowed it to cater at some stage for developments in relation to independent <Col N="970" /> local television, which is a possibility in the years ahead, so that the stations could be licensed.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, in view of difficulties being experienced in some parts of the country in relation to television reception, a development of a system of deflectors or rebroadcasting of television signals is taking place at the moment.  This Bill will also allow the authority to investigate the situation regarding these broadcasting stations and provide an opportunity for licensing.</P>
    <P>The Bill is broad in its concept and will cater for all the possibilities and opportunities in relation to broadcasting in this country.  Government Opposition to the Bill is very weak.  I reject their amendments to our Bill.  Our Bill caters for local broadcasting and is community orientated as well as giving commercial opportunities. If there was no commercial aspect to broadcasting it would be difficult for any station to survive in the long term.  A job creation potential, must be involved in setting up local radio stations. This is evident from the success of the stations which have been broadcasting here for some time with regard to the creation of jobs there, but many jobs have been lost in the last few weeks as a result of the action taken by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I charge Minister Nealon with misleading the personnel involved in broadcasting by his statements on the RTE television programme &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; when he was interviewed by presenter Pat Kenny in March of this year.  The Minister first stated: &ldquo;We have to get the pirates off the air&rdquo;.  That is a direct quotation.</P>
    <P>In response to Pat Kenny's question: &ldquo;Are you determined to do that?&rdquo;  the Minister said: &ldquo;Most certainly, but I think the way to do it at this stage is in association with bringing on local radio so that you do not leave a vaccum and create all sorts of difficulties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Pat Kenny then asked: &ldquo;People who run stations, would you allow them to apply?&rdquo;  Minister Nealon replied: &ldquo;...various censures which you could apply: If you go off the air by July 1 or August 1, you could then apply&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will confirm <Col N="971" /> the words that he stated publicly at that stage.  He stated clearly to the people operating the stations that they would have an opportunity to apply and that he would give them adequate notice before he moved in the troops to close down the stations.  The Minister was clearly indicating his general policy in relation to that area of broadcasting.  The people involved listened to him because he had been given responsibility for broadcasting and they felt his words meant something. However, they were empty words. Within a few months key personnel in his Department moved in and closed down the stations in a most ruthless and heartless way depriving young people of a service they enjoyed.  They supported the stations and got immense enjoyment from them.  It was a big blow to young people from an entertainment point of view.</P>
    <P>Our policy all along was to bring forward two Bills at the one time, the Radio and Telegraphy Bill, 1979 and a Broadcasting Bill.  We would have had the legal framework to restrict people from broadcasting and also the framework to give these and other stations the opportunity to apply for and receive licences.</P>
    <P>The Radio and Telegraphy Act, 1976 is totally inadequate.  That is why we prepared proper legislation which we had intended to bring before the Dáil in 1981. Due to the election we did not get an opportunity to bring that Bill forward.  If we were in power we would have brought it forward at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Minister or Ministers of State have not given priority to this area.  With the back-up staff the Minister has at his disposal and the fact that he has been given sole responsibility for broadcasting he should have got down to work and brought forward a proposal by now and have it passed before the summer recess. I appeal to Deputies to give proper consideration to voting for this Bill.  If it does not go through the House I hope the Minister will bring forward his own legislation before the summer recess to enable legal broadcasting to take place before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>There is a new generation of radio <Col N="972" /> listeners.  Young people are more discerning and demanding than before. Fianna Fáil's initiative in producing this legislation indicates that we recognise the needs of young people and reflects the attitude of Fianna Fáil members who are more than anxious that we bring forward legislation at the earliest opportunity to organise and control broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I call on every Deputy who has ever availed of the facilities offered by the pirate stations to show his or her concern now by voting for the Bill.  Deputies on the Government side owe it to the broadcasters to support the Bill because many of them would not have been elected to the House if it was not for the support they received from broadcasting stations operating around the Dublin area.  It is a sad reflection on their interest that they are not here tonight.  So many of them who queued up to appear at all times on these stations are sadly missing tonight when they would have had an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  They are showing their interest in broadcasting by their lack of attendance.</P>

      <P>I hope he will support legislation to enable broadcasting to take place.  Since this controversy broke the normally not too shy Deputies who are willing to make comments on radio and television have been silent on this issue. They have not put pressure on the Minister or the Government to expedite the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very broad, detailed Bill.  If we had had the opportunity we would have made it a priority to bring in legislation. Perhaps in the not too distant future we may have an opportunity to be on those benches and we will bring forward the legislation.  The Government have been sadly lacking in this regard. The only action they took was to close down the stations and deprive young <Col N="973" /> people of the facilities.  In the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 3 June it seemed as if the Minister had second thoughts about the closure of the stations.  The Minister stated that it was his policy to phase out the illegal stations at the same time as introducing the new licensed stations.  On 18 May his officials closed down the stations. In that newspaper the Minister stated that it was never his intention to close down the illegal stations before his Department was ready to give licences. Who closed the stations?  Was it the Minister or is he putting the blame on his Minister of State?</P>
    <P>The Minister availed early and often of the facilities of Radio Dublin.  I should like him to refute that and indeed I challenge him to do so.  It is on record that he often spoke on that radio station in his constituency and as a result he probably gave support to that system of broadcasting. He did not sign a warrant for Radio Dublin and close it down.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to state if it is his policy to allow the stations to start up again and not take any action before the end of the year.  The Minister should state clearly if it is his policy to allow the stations to continue until the end of the year.  I hope that is his policy.  I will encourage him in that regard but he should have considered that policy before taking the action to close down the stations and put many people out of work. There is a certain ambivalence on the part of the Minister because the stations were paying PRSI, PAYE and company tax.  They had telephones from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. With our unemployment level we can ill afford the loss of jobs which has occurred as a result of the Government's action. This Government will go down in history as the job destruction Government. Unemployment has risen dramatically since they took office in December 1982, and by their actions they are contributing every day to further unemployment.  In one fell swoop they have removed many worthwhile jobs and deprived young people, many of whom are probably unemployed, of the opportunity of enjoying the services that were provided by the stations concerned.  The principal features <Col N="974" /> of the Bill would be: the establishment of an independent local broadcasting authority consisting of eight to 12 members appointed by the Government; the authority to provide local broadcasting services as a public service of information, education and entertainment in addition to the broadcasting services of RTE; and programme contractors to enter into contracts with the authority to provide local broadcasting services that would be community based, community orientated and community supported.</P>
    <P>There must be a community aspect to this because it is local and community broadcasting.  Many of the stations I have been listening to in the past few years have provided a good local service and have given people who would not perhaps normally have such opportunity the opportunity of being on the national television or radio networks.  It is the basic principle of local broadcasting to facilitate local areas, local community councils and voluntary organisations but it must operate hand in hand with a form of commercial radio.  Contracts would be given to people who would put a package together linked with the locality and involving local interests.  Our Bill provides that before establishing a station the authority would have to be satisfied that it would be in accordance with good economic principles and be operated by suitable contractors who expressed the wish to become involved in such activity. Unless there is an aspect of commercialisation together with the community interests, a station would not be in a position to provide jobs for young broadcasters.</P>
    <P>Many Ministers and Ministers of State &mdash; I think of the Minister of State at the Department of Labour &mdash; have been heard regularly and have entertained on local radio services.  Yet, they were very silent in relation to the closing down of these stations.  There is total inconsistency on the part of the Government in this whole matter.  They should have been aware of the service which many of the broadcasters were providing for the local areas.  We propose that the contractors who provide a service maintain high standards, are responsive to the interests <Col N="975" /> of the community, have regard to Irish cultural traditions, and offer news, information and entertainment consistent with local services.  We propose that they use Irish produced and recorded material to the maximum extent possible. In that regard, the Irish produced and recorded material should be given pride of place in any local broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>There are many people employed in the entertainment area whose situation is very serious now.  That is why in this Bill we are encouraging the use of Irish produced material to the greatest extent possible. That is a section of the Bill that we would expect to be regarded by the authority as a guideline.  There is a requirement in respect of RTE 1 and RTE 2 in relation to percentage of Irish produced material which is broadcast. That is only right and proper.  It would be for the authority to decide the percentage if that was required at any stage in respect of stations that were not giving at least some attention to the place of Irish material.  This is a fast growing business area and one that needs support. The more Irish produced and Irish recorded material that can be used on local broadcasting stations, the more potential there is for young people engaged in the entertainment business.</P>
    <P>I should like to ensure also that the news and current affairs programmes would not be vested in a person who exercised editorial or other control over newspapers.  What we must aim for is the portrayal of a balanced view of a local area.  We must have a certain amount of competition but we do not wish to have a monopoly situation in any area where, for instance, a newspaper chain could take complete control of the editorial and current affairs sections of an independent local radio.  A monopoly situation would not be helpful to broadcasting.</P>
    <P>We propose that having gauged the need for local broadcasting services as a result of public meetings or consultations, the authority would adjudicate on the proposals of interested parties having regard to the quality and range of programmes proposed, adequacy of expertise and resources available, association <Col N="976" /> with local communities, employment content, existing involvement in local broadcasting and other matters as the authority see fit.  It would be the proper approach for the authority to ensure that when a station was set up it would survive and would recognise the needs of the locality and respond to them.  Naturally we propose that programme would include advertisements but subject to approved tariffs and to maximum periods of air time.  We propose that advertisements directed towards religious or political ends or dealing with industrial disputes would have to be gauged carefully and not necessarily be part of the broadcasting material.  Also, the authority would determine the hours of broadcasting of any station established under the Act.  This would provide for consistency in the number of hours and the control of the services that would be provided. We propose that the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs may direct the authority to refrain from broadcasting material that was likely to promote or incite crime, or which would tend to undermine the authority of the State.  It is only right that the State would exercise a certain control over the stations and that they would do so in consultation with the Minister.  We propose that the programme contracts be for a maximum of five years which would be renewable in most cases if the stations were providing a good service.  At least this would ensure that the highest standards would obtain at all times and that the contractors would be aware of the need for these high standards.</P>
    <P>In relation to the general membership of the board, I would be anxious that the local board would be representative of the arts, of journalism and of the broadcasting fields and would have expertise from the radio and television sides of the business.  The board should be representative of the regions also and have regard for the interests of all the voluntary organisations who would be represented on the boards to ensure that there would be a representative balance throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We propose that the programme contractors would pay the authority sums to be specified by the Minister as well as <Col N="977" /> other sums specified in the contract. There would be the aspect of paying for the licence but due regard would have to be paid to the area serviced by the local radio station and to allow for stations in more uneconomic areas of the country where there would not be the same response from advertisers as there would be in the major cities.</P>
    <P>I could visualise a situation in which the licence would be practically nil in local areas in order to allow stations to survive.  There is no point in charging an exorbitant rate for a licence and then finding that the station was not in a positive to survive.  Many of the stations would have to pay the performing rights fees and all the other charges which arise in respect of broadcasting material.  In addition, the cost of running a station is extremely high in relation to the provision of electricity and all the other services that would be involved.  That is the outline of the Bill.</P>
    <P>We are also providing for the development of local television broadcasting. There is a strong possibility that in the years ahead there will be a demand for local television and I should like to see an independent broadcasting authority having the power to issue licences when the need arises.  We must have the necessary framework in order to prevent the possibility of illegal television broadcasting. Our Bill would allow for the issue of licences at some time in the future.  Many people feel there is a need for an independent television station.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the Bill would allow for the issue of licences to people operating deflector systems.  The Minister will be aware that many parts of the country are not receiving stations from overseas.  Contractors have already tendered for the provision of piped television services to places such as Galway, Ballinasloe, Sligo, Ballina and elsewhere. There is a great need, particularly in rural areas, for rebroadcasting or the use of the deflector system and the Minister should allow for the possible issue of licences to regulate the position.</P>
    <P>We have taken positive steps to solve the crisis that has arisen.  The Minister and the Minister of State have been careless <Col N="978" /> in their approach and have not taken a particular interest in this matter.  Their actions have been totally unacceptable. Their words were empty and their actions were forceful.  The Minister, who is not here this evening, declared an amnesty last Friday and the Minister of State should now clarify the position.  The Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, was not available for comment on 18 May when he departed for Portugal, having already closed down the stations.  Pressure was exerted on him by members of his own party and he has now stated that he will not close any more stations before the end of the year or until the legislation is enacted.  That is the approach which should have been adopted in the beginning and many problems would have been prevented if he had not acted in the way he did.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister of State to outline the legislative steps proposed.  I would also ask the Government to bring forward their legislation as quickly as possible or else to support this Bill.  Why not support a Bill which has been carefully prepared and is now before the Dáil?  This would allow the authority to be established before the end of this month.  Deputies on the Government benches should respond to their constituents who are calling for this type of legislation.  Many of those involved in broadcasting are anxious that the services they provide should not be regarded as illegal.  They wish to establish fully licensed stations giving full-time employment. They do not want to have to look over their shoulders every time a Government Minister makes a statement.</P>
    <P>A very orderly and responsible approach was adopted by the young people who marched to the Dáil and I compliment them and the people involved in organising that march.  It was a legitimate action by our young people in showing the politicians exactly what they want.  They want to become involved in the exciting challenges provided by independent radio.  Our young people are well educated and articulate and fully capable of tackling every aspect of broadcasting. Some of our finest young commentators and disc jockeys were given <Col N="979" /> their first opportunity by these local stations and many of them have moved on to RTE Radio 2 and overseas, as well as into the television area.  The Minister is in a position to take the necessary action to provide the service which these young people want.</P>
    <P>We are adopting a very responsible approach and giving a lead to the Government.  We have given priority treatment to this area.  Our Leader, Deputy Haughey, realised the need for this Bill to enable independent local radio and he gave me a mandate, together with a back-up committee from Fianna Fáil, to bring forward this legislation as quickly as possible.  We acted positively and prepared what I regard as a fine piece of legislation.  It is a historic event in that the Opposition party are in a position to introduce a Bill before the Government are able to do so.  The Government, with all their back-up staff and advisers, did not take the proper action.  We have adopted a proper approach.  This is the first Bill brought forward by our party in Opposition and we are giving the lead by indicating exactly how we would tackle this aspect of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>This Bill caters for local communities and gives scope for broadcasting at its best.  There is an opportunity for existing broadcasters to apply for licences in a proper manner.  It was stated recently in a magazine called &ldquo;Sunshine Radio Give-Away&rdquo; that this Bill would be costly to implement.  I refute that allegation Under this Bill we would have the right to provide transmitters, to license transmitters or to approve of existing transmitters which would comply with international standards.  This would ensure that existing stations would be able to apply for approval of their facilities.</P>
    <P>The Government's approach is unacceptable and the Fianna Fáil response is the right and positive one which has been accepted by those involved in broadcasting, many of whom are in attendance here tonight.  The presence of so many young people in the public gallery is encouraging.  I hope this will encourage the Government to allow this Bill to be enacted without delay.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann declines to give a second reading to the Bill:</P>
      <P>(a)  because the Bill as presented is concerned only with the establishment of local broadcasting stations on commercial principles and does not make adequate provision for community oriented services, and</P>
      <P>(b)  because it is the Government's intention to proceed at an early date with legislation for the orderly development of local community radio services.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government are opposing this Bill because it is one designed with commercial radio only in view; because there are major internal conflicts within the Bill itself; and because we intend to introduce fresh legislation at an early date to provide for the orderly development of local radio services on a national basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have said that their Bill would make it possible to have legal local radio stations operating by the end of June.  In view of this let us first look at what the Opposition did with legislation on local radio when they themselves had their chances, when they were on this side of the House.  The Fianna Fáil Government of the day decided to draft a Local Radio Bill in May 1979.  By June 1980, more than a year later, the Bill had been drafted and ready: after that, a strange inertia but not total paralysis. Remember this was the time of the 20 seat majority, but nothing at all happened with the Local Radio Bill for one full year, until May 1981 when the then Taoiseach had already decided he was going to the country anyhow.  So from May 1979 to May 1981 there was plenty of time.  There were plenty of votes but no legislation on local radio.  Then in 1982 the Opposition, now so concerned and in so much of a hurry, got another chance. And still the Bill was not re-introduced. Deputy Leyden was Minister of State at <Col N="981" /> the time.  Though there was not total paralysis, during a period of six months one paragraph was added to the Bill, 18 words, three words a month.  Now back in Opposition, Deputy Leyden becomes a born-again instant legislator.</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is basically the text of the same Independent Local Radio Authority Bill of 1981, originally Deputy Reynolds' Bill.  The initiation of the Bill at this stage is clearly an act of political opportunism on the part of the Opposition.  I am sure that Deputy Reynolds will agree this is a crude Bill that does not do justice to some fine points in the original Bill.</P>
    <P>May I say, this Government recognise fully the urgency of introducing legislation to regulate the use of local radio and to bring order into what is, essentially, a near chaotic situation.  In our Programme for Government, there is a commitment that community radio will be developed in an orderly manner.  I was appointed Minister of State with special responsibility to give all aspects of broadcasting the priority the situation so clearly requires and which they have not got in recent years.  Since being given this special responsibility, about three months ago, already I have examined the various approaches to local broadcasting and proposals are already before the Government for consideration.  Naturally, I am not in a position to announce at this stage the details of that legislation &mdash; indeed it would be quite wrong of me to do so until Government consideration has been completed.  I can say, however, that it is our intention, and the Government's wish, that the services which will be provided will meet the very wide range of community needs and interests which should be catered for by local radio services.  It is also our intention that the legislation will allow the greatest possible degree of flexibility for the development of services of this type and that there will be no bias in favour of commercial stations as against community based enterprises.</P>
    <P>The speed with which action is being taken reflects, as I said, the Government's desire to bring about order in this whole area.  It is in marked contrast to <Col N="982" /> the inactivity and procrastination displayed by Fianna Fáil when in Government. If they had only been fractionally as concerned as they now wish to convey to the public that they are, we would not be dealing with the Bill before the House today; we would have had legislation some years ago.</P>
    <P>The record of Fianna Fáil has been one of masterly inactivity and indifference to the two-fold problems of providing for legitimate local radio services and the suppression of illegal broadcasting stations. To fully appreciate the manner in which they presided over the developing chaos of the airwaves it is necessary to go back to the late 1970s.</P>
    <P>Prior to then the operation of illegal broadcasting transmitters was rare.  However, about that time it became evident that a determined effort was being made to establish commercial radio stations in defiance of the law.  Those illegal stations became popular, particularly with young people and, it must be conceded, it became very professional, clearly demonstrating that there was a demand for local radio.</P>
    <P>Against all this background, Fianna Fáil proceeded to have a Bill, which was similar to the one we have now before us, after the 1979 deal with commercial local radio.  Then they did not do anything about it for an entire year.  The sudden burst of concern on the part of Fianna Fáil, their statement reported in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 26 May that their Bill would make it possible to have legal local radio stations operating by the end of June requires some explanation.  That explanation has not been given by Deputy Leyden.</P>
    <P>What is involved is political opportunism on the part of Fianna Fáil and a cover up for their absolute inexcusable inactivity during a long period while illegal stations were allowed to proliferate and when something could have been done easily.  Does Deputy Leyden believe it possible to establish local radio stations under this Bill within a month?</P>

      <P>Let us look at what is involved.  Even with the best will in the world it would take almost a month to get the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas and signed by the President. Deputy Leyden claims that not only was the will absent but much more besides. People would be invited to accept membership of the new Authority; the Authority would be established, staff would be appointed and all the necessary arrangements would be made to commence the Authority's business.</P>
      <P>Then, under section 17 of this Bill, the Authority would determine where local radio stations would be viable and a suitable programme contractor would become available.  The Authority would than seek licences from the Minister for those services and then would proceed to obtain the necessary transmitter and would erect it.  Under section 22 of this Bill the Authority in the same short period would hold consultations and public meetings, invite applications from people interested in becoming programme contractors, would adjudicate on those applications and then decide on a suitable contractor&mdash;all before the end of June.</P>
      <P>Where there is a will there is a way, we were told a few moments ago.  The selected contractor would then provide all the necessary facilities and organise staff and other resources to provide the services.  And Deputy Leyden expects all this to be done within his timetable.  I do not think he is fooling anyone with that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil must realise that if this Bill were to become law it would be a considerable time, with the best will in the world before legal local radio services would be available.  It is important that this should clearly be recognised, spelled out and that we do not attempt to deceive anybody.  All the steps I described earlier, and many more, would have to be taken.  We must all be realistic about the time factor involved to sort out this problem. In view of that it is all the more regrettable that it was not sorted out when it first arose.  We should never have arrived at our present point of departure. We are here because of the inexplicable <Col N="984" /> failure of Fianna Fáil to act over many years.</P>
    <P>It is my responsibility now to tackle the problem and I intend to do so.  I assure Deputies I will do so as quickly as possible considering all that must be gone through, and there is no shortage.  There is now an urgent need for order to be restored to the radio spectrum, which is a very valuable natural resource.  I am sure that this is something which the pirates acknowledge and agree with.  The radio spectrum is a finite natural resource and if used properly can be of enormous benefit for a range of services, including local radio.  The radio spectrum has to be carefully planned and regulated nationally and internationally in order to accommodate the various services which can use it and to minimise harmful interference between services.</P>
    <P>On the international level countries agree to abide by the radio regulations of the International Telecommunications Union, a specialised agency of the United Nations.  By implementing the provisions of the regulations countries ensure the proper use of the spectrum and minimise interference across national boundaries. There is no other way in which this can be done.  When complaints are received they are received under the regulations I quoted.  Indeed, I could find no greater tribute to those regulations than one I have before me in elequent tones delivered by Deputy Wilson when he was Minister. The existence of unlicensed stations here places Ireland clearly in breach of the radio regulations.</P>
    <P>Nationally, radio equipment cannot be operated except in accordance with licences issued under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.  It is fair to say&mdash;in this case I will address my remarks to the Dáil; I will not refer to the Gallery attendance&mdash;that nobody wishes to deny people a reasonable choice of broadcasting service.  Such a choice can never be achieved however through the form of free for all which has existed in recent years.  That cannot be done on any sort of permanent basis.  I believe there is universal agreement on that.  Developments will have to be in an orderly fashion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> The Government are at present considering the details of the legislative framework which will facilitate that development. There will be no delay in finalising that legislation and in introducing it to the Oireachtas.  I am confident that when the draft legislation that will be approved by the Government is enacted the provision of the new services will proceed quickly.</P>
    <P>The present unsatisfactory position has arisen partly because of the inadequate powers contained in the existing legislation. It was recognised that in order to maintain order in the use of the radio frequency spectrum it would be necessary to proceed with a Bill to strengthen the powers of the Minister to suppress illegal broadcasting and to ensure the orderly use of the wireless telegraphy or radio equipment generally.  The Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill, 1979, was prepared for this reason.</P>
    <P>As the Fianna Fáil Opposition well know, the 1979 Bill, prepared on their instruction, had a twin purpose.  One was to prevent the making of broadcasts from anywhere within the State unless in accordance with a licence issued by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It proposed to make it an offence for anyone to provide accommodation, equipment or programme material for unlicensed broadcasts, or to advertise by means of, or take part in, such broadcasts.  The Bill was broadly on the lines of Broadcasting (Offences) Act, 1968, which was enacted to suppress broadcasting from ships, aircraft and marine structures.  The Bill provided for penalties for broadcasting offences of fines of up to £10,000 or two years imprisonment in cases of conviction on indictment.  The second purpose was to strengthen the powers of the Minister under the Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1926.</P>
    <P>The approach in the 1979 Bill was to persuade not only those involved in illegal broadcasting but also those who gave it any material support to cease doing so. This approach was successfully used in the Broadcasting (Offences) Act, 1968, which dealt effectively, by concerted international action, with the problem of illegal broadcasting from ships.  However, <Col N="986" /> the 1979 Bill suffered the same fate as the Independent Local Radio Authority Bill, 1981.  It was introduced in the Dáil in April 1979, but it was never subsequently debated.  It lapsed with the dissolution of the Dáil in May 1981, and was never reintroduced.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to proceed with legislation on very much the same lines of the 1979 Bill concurrently with the legislation to provide for the orderly development of community radio services. Unregulated use of the frequency spectrum can cause serious problems and we have had many complaints in recent times.  Among the most serious was one received from the North Eastern Health Board who reported that their radio system for the accident and emergency service was rendered useless for a period of four days, from 16 to 19 April of this year, due to interference from an outside source.  This was the case also with the Drogheda and Dundalk fire services and with the Meath fire service.  This interference was reported to my Department on 19 April last by the North Eastern Health Board.  A similar complaint of severe interference to the Dublin City Ambulance Services was reported on the same day by the Eastern Health Board.  On receipt of the complaints my Department monitored the fire and ambulance radio frequency bands.  Tests established that the interference was caused by a combination of signals from Radio Nova and KISS FM.</P>
    <P>Radio frequencies in use at Dublin Airport have also been subject to extensive interference.  This interference affected frequencies used by aircraft when taxiing and immediately after take-off and frequencies used by airport, fire and emergency services and the Defence Forces.  Radio Sunshine was positively identified as the source of the interference in a number of cases.  Garda and Army communications have also been subjected to interference by pirate radio stations.  This has resulted in the loss of communications with mobile units involved in essential security duties.</P>
    <P>The potential consequences of interference in cases of the type of which I have mentioned cannot be overstated. <Col N="987" /> The safety of lives must be of paramount concern in any case where aeronautical services or emergency services are concerned. Once the source of interference of these services has been identified the possibility of recurrent interference could not be accepted without taking some action.</P>
    <P>Illegal broadcasting stations have also affected radio and television reception in very many areas.  Radio Sunshine in particular has been responsible for a deterioration in the reception of authorised services throughout an extensive area in north Dublin.  Harmful interference has been caused to authorised broadcasting stations in Britain which have been subject to considerable disruption due to the activities of Radio Nova here.  This interference has been the subject of a formal complaint under the radio regulations of the International Telecommunications Union.</P>
    <P>There were persistent reports in recent months of plans for larger and more extensive illegal developments.  These included plans to broadcast internationally from this country.  Such developments, if they were allowed to occur, would inevitably have given rise to even more serious interference problems than have been experienced to date.  There have also been attempts in the past year to establish illegal television stations.  I want to make it clear that developments of this sort could not be tolerated.</P>
    <P>Illegal broadcasting must be phased out and legal services developed in an orderly manner under a new legislative framework.  We must aim for that.</P>

      <P>To turn again to the Bill before us, the text is, as I said earlier, basically that of the Independent Local Radio Bill, 1981, with some minor adjustments. Deputy Leyden has said that this new Bill is intended to allow the proposed Authority to concern itself with the questions of independent television and other possible future developments in broadcasting. <Col N="988" /> The Deputy, in the course of an interview on the RTE radio programme, &ldquo;This Week&rdquo; on Sunday 22 May, stated that his party had been working on the Bill for some time and has had the benefit of a parliamentary back-up advisory committee. He said the same thing tonight. I must confess that I cannot see any evidence of the impact of this work in the 1981 Bill.</P>
      <P>There is of course a new television dimension, but how has this been achieved?  Simply, as far as I can see, by erasing or scrubbing out the word &ldquo;sound&rdquo; before &ldquo;sound broadcasting&rdquo;&mdash; and there you have a new television dimension.  This is the first example of legislation before this House which might be described reasonably as legislation by Tippex.</P>
      <P>The Bill before is one designed with commercial local radio only in view. There is an emphasis throughout the Bill that services must be commercially viable.  No attempt is made to ensure that services are spread throughout the country. The condition specified in the Bill would, in my view, tend to confine local radio services to the larger cities because only there could a financial return be assured.  There is no suggestion that large profitable stations might assist smaller less profitable ones.  Neither is there any indication that community groups might be assisted in attempts to develop the services to meet the needs of the areas which they serve.  No account has been taken of the obviously different criteria that must apply if the scope of the proposed Authority is to be extended to television.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very good example of this and of the cosmetic exercise involved in television is in section 22 which gives the proposed Authority power only to establish whether there is a demand for independent local sound broadcasting services; the Authority would have no power to consider the question of independent television under the Bill as it stands.  Therefore, in this big new television dimension to the Bill which we heard about tonight the vital paragraph is not giving any authority.  The word &ldquo;sound&rdquo; remains <Col N="989" /> and we must ask did Deputy Leyden's Tippex run out?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is another example we might look at.  Section 18 makes no distinction between radio and television. Its provisions would prove impossible to observe in practice.  That section requires that the services should offer a broad range of news, information and entertainment consistent with the local character of the services, they should utilise to the greatest possible extent Irish produced, recorded, published and performed material, and the programmes broadcast from different stations for reception in different localities should not consist of identical or similar material to such an extent as would be inconsistent with the character of the services as local broadcasting services.  How is it envisaged that any purely local television service would be able to afford a range of services on those lines?  Where would the programmes come from?</P>
      <P>All in all it seems to me that the Opposition have given no thought at all to the implications of including television within the scope of the new Authority. They do not appear to have considered in what circumstances local television services might be provided nor have they thought of the cost of such services which are likely to be at least ten times or maybe 20 or 30 times as great as those of radio services.  The Bill does not advert to the provision of local community television services by cable which seems a much more likely means of providing such services at some time in the future.  The provision of television services in that way would be covered by the Wireless Telegraphy (Wired Broadcast Relay Licence) Regulations, 1974.  Those regulations empowered the Minister to require cable television licensees to provide a channel on their cable systems for the relaying of locally originated programming. If the Authority are to supervise local television services as well as local radio the Bill should provide for supervision over locally originated programming on cable systems; it does not do so of course &mdash; it refers only to broadcast programmes, a different thing entirely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I say, it seems that the Opposition <Col N="991" /> have really given no thought to the implications of including television broadcasting within the scope of the Bill.  Having made these criticisms of the claims made for the present Bill, I should say that the considerations affecting local radio and local television are quite different and that the two should be legislated for separately &mdash; if, in fact, a demand emerges for local TV that needs to be catered for separately, and I think it will.</P>
    <P>There are going to be major advances in the availability of television services, both through satellite and through cable. It is safe to predict that in five years' time viewers in Ireland will have five satellite stations to choose from in addition to the stations they can now receive on their television sets.  They will be able to receive these communally through cable systems or through a simple antenna dish. It will not even be necessary to put the dish on a chimney.  Cable television will also see major developments. This may not occur as fast as the developments in satellite television but inevitably there will be developments as in the United States and Canada where local cable television systems carry as many as 30 or 40 channels.  These are the developments we can expect in the near future.  None of these has been dealt with in Deputy Leyden's Bill.</P>
    <P>An editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i> on 4 May 1983 stated:</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill of 1981, which fell with that Government, proposed a system of local broadcasting in which commercial interests would probably have dominated and in which the profit motive would likely have been the prime one.</P>
    <P>The emphasis in this Bill which Deputy Leyden now presents, as in the 1981 Bill, is on commercial viability of stations. That comes out in section 17.  It is also clear from the lack of any provision in the Bill which would facilitate the development of local radio services by noncommercial interests or in areas where the economic viability of services might be in any way marginal or doubtful.</P>
    <P>I note with some amazement that section <Col N="992" /> 27 of the Bill proposes to include power to make repayable advances not exceeding £10 million to the proposed Authority from the Exchequer.  The enabling provision in the 1981 Bill was not exceeding £2 million.  Given the Fianna Fáil claim that local radio could be operating under their Bill by the summer might I ask where they envisage the necessary Exchequer assistance can come from?</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating that the introduction of the Bill is a piece of opportunism, that it would not supply the type of framework to provide for the orderly development of local radio on a national basis, and that the time-scale proposed for implementation is totally unrealistic.  The Government are pressing ahead with the preparation of legislation and with the making of advance arrangements that will enable legal local radio to be implemented on the most acceptable basis for the community generally and that will not have the defects of the Bill now under discussion.</P>

      <P>In addressing myself to the text of this Bill I should like first of all to address the Minister of State, the Government <i>in absentia</i>, Deputies from Fine Gael and Labour <i>in absentia</i> and ask them why they did not come down to this Chamber to listen to the views expressed on both sides of the House on the very serious public concern outside this House about the seeming inability and unwillingness of the Government to respond to the very legitimate needs, tastes and desires of the public at large and particularly our young population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Might I remind the Minister of State in the context of the need for an updating of the present legislation that it was his Government and his former Minister for <Col N="994" /> Finance who introduced a Bill dealing with Dáil reform, a Bill which would prove to the people outside the responsiveness of Members of the House to the ever-changing circumstances of Irish society?  We were to be seen to be vigilant in our actions and deeds as well as in our speeches.  I regret the absence of Deputies from the opposite benches.  In the recent past they put forward the view to the public that they are concerned about our young people.  I want to quote for the Minister of State an oft-quoted statistic: 50 per cent of our population are under 25 years of age, a population ever-questioning, discerning and rapidly developing in thought and in intellect.</P>
    <P>I want an explanation from the Minister's side of the House of the absence of those Deputies this evening.  I want him to explain to the young people who went to the trouble of coming into the Public Gallery this evening why they did not see fit to come in here and show an urgent interest in accommodating the community and individual needs and tastes of the people outside the House.  Is it that they are afraid?  Is it that they know the Minister of State is refusing to acknowledge what is out there, refusing to acknowledge that in the 1979 Bill we have the mechanism for what is needed right now to broaden the facilities which are monopolised at present?  I have heard this increasingly in recent days from our young population and from their parents, that RTE are rapidly losing touch with reality and failing to accommodate the views and tastes of our fast-growing young population.</P>
    <P>I am saddened by this absence this evening.  I am saddened that they see no justification for being present here to take serious cognisance of the terms of this Bill.  In speaking here tonight I am motivated by a desire to see this Dáil and this Oireachtas responding in a positive and constructive manner to the current needs of our people both young and old.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a speech I made in the Dáil on Dáil reform.  I felt this House was cumbersome and unwieldy in its structures and its Standing Orders, incapable of or unwilling to face up to current pressing and serious issues.  The Fianna <Col N="995" /> Fáil Bill is a careful and constructive attempt to respond to serious issues and needs.  We have to ask ourselves what are the facts.  I have already stated that half of our population are under 25 years of age.  It is the duty of the State to understand and appreciate and cater for the tastes and needs of our young and rapidly growing population, to cater for them in a positive, constructive and enlightened way.  I regret the stand taken by the Minister of State this evening.  He took the text of our Bill and imposed a negative interpretation on it.  He refused to face up to the expansive and wide terms of reference proposed in our Bill, the flexibility it offers to an authority, the futuristic and modern approach incorporated in it.  This is an attempt by the Minister to evade the issue.</P>
    <P>If he is so concerned about these young people, rather than criticising our Bill why did he not bring in his Bill?  Why is it not here before us this evening so that I and other Deputies could say: &ldquo;This amendment is his Bill and we have something to chew there.&rdquo;  Sadly for the people who are listening and for the people who will read his remarks tomorrow, all we got to chew were little gems of negative wit about rubs of Tippex.  This is a sad reflection on the Government's attitude and their motivation towards facing these issues seriously.  The sooner they face up to the reality of this Bill and what it proposes to do about the absence of facilities, the better they will be performing and the more constructive role they will be playing.</P>
    <P>In a number of ways the Minister of State agrees with me that for a considerable time now existing structures such as RTE have failed dismally to appreciate the tastes and needs of the new generation as they are popularly termed.  There has been extreme dissatisfaction with a broadcasting authority which many of them describe as having lost their way.  I am not saying that I subscribe to that view, but I believe there is a certain validity in it.  After all, if the overwhelming majority of our young population turn away from the semi-State structure which has been offered a monopoly through the decades <Col N="996" /> there is something seriously wrong.  I believe it is the failure of this monopolistic authority to take due account of what is happening in the world outside its structure.  It is, therefore, inevitably failing dismally to make a serious and positive effort to accommodate and cater for the various interest groups.</P>
    <P>I will give one example of the kind of needs in our community today arising out of a greater awareness, enlightenment, and increase in the educational standards of our young people.  I recently came across a case of a young girl confined to a wheelchair.  Some neighbours of mine asked me to make representations to the Gay Byrne Hour for this lady to try to identify a flats complex owner somewhere in a particular area of the northside who might have the necessary facilities to enable this young girl to have access to a house.  It is a very difficult facility to have in a flats complex.  I approached the Gay Byrne Hour and one or two programmers in RTE.</P>

      <P>They told me they could not do it.  I asked them if they would accept this was a very genuine need.  They conceded that, but they said they were a national broadcasting organisation and they could not cater, albeit in a very needy case, for the needs of this girl.  I said I did not want my name mentioned. Within days of having failed with the national broadcasting organisation and having reported back to the friends and relations of this young lady, they very quickly went to the local pirate radio who were promptly responsive to her need. They very quickly got it on the air.  I should add that subsequently there was one offer from Radio Éireann to try to accommodate this need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am trying to illustrate the facility available to the local radio to respond promptly to what was a very genuine cause.  I believe the function of any broadcasting authority must surely be to accommodate the widest possible range of tastes.  If they fail to do so then inevitably there is a duty incumbent on the State to provide the necessary additional structures <Col N="997" /> to ensure that fairness and equity obtain on the airways for all our people, both young and old.  Our young people have told us that they do not regard the existing legitimate legal structures as offering to them a degree of fairness in terms of its programme taste or content. We have a duty to take serious cognisance of that and to reflect that duty in the House at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>I want to approach another aspect of this in what I believe is a logical manner. I put down a parliamentary question earlier this year to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister of State present in the House tonight answered it. I asked him when he proposed to establish an independent local radio authority. The Minister of State informed me that he was bringing that Bill before the House very shortly.  He conceded, in reply to supplementary questions by me, that existing legislation was inadequate to cope with, accommodate and embrace the enormously wide interests among our population for broadcasting services. That admission is on record in the Official Report.  That admission surely meant that existing legislation was inadequate Recently, despite this, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; we still do not know who authorised this &mdash; tried to implement that inadequate legislation, as conceded by the Minister of State. Surely, if legislation is inadequate and we want realistically and positively to face up to the fact, we update it to accommodate the new set of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year the Minister of State agreed basically with the principles of the 1981 Bill, or, as he referred to it this evening, the 1979 Bill brought before the House in 1981.  He agreed that the basic fundamental principles of the Bill were satisfactory to him, Deputies Leyden, Wilson, Reynolds and a number of other Deputies were present and we all conceded that we were willing there and then to facilitate the passage of this Bill through the House, if the main bones of it were there and the Minister was agreeable to it.  Instead the Minister of State chose, or perhaps it was his Minister or the civil servants in the Department chose, to apply the jackboot to a situation <Col N="998" /> and structures which were rapidly winning a phenomenal proportion of our population, who were rapidly building up tremendous goodwill albeit through illegal structures.  They were proving in no uncertain fashion that they could capture the imagination and service the needs of our young people in a positive, constructive and serious manner.</P>
    <P>I can give lots of proof, if the House wants it, of the tremendous work the local structures did for charitable and community organisations.  They did work for the CRC and many other charitable organisations.  How did they do it?  They did not do it on the basis of having two or three personnel deployed in fund raising. They did it on the basis of the manner in which they captured the imagination of our young people &mdash; the manner in which they could harness that imagination and goodwill they had built up to promote very deserving legitimate causes in our community.  This is a very definite reflection of the contribution they have made.</P>
    <P>When the Department of Posts and Telegraphs &mdash; I am not clear who authorised this &mdash; decided to apply the jackboot to these illegal radios inevitably it caused a huge public outcry.  It went to such an extreme during the course of one week that parents permitted their teenage sons and daughters to take to the streets in protest that the only facility making a serious attempt to contribute to the growth and welfare of their young people was being hammered down.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister of State has decided at last to put a stay on the action of his Department.  The reasons given are rather dubious.  The reasons given for the closure of the stations initially and for the application of what I consider the jackboot &mdash; references were made to it this evening &mdash; were that there was an interruption of emergency services and, therefore, that there was a very serious and pressing urgency that these stations be closed down.  If there was disruption a few weeks ago why will there not be disruption next week and the week after? What has happened in the meantime, what facilities have the Minister, the Minister of State or the Department obtained <Col N="999" /> to enable them to overcome these interferences in coming weeks and months?  They have said that they will not move against them again until there is legislation before the House.  I commend that decision but I ask them to justify in more legitimate, authentic and credible terms the reason they so decided.</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister of State to adopt our Bill as one that constructively and positively contributes to the needs of our young people and express my condemnation for the absence of Deputies from this House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £18,752,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, including sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>As is the usual practice I will discuss the Fisheries and Forestry Estimate together and I shall move the Forestry Estimate after the debate concludes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Government's efforts to reduce overall expenditure and borrowing the Fisheries Estimate shows a decrease of IR£822,000 over last year's vote.  The overall decrease is due mainly to a reduction in the amount allocated for the main fishery harbour works including payments to the Fishery Harbour Centres Fund, a reduction in the grant-in-aids to BIM for current and capital purposes and an increase in Appropriations-in-Aid from fines and forfeitures arising from the prosecution of foreign fishing vessels for illegal fishing. These reductions have been partly offset by increases in the cost of other services, mainly in the salary provisions and in the grants paid to the Central and Regional Fishery Boards.  I am satisfied <Col N="1000" /> that the reductions will not seriously affect the development of the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The value of domestic landings in 1982, excluding salmon landings, amounted to £43.7 million as against £35.4 million in 1981, an increase of 23.4 per cent.  In addition there were landings by Irish registered vessels into foreign ports valued at some £3.2 million.  The total quantity of fish landed at home ports in 1982 was 195,000 tonnes.  This is a record figure and represents an increase of 18,000 tonnes over the 1981 catch.  The industry also registered a new export record of £68 million which was 33? per cent up on the 1981 figure.</P>
    <P>Over 70 firms are at present involved in fish processing employing about 1,700 persons.  A total of 14 projects incorporating either new processing plants or extensions to existing ones were approved for grant purposes in the calendar year 1982 involving a total capital investment of £5.12 million including State investment of £1.1 million.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was finally reached at the Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels on 21 January 1983. Before going any further I would like to thank all of my predecessors, on both sides of the House, who contributed to what were protracted and difficult negotiations. This is an agreement of vital interest to the fishing industry and it is, therefore, appropriate that I should give some details, however brief, on the component elements of the agreement as they affect us.  They are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(1)  Access &mdash; This refers to access by member states to the waters of other member states.  The CFP provides for the maintenance of the existing six-mile zone exclusive to Irish fishermen and improvements have been achieved in the six- to 12-mile zone.  In addition, Irish vessels will continue to retain their existing rights to fish in the UK six- to 12-mile zone in the most productive parts of the Irish Sea and off the west of Scotland, the Isle of Man and Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>(2)  Quotas &mdash; These represent the share-out of the available total allowable catches which are based on scientific <Col N="1001" /> assessment of the state of the stocks. Normally such share-out is based on historic fishing patterns but in Ireland's case we are considerably aided by the existence of an agreement reached by the Council of Ministers in The Hague in 1976 to the effect that Ireland be allowed to double her 1975 catch by 1979.  It is appropriate that I pay tribute here to our Taoiseach who, as Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1976, played no small part in achieving that commitment.  In a situation where overall fish stocks in EEC waters have been decreasing year by year it has proved invaluable and indeed is the envy of many other member states in the Community.  The quotas agreed for 1982 compared very favourably with the targets established under The Hague agreement, the only exception being herring where there are restrictions on catches on grounds of conservation.  Even here, however, this was compensated for by an increased quota of mackerel.</P>
    <P>Our quotas have been mistakenly condemned on the grounds that we are offered only 4 per cent of the total fish available in the Community whereas we have 25 per cent of Community waters. This misleading statement, although factually correct, takes no account of the huge stock differences as between waters adjacent to Ireland and for example the highly productive areas of the North Sea, Baltic Sea and Skaggerak/Kattegat areas where the bulk of the Community fish stocks occurs.  It also ignores the large Irish catches taken in UK waters.  Taking into account those stocks subject to quotas and located partly or wholly in Irish waters, it is estimated that the Irish quotas represent some 86 per cent of these stocks and that the total stocks in Irish waters comprise 6 per cent of the total EEC stocks.  I trust that these facts dispose of the argument that our quota allocations should be related to the percentage that our waters constitute of total Community waters.</P>
    <P>We have recently received the 1983 quota proposals from the EEC Commission and these will be subject to discussion later by the Council of Ministers. In a number of cases reductions have been proposed in total allowable catches which <Col N="1002" /> have led in our case to reduced quotas being proposed for some species.  This is particularly serious in the case of mackerel on which our fishermen and processors have become very dependent.  While in most cases our percentage share of the total allowable catches is at least as high as that agreed for 1982, I am concerned that the quotas now proposed may be inadequate to meet the expanding needs of the industry in Ireland and I will be doing my utmost to have them increased. I have already made my dissatisfaction clear to the Commission.</P>
    <P>(3)  Conservation &mdash; There is a series of technical measures for the conservation of fish stocks such as limitations on mesh sizes, landing sizes and a ban on certain methods of fishing.  These will facilitate the strict conservation of fish stocks on a Community-wide level based on scientific advice.</P>
    <P>(4)  Control &mdash; Control will be effected by keeping a strict system of surveillance on catch levels through the keeping of log books by fishing vessels and the submission of catch reports.  It will be further strengthened by the establishment of an EEC inspection force with the objective of supervising the enforcement of the quota and conservation regulations. Proper monitoring and control will be essential if the CFP is to achieve its objectives.</P>
    <P>(5)  Structures &mdash; This heading embraces the provision of Community aid for the restructuring of the fleet and for aquaculture.  Grant-aid will now be available for the following measures: &mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  Permanent and temporary laying-up of vessels to relieve overcapacity in the fleet;</P>
    <P>(b)  Encouragement of exploratory fishing for new species and permanent removal of fishing vessels from the Community fleet by way of joint ventures with non-EEC countries for the purpose of exploiting resources located outside &ldquo;Community&rdquo; waters;</P>
    <P>(c)  Construction of new fishing vessels and the modernisation and conversion of fishing vessels already in use;</P>
    <P>(d)  Aquaculture projects;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1003" /> (e)  Construction of artificial reefs (in the Mediterranean only).</P>
    <P>Ireland will qualify for more favoured financial treatment in this area being eligible for grant-aid up to 50 per cent of the cost of approved projects as against the normal 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>(6)  Market Organisation &mdash; A new regulation for the Common Organisation of the Market, comprising a price and trading system and common rules of competition, came into force on 1 January 1983. Broadly speaking, the regulation provides for market standards for fish measures dealing with the setting up, financing and operations of producers' organisations of fishermen, the system of price support arrangements for fish catches and provisions governing trade with non-EEC countries.</P>
    <P>The main improvements in the new marketing structure from Ireland's point of view are:</P>
    <P>(a)  The strengthening of the role of existing producers' organisations and increased aid measures for new producers' organisations;</P>
    <P>(b)  A broader criterion for establishing withdrawal prices and the introduction of some flexibility in their operation to take account of market fluctuations;</P>
    <P>(c)  Increased financial compensation levels payable by the Commission for fish withdrawn from the market which fail to find a buyer at or above the withdrawal price;</P>
    <P>(d)  A better protection system against market disruption caused by low cost imports from non-EEC countries;</P>
    <P>(e)  Financial aid for the storage of withdrawn fish in an attempt to retain such fish for the human consumption market.</P>
    <P>Some misgivings have been expressed about the marketing regulation, particularly its effectiveness in controlling cheap imports from third countries which Ireland is very concerned about.  The new <Col N="1004" /> regime, while it may not be perfect, represents a big improvement on the old regime and there are already indications that it will prove more effective against imports.</P>
    <P>(7)  Third Country Fishing&mdash;Only those non-EEC countries which conclude agreements with the Community may fish in future within the Irish 200-mile zone and under no circumstances may they trawl inside a &ldquo;box&rdquo; which is anywhere nearer to the Irish coast than 50 miles. Access of such countries to particular fish stocks will be allowed only on the basis of quantities surplus to Irish and Community needs and their vessels will be subject to the general conservation and control regulations.  While on the subject of third countries, I would like to say that the amending legislation which I have promised to deal with the use of flags of convenience will be introduced in the House shortly and will I hope be given a speedy passage.</P>
    <P>This then is the broad outline of what we know as the Common Fisheries Policy. I remain convinced that it represents the best &ldquo;deal&rdquo; that could have been achieved given the constraints of time and conflicting interests that existed.  All are agreed that the absence of a Common Fisheries Policy has bedevilled the European fishing scene for many years and I am confident that the agreement now reached can only assist in the more orderly and efficient development of our sea-fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The grant-in-aid to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara for 1983 for administration and current development amounts to IR£4.7 million and the grant-in-aid for capital development amounts to IR£3.1 million. Additional funds are available by way of repayable advances from the Central Fund, a line of credit from financial institutions and the board's own resources to meet the demand by fishermen for loans for boats, gear, and so on.  In addition to an interest subvention of £950,000 a sum of approximately £2 million is provided to meet the cost of grants under the board's Marine Credit Plan.  The board's grant-in-aid for capital development also includes a provision of £420,000 by way of grants for mariculture development <Col N="1005" /> and £300,000 towards the cost of refurbishing the Decca navigation system.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the high level of arrears on fishing boats loans which are due to a variety of factors.  I have asked the board that each case of arrears be treated on its merits and that boats be not repossessed from fishermen who are making a genuine effort to meet their commitments.  I am not, however, prepared to give a blanket undertaking that no boats will be repossessed but I am confident that the board, with a genuine response from the skippers concerned, will find solutions to the problems in most cases.</P>
    <P>I am examining ways and means of improving our marketing structure and I propose to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> advisory group representative of BIM, the Department and all sectors of the industry to make recommendations on marketing strategy.</P>
    <P>In recent years interest in acquaculture in Ireland has grown rapidly with a particular emphasis on the cultivation of oysters, mussels and escallops.  The cultivation of these species is a relatively new technology with progressive developments in methods of culture and this factor, along with cultivation in new untried areas, requires a period of evaluation before success can be assured.</P>
    <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara continue to operate their Mariculture Grants Scheme for pilot and commercial scale fish farming projects and this scheme and the grants which the EEC continue to make available for such projects play a very significant role in the development of this sector.</P>
    <P>Progress is continuing on improvement works on landing, berthage and other facilities necessary at fishing ports and landing places.</P>
    <P>At Killybegs an extensive dredging programme has been completed to provide adequate depth in the harbour generally and additional depths in specified areas to meet the needs of the bigger trawlers now using the port.  Tenders are being examined by the Office of Public Works for the civil engineering works in connection with the installation of a syncrolift and it is hoped to place a contract <Col N="1006" /> very soon.  Work on the construction of an automatic telephone exchange, which will give much needed improvement in the telephone service, is due to commence shortly.  A new fish freezing plant has gone into production.</P>
    <P>At Castletownbere a 38 kv electricity supply, which will provide an adequate power supply for the industrial expansion envisaged as a result of harbour development, has been laid on recently.  Work is virtually completed on an effluent disposal plant for Dinish Island.  Work on the servicing of industrial sites on Dinish Island was carried out during 1982.</P>
    <P>The development scheme at Howth is progressing according to plan.  The West Pier has been widened and I expect the installation of the syncrolift to commence shortly.  Work on the syncrolift boatyard with traverser bays has already started. Expenditure on the overall scheme at the end of 1982 amounted to £8.5 million.</P>
    <P>At Rossaveal the old pier has been repaired and a new lighting system has been provided on the new pier.  Marker buoys have been installed in the approaches to the harbour and plans for a directional light have been drawn up by Irish Lights.  The preparation of plans for a major development scheme is in hands.</P>
    <P>A major development scheme at Caherciveen is virtually completed and substantial schemes are in progress at Kilcummin, Killala, County Mayo; Portevlin, County Donegal; and Oilean na gCaorach, Bere Island.  It is expected that the works at Kilcummin and Oilean na gCaorach will be completed this year. Minor works are in progress at Seafield and Liscannor, County Clare, and should be completed shortly.</P>
    <P>Development works are planned at Greencastle and Burtonport, County Donegal; Schull, County Cork, and at ten other landing places around the coast. These works will be carried out as soon as practicable and subject to the availability of the necessary funds.</P>
    <P>The Central and Regional Fisheries Boards, which were set up in October, 1980, continue to work for the better conservation, protection and development of every aspect of our valuable inland fisheries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1007" /> Under section 32 of the Fisheries Act, 1980, the introduction of a staff scheme for the staff of the central and regional boards is well under way.  Also I am glad to say that a superannuation scheme for the staff of the central and regional boards is at an advanced stage and it is hoped that this scheme will be introduced in the very near future.</P>
    <P>The most important element of our inland fisheries is our salmon fisheries. Provisional figures for 1982 show that the total weight of the salmon catch by all fishing methods was approximately 900 metric tonnes valued at approx.  £3.4 million as compared with 650 metric tonnes valued at £2.3 million in 1981.  The overall weight of our salmon catch in 1982 showed an increase of almost 39 per cent on the 1981 catch.  While this increase in the salmon catch is very welcome it should not be forgotten that the 1982 catch was still less than 50 per cent of the 2,188 tonnes caught in 1975.  Illegal fishing continues to be a cause for great concern.  In this regard I would strongly exhort everybody engaged in the salmon industry&mdash;whether as fishermen or authorised salmon dealers&mdash;to ensure compliance with the statutory salmon conservation measures which are designed to allow a sufficient escapement of returning salmon to our rivers to spawn consistent with reasonable exploitation of the stocks to the benefit of our commercial salmon fishermen, dealers, processors, exporters and our native and visiting salmon anglers.  I must say that I am pleased with the improvement in protection since the regional fisheries boards were established and I am hopeful that within a short space of time we will be able to curb the poaching which has caused such damage to our salmon stocks over the years.</P>
    <P>The salmon levy, which was introduced on 26 May 1980, was discontinued with effect from 1 June 1982.  To date a total of £292,526.63 has been collected.  The purpose of the levy was to provide additional finance for the development and protection of inland fisheries.  To compensate for the loss of moneys collected by the salmon levy, the licence fees for <Col N="1008" /> fishing, licence duties and for dealers' and exporters' licences had to be increased substantially for 1983.</P>
    <P>As to the protection of our salmon fisheries, my Department, with the co-operation of the Minister for Defence, arranged for vessels of the Naval Service to patrol the fishing grounds during the 1982 season in support of the protection being afforded by the Garda and the fisheries protection staff of the fisheries boards in the estuaries and the rivers.  It is hoped to continue these patrols this season.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to report that the Erriff salmon and sea trout fishery near Leenane, County Galway, which is one of the best salmon angling and sea trout fisheries in the country, has recently been acquired by the Central Fisheries Board. The lands attached to the fishery have been acquired by the Forest and Wildlife Service of the Department.</P>
    <P>My Department, in conjunction with the fisheries boards, continue in the forefront of the battle to control pollution. Much interest continues to centre around the problems of Lough Sheelin.  The transport subsidy scheme, operated by the Lough Sheelin Management Committee, is working satisfactorily and I am glad to say that almost 35 million gallons of excess slurry have been removed from the catchment under the scheme since its introduction in late 1980.  The scheme will continue to operate until the end of this year and discussions will shortly take place with interested parties with a view to securing greater involvement of pig producers in the operation of the scheme thereafter.</P>
    <P>The Salmon Research Trust of Ireland, which is funded jointly by my Department and Messrs.  Arthur Guinness, Son &amp; Co. Ltd, continue their research into the biology of the salmon and the factors bearing on its future survival as a species. A grant-in-aid of £60,000 is allocated to the trust for 1983.</P>
    <P>An amount of £145,000 is included in the Estimate to meet our contribution towards the expenses of the Foyle Fisheries Commission.  The money will be used to offset the commission's estimated financial deficit in 1983.  The commission's <Col N="1009" /> increasing deficit is due mainly to increases in expenditure on wages and salaries and also the purchase of a patrol boat.  I am satisfied, however, that the commission are continuing to make every effort to reduce their annual deficit.  To that end the commission have increased the licence duties payable for salmon fishing licences in the Foyle area this year.  I am satisfied that the commission are continuing to do everything possible to keep their annual deficit to an absolute minimum consistent with fulfilling their obligations under the Foyle Fisheries Acts to conserve and manage the fisheries in the Foyle area.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with the Fisheries Vote I will now turn to the Forestry Estimate. The nett amount being provided for this year, namely &mdash; £38,670,000 &mdash; represents an increase of £3,883,000 &mdash; or 10 per cent &mdash; as compared with last year's Estimate.  This increase, due largely to salary and wage increases, is partly offset by an increase of £325,000 in the estimated Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    <P>Some subheads in this Vote allow for roughly the same level of expenditure as last year and do not call for any special comment, but if Deputies want detailed information about them I will be happy to provide it in my reply.  I will, therefore, concentrate on the major items.</P>
    <P>The main aim of the State forestry programme is to increase the size of the forest estate and the supply of wood to be processed for home and export markets, with due regard to amenity and recreation considerations and wildlife (fauna and flora) conservation requirements in the forest context.  For many years the State afforestation target has stood at 10,000 hectares a year but in recent times, because of difficulties in acquiring land and the resultant unsatisfactory land reserve position, it has not been possible to attain this target.  Last year, following a detailed examination of the situation, the Government decided that an annual planting target of 10,000 hectares per year, including reafforestation and planting of privately-owned land, should be maintained as an overall <Col N="1010" /> policy objective.  At the same time it was accepted that, pending an improvement in the plantable reserve of State-owned land and an acceleration in the level of private forestry, an annual State planting programme of 7,500 hectares, to be augmented as much as possible by private planting, would be the most practical policy in the short term.</P>
    <P>It goes without saying that every effort must be made to increase the intake of land for afforestation purposes.  Ideally, the target should be to engage in land acquisition to such an extent as would sustain a State planting programme of 10,000 hectares per year but in present circumstances it is difficult to provide funds of the required magnitude.  However, I am glad to say that in this year's Estimate a sum of £3.5 million is being allocated under subhead C.1 for land acquisition and it is expected that this amount, together with a balance of £380,000 in the land acquisition fund at 31 December 1982 will result in the purchase of approximately 7,000 hectares, but of course the bulk of this land will not come into the possession of my Department until next year and later depending on negotiations with individual landowners and the speed with which sales can be closed.  In the current year, as a result of price agreements entered earlier, the land intake is likely to be of the order of 6,000 hectares.  Clearfelling of existing plantations will make a further area of about 1,000 hectares available for replanting.  However, I accept that this level of activity is far from satisfactory from the standpoint of a return to an afforestation level of 10,000 hectares per annum and it will be my aim to seek a much higher allocation for land acquisition in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>I would like now to pass on to subhead C.2 which relates to the existing State forest estate.  This estate embraces 386,000 hectares of which 307,000 hectares have been planted &mdash; and its development and management include a variety of activities such as the production of nursery stock; the establishment, maintenance and protection of State plantations; the provision of amenities and public recreation facilities; the purchase, <Col N="1011" /> maintenance and hire of machinery; the construction of forest roads; and the whole field of timber harvesting and conversion.  For these activities a provision of £26.827 million has been made under subhead C.2 for the current year. The level of activity being undertaken is broadly comparable with last year's performance and provides employment for a work force of about 2,500 men &mdash; usually in areas where alternative employment prospects are poor.</P>
    <P>The stage is now being reached in Irish forestry where past investment is beginning to show a significant return.  With the increased emphasis on timber harvesting the provision of adequate funds for forest roads and harvesting machinery assumes paramount importance.  An increase of approximately 28 per cent in the allocation for road materials this year reflects the increasing number of plantations now reaching the stage where timber has to be extracted.  The purchase of gravel and other materials used on forest roads contributes in no small way to the economy of the localities concerned. Although, unfortunately, none of the expensive and specialised machinery used in forestry operations is manufactured in Ireland, my Department are acutely aware of the need to spend as much of their budget as possible in this country.  In illustration of this I would mention the purchase last year of two specialised machines for the transport of heavy materials over boggy terrain. Under the prescribed sealed tender competition arrangements the vehicle found most suitable for the Department's needs was a Canadian tracked machine.  Following negotiations with the manufacturers the two machines, less cabs and engines, were supplied in a completely knocked down condition and arrangements were then made which enabled one Irish firm to supply the engines, assemble the two machines and do some extra fabrication work while another Irish firm was awarded the contract for the manufacture and fitting of the cabs. These arrangements, as well as providing outlets for Irish industry, also resulted in <Col N="1012" /> a fairly substantial saving to the Department.</P>
    <P>The funds in subhead C.2 include a provision of £935,000 for machine hireage in 1983 and £640,000 for contract harvesting. This expenditure is mutually advantageous to the Department and to various machine owners and contractors.  On the one hand it affords an outlet for the spare capacity of machinery in private ownership and on the other hand it reduces the need for capital expenditure by my Department on the purchase of specialised equipment for which it would have only part-time use.</P>
    <P>There is a slight increase this year in the amounts being made available for the purchase of weedkillers and fertilisers. This is due partly to a greater use of chemicals for the control of weeds &mdash; work which was previously done manually at a greater cost &mdash; and the higher prices for fertilisers, mostly unground mineral phosphate, which have to be imported and paid for in US dollars.</P>
    <P>Grant assistance to Chipboard Products Ltd., at Scarriff, County Clare, is provided for under subhead C.4.  This company &mdash; set up with grant assistance from the Government &mdash; has been in production since May 1981.  It is a private limited company employing some 200 people directly at the plant and a further 100 in timber harvesting and transport. The grant assistance of £1 million proposed for this year is intended partly for capital development and partly to meet the cost of subventing timber harvesting operations under the terms of a timber supply agreement between the State and the company.</P>
    <P>In the area of timber promotion my Department are in consultation with the Department of the Environment with a view to increasing the market share of Irish timber in the housing sector and also to easing certain restrictions inhibiting the greater development of timber-frame housing.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to kill off the erroneous impression that my Department were allowing the export of timber at £1 a ton.  This misconception <Col N="1013" /> appears to have stemmed from the fact that in recent years, when the pulpwood industries had virtually ceased operations, my Department encouraged the creation of export outlets as a temporary measure for this type of material in order to ensure the development of the primary forest product, namely sawlog, and also to maintain forest employment and facilitate the development of harvesting expertise.  The pulpwood in question was sold standing in the forest, often in remote and difficult harvesting sites, and at the point of export it would have cost the exporter in the region of £20 a ton &mdash; mostly in wages.  It should also be borne in mind that the ultimate value of such timber in terms of foreign currency earnings was of the order of £6 or £7 million per annum &mdash; a factor which helped to reduce the net cost of necessary timber imports.  Nevertheless I am happy to say that, with the establishment of a pulpwood plant in Clonmel to manufacture medium density fibreboard, and which will commence production this summer, pulpwood exports will decrease as the demand by the new industry increases.  Moreover, this firm will add greater stability to the timber industry generally by affording a welcome additional outlet for sawmill waste and chips.</P>
    <P>The level of expenditure being provided this year for private forestry &mdash; subhead D of the Vote &mdash; is £300,000.</P>
    <P>While progress to date in State forestry has on the whole been satisfactory, the contribution made by the private sector to the national afforestation programme has been disappointing.  There are, of course, historical reasons for this but I am glad to say that there have been some encouraging signs of late that attitudes are beginning to change and that, with the State incentives now available, a substantial increase in private forestry will emerge in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The private forestry sector will receive full support in its operations from the Forest and Wildlife Service by way of grants and a free technical advisory service.  Every effort is being made to generate wider interest both in the traditional planting grant scheme and the more recent forestry element of the EEC <Col N="1014" /> Western Package.  This latter scheme was introduced primarily to encourage an expansion of private forestry in Counties Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Galway, Monaghan, Longford, Cavan, Clare, Roscommon, Kerry and parts of Limerick and Cork.  Grants of up to 85 per cent of the cost are available subject to a maximum of £800 per hectare. Regrettably, progress under the scheme to date has been slow.  In 1982, only £61,000 was paid out in grants in respect of 170 hectares planted under the scheme.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the functions of State forestry have expanded in recent years far beyond the production of timber and the aims of my Department now include the provision of amenity and recreational facilities, game development and an on-going wildlife conservation programme.</P>
    <P>On the amenity side, provision is made in subhead C.2 (4) of the Estimate for the maintenance of nine forest parks&mdash;the most recent being that at Currachase, County Limerick, which was officially opened last Autumn.  In addition, provision is included for general amenity and recreational facilities in the State forests, which now contain over 400 areas open to the public and listed in my Department's publication entitled <i>The Open Forest.</i>  The public are invited to continue to visit and use State forests where such usage would not interfere with the production of commercial timber.</P>
    <P>On the game and wildlife side, provision is included in subhead G in respect of the services of the Wildlife Ranger Corps who deal with the enforcement of the Wildlife Act, 1976.  There are currently 47 rangers engaged in enforcing the general protective provisions of the Act and more specifically in regulating hunting and dealing with poaching offences and illegal trade in wildlife species. They also have an important role in fostering a greater interest in wildlife conservation at local level.</P>
    <P>I am aware that the absence of a provision in the Estimate for game development grants has been a source of grave disappointment to regional game <Col N="1015" /> councils and tourist shoot operators. Regrettably, the priorities which governed the formulation of public expenditure estimates for this year did not permit a continuation of such financial support.  I appreciate the good work done by all these organisations over the years in the interests of game development and I sincerely hope that their enthusiasm will not be diminished by the present situation. The traditional advisory and liaison services provided by my Department for the game sector will continue to be made available and I would urge the sporting interests concerned to avail themselves of them.</P>
    <P>Funds for the wildlife conservation programme are provided for in subhead H, the provision for 1983 being £170,000.</P>
    <P>Research into wildlife habitats and species is a major element of the wildlife conservation programme.  The Forest and Wildlife Service have identified a number of sites of different types of ecosystems around the country, particularly peatland areas, which are worthy of nature reserve status.  Most of these sites are privately owned and, having regard to the cost of either acquiring them or entering into management agreements with the owners, progress in affording them statutory protection will inevitably be slow.  However, this is a sector to which I am giving particular attention in the hope of securing some allocation of funds that would permit the conservation of at least the most vulnerable habitats. I am pleased to say that to date 12 nature reserves&mdash;mainly woodland reserves on State forest property&mdash;have been established and are being managed by my Department.  The number of such reserves is likely to be increased during the year.</P>
    <P>Public demand for information on wildlife and conservation is extremely keen and is met by the distribution by my Department of various educational leaflets which are continually being updated and expanded.  On the international front, wildlife conservation has wide implications.  The FWS continued to participate with various international organisations at EEC and other levels and <Col N="1016" /> every effort is being made to fulfil this country's obligations under the various directives, regulations and conventions which have emerged in recent years.</P>
    <P>I should like at this point to pay a very special tribute to the on-going work of the Wildlife Advisory Council&mdash;a voluntary group&mdash;whose advice on a wide variety of wildlife conservation topics is greatly valued by me and my Department.</P>
    <P>This address would be incomplete without a reference to the forestry research sector.  In so far as silvicultural research associated with the commercial production of timber is concerned, this is handled by the Forest and Wildlife Service itself and the costs involved relate in large measure to the personnel involved.  As regards timber technology research, however, my Department avail themselves of the services of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards who are currently undertaking a number of research projects on behalf of the Forest and Wildlife Service aimed at promoting the use of Irish timber and the bulk of the funds provided for under subhead I relates to this exercise.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that timber production is an area which can offer increasing scope for import substitution.  However, in the long run the successful production and harvesting of timber depends on the response from house builders and other buyers and users of timber.  I would appeal to everyone connected with the trade to make an extra effort to do all they can to secure a larger market share for Irish timber with a view to safeguarding the long-term interests of the entire timber industry.</P>
    <P>The Forest and Wildlife Service also keep in touch with new developments in the sphere of forestry research such as biomass, that is, renewable energy resources, either through conventional forestry or by way of growing specialised short-rotation energy crops using species such as poplars and alders.  My Department are actively involved, in conjunction with other State agencies, in a number of EEC-assisted biomass projects, but developments on this front are as yet <Col N="1017" /> experimental and it would be premature to draw any firm conclusions from them.</P>
    <P>The final subhead to which I would like to refer is subhead J&mdash;Appropriations-in-Aid. This, of course, relates to the revenue which is expected to accrue to the Forest and Wildlife Service in the course of the year to reduce the gross Vote.  The expected aggregate income this year is £8,873,000 but, as Deputies will see, the vast bulk of this revenue derives from the sale of timber and more particularly sawlog.  While the prevailing market for this sector is difficult due to a downturn in building activity, I am glad to see that, in the face of such difficulties, some firms have been imaginative enough to seek and obtain sizeable markets overseas for processed timber.  Such initiatives are very commendable and have played a significant role in the countinuance of forestry activities and improving forest revenues.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I would like to mention the subject of forest fires.  In recent years people have become very conscious of the potential of our forests in terms of recreation and amenity and also of their value in the sphere of wildlife conservation.  For my part, it is indeed a pleasure to welcome the public to enjoy the many facilities and amenities available. However, what is sometimes not realised is the great vulnerability of the forests to the danger of fire, which is the major enemy of our plantations.  Every year, many hundreds of hectares of forest, developed at heavy cost to the taxpayer, are destroyed by fire as a result of a moment's carelessness or wilful selfishness. With a little thought and foresight most of these fires could be avoided. While weather conditions in recent months have been such as to reduce the extent of fire hazard, I would appeal for continued vigilance by the public in the lighting of fires and the discarding of cigarettes and matches in the vicinity of forest properties.</P>
    <P>I have now dealt with the Estimates for Fisheries and Forestry in considerable detail.  I commend both Estimates for approval and I look forward to comments from all sides of the House.</P>
    <Col N="1018" />
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of this opportunity to take part in the debate on the Estimates for the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  In relation to fisheries, while development has shown considerable expansion over the past five years, and the evidence is there to show where that expansion has taken place, nevertheless we on this side of the House believe that the industry has not reached its maximum capacity and has not developed to its full potential.  There are many areas in which the industry can be assisted by the State to enable it to reach its maximum potential and make its full contribution to the national economy.</P>
      <P>We welcome the completion of the Common Fisheries Policy Agreement which has been adopted by the Community. It has been the subject of so much deliberation and discussion for a long time.  While not being totally satisfied with the outcome, we feel that it can now form the basis of a sound national policy. This is where I must be slightly critical of the present administration in that there is not, to date, any evidence from the Government of a clear-cut, defined policy in relation to fishery development, and sea fisheries in particular, which would indicate clearly and spell out definitely and conclusively how the opportunities, potential, investment and other areas in need of attention would be dealt with and how the sea fisheries potential can be maximised in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Common Fisheries Policy Agreement is the cornerstone of our fisheries policy as members of the Community and will be for the next 20 years.  We on this side of the House &mdash; certainly during my time in office &mdash; felt that it was essential that alongside the CAP agreement which was the agreement for the development of fisheries in the Community, we needed to spell out our own clear-cut, definite national fisheries policy.  In this regard what we have been getting from the Minister is mainly a continuation of the existing situation which had been all right in so far as it was applicable to the circumstances of the last ten or 15 years.  However, the new opportunities emerging in the new European policy have great importance for us and the Government <Col N="1019" /> must immediately get down to the task of producing a national policy which will clearly show the direction for the industry and give guidance to those in the sectors of the fishing industry as to where they should make their investment, what activities they should engage in and the opportunities, possibilities and dangers in the future.  As is well known in the House, there are some threatening signs on the horizon in relation to fish stocks, where there is need for caution, care, consideration, proper management and conservation policies to go alongside the policy of exploiting the potential.  In this way, we will get the full benefit for the industry and the community generally which our fisheries can provide.</P>
    <P>The importance of the industry and its contribution to the national economy have not been fully recognised.  Its development is vital, especially to the social and economic development of the coastal regions.  The fishing industry has a far greater significance to the Irish economy than the fishing sectors in the majority of the other member states in the Community and figures and statistics are available which will bear that out.  The development of the industry can have far-reaching effects on the social and economic structure of the south-west, the west and the north-west regions and present significant job-creating opportunities, as well as preserving the present fabric of the industry and the existing jobs in it.</P>
    <P>That is why I must be critical of the Government decision to cut back on the allocation for harbour development.  The failure of the Government to recognise the importance of the development of our harbours, by reducing the present Estimate by over £1 million, is a retrograde and most undesirable step.  The risk involved in this short-sighted policy is a risk which the industry cannot afford at this time.  As a matter of extreme urgency, we need to complete the development of the five major fishery harbour centres.  Some of them are now at an advanced stage and some are at planning stage.  Work has been done on most of them.  We must push ahead with the <Col N="1020" /> development of these five major harbour centres.  No industry can prosper without the necessary infrastructure.  The decision was a major blow and will be felt most severely in the small fishery harbour centres.  As Minister I felt there was need for special attention in these areas. Assistance should be available for them through the Regional Fund of the EEC.</P>
    <P>Many of the minor fishery harbour centres were developed at enormous cost years ago, some during times of famine and recession.  They have not been attended to over the years and many are in a state of disrepair and collapse.  I am thinking of harbours such as Clogherhead in County Louth and Doolin Pier in my own constituency.  It is necessary to complete the developments in the five major fishery harbour centres.  It is also necessary to undertake a programme of repair and investment in small harbours which will enable them to be a backup to the major centres.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems in the fishing industry.  The decision to curtail finance was a damaging one and a retrograde step.  It is essential in view of the completion of the Common Fisheries Policy and the new confidence that there is in the industry to have investment in harbours, training, research, development and in all areas to enable the fishing industry to expand.  There have been problems which have caused concern to the organisation representing the industry. There is need for urgent action to deal with these.</P>
    <P>In recent months the weather has caused serious hardship for fishermen. While we cannot blame the Government for that, some consideration should be given to the establishment of a hardship fund similar to that made available in certain cases to the farming community &mdash; for example, if they lose their herd through animal disease.  A fisherman can lose his livelihood due to bad weather conditions.  It is important that we consider the establishment of such a fund which would be availed of only in extreme circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am critical of the Government's decision to cut the subsidy to BIM.  Anyone who has an interest in the industry knows <Col N="1021" /> the position in relation to the repayment of loans fishermen received for their boats.  Some fishermen have been doing reasonably well but many find it difficult to meet loan repayments.  In some cases boats have been repossessed.  Many small boat owners are afraid that their boats will be repossessed.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that before any action of this nature is taken there will be consultation between the fishermen and their organisation to see what can be done.  The necessary assistance should be given to them to enable them to overcome their difficulties.  In industry we have grant aid facilities available to help it meet changing demands.  The necessary finance should be put aside to help fishermen who are in difficulty.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies who are familiar with the industry know that one of the major problems has been increasing fuel costs. It is essential that the subsidisation of fuel for fishermen should continue.  There are indications of a reduction in the price of oil but there is a feeling that the full reduction will not be passed on to the fishermen.  We need to look at this area.</P>
    <P>We must be very conscious of the need to invest in training and education.  Gear and equipment are much more sophisticated than ever before and we have a changed pattern of fishing.  It is essential that we invest heavily in training and utilise, if necessary, some of the funds available to the Youth Employment Agency to assist the Fishery Vote.  We must train skippers and young people. Excellent work has been done in the fishing schools and by the mobile unit operated by BIM.  Nevertheless, much more could be done and there could be greater investment.  Much more in the way of funds is essential if we are to exploit fully the possibilities in this area and if we are to train the young people entering the industry who are looking forward to a secure future.</P>
    <P>A very definite commitment and a decisive strategy are required in the whole area of marketing.  When I was involved in the Department I visited Egypt, a visit that was criticised by some people at the time, for the purpose of endeavouring to open up markets with <Col N="1022" /> the Egyptians at a time when markets in other areas were under pressure.  There are possibilities there and these must be exploited.  I am aware that some fish has been exported already to Egypt.  Given a proper co-ordinated approach involving the industry at all levels &mdash; the catching, the processing, the marketing levels &mdash; and above all in consulation with the industry and with the help and guidance of the experts in the Department and in BIM, it should be possible to devise a marketing strategy whereby we would be capable of marketing all the fish we can produce.</P>
    <P>One of the essentials in the marketing area is the maximum co-ordination and consolidation of the various strands in the industry.  The catching sector must be in communication with and involved with the processing sector while there must be liaison also with people in the marketing field.  I had a clear indication from the Egyptian Government that they would favour a State-to-State marketing arrangement which would involve fairly substantial quantities of fish, quantities perhaps that we would not be able to meet.  They felt that they needed the security of a country-to-country arrangement but there would seem not to be the legal framework here to enable us to do that and to exploit fully the opportunities of these markets.  Perhaps the Minister would consider that area to see if the State might become more involved in the industry in ensuring that arrangements can be negotiated with the countries in which there are markets for our fish.  This would encourage people to become involved in the business.</P>
    <P>There are some other aspects of the fishing industry which are very important, too.  In regard to inland fisheries, for instance, there is need for closer co-operation and for more consultation between the central fisheries authority and the regional boards.  The establishment of the regional boards was a welcome move but there is a need for more co-operation between them and the central board and particularly between the staffs of the two.  We cannot afford the luxury of different bodies engaging in their own particular developments.  The <Col N="1023" /> central and the regional boards must be involved jointly in the protection, the development and the exploitation of inland fisheries.  We have not pushed ahead quickly enough with the creation of proper working conditions for the staffs of the regional boards.  For many years the situation in this regard has been haphazard with confusion generally as between one board area and another. One would have hoped that as a result of the establishment of the regional boards we would now have had all these matters regarding employment conditions, pension schemes and so on sorted out.</P>
    <P>It is desirable that there be some co-ordinated approach between the central board and the regional boards in the whole matter of staffing and in the provision of the facilities that are so essential in the fight against the various hazards facing inland fisheries.  I welcome the recent speeches of the Minister and of the Minister of State in relation to the stamping out of illegal activities, regardless of which quarter these emanate from. We have heard time and again about the illegal activities of foreign fishermen but much of the time we hear little about the illegal activities of some of our own fishermen. In fairness to the Minister, he has spoken out against such activities and in the past few days has acted to ensure that at least the mouth of the Shannon estuary will be kept clear of illegal nets this season. When I was in office many of the Shannon fishermen sought to have me removed for my alleged failure to deal with the problem, but we dealt with it within the limits of the resources available then.  It is necessary to have an almost full-time presence on the mouth of an important estuary such as Shannon at peak times and especially when the salmon are running.  We must keep the estuaries free of illegal nets and leave the waters free for the salmon to get to the higher reaches.  These illegal activities put in jeopardy not only the livelihood of those involved in inland fisheries but also of the many people involved legitimately in drift netting in the sea.  We can no longer afford this type of illegal activity.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the action being taken <Col N="1024" /> in relation to the continuation of pollution control in Lough Sheelin.  Many of those involved in fisheries have been concerned about the situation there but recent development indicate that it is improving.  Nevertheless, we must express regret that adequate finance is not being allocated to research and development generally.  It is regrettable that at a time when there is a need for as much research as possible the Government are cutting back on small research schemes such as the one in Carlow.  This is a short-sighted policy and one that will not help in the development of inland fisheries, an area in which there is great potential.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I should like to refer to some important developments in the area of forestry.  In the past 60 years the taxpayers have invested about £400 million in this industry but it is a national waste, if not a disgrace, that one-third of the timber produced by the forestry service has remained unsold in recent years because of a bias in favour of imported timber.  The saw-milling sector have experienced difficulties due to a decline in the building industry but this is the sector that have suffered most from the unnecessary and undesirable importation of foreign timber.  While they have been experiencing great difficulties in recent years, we have been importing massive quantities of timber.  We must utilise fully the timber resources of the State.  We cannot afford to be putting so much money into timber growing if we do not intend utilising the product fully and to the maximum advantage of the State and utilising it also from the point of view of job potential.  Timber can have a major regional impact and can also have job creation potential, especially in the west.</P>
    <P>It is unsatisfactory that the saw-milling sector is losing jobs while at the same time timber is being imported in ever-increasing quantities.  When I was in the Department I sought to indicate that it would be possible to index the price of sawlog in the Irish market to international prices. If we could reduce timber prices for the industry here in line with or below international timber prices we could create <Col N="1025" /> job opportunities while exploiting our resources.  The Department's position is that they must get a return on investment and raise the necessary funds from the sales of timber to enable the afforestation programme to continue and expand, but the time has come when decisions must be made as to whether the tendering policy which keeps the price at a very high level, which often does not relate to international prices, is the right course.  The Minister must consider whether it might be wiser to reduce timber prices to the native saw-milling industry to a level comparable with or below import prices. This would enable the industry to create more jobs and encourage far greater use of the timber resources which we will have in abundance in coming years.</P>
    <P>When Minister I reviewed some of the schemes in operation and we produced a document outlining the possibilities for the timber industry.  I should like this document to be published so that the general public would be aware of the possibilities and opportunities in this area.</P>
    <P>It is important to maintain the State planting programme and to provide sufficient funds for land acquisition for further planting.  We should also encourage as far as possible private planting schemes of the type which have been working very successfully in my constituency. We should expand the sawmill sector and make concessions to those who are experiencing financial difficulties. It is necessary to work out in consultation with the interests involved in the industry a policy to exploit to the fullest the potential of our State forests.</P>
    <P>Wildlife conservation has not received the attention it deserves and we must increase further the allocation in order to continue the work of surveying and the acquisition of wildlife habitats.  This should not be regarded as a luxury even in the present difficult economic climate. A site in the Burren was examined by the Department with a view to purchase and use as a nature reserve.  Some allocation for this should be provided, possibly from the subhead for land acquisition.</P>
    <P>We need more time to deal in detail with fisheries policy and the expansion of <Col N="1026" /> the fishing industry and we hope for an early opportunity to have a detailed discussion on the common fisheries policy and the national plan to exploit our fisheries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointments.  The congratulations will have to stop there.  In BIM we have the most archaic semi-State body this country has seen for a long time.  It reminds me of the famous short story told by a politician about a political party.  He said they were a banana Government &mdash; first they were green, then they became yellow and eventually they curled up and became rotten.  That is the way it is with BIM.</P>
      <P>I cannot share the optimism expressed by the Minister and Deputy Daly.  I live amongst fishermen and I know their anxiety. There is an air of gloom in the fishing industry.  As recently as Wednesday, 27 April I tabled a question to the Minister asking the number of boats repossessed by BIM between 1 January 1980 and 31 March 1983, the number of such boats sold up to 31 March 1983, the profit or loss on the sale of those boats and the loss to the Exchequer on boats repossessed. The answer makes shocking reading. In those three years 20 vessels were repossessed by BIM.  Sixteen boats were sold, seven of them for cash while nine were reissued to other fishermen.  What happened to the four missing boats? There was a loss of £1.5 million on the sale of those boats and another loss to the Exchequer of £1.5 million.  How can an industry thrive in such conditions? Every fisherman, whether he has a 30-foot launch or a trawler of 110 feet is hounded by demand notes from BIM, threatening him with repossession of his boat unless he pays up.  The Exchequer lost £3 million on the repossession of those boats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can see where BIM have gone wrong.  There is no practical fisherman of rural origin on the executive side of the board.  They are staggering from one crisis to another.  Why?  It is because they do not know what is happening around them.  I, aided and abetted by Deputy Gallagher, brought to the notice of the Minister <Col N="1027" /> for Fisheries, and the Department that Spanish trawlers would land fish at Cappagh in County Clare.  Of course, the Department had never heard of it until early that day.  At the same time, not many yards from this House, a press interview was given by the sponsors of that project who said unequivocally that they had been in contact with the Department about the project and they had given it their blessing.</P>
    <P>Who is codding whom?  Morning after morning on the Order of Business Deputy Gallagher and I have asked the Minister when he will bring in legislation about third country trawlers flying the flag of convenience coming in here.  He said today he would bring it in the near future.  We have had that story from both the Taoiseach and the Minister for the last six weeks.  It is about time we said something about it on the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>Is it not a fact that a number of those trawlers are already in this country landing at different ports with Spanish crews.  Yet another organ of the Government, the Department of Labour, have never insisted that these fishermen should have work permits to land in this country.  Why were the Department of Fisheries not there?  Why did their officials or officials of BIM close their eyes to this carry-on throughout the past two years?</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, I have met many fishermen deeply concerned about their present position.  They know that if the Spaniards get a licence to come in here it will be the end of fishing as we know it off the west coast.  It is very significant that the fishermen of this country would never see the sprats these Spanish trawlers have in their boxes.  Can we get an explanation of how this situation has been allowed to develop and continue during a number of years?  At least ten Spanish trawlers can fish at will off our coasts and the Department of Labour do not insist that their crews have work permits. Would any other section of the community tolerate such blackguardism?  No, only the fishermen who have to get up at 5 a.m., face into a south-westerly or north-easterly wind and will not be seen <Col N="1028" /> again until 48 hours later.  They have no one to fight their case.</P>
    <P>In my opinion BIM have outlived their usefulness.  Yet they boast here of our record catches for 1982.  Did they tell us how much of that catch was dumped or how much was sprayed with red or purple dye, as the case may be, and dragged around the coast to fishmeal factories?  It seems that if fish does not reach a certain price it is sprayed by an official of the Department, taken to a fishmeal factory and along 50 or 60 or perhaps 200 miles you will see nothing but sprayed fish which have fallen from the lorries on the sides of the main roads.  Yet we boast here tonight about our record catches.</P>
    <P>Why has all this happened?  It is because BIM opted out of the marketing of fish when they should have stayed in. When fish is not properly marketed where will it go?  There are now a few fly-by-night cowboys reaping the fruits of the sea and paying their own price to the fishermen.  There is now a monopoly not only in the Dublin market but in other ports throughout the country.  What redress had the fishermen of Howth three weeks ago when their fish were purchased by cheques which bounced?  Who is to give those people satisfaction?</P>
    <P>I could go on for hours about the failures of BIM.  The Minister came here tonight to tell us he is content with the state of the industry.  I humbly suggest to him that the sooner he gets rid of those pinstriped, city oriented executives the better.  They may be good men in their own right but as far as the practicalities of fishing are concerned out they should go.</P>

      <P>Even though I am cynical about advisers &mdash; and God knows we have enough of them here tonight &mdash; I suggest to the Minister that his Department could do with a breath of fresh air. When the Department were established in 1977 they were the cinderella of the Department of Agriculture.  The time has come for the Minister and the Minister of State to take a close look at the operations of the Department of Fisheries.  In <Col N="1029" /> 1977 one would have thought that the new Department would have put some kind of stranglehold on BIM and their operations.  But no, the board took off hell for leather to build a palace in Dún Laoghaire which is still unoccupied.  How much is it costing the State to finance that palace every year?  There is more money going to maintain that premises than any of us could imagine.  I tabled a question last week to the Minister for Fisheries asking him if furniture had been taken out of this palace recently.  The reply I got was to the effect that it was never refurbished but a robbery had taken place and radiators were taken.  What have we come to?  We were not told what the radiators cost or how they were stolen. Of course, mar a deir Deputy Denis Gallagher, sin ceist eile.</P>
      <P>The answer to the problem of the fishing industry is first to set up a fish marketing board.  That board should consist of people experienced in marketing at home and abroad and they should be practical Irishmen.  Up to recently&mdash;this is no reflection on Deputy Daly&mdash;there were two Fianna Fáil Senators on the board.  It could happen that they could have been Fine Gael Senators.  I do not hold it against the gentlemen who are friends of mine but I should like to know how it is that Members of the Oireachtas are not allowed sit on the board of any other State-sponsored body.  There is a story in Kerry that if one wanted to get anything it was necessary first of all to apply to the Fianna Fáil Cumann who would forward the request to the Fianna Fáil Cumann in BIM.  Of course, I did not believe that at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Genuine fishermen have little or no say in the fishing industry.  Deputies Denis Gallagher, Pat Cope Gallagher and Daly have something to contribute as far as the fishing industry is concerned.  I have had informal discussions with those Deputies in the House and we came to the conclusion that we could not get anywhere.  If BIM can borrow money from the Exchequer with repayments to be made over 20 years I should like to know why a trawler owner must repay a loan in 12 years or, in the case of a secondhand <Col N="1030" /> craft, over ten years.  Why not give the same concessions to the fishermen as the State give to BIM?</P>
    <P>The Minister, and the Minister of State must be delighted that my criticism will not appear in tomorrow's newspapers and that very few will buy a copy of the Official Report to read it.</P>

      <P>It goes deeper than that, I should like to remind the boy from Wexford.  Is the Minister aware of the anxiety in the household of a trawler owner when a boat is repossessed?  There should be an advisory or rescue body, like Fóir Teoranta, in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to help fishermen who reach the stage that they can no longer meet their commitments.  If one purchases a boat valued at £600,000 one must pay back £180,000 per year.  To break that down into simple figures it means a boat owner must pay £3,500 per week.  If the weather is bad the boat is idle and the boat will also be idle if there is a breakdown or if one of the crew suffers a bereavement.  The Department should have in their team a person to advise fishermen.  We must also consider other charges such as fuel and insurance. I have no doubt that if we include them the cost would work out at about £4,000 per week.  If a boat breaks down and must be removed to a boatyard the owner will face an astronomical bill and at the same time must meet the cost of £4,000 per week.  Deputy Daly was correct when he said that there should be some compassion to help those unfortunate fishermen who find themselves in this situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pose a number of questions to the Minister and BIM.  I notice Members are looking at the document I have but I can assure the Minister that it is not a Government leak.  I should like to know what opportunities exist for further development and expansion in the fishing industry.  What are the opportunities in the export market for that industry for each major variety of fish?  What type of product should we process?  What indications are now apparent in international markets?  How will aquaculture <Col N="1031" /> progress here in years to come?  What efforts are we making to expand that aspect of the industry?  Has any official of the Department carried out a survey of the rivers flowing into small harbours around the coast and marked out pilot areas?  What precaution will the Government take against foreign trawlers who fish 12 miles outside our limits, those whose traditional rights may be between six and 12 miles at certain times of the year?  How many inspections took place of those trawlers in the last 12 months? Had those who carried out inspections special clothing to go into the deep freeze compartments to see if those boats had exceeded their quota.  Is this pirating and plundering of our seas going to continue unchecked by the Department?  Let us talk about the illegal salmon fisherman. If he lands his boat his catch is taken.</P>
    <P>There should be a monitoring system of trawlers with freezing facilities.  These trawlers should be inspected at least every evening when they are fishing off our coasts.  Has anyone ever heard of an arrest by one of our naval vessels of a Spanish, Bulgarian, French or Belgian trawler because they had exceeded their quota and had frozen their catch?  Have there been any prosecutions in our courts for such an offence?  Do not tell me this is not happening.  These boats may only catch a quota and only a certain number of licences are issued, but who checks our seas?  There is no point saying a helicopter flies over Dingle Bay, up to Loop Head off Malin Head once in a while and takes a look at the Aran Islands.  Everybody knows what is happening.  Once these boats are so many miles out to sea the licence is passed to another trawler which comes and fishes in our waters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been uneconomic for that Spanish trawler to go back to port because she would lose so many days fishing.  Why do you think the Spanish invasion is about to take place? These Spanish trawlers, English registered, flying the Union Jack, were told to leave England and Wales.  Special legislation <Col N="1032" /> was introduced in the House of Commons and they sat until 3 a.m.  Here we are, months later, and what are we doing?  We are about to bring in legislation. We have been about to bring in legislation for the last ten weeks and we have not seen it yet.  How much more can our fishermen take?  There is no excuse for inefficiency.  I realise all Departments must see the heads of a Bill before it can be printed, but if any Department is holding up this legislation the Minister should tell us.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was going to set up a fish marketing board.  How far has he got?  How many meetings were held? Who was consulted?  What action does the Minister propose to take?  There is no point in our fishermen catching fish if they cannot sell it.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle lives in the historic town of Nenagh, but how often can he buy fresh fish there?  I know he cannot answer now, but perhaps he will tell me later.  In Killybegs, Dingle and Castletownbere the blue dye or the red dye is spread on the fish which is taken out to sea and dumped unceremoniously.  Where is it all going to end?</P>
      <P>Unless there is a radical approach to the fishing industry, unless the Minister drastically overhauls BIM from top to bottom, there is no future for the fishing industry.  That makes some of us very sad.  For the person who comes from the west or south-west coast and eats salt and spuds for dinner, with a little fish, five days out of seven, there is little hope left. It was the currach, the launch, the trawler or the lobster pot, that helped the hardy men of the west to survive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the new dictatorial policies of BIM, particularly since the Minister came into power and this harassment started, all these fishermen are living in fear that they will lose their boats.  It is no wonder fishermen are lost at sea. Some of them have to take chances they never took before to keep a roof over their heads, to pay the mortgage and to keep their children at school.  That is reality.  Because of our geographic location big industry is pie in the sky as far as we are concerned.  We depend on natural amenities &mdash; the land and the sea.  Has <Col N="1033" /> the new chief executive officer of BIM ever visited Dingle, Baltimore or Castletownbere? We get the feeling that we are dots on the map and a decision is taken when he has studied the statistics and the figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister has a golden opportunity to take a hard close look at the fishing industry.  If he wants the real facts I advise him that he will not get them in Hume House.  He will not get them in Upper Merrion Street.  He will not get them in Dún Laoghaire.  He will get them in Castletownbere, Dingle, Killybegs, Achill Sound and from the fishermen on the Aran Islands.  They are the men who will tell him in no uncertain terms how they feel about the fishing industry and the way they want it to evolve in the eighties.</P>
    <P>The Minister is a west of Ireland man. He is new to the job.  He has already started a process of communication with the fishermen in open public forum.  I appeal to him to continue that on the west coast, on to Dungarvan, and all the way up to Arklow, Howth and Louth.  He will then learn what is wrong with the fishing industry.  He will learn about the fly-by-nights, the people who make a quick buck out of the fishing industry and renege on it when the chips were down.</P>
    <P>I do not subscribe to the view that we should have five major harbours.  If there is only a limited amount of cash available for harbour development, any harbour with a tradition in fishing and a minimum number of boats registered should get a slice of the cake.  I can speak at length about my own harbour, Dingle Harbour. The last time anything was done to Dingle Harbour was in 1972 when it was dredged.  Believe it or not, the dredger arrived in a juggernaut, went into the sea in Cromane and floated up Dingle Bay into Dingle Harbour.  That is the last time we saw a dredger in Dingle Harbour.</P>
    <P>I often wonder who advises the powers that be on what harbours should be dredged and what gear should be renovated. I ask myself: Is it BIM?  Then I say to myself: &ldquo;What do they know about fishing?&rdquo;  If they knew anything at all about fishing they would know we had a natural amenity out there under our nose waiting to be developed, waiting to be <Col N="1034" /> cultivated, whether for drift netting or for trawling.  It took the Dutch to arrive here and teach us about mariculture.</P>
    <P>If BIM could afford to lose £3 million of the taxpayers' money on repossessed boats in a little over two years, what are they about to embark on judging about all the six day notices and five day notices the fishermen around the coast have got? If this debate does nothing other than highlight that situation it will be worth-while. We were told in response to Dáil questions that of the 20 boats which were repossessed nine were sold back to Irish fishermen.  Where did another seven go? That is the question I pose to the Minister. Were seven trawlers sold to another boatyard in this country, refurbished and then sold abroad?  I would like the Minister to listen to me when I am saying this.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned that there is a nice cosy little racket going on.  These trawlers were repossessed from Irish fishermen and sold abroad, and yet we are reliably informed that some of those fishermen who were losing their boats were offered a better price by people in Scotland, Wales and on the Continent, and An Bord Iascaigh Mhara would not sanction the sale.  I hope that in the Minister's reply he will be very forthcoming.  If we stop this cosy little racket that is going on in the repossession of boats this debate will be worthwhile.</P>
    <P>In 1979 I spoke at length in a debate here about the sale of our boatyards to private interests.  BIM did everything in their power to blackmail me because I had the courage of my convictions and spoke out in this House.  It is a peculiar twist of fate that we are discussing fisheries here tonight, and yesterday one of the proprietors of the boatyards went to the High Court seeking an injunction against BIM because they had led him up the garden path.  He was not the first Corkman to be led up the garden path by BIM.  The House can take it from me that he will not be the last either if BIM continue as they are going.  It is strange that in the course of the affidavit made by that Corkman in the High Court yesterday, he said BIM had a vendetta against him.</P>

      <P>Deputy Noonan (<i>Limerick West</i>) has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of Questions Nos. 31, 32 and 33 of last Thursday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I would like to thank you for giving me permission to raise on the Adjournment the sub-questions on the Adjournment.  I propose to speak for ten minutes and two of my colleagues will speak for five minutes each.  In view of the unsatisfactory reply of the Minister to those questions last Thursday afternoon this side of the House felt that those matters should be raised on the Adjournment because many of my colleagues had a number of supplementary questions to ask on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important from the point of view of the national cattle herd and also from the point of view of slaughterings at our meat plants that this aspect is aired in this debate this evening.  This side of the <Col N="1036" /> House feel that cattle and beef production is the most important agricultural enterprise in the country.  It is also the least developed and possibly the most under-capitalised.  Our beef and cattle industry has, traditionally, been run on a more extensive rather than an intensive scale, with fluctuating and low profits.  It is also characterised by different stages of production.  Calf rearing, summer store grazing and beef production are distinctive and certainly are not integrated in one form.  The major difficulty has often been that good profits from one sector have been at the expense of another.</P>
    <P>The recent trend of encouraging calf to beef production is sensible and should be encouraged.  I believe it will ultimately lead to greater stability in the trade.  It is important that the crucial role of the cattle industry in our economy be recognised. In 1982 our total output was valued at about £655 million.  It is quite feasible to increase this output by 20 per cent in volume alone within a relatively short period.  This would result in increased earnings of over £130 million.  Questions were put to the Minister and his views and those of the Department were sought about the approach of the Minister and the Government to increasing the national cattle herd.</P>
    <P>I feel that an increase in our cattle herd must be a first priority.  The withdrawal of the farm modernisation grants scheme will certainly hinder that increase.  It is a step in the wrong direction.  I feel such expansion would have enormous benefits for the whole country.  The effect on the balance of payments would be dramatic. Unlike many other industries the means and the technology to secure this expansion are readily available.  The drive to get this increase in numbers must be pursued simultaneously on several fronts. Beef cow numbers, which are very responsive to the prevailing economic climate have fallen by nearly 50 per cent over the past seven years and, unfortunately, they are still falling.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised that farmers need to plan well ahead before embarking on such an enterprise.  This is where we need Government planning over a <Col N="1037" /> period of four to five years.  While you can wind down cattle production almost overnight it takes many years to build up the cattle herd.  It is incumbent on the Government to provide guaranteed support for at least five years in grants and capital at reasonable interest rates.  From what we have heard from the Minister today in reply to a number of questions we put to him, I feel this is not forthcoming. No area is more deserving of some form of subsidy and nowhere else would the return to the economy be greater than in this field.  The provision of medium to long-term capital at subsidised rates is essential because of the present recession and the high interest rates prevailing.  It would be unrealistic, with the recent decline in farm incomes, to expect many farmers to set up or expand suckler herds under those terms.</P>
    <P>The formation of producer groups should be encouraged and positive incentives, possibly in the form of higher grants and subsidised interest, should be made available to such groups.  They have been very successful in other EEC countries. Special Community aid is available for their formation.  While this side of the House can justificably criticise the approach of the Government and the Minister with regard to agricultural production, nevertheless I feel there is an obligation on us, while we are in Opposition temporarily, to run the Department of Agriculture and agriculture generally from the Opposition benches.  We intend to do this.</P>
    <P>We will also put up positive, constructive alternatives because I feel there is little point in criticising without putting up constructive alternatives.  We hope this is what we are doing here this evening. The disruption caused by the disease eradication programme is well documented. We must make every effort to free the country finally of tuberculosis and brucellosis whilst continuously monitoring the implementation of the schemes, thereby ensuring the minimum amount of hardship on farmers.  Therefore, increased production in this area is important.</P>
    <P>We have advanced alternative suggestions to the Minister and we hope he and <Col N="1038" /> his Department will take heed of what we have said on this side of the House because it constitutes positive alternatives. Also, in order to encourage an increase in our beef and cattle numbers attention must be given to the provision of winter fodder; at present too much of our winter fodder is made from hay rather than silage.  I would ask the Minister to make grants available in a positive approach to the making of silage.  All of this will help increase cattle numbers, so essential and of such enormous benefit to the country generally.  I hope the Minister will have some positive suggestions to make.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy Noonan I am grateful to be given this opportunity of raising this issue here this evening. Indeed the reason this question is being raised now is that we were unsuccessful last week in gleaning information from the Minister on his proposals to increase the national herd.  Two Parliamentary Questions, Nos. 31 and 32 were put down on 2 June 1983 asking the Minister the proposals he had to increase the national herd.  In my opinion the answer given was pathetic and did not constitute an answer at all.  Subsequent supplementary questions were treated with contempt and sarcasm.  This would appear to be a true indication of the Minister's interest in increasing the national herd.  I might quote part of the Minister's reply which read:</P>
      <P>A range of measures is already in operation to encourage farmers to expand livestock numbers.</P>
      <P>&mdash; a range of measures introduced by the Fianna Fáil Party and reluctantly continued by the Minister.  He did not spell out any of his own proposals because he has none.  Then the Minister continued in his reply to say:</P>
      <P>I am glad to note that slaughterings at our meat export premises to date this year are 8 per cent higher than the corresponding period last year and I hope that this upward trend will continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage we want more than hope. <Col N="1039" /> That is why I say that the Minister's answer then and indeed his answers today are an indication of his interest in the whole business of agriculture.</P>
    <P>The national herd commenced its fall in 1974 when factories paid a ridiculously low price for cattle, when the export of cattle was at an all-time low.  We are aware of instances of farmers going to the mart with one calf to sell and sometimes returning to their trailer to find two calves in it, the situation then was so bad and such were the prices being paid.  That was followed soon afterwards by the vets strike, one from which the country has not yet recovered.  That strike was protracted with gross neglect by the then Government of the seriousness of the matter.  That undoubtedly reduced our herd size because of the increase in the incidence of disease.  The fall in cattle numbers continued but Fianna Fáil introduced measures to curtail that slide and had a scheme prepared, just before the last election, under which £100 million would have been made available for the purpose of increasing the cattle herd. This Government ignored that scheme totally.  As admitted in the Minister's reply, the Government themselves have no initiative to offer.  They have discontinued the farm modernisation scheme which undoubtedly acted as a discouragement to an increase in cattle numbers.  As I have already said, this Government have reluctantly continued some other Fianna Fáil schemes.</P>
    <P>I would pose the question: is agriculture still our greatest natural resource?  It is very difficult to believe that that view is shared by the Government.  Any Government must tap that great resource.  This can be done only by increasing livestock numbers and possibly, to a lesser degree, tillage acreage. Both must be good for our economy.  It must be remembered that ours is the best land in Europe, the best for grazing in Europe, we having nine months' growth as opposed to five months in some European countries and as little as three months in others.  We must take full advantage of that fact but we have not; in <Col N="1040" /> fact we are going in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister recognise the importance of an increase in livestock numbers? I am appealing to him to provide an incentive to farmers to increase their cattle numbers immediately because increased productivity means extra jobs at marts, meat factories and creameries.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister, replying to my Parliamentary Question No. 33 of 2 June last asking the action he proposed to take to have a greater volume of slaughtering at our meat plants, indicated that to date this year we had had an 8 per cent increase over the corresponding period last year.  However, it would appear he did not tell the full story because he had not taken into account the weather we have been having, when people were disposing of stock they would not dispose of at other times, because of slow growth, persistent rainfall and scarcity of feed.  In my constituency, where there are two meat plants, one was closed a year ago, the second has been closed for the past six months and is unlikely to open for another two months.  There is a plant owner in an adjoining county contemplating moving across the border for slaughterings because of the excessive costs involved on labour, energy, telecommunications and interest charges. Indeed a month ago here when we had a debate on unemployment there were meat factory workers demonstrating outside this building, distributing leaflets claiming that 750 people had been laid off and another 150 placed on a two-day week in County Kildare in three plants in that county, in Leixlip, Premier Meats, and Kildare Chilling Company which they claimed had a capacity to kill 30 per cent of all cattle for disposal.  It is difficult to reconcile that claim with the Minister's contention that we have had an 8 per cent increase in slaughterings at our meat export premises to date this year.  We condemn the Minister for not removing the anomaly which has left Britain in recent months in a favourable position in operating the variable slaughtering premiums in respect of their exports to other areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1041" /> The situation in regard to the national herd is that it is now lower than when we joined the EEC.  We must remember that at that time expectations were high as to how we would develop.  In fact there was even talk of increasing the herd from something less than 7 million to 10 million over a ten-year period.  That was the prediction at that time.  We had a cattle herd of 5,783,100 in December last, which was lower than it was in June last.  Of course I am not disputing the peak and valley periods.  However, I think the Minister would agree that the increase has been minimal.  He must accept there has been a substantial decrease in in-calf heifers. While there has been an increase in cow numbers, it is the increase in the numbers of in-calf heifers that is the important factor in the increase in stock generally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The current difficulties of the meat trade are due primarily to the exceptionally high level of slaughterings in 1980 coupled with substantial exports of live cattle, both legal and illegal.  A record factory kill in 1980 took place at the expense of a drastic reduction in the breeding herd.  We all know that happened. The national herd goes in cycles. There are the peaks and the valleys.  The year 1980 was a particularly bad valley period because of the number of slaughterings that took place.  We are still trying to make up the decline that occurred in the national herd as a result of the number of slaughterings in 1980.</P>
      <P>Indications are that there was a gradual shift away from live exports in favour of meat plants in 1982.  Cattle slaughterings at meat export plants increased by more than 6 per cent on their admittedly low 1981 volume.  As I said last Thursday, in the first few months of the current year there was an 8 per cent increase over the corresponding period last year.  The levels in 1981 and 1982 were relatively low and I agree with Deputy Leonard in that. I am not trying to make a case for something that occured in the period of office of another Government.  The national herd numbers rise and fall in cycles.  Fortunately we are coming out of the downward swing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1042" /> In 1982 slaughterings accounted for 73 per cent of total export disposals compared with 68 per cent in 1981.  The outlook for 1983 suggests a continuation of this trend and, consequently, an increased share of available supplies is likely to be sold to meat export plants.</P>
    <P>With regard to legal exports, a prohibition is not permissible under EEC rules and would not be in the long-term national interest.  It would reduce competition for cattle supplies and by weakening prices would affect the returns to producers.  As a result it would affect production in future years.</P>
    <P>Exports of live cattle to non-EEC countries have increased dramatically in the past few years, mainly to north Africa.  The increase in live exports to north Africa coincided with a sharp decrease in the traditional live exports to Britain and member states of the EEC. The overall level of live exports in 1982 was the lowest for over 30 years with the exception of 1979.  In that year we exported a large number of cattle to Britain but this is not the case nowadays. Live exports in 1982 were 125,000 head lower than in 1980 and 62,000 head lower than in 1981.</P>
    <P>The live export to north Africa is a development of recent years.  Such exports are possible because of the EEC system of export refunds which are designed to bridge the gap between high EEC prices and low world market prices. These refunds apply to both cattle and beef exported to third countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to the cattle supply outlook, recovery in disposals will be gradual. I have heard the word &ldquo;immediate&rdquo; used here tonight.  There cannot be an immediate increase: the increase will only be gradual.  We will not get dramatic results overnight.  The main problem is low cattle numbers and the main concern of the Government is to improve that situation.</P>
    <P>The calf premium and calved heifer schemes are two of the special measures that have been introduced with a view to increasing cattle numbers.  The reduction last year in EEC export refunds both for live heifers and heifer beef is an additional incentive in this regard.  As in any <Col N="1043" /> expansionary phase of the cattle cycle, some of the extra numbers are retained for stock accumulation rather than sales for slaughter or live export.</P>
    <P>Total cattle numbers declined from 7.18 million in June 1979 to 6.93 million in June 1980 and 6.7 million in June 1981. In June 1982 total numbers were again 6.7 million.  Over the period 1979 to 1981 the national cow herd fell from 2.11 million in 1979 to 2.03 million in 1980 and 1.98 million in 1981.  However, in June 1982 this trend was reversed and the national cow herd recovered to 2.02 million, an increase of 37,000 over June 1981.  Cow numbers were again up last December, this time by over 53,000 and total numbers were up by 25,000.  I think it is fair to say that the underlying decline in numbers has been arrested.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to take this opportunity to announce the continuation in 1983 of the calved heifer scheme which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, launched in February 1982 when he was Minister for Agriculture.  This is worth £70 for each additional calved heifer. This is in contradiction of what Deputy Byrne stated&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>With the continuation of this scheme very generous incentives are available to farmers to expand numbers. In fact, a farmer in the disadvantaged areas can receive grants of up to £169 for a cow and calf in a beef herd or £138 in a dairy herd.  Elsewhere the comparable figures are £118 and £93.</P>
      <P>I wish to repeat that the £100 million Euro-loan which has been referred to by Opposition Deputies would cost over a five-year period something in the region of £25 million.  The previous Government, irrespective of what they may say here, did not make any provision for this money in the 1983 Book of Estimates which are there for anyone to examine. In our endeavours to get an improved national herd we provided £3 million in the current budget for increased prices for reactors.  We also provided £3.26 million for AI services which were not provided for in the previous Book of Estimates. Those are positive incentives to increase the national herd.  I should like if those points were borne in mind.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the activities of the &ldquo;Young Ireland&rdquo; group which originated in Oatlands College, Stillorgan, and I have been following their progress and development with interest.  The Oatlands' pupils and teachers have shown tremendous enthusiasm and drive in launching their &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; promotion and it is very gratifying to see that their initiative is being duplicated in schools throughout the country.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Treaty of Rome precludes the Government from directly encouraging or supporting schemes &mdash; such as the one organised by the &ldquo;Young Ireland&rdquo; group &mdash; designed to promote the purchase of Irish goods on the domestic market.  In fact a Judgement of the European Court of Justice in November 1982 specifically condemned the Irish Government for its involvement in the organisation of a campaign to promote the sale and purchase of Irish products within its own territory.</P>

      <P>I presume that the Deputy's concern is related to the implications for Irish manufacturing firms of the present level of importation of footwear.  This is a matter on which, because of our obligations as members of the EEC, freedom of action is limited.  Within those limitations, however, Ireland has succeeded in recent years in having restrictions applied to imports from certain third countries. Because of the level of imports from third countries in 1982, my Department have for a number of months past been endeavouring to secure the agreement of the EEC Commission to restricting imports into Ireland from several additional third countries.</P>
      <P>The operation of licensing arrangements in respect of imports of footwear is a matter for the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>

    <P>Community Youth Training Programme:</P>
    <P>Under AnCO's Community Youth Training Programme four projects have been approved since December 1982 but have not yet commenced.  The projects are as follows: St. Brendan's GAA Park Development Committee &mdash; to complete the remaining work on a new handball alley; Galway County Association for Mentally Handicapped Children &mdash; the painting and decorating of two old classrooms; Kilcoona Development Association &mdash; the building of a new community centre; Skehana Community Council &mdash; the conversion of an old two-roomed school into community centre.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are nine community youth training projects at present under way.</P>
    <P>Workshop for Socially Disadvantaged:</P>
    <P>AnCO has recently approved a workshop for the training and education of young travelling people to be located in Tuam.  The workshop will be run in conjunction with the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>This workshop is additional to the existing three workshops in County Galway for travelling people and the workshop for young offenders in Ballinasloe.</P>

      <P>In so far as the Forest and Wildlife Service of my Department is concerned, activities in the current year centre largely around the development and maintenance of the seven State forests in the county with a total area of about 10,000 hectares of which some 9,500 hectares are planted.</P>
      <P>These activities, which involve, <i>inter alia</i>, some new land acquisitions and planting and forest road development, provide employment for 70 workmen.  It is expected that harvesting of forest produce (in the form of thinnings and clear-felling) this year will make available a total of approximately 10,000 m3 of timber for processing by various industrial firms inside and outside the county.</P>
      <P>The possibility of releasing turbary on State forest properties for turf production is under consideration.</P>
      <P>Operation of the &ldquo;Open Forest&rdquo; policy and, in particular, the management of the forest park at Currahchase (Adare Forest) is being continued in the interests of providing facilities for public recreation and enjoyment.</P>

      <Col N="831" /> Private forestry, including planting under the EEC western package scheme (in so far as the scheme relates to County Limerick) is being encouraged.</P>

      <P>The Broadcasting Review Committee Interim Report on Cable Television and Programme Choice submitted on 22 February 1973 recommended that RTE should have a second television channel on which it would broadcast throughout the country a selection from BBC, ITV and other programmes, as well as a content of home-produced programmes. Following the interim report, RTE sought on 18 April 1973 a decision which would enable them to plan and establish a second national television service by the end of 1975.</P>
      <P>The Government agreed on 16 October 1973 that the necessary arrangements for the provision of a transmitter and a microwave link network should proceed to facilitate the provision of a second television channel.  The then Minister conducted negotiations with the United Kingdom authorities between May 1973 and July 1975 on the possibility of rebroadcasting a British television service on this network.</P>
      <P>In August 1975 it was decided that a public opinion survey should be carried out on the question of programme choice for the second television network.  The result of the survey indicated a strong preference for a second RTE television service and the Government decided on 7 November 1975 that the new network should be used for this purpose.</P>

      <P>Section 8&mdash;</P>

      <P>British coins are not legal tender within the State.  Only coins provided by the State have legal tender status, in accordance with the Decimal Currency Act, 1969. Until the ending of the one-for-one parity with sterling in 1979 British coins circulated widely here and were accepted at face value by the banks although they had no legal obligation to do so.  The banks in fact continue to accept at face value British coins which have an Irish equivalent.  I have been informed that the banks decided not to accept the new British £1 coin since it does not have an Irish equivalent and because of the costs that would arise in repatriation of the coins.</P>
      <P>Inquiries made by my Department and the Central Bank have not confirmed reports of any considerable inconvenience being caused to British visitors.

      <P>The <Col N="847" /> information sought by the Deputy is as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Paid by the Exchequer £1,836,129</P>
      <P>(b)  (i)  Due to the Exchequer £1,588,253</P>
      <P>(ii)  Due to the Central Bank NIL</P>
      <P>(ii)  Due to the Central Bank ......... NIL</P>
      <P>With regard to the amount of £1,836,129 shown at (a) above, the following points should be noted.</P>
      <P>(i)  the amount of £1,875,279 indicated in my reply of 17 May 1983 (No. 718 Dáil Official Report Vol. 342, column 1331) as having been paid by the Exchequer represents the gross amount due from the Exchequer in respect of the proved claims of depositors of Irish Trust Bank when it went into liquidation;</P>
      <P>(ii)  from this sum there falls to be deducted a sum of £39,150 in respect of moneys due by some customers to Irish Trust Bank, which the Liquidator was authorised by the Court to set-off against their deposits;</P>
      <P>(iii)  the actual Exchequer outlay, therefore, was £1,836,129;</P>
      <P>(iv)  the amount shown in the Appropriation Accounts under the heading &ldquo;Recoupment to the Central Bank of Ireland of Payments to the Liquidator of the Irish Trust Bank, Ltd.,&rdquo; is £1,843,611.  This falls to be reduced by an overpayment of £7,482 to give the net Exchequer outlay of £1,836,129.  The figure of £7,482 is included under the heading &ldquo;Miscellaneous Expenses&rdquo; in Account No. XI (Miscellaneous Revenue) in the Finance Accounts for the year 1980.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 668 and 669 together.</P>
      <P>The Anti-evasion Branch was set up by the Revenue Commissioners at the end of 1982 with responsibility for the overall co-ordination of anti-evasion work in respect of all the taxes and duties administered by the Revenue Commissioners. All of the staff assigned to that branch at present are general service personnel and already had been engaged on anti-evasion duties in different areas of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  No additional cost, therefore, arose from this change.</P>
      <P>The essential co-ordinating function of the new branch does not readily lend itself to estimation of its expected financial yield.  This will tend to be rather more indirect than direct, resulting primarily from the greater efficiency of the anti-evasion campaign through increased liaison between the different taxes and duties areas.</P>
      <P>There are at present no inspectors of taxes attached directly to the Anti-evasion Branch.  However, the actual investigative work in relation to individual cases is carried out, in the first instance, by inspectors in the various tax districts and, where back duty arises, by inspectors in the special Investigation Branch. In that branch there are 19 specially trained inspectors of whom five are qualified accountants.  The back duty settlements completed by the Investigation Branch in 1982 produced a yield of £2,945,945.  It is expected that a higher total will be achieved in 1983.</P>

The inspector wrote to the taxpayer on 13 April 1983 for additional information required to process the claim, but no reply was received.  The commissioner's inquiries have disclosed that the inspector's letter was not in fact received by the taxpayer as it was returned unanswered to the inspector's office on 25 May 1983.

The person concerned was last employed in the United Kingdom but her contributions there cannot be invoked under EEC regulations as she has had no <Col N="858" /> employment contributions under Irish legislation in the meantime.</P>
      <P>She claimed unemployment assistance and following an investigation of her case by a social welfare officer she was assessed with means at £11.90 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging in her father's household.  She is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £13.55 weekly being the maximum rate payable to her £25.45 less £11.90.  All arrears of unemployment assistance due were paid on 26 May 1983 and further payments are being made at weekly intervals as they become due.</P>

      <P>Pending the completion of investigations resulting from the accident, he was awarded disability benefit on an interim basis from 20 April 1982, the fourth day of incapacity, and pay-related benefit from 30 April 1982, the thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>
      <P>Injury benefit was subsequently allowed from the date of the accident and injury benefit over and above the disability benefit paid in the interim has been issued in respect of the period from 15 April 1982 to 13 October 1982, the maximum injury benefit period payable.</P>
      <P>The claim has been treated as one to disability benefit from 14 October 1982.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 23 April 1982 and was paid a total of 52 weeks benefit to 23 April 1983 based on his insurance record in the 1980-81 contribution year.  From 25 April 1983, his entitlement to disability benefit depended on his 1981-82 insurance record and payment was interrupted while inquiries were being made to establish his entitlement to benefit from that date.

      <P>The claimant was paid pay-related benefit at £25.50 per week to 2 April 1983, reduced to £20.40 per week from 4 April 1983.

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take questions Nos. 774 and 775 together.</P>
      <P>I have no function in relation to the institution or non-institution of criminal proceedings and, as a general rule, I would regard it as inappropriate and unwarranted for me to disclose information in relation to the possibility of criminal proceedings being taken against an identifiable person or company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this case, because certain information was public knowledge, I have already indicated to the House that the Garda completed an investigation into certain complaints and submitted a report to the law officers for a decision. That position remains unaltered.  Garda inquiries into certain other complaints <Col N="895" /> are continuing.  It would not be appropriate for me to give details of those complaints or to say when the report already completed was submitted to the law officers who, of course, may in any particular case ask for further inquiries to be made or who may consider it necessary to await reports in relation to other cases.</P>
    <P>I think it right to repeat also that the fact that the Garda have submitted a report to the law officers does not necessarily mean that they have formed any view as to whether the facts provide or are likely to provide grounds for criminal proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Garda investigations commenced on 16 March 1982.</P>

Copies are supplied free of charge to the law faculties of the universities and to other educational institutions.  Copies are also supplied free of charge to the Incorporated Law Society, to the Law Library, to the Oireachtas Library, and to the Incorporated Council of Law Reporting for publication in the Irish Reports if they are deemed by that council to be of sufficient importance.  I understand, however, that in certain family law cases, where confidentiality may be in question, judicial directions are given that copies of judgments should not be circulated and should be provided only to the parties involved in the proceedings.</P>
      <P>Written judgments are rarely given in the Circuit Court and written judgments are never given in the District Court.</P>

In that period 4,328 persons were given legal advice only and of these 2,755 persons were concerned with family law matters. Legal representation in court &mdash; as well as legal advice &mdash; was provided for 2,009 persons of whom 1,904 were concerned with family law matters.  The statistics for the subsequent period are not available and I am informed by the board that the figures could not be compiled at this stage without serious disruption of the board's work.  They will be compiled later for inclusion in the board's annual report.</P>
      <P>There is no breakdown of these figures as between husbands and wives.</P>
      <P>Statistical information in relation to the provision of services under the scheme is contained in the annual reports of the Legal Aid Board for the years 1980 and 1981 which have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if in view of the recent overruling by the High Court of an estranged father's objection to the provision of a passport for one of his children and the successful application to the court by the child's mother for a temporary passport, he will consider amending the legislation dealing with such matters.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am not aware of any judgment of the High Court which indicates a need for amendment of the legislation for which I have responsibility in relation to the rights of parents <i>vis-á-vis</i> their children or <i>vice versa.</i>  Moreover, <Col N="897" /> and without wishing to comment on any particular case, I would consider it as perfectly normal for the court to overrule a spouse's objection to the other spouse's travel arrangements where the court is satisfied that this is in the interest of their child's welfare.  Section 3 of the Guardianship of Infants Act, 1964, requires the court to have regard to the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration in deciding any question affecting the upbringing of the child.</P>

It was received in the Land Registry on 9 December 1982 and is at present receiving attention.  Applications such as this involve detailed and complex examination of title, usually necessitating extensive correspondence and the issue of statutory notices to interested parties. It is not possible at this stage to say when registration will be effected.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> There is no clear distinction between the concept of a study visit and that of a conference but, taking the question in the sense in which I assume the Deputy intended it, a total of 35 members of the force participated in training courses/study visits abroad during 1982 and it is estimated that a total <Col N="898" /> of 40 will participate in such courses/visits during 1983.  While it would not be appropriate to disclose details in relation to individual courses etc., I can say that the purpose of participation in such courses and study visits is to develop the professional competence of the Garda Síochána in areas such as crime investigation, drug trafficking and computerisation; that, in general, members up to and including the rank of chief superintendent are involved; and that the countries concerned are EEC member states and, in one case, the United States of America.</P>
