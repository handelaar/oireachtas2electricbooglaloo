      <P>That, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the proceedings on the Third, Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1982, and on the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Referendum (Amendment) Bill, 1982, shall be brought to a conclusion at 6.30 p.m. today by putting from the Chair forthwith and successively the Questions necessary to bring them to a conclusion.</P>

      <P>: I wish to object again to the use of the guillotine in this fashion. As I said previously, I registered my objection on Second Stage, at which time I was denied the right to speak.  Although I had put down an amendment which was subsequently voted on, I was refused the right to speak because of the use of the guillotine.  The amendment I put down was to the effect that the subject required much more serious discussion and debate and that it should have been referred to an all-party committee.  Because I still believe the subject requires much more discussion, thought and examination by this House in the interests of democracy, I object to the use of the guillotine in this fashion.  If anyone wishes to speak he or she should be given the right to do so. There should be no question of rushing through the amendment.</P>

That is why we have given the whole day to a debate on the matter and why we also gave adequate time on Second Stage for anyone who wished to speak.  We allowed the debate for a number of days and we considered that people had been given an opportunity to contribute then.  We are also allowing a full day's debate today.</P>

    <P>When I spoke at the conclusion of the Second Reading debate, I told the House that a decision had been made by my party that I should introduce this kind of amendment.</P>
    <P>I gave the reasons then and I do not think that I should delay the House by unnecessary repetition.  However, I think it is necessary that a few points should be clarified.</P>
    <P>The first point concerns the precise wording.  In my speech at the conclusion of the Second Reading, I said that the wording would be on the lines of the words I then used.  I quite deliberately left open the possibility that some minor change, not altering the sense of what was proposed, could be made before the formal amendment was put down.</P>
    <P>As it turned out, the Attorney General was quite satisfied that the wording that I had mentioned on Second Reading needed no change whatsoever &mdash; that it was entirely adequate to achieve its objective and that the technical criticisms that had been made about the alleged insufficiency of the word &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo; were not well founded.  Nevertheless, because the criticisms had been made and were being persisted in, I did not think it right that we in this House should embark on a futile and time-wasting argument about a side-issue and, as the Attorney General was satisfied that a few words could be added without harm to the meaning, the amendment that I am now formally putting to the House includes, <Col N="2003" /> as well as the word &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo;, those extra words, that is, the words &ldquo;or to deprive of force or effect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I think I should at this point refer to the statement issued last evening by the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign &mdash; PLAC &mdash; about the wording that I am proposing.  It is unnecessary for me to comment specifically on that statement in so far as it deals with the substance of the proposal, as the general comments that I shall be making are relevant to it.  I shall refer, therefore, to the technical criticisms only and, as far as they are concerned, I can sum up my position by saying that I cannot accept them as valid.</P>
    <P>This amendment would be an integral part of the Constitution.  The phraseology that nothing in the Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate certain kinds of laws does not and cannot possibly be held to mean that such laws might indeed be unconstitutional but that no procedure will exist to test the matter.  The prohibition on the invocation of the Constitution, being itself a part of the Constitution, clearly is more than a procedural bar &mdash; it expresses the intent that such laws are not unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>This being so, I suggest that there is not the slightest possibility that the Supreme Court could, on a reference of a Bill pursuant to Article 26, take a stance different in this respect from that it would have to take if the Bill had been enacted. To say otherwise is to say that the Supreme Court would give an interpretation contrary not only to the clear intent of the amendment but also to commonsense.</P>
    <P>As for the reference to the 1922 Constitution, the position is quite simple.  The point PLAC make was certainly not overlooked, and I think they might reasonably have assumed that it was not overlooked. The fact is that it is only a purely theoretical point and does not take account of the actual content of the 1922 Constitution.  If there is a risk that the 1861 Act could be declared to be inconsistent with the Constitution &mdash; by which of course I mean the present Constitution &mdash; that risk derives from the fact that there are, in that Constitution, certain <Col N="2004" /> Articles the precise scope of which is as yet undetermined by the courts and that these Articles may, for instance, implicitly recognise a right to privacy which would take precedence over the 1861 Act.  There are no corresponding provisions in the 1922 Constitution so the possibility of conflict or inconsistency could not arise in that context.  I do not believe that it would be right to clutter up the terms of the present amendment with useless verbiage that has no relevance, given the facts to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>I would also say that, while I can understand the disappointment of PLAC with recent developments, I would appeal to them not to add further to the difficulties and divisions by criticism which, in its content and tone, goes beyond what could reasonably be justified.  I do not object in any way to their saying what they feel they ought to say about substantive points but I would seriously urge them not to seek to make issues about mere technicalities on which there need be no disagreement.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the substance of the amendment, may I recall that, when referring to it on Second Stage, I adverted to the obvious fact that it does not seek to tie the hands of the Oireachtas, something that had already been noted in the newspapers that morning, in the context of my party's decision to sponsor such an amendment.  To my surprise, Deputy Woods subsequently referred to what I said as a &ldquo;damaging admission&rdquo;.  I wonder if the Deputy considered the implications of what he was saying.  It is my function, as I see it, to put the facts as clearly as I can before the House.  To speak, in this context, of my making admissions suggests that, for some unexplained reason, the Deputy thinks I should have come in here and tried to pretend that the amendment is something different from what it is.  Not only that but it suggests that, if I had done so, Members of the Dáil might not have noticed that I was misleading them. As I say, I find this kind of comment surprising.</P>
    <P>However, the point that I would like to make clear, as I formally propose this amendment, is that, when I said that the <Col N="2005" /> text as now proposed would not exclude the possibility of legislation by the Oireachtas, I meant only what I said and no more than that.  I am saying only what indeed is obvious, namely, that this text does not exclude that possibility.  I am not in any way expressing the view that nothing else in the Constitution is to be interpreted as recognising a right to life before birth.  Different people have different views on that question &mdash; that is, whether the Constitution already has an implicit recognition of a right to life before birth &mdash; and it is sufficient for my purpose to say that there are distinguished legal authorities amongst those who clearly believe that such a right already is recognised in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The reason I advert to this now is, I believe, a very important one.  It will be common ground that, if such a right was known with certainty to be recognised already, no amendment would be necessary &mdash; neither the one sponsored by the Opposition nor the one now proposed not any variation on either of them.  It may fairly be asked whether there is another side to this.  Granting that there must be a very real possibility &mdash; to put it no higher &mdash; that the courts would, as matters now stand, find in the Constitution a right to life before birth, might they feel precluded from doing so if this amendment were passed, seeing that the implication of their decision would be that the amendment was unnecessary?  In fact, that question has already been effectively answered in the negative, because the provision which is now identified as Article 40.4.3º of the Constitution, and which concerns <i>habeas corpus</i>, was inserted by way of amendment and, in a case that subsequently arose, the Supreme Court gave a decision which, by implication, showed that the amendment had been unnecessary.  It was unnecessary because the substantive part was shown to be already implicit in the Constitution &mdash; as part of something wider &mdash; and because the procedural part could have been effected by legislation.</P>
    <P>It follows that the consideration that an amendment would be shown to have been unnecessary would not be regarded by the Supreme Court as something that <Col N="2006" /> would preclude them from finding in the Constitution a right that they would have found in the absence of such an amendment. Accordingly, I suggest that the House can be fully assured that nothing in this amendment can possibly be interpreted as interfering with any existing rights in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>There remains the important question: what is wrong with the existing wording? Deputies are, of course, already by now well aware of what has been in the public press and of the fact that, on the best legal advice available to us, the existing wording has serious defects.</P>
    <P>Briefly, those defects are twofold: first, that the expression &ldquo;the unborn&rdquo; is very ambiguous; second, that the reference to the equal rights of the mother is insufficient to guarantee that operations necessary to save the live of the mother but resulting in the death of the foetus may continue.</P>
    <P>On the first point, it is scarcely necessary to say that objection is not being raised simply on the basis that there is a certain degree of ambiguity.  Some ambiguity is probably inescapable &mdash; language is not a precise instrument.  The criticism in this case is the extent of the ambiguity, a criticism which is strengthened by the fact that it was obviously accepted in order to avoid argument.</P>
    <P>On the second point, I would like the record to show very clearly what is being said by way of criticism &mdash; and what is not being said.  It is not being said that the wording would be held to make the operations in question unlawful.  Nobody could say with certainty what interpretation a court might put on the words.  What is being said is that, on the ordinary meaning of words, that should be the interpretation and that therefore there must be a definite risk.</P>
    <P>Now, the position in which we find ourselves is that I am sponsoring this amendment and, in effect, the Opposition are sponsoring the existing wording. I have sought to answer the questions that arise on my side.  If we are to have a reasoned debate, somebody on the Opposition side should, I suggest, undertake to answer the serious questions that arise on their wording.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2007" /> It has been said that no court, unless absolutely compelled to do so, would put such a construction on the words, given the fact that these operations are in accordance with long-established practice; and that it cannot be contended that the courts would be compelled to do so since an interpretation more favourable to the mother is at least an option open to them.</P>
    <P>My questions are these.  First, is it not the case, clearly and beyond any argument, that those particular operations, legitimate and necessary though they are, protect the life of the mother in a manner that in some cases must lead to the death of the foetus and that, in other cases, puts that life at serious risk?  Does it not follow that, while the death of the foetus is certainly not intended, in the ordinary meaning of the word &ldquo;intended&rdquo;, it is nevertheless a fact that, since the death of the foetus is a foreseen and even certain consequence, the action being taken gives priority to the mother's right to life? Now &mdash; and this is the crunch question &mdash; if the intention is, as no doubt it is, that these operations are not to be unlawful, why does the draft not say so?  Why does the text use language that its sponsors hope will be interpreted in a particular way by the Supreme Court but avoids expressing that intention with the kind of clarity which is attainable?  I should like to make it quite clear that I accept that all concerned hope, and indeed may feel confident, that that is the interpretation that the courts would opt for.  But the question remains: why does the text not say what its sponsors intend?</P>
    <P>I do not know what the thinking behind the choice of these words was.  The wording was, as we know, chosen by the former Government.  I have already explained to the House that the records available to me do not contain any analysis or any background information that would throw light on it.  I suggest that it is up to somebody on the Opposition side to clarify it, even if only so that in future years somebody may be able to read the record and find the answer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister's speech is very disappointing.  He would appear to be passing responsibility for this amendment to this side of the House and asking the questions of us.  I would have thought that it was the responsibility of the Minister to express clearly the necessity for a pro-life amendment and, if he is not proceeding with the pro-life amendment, to give us the reason for that change.</P>
      <P>The Minister has told us that at the conclusion of the Second Stage debate he told the House that a decision had been made by his party that he should introduce this kind of amendment.  Again, we are back to the question of the status of the Minister in relation to the amendment he is bringing forward.  Is it an amendment on behalf of his party or on behalf of part of that party or of part of that side of the House or is it an amendment of the Government as a whole?  I disagree with the Minister on the basic principle.  He tells us that at the conclusion of the Second Stage he told us that the wording would be on the lines of the words he used then.  He goes on to say that there was some minor technical change introduced but that apart from that the wording is on the lines used by him at the conclusion of his speech.  If we take the words that have been presented by the Minister, we find that there is a substantial departure from the principle enunciated by him in the first instance in bringing the Bill to the House.  In May 1981 the Taoiseach gave a firm commitment in principle on behalf of his party to a pro-life amendment.  One of the first problems we have with the amendment the Minister is putting at this stage is that it is not a pro-life amendment.  It is not an amendment of the kind that his Leader promised in the first instance or of the kind that was put before the electorate. Consequently, it is totally deficient in that respect.  The Minister would like to have us spend the day debating minor technical points but the first and fundamental element is that he has departed from the principle of the commitment given and from the commitment as contained in the general principle of the Bill and understood at Second Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach was the person who was <Col N="2009" /> first to give the commitment in principle. Some weeks later our party Leader gave a similar commitment in principle, that was to introduce a pro-life amendment. There was no political division at that stage on the issue.  There was general agreement on the matter up to the election of January 1981.  The Coalition were returned to office then and it is interesting to note that during their period in office no progress was made in relation to a pro-life amendment.  That situation assumes a new significance as it becomes clear that the Coalition at that time either did not intend to or were not able to get around to introducing the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: The point is that a new amendment is a departure from the principle which was agreed to and put forward by the Leader of Fine Gael.  I do not need to stress that, since it is well-known publicly.  There is clear evidence that the principle was accepted.  The Taoiseach, in one of his statements, referred to the amendment as proposed, which is the amendment included in the Bill, as being defined in positive terms and designed to strenghten the Constitution and protection <Col N="2011" /> of life.  In Opposition, and at earlier stages when in Government, the Taoiseach and his party were committed to the underlying principle of a pro-life amendment.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach was at great pains to emphasise that fact, a matter which has been dealt with clearly in the media and during the course of the Second Stage debate on the Bill.  There can be no doubt about the commitment by him to a positive pro-life amendment, such as is contained in the Bill and as was put to the House by the Government.  I accept that the Labour Party expressed concern about that amendment but there is no doubt that the Taoiseach unequivocally accepted the principle of the Bill.  In fact, the Minister for Justice on Second Stage said:</P>
      <P>... in approving of the principle of the Bill, which is what the House does in giving a Bill a Second Reading, Deputies would not as far as I am concerned be committing themselves to the particular wording now proposed or any other particular form of wording ...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That statement caused considerable dismay and shock in the House.  We were given to understand that when the Minister brought forward an amendment it would be about the basic principle of the pro-life amendment.  The amendment put forward by the Minister, without getting into any new technical detail, is not a pro-life amendment.  I must be permitted to make this fundamental point before we discuss the minutiae of the amendment.  It is because of this difference that so much of the confusion and debate has arisen.  Apart from the technical considerations it may be that on examination the Minister's amendment is deficient in that it does not comply with the basic principle put forward.  However, there is a wider problem because the basic issue is the integrity of political parties, of the system and the credibility of the Government and the House.  We have gone through the various processes, given various undertakings and passed the Second Stage when we understood <Col N="2012" /> the basic principle, but on Committee Stage we are presented with something which is entirely different and does not carry the basic pro-life principle.</P>
    <P>The original wording, the pro-life amendment, is:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>That wording has been contested on the grounds that it represents an interference on the part of the State.  All societies have their systems of values and they are reflected in constitutional framework. That is relevant in regard to what the Minister has said about the wording of the Bill.  He has put fundamental questions about whether we should have a Constitution and what we should have in such a Constitution.  I contend that every society has its system of values and in a democratic society they are reflected in a constitutional framework and in the laws.  It may be difficult to define the boundary lines between the religious-moral issues and issues which are both secular and moral.  That is one of the aspects of these amendments which has received considerable attention publicly. Even if those issues overlap, the State is not absolved from regulating the social order or from protecting fundamental rights.  The Minister has put one of those questions in regard to the amendment, what is the position of the State in relation to protecting fundamental rights. Irrespective of any person's private religious views it cannot be denied that the killing of the unborn is an issue which fundamentally affects the secular and social order of the State.  That is something which is fundamental to the order of our State and which we believe should be properly covered in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a document which was issued recently in Germany, Comparative Constitutional Law by Professor Walter Murphy, published by Princeton University entitled, Human Dignity and Public Health, Morals, and <Col N="2013" /> Safety.  That publication deals with the rights of the unborn and the duty of the State.  It deals with an Abortion Reform Law Case in the West German Constitutional Court and states:</P>
    <P>The Basic Law protects as an independent value the life which is developing in the mother's body.</P>
    <P>The State's duty of protection is far-reaching.  Of course, direct State interference in a developing life is outlawed; even further, the State must protect and promote this life, above all, defend it from unlawful interference by other persons ... human life is, as needs little proof, among the highest values in the Basic Law's order. It is the vital basis of human dignity and the precondition of all other basic rights.</P>
    <P>But because the foetus is an autonomous human being, under protection of the Constitution, termination of pregnancy has a social dimension which opens it to public regulation and demands regulation.</P>
    <P>Of course, the Basic Law also acknowledges and protects a woman's right to free development of her personality, which includes a general liberty of action and thereby also freedom to decide against parenthood ... But this right is not guaranteed without limitation.  The rights of others, the constitutional order and the moral code all restrict it.  The rights of a woman can never allow interference in the protected legal sphere of others without legitimizing reason, or permit destruction of life itself, especially if there exists by nature a special responsibility for this life.  A compromise which guarantees both protection of the foetus as well as freedom of abortion to the pregnant woman is impossible because termination of pregnancy always means destruction of unborn life.</P>
    <P>The State must, in principle, act in accordance with the mother's duty to carry out the pregnancy; in principle it must outlaw termination of pregnancy. This disapproval must be clearly expressed in the legal order.  The false <Col N="2014" /> impression must be avoided that termination of pregnancy is something like a visit to a doctor to cure an illness, or even a legal alternative to birth control. Neither can the State dismiss its responsibility by acknowledging &ldquo;a law-free State&rdquo; and, refraining from upholding values, leave them to autonomous individual decisions.</P>
    <P>It goes on to state:</P>
    <P>Certainly, the legislator has the primary constitutional duty to protect developing life.  Nevertheless, the Federal constitutional Court also has a constitutionally imposed responsibility to determine whether the legislator has fulfilled this duty.  The Court, of course, must carefully allow latitude. ... The Court must not put itself in the legislator's place.  Nevertheless, the Court has a duty to decide whether the legislator has done what is necessary, within the realm of the possible, to protect endangered values.</P>
    <P>This is basically what is achieved by the original Fianna Fáil pro-life amendment and the words &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; are included.  The Minister asked for some relevant references and this is one which he might wish to study further.</P>
    <P>Given that all sections of the community are opposed to indiscriminate abortion, it is not surprising that everybody supports this basic amendment.  At least, they supported it before the election but now we have a difference of opinion.</P>
    <P>I now go on to the wording used in the Fianna Fáil amendment.  It is interesting to consider the point at which it is to be introduced into the Constitution.  The text of the Fianna Fáil amendment contained in the Bill reintroduced by the Government is as follows:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>Similar words are used elsewhere in the Constitution.  Article 40.3.1º states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2015" /> The State guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate the personal rights of the citizen.</P>
    <P>What is so wrong with this language when it is applied to the life of the unborn? Article 40.3.2º states:</P>
    <P>The State shall, in particular, by its laws protect as best it may from unjust attack and, in the case of injustice done, vindicate the life, person, good name, and property rights of every citizen.</P>
    <P>The amendment contained in the Bill would become Article 40.3.3º and would state as follows:</P>
    <P>The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother, guarantees in its laws to respect, and, as far as practicable, by its laws to defend and vindicate that right.</P>
    <P>Article 40.4.1º states:</P>
    <P>No citizen shall be deprived of his personal liberty save in accordance with law.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to see the amendment in the context in which it will appear in the Constitution.  We can see that the words used are similar to those already used in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the Constitution already contains the same guarantees and protection for many fundamental and personal rights of the citizen, including the right to life.  This form of guarantee has existed in the Constitution for over 40 years.  Although expressed in general terms it has never been seriously challenged as being uncertain, yet this allegation is made about the proposed amendment.  The Constitution has been successfully invoked by citizens on numerous occasions to defend their fundamental and personal rights from attack by the State and it has been found by the courts that there is constitutional protection for many personal rights such as the right to bodily integrity, the right to work, the right to marital privacy and the <Col N="2016" /> right to freedom from inhuman treatment. If this constitutional protection can be invoked so successfully and in such a practical way to defend the rights of citizens, then it is difficult to understand why some people object when it is sought to extend the same protection and dignity to the life of the unborn child.  The extension of constitutional protection of the right to life of the unborn reflects the place we give in our society to that right while at the same time recognising the right to life of the mother.</P>
    <P>It is well established in the courts that none of the personal rights of the citizen is absolute or unlimited.  The Fianna Fáil proposal does not create absolute or unlimited guarantees for the life of the unborn.  Such rights are general and fundamental but they are not absolute rights. The proposed amendment specifically acknowledges the equal right to life of the mother, and the laws of the State may therefore provide for the exercise of that right when it is threatened.  There is specific provision for this.  In the present circumstances the right to life of the mother is clear and it is certain that it must be protected.  The Constitution supports the concept that a mother in a life-threatening position must be given the medical treatment required.  A mother will continue to have a constitutional right to life and if her life is threatened by illness she is constitutionally entitled to appropriate medical treatment, even if such treatment would result in the termination of her pregnancy.  This is also the position in statute law and the amendment would not alter existing legislation or the medical practice which is in accord with it.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach recently raised the scare that medical practitioners would not be able to give the treatment necessary in life-threatening situations if this amendment were made.  We have available to us the best legal advice and it has been consistent over a long period.  That is why I made reference to the length of time over which this issue has been before us. It is quite clear that rights at present guaranteed in the Constitution would continue to apply following the amendment to the Constitution.  Mothers need <Col N="2017" /> have no fear that there would by any change in the position because their fundamental rights are already included in the Constitution.  Those rights would still obtain.  The advice we have had has been consistent despite renewed referrals on our part from time to time.</P>
    <P>It is also the advice given by many people outside the House who are interested in this.  We have the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign, the lawyers associated with it and the statement by the university professors of obstetrics and gynaecology.  Five eminent professors on 15 April said:</P>
    <P>We have read with astonishment the statement by the Taoiseach, Dr. FitzGerald, to the effect that the original wording for the Constitutional amendment would probably &ldquo;condemn to death&rdquo; women whose lives are now saved by operations which have been performed within the law for more than a century in Ireland and in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>They also stated:</P>
    <P>Dr. FitzGerald has also cast doubt on the legality of existing well-established medical practice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: I gave the reference.  It is the statement by university professors of obstetrics and gynaecology of 15 April. It has been fairly widely distributed.  I believe all Deputies have received a copy.  The statement continued:</P>
      <P>Doctors do not act on crude assumptions about the legality of their actions. Dr. FitzGerald's assertions will be a source of much unnecessary alarm.  We have found the original wording proposed for the amendment to be entirely satisfactory.  We believe that this wording would present us with no difficulties in the proper discharge of our professional responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is signed by John Bonner, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Eamon de Valera, Professor of Obstetrics and <Col N="2018" /> Gynaecology, University College, Dublin, David Jenkins, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College, Cork, Kieran O'Driscoll, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College, Dublin and Eamon O'Dwyer, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, University College, Galway. What I have said is really the basic legal interpretation of the constitutional right as we are advised and which is quite clear in very practical terms and has been the practice here for many years past. Not only can we rely on our own practical judgment, on the volume of legal and medical advice which we have had available to us in this situation, but we also have a flood of distinguished and imminent lawyers as well as gynaecologists and obstetricians coming out quite horrified at the suggestion which the Taoiseach made and I am sure quite horrified that the Minister should come back and reiterate those sentiments again today on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I hope it is quite clear that the mother's right will still be as it is at present, that nothing in the amendment in the Bill will alter that position, and that her right at present derives from her fundamental right to receive the treatment which she requires in a life threatening situation.  In addition to all this both Attorneys General who served in the last Fianna Fail administration concluded that our proposal is adequate and effective to protect the life of the unborn and at the same time the right to life of the mother.  The Fianna Fail wording leaves totally intact the right to life of the mother.</P>
    <P>As far as we are concerned, the question is quite clear and we are quite happy with that aspect of it.  As far as the pro-life movement are concerned &mdash; a movement of very responsible people who have taken a responsible interest at a time when they saw there could be a creeping development of a movement towards abortion in the country &mdash; they are also quite satisfied with the wording we have in this respect as well as in other respects.</P>
    <P>Various other questions have been raised about the right to life of the unborn.  It is interesting that virtually all <Col N="2019" /> groups wanted a positive formulation of an amendment.  The pro-life groups wanted specifically to acknowledge the right to life of the unborn.  The Protestant Churches were particularly anxious, as we found when we were preparing our wording, that negative prohibitions should not be written into the Constitution. The Minister at the moment is proposing negative prohibitions.  What he is proposing has limitations in its own way. The Standing Committee of the Church of Ireland in a Resolution of 21 June 1982 stated:</P>
    <P>We cannot emphasise too strongly the right to life and this includes the right to life of the yet unborn.</P>
    <P>If we go on to the question with due regard to &ldquo;the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo; the reference to that equal right to life is the right to life of the mother, the same as the right to life of all citizens is an equal right.  It was to quell any fears expressed in certain quarters that the right to life of the unborn might be given precedence over the right to life of the mother that that was included in the amendment.  The Church of Ireland in a statement of 16 November 1982 said:</P>
    <P>In particular, we are relieved that the proposed wording of the amendment acknowledges the right to the the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Attorney General have sought to suggest that a phrase put in specifically to spell out the protection enjoyed by the mother could remove that protection and somehow condemn her to death by disallowing certain long established medical practices.  This, as I have tried to point out, is not the case.</P>
    <P>We have seen that the unanimous opinion of the senior gynaecologists supports us in that respect.  It has also been pointed out that the wording in no way obliges the Supreme Court to take a perverse interpretation of the wording.  The qualification as far as practicable is important in this respect.  This is why the wording, as far as practicable, has been included. <Col N="2020" /> It now appears that the Leader of Fine Gael, the Taoiseach, is in open conflict with the Catholic Church, certainly with some members of it, in respect of the claim he has been making.  In <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 26 April 1983 the Bishop of Kerry said:</P>
    <P>The mere suggestion conjures up an image of the law which it is impossible to accept.  What is being suggested is that, once an amendment of the above type had been passed, the law would be bound to invade the doctor's surgery and restrain him from carrying out life-saving operations which have been standard medical practice all over the world for more than a century.  One cannot credit that the law has no access to sound principles which would relieve it of the obligation to do anything of the kind.</P>
    <P>Dr. Ryan, the Archbishop of Dublin, has likewise described the argument by the Taoiseach as a calumny.  The position of the Protestant Churches in relation to our wording has been called into question as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: The position of the Protestant Churches in relation to the wording has been called into question.  Archbishop McAdoo in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 4 November 1982 said: &ldquo;The proposal seems just and adequate.&rdquo;  Archbishop Armstrong, the Archbishop of Armagh in an RTE interview on 3 April 1983, commenting on the original draft said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We accepted it in the beginning and we were very pleased.  As we said in the statement, in both cases the <Col N="2021" /> Government approached the Church of Ireland to ask for their opinions in the matter and they gave their opinions. It is only an attempt and does not go the whole way.  It was accepted by us at the time as an attempt to deal with the difficult moral problems.  I do not change my opinion from the time it was submitted to us by the previous Government.</P>
    <P>In their statement of 16 November 1982 the standing committee of the Church of Ireland while repeating certain previously expressed reservations said:</P>
    <P>Having now studied the text of the proposed Eight Amendment to the Constitution the Standing Committee values the following observations:</P>
    <P>(1)  We recognise that an attempt has been made to take account of the complexity of the subject and the views expressed by our own and other churches, and</P>
    <P>(2)  We are relieved that the proposed wording of the amendment acknowledges the right to life of the unborn with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposed by Fine Gael would not protect the constitutional right to life of the mother against attack by any future legislation which sought to prohibit abortion in all circumstances even when the life of the mother was at risk. This is a defect which could be important in the future.  Such legislation could not be declared unconstitutional on the grounds that it ignored a mother's right to life because the Fine Gael wording provides that nothing in the Constitution may be invoked to invalidate any law which probibits abortion.</P>
    <P>Some people have claimed that the proposal to amend the Constitution is sectarian.  The Minister has made it quite clear that he does not regard it as sectarian. We shall see as the day progresses if that is still his view.  As far as we are concerned, it is not sectarian.  Virtually all sections of the community and all churches accept the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 which is understood to <Col N="2022" /> render the procurement of abortion unlawful except where the life of the mother is at risk.</P>
    <P>The proposed Fianna Fail amendment will not alter the present statute law or make it more restrictive.  It will simply ensure that abortion on demand cannot be introduced without consultation with the people through a referendum.  The Church of Ireland has not described the proposal as sectarian.  As far as we are concerned, in providing these guarantees which are not absolute, the proposal extends to the life of the unborn in a very positive way the same protection which exists in the Constitution for other fundamental rights.  There is nothing inherent in the right to life of the unborn and the value which society places on it which makes it less worthy as an object of constitutional protection than many of the other rights recognised in our democrary.</P>
    <P>The Coalition proposal does not acknowledge the right to life of the unborn let alone provide for its protection. Their policy is to reserve for the Oireachtas the right to leglislate for abortion in the future.  As the Minister said at the outset, it is reasonable to criticise this amendment for what it does not contain. He looked for support on some technical improvements he has made.  It is true that the amendment does not go far enough. It does not provide protection for the unborn child and it is on this basis that we feel that it is deficient.  One of the reasons we have rights and freedoms written into the Constitution is to protect them from attack by the State.  The courts are the independent upholders of the Constitution and can strike down any laws which make such an attack.  A former President and Chief Justice, Cearbhall Ó Dálaigh, once said when referring to the guarantees of fundamental rights in the Constitution that such guarantees are not political shibboleths but provide a positive protection for the citizen.</P>
    <P>The amendment before the House fails to give any positive protection against abortion being introduced by law in the future without any reference to the people.  It does not acknowledge the right to life of the unborn nor does it seek to <Col N="2023" /> protect that life in the future.  We may ask what value it expresses in our Constitution other than bringing a negative prohibition into it.  What right does it seek to protect in the Constitution? It is a negation of a pro-life amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment before us seeks to copperfasten the right of the Oireachtas to introduce abortion without consulting the people.  It will also curtail the functions of one of the institutions of the State, that is the courts, and prevent them from passing judgment on whether the Oireachtas has acted in accordance with the wishes of the people.  It sets a dangerous precedent by undermining one of the institutions of State and fails to recognise that we are a constitutional democracy and not merely a parliamentary one. Those in the pro-life movement do not want to restrain the Supreme Court in their activities but seek to have a positive statement in our Constitution of the values we hold so important so that it will be there as a guide to the courts.  The Minister's amendment placing a stricture on the courts would be most unusual in relation to the Constitution.  It has been suggested by those in the anti-amendment campaign that the Constitution already contains a protection of the right to life of the unborn and that, therefore, there is no need for the amendment.</P>

      <P>: In relation to the Fine Gael wording as proposed here, I have tried to show how this wording is substantially at variance with the principle which was put forward by the proposers of the Bill in the first instance.  They will recognise <Col N="2025" /> that, and I appreciate the Minister's sensitivity about that aspect.  I believe it is not going to meet the promises and commitments which were given in the first instance.  The words which have been put forward by the Government in their amendment are extremely limited and do not represent a pro-life commitment.  It has been made quite clear that they could be technically deficient, and in that respect the Minister has made an amendment at a very late stage.  However, even that does not merit a great deal of consideration in the House because of the very limited nature of the amendment which the Minister is putting forward. We have been treated to a variation of words and proposals and we have had the Minister's advice and suggestions.  He appears to be at variance with his own colleagues and Attorney General in relation to the words which have been chosen. We will be going into further details later regarding the legal, medical and other aspects.</P>
      <P>From the beginning we have been anxious to have a pro-life amendment which would bring into our Constitution the guarantees to the unborn which we gave an undertaking to do and which we are prepared to continue.  We are not anxious to get into argument over minor points. The Minister has asked me to answer some questions in relation to our Bill.  He referred to the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; being ambiguous.  He must be one of the few people in the country who makes that claim.  One could say &ldquo;the right to life of the unborn life&rdquo; if the Minister felt it was necessary but most people would say that that is not necessary.  I could refer to the Minister's advices which either he or someone else leaked from his Department&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>: There is nothing ambiguous about the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo;.  Even the Minister's own advice seems to have been to that effect.  The most likely interpretation which he gave also and which the Attorney General gave in his advices &mdash; I have a copy of these also, although I will not suggest how they came out in case I would be in trouble with the Chair. Even the Attorney General says that the most likely interpretation is the one which we have put on it and which any sensible, reasonable juror will put on it. Therefore, the Minister should stop confusing people by asking someone to explain it to him.  I am sure it has been explained to him and there is not much doubt about it now.  If the Minister takes the Irish version, &ldquo;na mbeo gan breith&rdquo; it is much clearer, takes precedence and nobody, including the Minister, seems to find any fault whatever with it.  That is included in part I of the Schedule and is generally accepted as being quite clear. There are no reservations about it and it takes precedence over the English version. With regard to the unborn, the Minister has said that that could be made clearer.  It could, by putting in an exact point; but this is the reason for having a Constitution, where the general point is quite clear and the detail in relation to it can be discussed in relation to the views of the medical and legal people at the time.  The Minister felt that one could put in &ldquo;from fertilisation&rdquo; or &ldquo;from conception&rdquo;, and of course one could.  That is the generalised nature of the rights which are involved here.  It is not necessary to do that and it would be unduly restrictive within the Constitution to take that approach.  It is quite clear to all concerned the general point at which life begins and, beyond that, it is a matter for the courts and the general practice, which is quite clear at present.  If, in future, <Col N="2027" /> there is any further evidence or information emanating from medical, legal or others in relation to it, it can be considered but within the situation where the unborn clearly have the right to life enshrined in the Constitution.  The Minister referred to the equal rights of the mother being insufficient.  I have said enough about that.  We have had two Attorneys General who agreed on that point and most people are in agreement about it at this stage.  I do not think there is any need for the Minister to worry about that point.</P>
      <P>Therefore, we regard the wording which we have in our amendment as satisfactory. We believe that it will meet the requirements which have been put to us to put a positive pro-life amendment.  The amendment of the Minister here is defective in that it does not protect the life of the unborn.  It does not provide positive pro-life cover, so to speak, the fundamental right in the Constitution.  In that sense, therefore, we believe it should be rejected and we see no difficulty with the original formulation.  Before the House also is another amendment which seeks to make the right to life of the unborn subject to the right to life of the mother. Of course, all the rights are equal rights and if we begin to give the unborn a specifically lesser right that would leave the position of the unborn particularly vulnerable.  That amendment is included in those put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa and it is No. 3 on the schedule of amendments which was circulated today, 27 April 1983.</P>
      <P>At this stage we will leave it.  That is our position and we are quite prepared to discuss and debate the details within that position in the course of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: At the outset let me commend my colleague, the Minister for Justice, for his continued endeavours to bring objective public and political judgment to bear on this grave referendum proposal which was not of his making in the first instance.  Let me also support and thank the Attorney General for his unambiguous advice to the Government and the people on the complex constitutional implications of the many propositions which have surfaced on this major question.  The public debate which has taken place has proved to be divisive to an extent unprecedented in recent times. It has generated confusion and bitterness, which do not provide a stable basis for decisions as important as changing our Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only acceptable way of approaching a discussion on the form of words to <Col N="2029" /> be used in a referendum is to clarify that which we seek to achieve.  As I understand it, the instigators of this campaign for constitutional change were concerned that legal interpretation could result in the introduction of abortion, against the clear will of the majority of our people. Leaving aside whether such a fear is realistic, that at least is a particular aim. However, there is an incredible reluctance on the part of those same people to accept the clear implications of their favoured amendment.</P>
    <P>The highest law officers of our country have confirmed for the Government what seems quite likely to the layman: that is that the original form of words proposed by Fianna Fáil would result in most serious uncertainty.  The only means of resolving that uncertainty, arising from the clash of two proposed equal rights of the mother and child, is to test it in the courts.  As a result, the final decision on whether and in what circumstances the procedures amounting to abortion would be permitted would rest with the Judiciary. Yet this is precisely the result which the campaigners sought originally to avoid.  Equally seriously, legal interpretation of this form of cords would resolve the conflict of rights in such a way as to prohibit medical treatment which is currently available for life-threatening conditions. I point out to the House that every year between 300 and 500 ectopic pregnancies occur in Ireland.  Surgical intervention which can result in the death of the foetus is necessary in such cases, as it is for treatment of cancer of the womb.  More generally, to give two examples only, I wish to draw to the attention of the House the recent statement by the Dean of the School of Medicine in Trinity College that it is a universal feature of medical care that the mother is accorded priority where necessary treatment may harm the foetus.  He instanced, for example, the use of antibiotics or treatment for acute leukaemia which might have an adverse effect on the foetus.  The risk to the foetus is accepted and treatment is instituted.  Similarly, the Master of the Rotunda Hospital has stated that if doctors had to give equal rights to the mother and infant, caesarean sections to save the <Col N="2030" /> live of mothers suffering from high blood pressure and kidney disease could be fatally delayed.  I find it very difficult to understand how the very serious implications of this form of words &mdash; and I have given only a mere two implications &mdash; can be shrugged off by the supporters of the original wording.  Such indifference to the threat to the life of so many women is totally incompatible with a pro-life stance.  The serious possibility of such an interpretation by the courts cannot be wished away.  Above all other considerations this proposed constitutional amendment affects the future well-being of every woman now of child-bearing age in our Republic and of women yet to be born in our State.  This almost all male and almost all Catholic Dáil seems by majority determined for the most part to impose its moral values and medical criteria on the women of Ireland for decades to come.  Shame on those of us who would do so today.</P>
    <P>Another important area of uncertainty arising from the original form of words is the position of well-established family planning methods.  Of course, this may be an intended result of the amendment in view of the well known hostility of the so called pro-life movement to most forms of contraception.  It is of interest to note that since November 1980, successive Ministers of Health, including Deputy Woods, have signed licences permitting the importation into the Republic of over 59 million condoms.  One must add to this total the many millions imported without licence.  What of the 55,000 women on the pill in this country and the two to three thousand women who use IUDs, the importation of which is illegal?  Is it now proposed as a next step in this ultra moral constitutional crusade to prosecute women who use IUDs?</P>
    <P>We have before us a choice between the Fianna Fail wording and the amendment proposed by the Minister.  The wording of the Fianna Fail amendment was precipitously formulated as is obvious when one looks at the files in my Department.  Those files also show that Deputy Woods did not make an important contribution to the agreed wording, and in view of the lucidity of his contribution <Col N="2031" /> this morning that could be excused.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Health I must choose between these two amendments.  In that context, and only in that context, the Minister's amendment is preferable because one must accept that it is the intention of the majority of this House, much as it is against my wish, that a referendum be held.  I must advise the House, if I have any responsibility as Minister for Health, which alternative is preferable, bad as they both are.  I am opposed in principle to the holding of this referendum because I do not believe, and I have spent many months considering this question, that there is a need for or a capacity of true definition of prohibition of abortion being inserted into our Constitution. As one opposed to abortion, I hold the view that the provisions of the 1861 Act adequately meet our needs relating to abortion.  If I have to choose between the two alternatives now before us, I accept that the Minister's amendment accomplishes only to a degree the objective originally sought by the so-called pro-life campaign and mitigates the uncertainties and the inducement to litigate which are inherent, and disastrous, in the original wording.</P>
    <P>Despite this and despite the evidence that the original wording is extraordinarily defective and dangerous to women, the pro-life movement have rejected it and have shifted their ground to what I call the hysterical accusation that the Oireachtas, the representatives elected by the people, would fly in the face of the wishes of the people they represent by introducing legislation to permit abortion. That is the nub of the argument. That is an insult to the Members of the Dáil and it is a diminishing of the traditions of our democracy that such a suggestion be made.  It is even more reprehensible that some Members of this House should actively seek to propagate that fear.  I deplore the appalling public attacks made by Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan on the Taoiseach.  His gross inference in his RTE interview that the Taoiseach was propagating a policy of abortion, of Herodian slaughter of the <Col N="2032" /> innocents, brings deep shame on Dáil Eireann.</P>
    <P>It is also difficult to avoid the conclusion which can be drawn from Deputy Wood's contribution that the deep feeling of our people on this important issue is being used as a weapon in a party political conflict.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>: Unfortunately, there are Members of this House who are not averse to that kind of cynical posturing. So long as my views and the views of the people are so firmly committed to the right to life of the unborn &mdash; and more particularly of those who are born &mdash; there is no possibility that the Oireachtas would introduce legislation to permit abortion.  If we pass this amendment into our Constitution we will deny our people the opportunity which may exist in decades to come for legislation to improve and clarify the present legislation outlawing abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This House should be as free as possible to frame such legislation in a way that precisely matches the consensus about the circumstances in which medical treatment may have to be given which, as an inevitable consequence as happens at present, may result in the loss of the foetus.  The best defence of the right to life of the unborn, as of all other fundamental human rights, is the strength and vitality of our democratic institutions. What we are doing today is diminishing that strength, vitality and public consensus. Constitutional and legal provisions may not alway be enough.  The evidence of other countries is that public opinion on this issue is very often stronger than the law or the Constitution.  Where public opinion has moved to favour liberalisation of abortion legal sanctions have proved ineffective.  It is of critical importance that while our people maintain their opposition to abortion there is no possibility that this House would contemplate defying the wish of the people and we should retain that right in this House. If a referendum is to be held, regrettably, I would favour the Minister's new wording, but only as the lesser of two evils. <Col N="2033" /> This is the whole purpose of reviewing a Bill on Committee Stage when one must choose between the actual alternatives now before the House.</P>
    <P>I continue to maintain my opposition to the holding of any referendum on this issue.  It has proved to be gravely divisive, particularly as it has provoked conflict between the Catholic Church and other denominations on this fundamental issue.  It is a sad day for the country and for the moral values of our people that we should witness such a grave <i>impasse</i> in Church-State and inter-denominational relations.  Ecumenical progress, so urgently needed on this island, has been seriously damaged by the insistence of a small number of Catholics of extreme views in relation to abortion, contraception, life, and a small group of their supporters within their own hierarchy that their view and theirs alone should prevail over Deputies' in this House and in our Constitution.  All of us in this House must deeply regret this development in Irish politics.</P>
    <P>Though I favour the ministerial amendment &mdash; it is basically an amendment derived from Fine Gael deliberations &mdash; the Labour Party have a free vote on this issue, and I am speaking in that context.  Though I will vote in favour of the ministerial amendment, I will continue on Report and Final Stages, and at the end of the Committee Stage, if we have time to have a vote then, to oppose the holding of a referendum, irrespective of the form of words, because it debases the role of our Constitution as a focus for unity.  To provoke deep division, as this debate has done, and to achieve nothing tangible as a result, is to debase our Constitution. The spirit in which constitutional change should take place was best described by the sponsor of our Constitution, Éamon de Valera, when he addressed this House in 1937.  He said &mdash; in the Official Report, 11 May 1937, column 75:</P>
    <P>We can, I think, if we only had the will to do it, approach this document in the spirit of its preamble &mdash; as it is intended to provide a basis for internal good order, social order, here; that it is intended to secure the dignity and <Col N="2034" /> freedom of the individual and that it is intended, finally, to have peace here, to bring about the unity of our country as a whole, and to have accord with other peoples.</P>
    <P>Primarily, then, the Constitution should be a focus for unity.  Again, Eamon de Valera's approach is persuasive &mdash; column 66:</P>
    <P>My anxiety is that we should agree on this fundamental law to the greatest extent possible.  That is why it has been introduced in the Dáil for full discussion and for full amendment before it is submitted to the people by way of plebiscite.</P>
    <P>On this important issue the level of agreement appropriate to our Constitution has not been achieved, or even been sought in any way relevant to our aspirations for unity on this island.  Furthermore, on a matter of this kind broad agreement may not ever be possible. Because of the differing views held within the community, not least on denominational lines, it is preferable to retain the flexibility to frame legislation which most nearly approximates to the consensus prevailing at any particular time.  Indeed, Eamonn de Valera understood the need for such flexibility.  When introducing discussion on his draft Constitution in this House he said of the fundamental human rights provisions &mdash; column 62:</P>
    <P>You cannot state those things absolutely. All you can do is to give the fundamental principles; to state them clearly and correctly and leave it to the sense of justice and good will of the community, to work in accordance with the spirit of the declarations.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I am in reasonable company in opposing the proposed referendum. My opposition to it is also due to the fact that it will have no effect on the Irish women and girls, more than 80 each week, who travel to Britain for abortions. Theirs is the real problem and the real tragedy.  The majority of them are unmarried and in many cases they are driven to this terrible step by the pressure they experience on becoming pregnant. That pressure comes from their families, <Col N="2035" /> relatives, neighbours and work-mates, and quite a number of men directly involved.  How many of those who advocate an amendment on this issue, on grounds of public morality, would apply the same pressure if a single girl in their own family were to become pregnant?  I fear that that would be an all too common response.</P>
    <P>Just as hypocrisy has driven many Irish girls to the abortion clinics of Britain and elsewhere, I fear that collective hypocrisy is driving us in this House to permit a referendum which will give some the satisfaction of having empty phrases enshrined in our Constitution while thousands continue to travel to Britain and elsewhere for abortions.  The reality of the problem of abortion here is such that I cannot support such empty gestures.  I deprecate this whole campaign which has provoked such division in the community, threatened the proper role of our Constitution and has obscured the real problem of abortion which cannot be tackled by legal formulae.</P>
    <P>From sources available to me I am satisfied that there is a good deal of information within the Republic and in the United Kingdom regarding the women from this country having abortions in the United Kingdom.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Medico-Social Research Board to collate and analyse such information as can be collected or is already available and to report to me on their findings as early as possible.</P>
    <P>I have, indeed, already been in contact with the board on this important matter which is of such vital public interest and I hope that their report will be with me by the autumn.  I would expect that the board's findings will contain important information about the women in question including such matters as geographical and age distributions, occupational, social and marital status, any history of previous abortions and other relevant data.  I submit that the former Minister would have been better engaged in that kind of approach than in trying to expound his philosophy here with such consequent confusion.</P>
    <P>I can assure Dáil Éireann that, as soon <Col N="2036" /> as this vital information becomes available to me, I shall lose no time in informing the House of the findings and of the action I propose to take arising from them.  Meanwhile, it is my intention to allocate from the moneys available in the budget for voluntary social service bodies some resources to enable concerned organisations to provide advice and assistance to women who might otherwise contemplate having abortions.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, I intend to vote in favour of the amendment put forward by the Minister in the context of a free vote within the Labour Party.  I want to commend my colleague in the Labour Party, Deputy Cluskey.  When this matter was first broached to him he was the leader of the Labour Party.  I attended a meeting with the sponsors of this campaign where he showed extraordinary perception, courage and directness and did not fall into the trap which&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>:&mdash;&mdash;leaders of other parties fell into at that time.  For that we must give him credit.  I also give credit to the leader of my party, Deputy Spring, who, despite the pressures of the general election campaign did not succumb to these pressures.  As a Member of this House I value my democratic right as an elected representative of the Irish people.  Nobody, be it a pressure group, be it church, be it party, will influence my conscience on such a grave matter.  Having served in this House since 1969, I am profoundly ashamed of the extent to which Deputies, who privately confess that they are appalled at the implications of the original wording put forward with so little thought by Deputy Woods, and so little analysis by the Government of the day, now succumb to those pressures and create a constitutional impasse. When history comes to be written the files of the Departments will prove my point.  As Minister for Health, I am concerned about the future well-being of the women of Ireland&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>: I am concerned about the well-being of those who will be born in the future.  In conscience I could not recommend the original wording. That wording is regrettable and dangerous. I will vote for the Minister's amendment and, on Report Stage, I will vote against the holding of a referendum.  If a referendum is to be held, as this House seems to be determined, let us at least hold it with the least damage to our country. Let us try to maintain on this island, North and South, between different denominations a sense of national purpose and a sense of respect for one another's views on grave issues such as abortion and moral values.  If I were a member of a Northern Ireland denomination other than the denomination whose members are pushing this through, I would not have anything to do with Dáil Éireann for many a decade to come.  That is another major tragedy.</P>
      <P>In Dáil Éireann we must try to ensure that we do not bend to extreme pressures and extreme views on aspects of medical practice.  I can find no recommendation or support in any Government Department for the form of words suggested by the Fianna Fáil Party.  As a layman I have tried desperately in the past few months to understand the medical issues involved.  I am sickened and appalled and I find it obscene that a wording of this nature should be proposed particularly by people who purport to have available to them experience in gynaecology, in obstetrics and in constitutional law.  As a layman with no qualifications in those fields I implore Deputies not to go ahead with that wording.  I urge those who are determined to ram it through to have second thoughts about it and draw back from putting the future legal interpretation of the right of women and the right of the foetus in danger in a constitutional context.</P>

      <P>: This is a black day for democracy and will be seen as such in 30 or 40 years' time.  I hope, a Cheann Comhairle, that you will not rule me out of order if I touch on things about which I have not had an opportunity to speak <Col N="2038" /> as yet.  I would remind you that I was not allowed to speak on Second Stage because of a guillotine.  Therefore, there are some comments I should like to make all of which will be relevant, I am sure you will agree, to the referdum which it is proposed to hold.</P>
      <P>I want to mention the constant references to pro-life in this debate particularly by Deputy Woods. He referred to the pro-life amendment, pro-life people, and said: &ldquo;We are pro-life&rdquo;.  I want to declare to this House that I am pro-life and I have been pro-life in many campaigns over a long number of years.  I was pro-life in campaigns against the Vietnam War, against other wars, against NATO, against nuclear missiles, against terrorism and against legal executions.</P>
      <P>I wonder what record of pro-life the so-called pro-life people have, the small fanatical group who began what they called the pro-life campaign.  In many cases they are the very people who support legal executions, nuclear weapons, joining NATO, whipping, lashing and hanging.  They are the type of people who have moved into politics in the United States in the past five or six years also. They are known as the fundamentalist groups, the Bible thumping fundamentalists who are pushing the United States to the brink of war almost.  They dominated the election of Ronald Reagan and they succeeded in having some of the most liberal and progressive representatives in America defeated in the last election. They are aiming to defeat others, including Senator Edward Kennedy, in the next Government.  They have become quite a force in American politics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the type of group who have been started here, the type of group who are fundamentally fascist in nature and who are attempting to dominate politics in Ireland as this group have dominated politics in America.  The final outcome of such domination of political life would be theocracy of the type in Iran under the Ayatollah Khomeini.  We can see from what is happining in Iran how pro-life are the religious Government in that country, the daily executions, the cutting off of hands and other dreadful actions in the name of God and religion.  This is what <Col N="2039" /> we would be faced with, the type of fanatical theocracy that will be followed by the small group of people who began this campaign of political blackmail on political parties.  The Roman Catholic hierarchy were not at any time campaigning for such an amendment but they have been forced into the position of having to back this Fianna Fáil wording which came from God knows where.</P>
    <P>I want to nail the pro-life suggestion that those who oppose the amendment are anti-life and that those who support it are pro-life.  The case is almost the reverse.  Many babies who were unborn in 1945 when the atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki are dying today and have been dying for many years.  Therefore, the actions of governments in relation to nuclear weapons and all weapons of war should be as vital a concern to the so-called pro-life people and members on the Fianna Fáil benches who have followed this line. They have attempted to be more religious than the Pope himself, more on the side of the angels than the hierarchy and now sit smugly in this House.  One might call them &ldquo;Charlie's angels&rdquo; but if we think back to a few months ago we might remember them as the angels with dirty faces.  This is the type of smug hyprocrisy which has led to this amendment being put before the House and which is leading the whole process of parliamentary democracy into the sewers.</P>
    <P>It is no great credit on the Taoiseach either who has shown such political ineptness and lack of political integrity.  On his own admission he went into this at the last election knowing it was wrong but for political purposes he went along with it.  He says now he knew at that time he should never have done it but he did it to win an election as though that made it all right.  This is not political integrity or courage of the type needed here. People should stand up and say what they believe in, and on this question it is even more vital that people speak out with courage and guts whatever their political future.  It is important for the unborn and for the future of the country that we have political integrity and that we give some <Col N="2040" /> meaning and credibility to this House.  In 1983 we are supposed to be grown up as a nation.  We are not even grown up as individuals in the carry-on we have had in the past three months.  We are proving we have not advanced very much since 1951.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil brought forward the amendment two days before they left office.  It came from the great republican party.  They used to be the republican party in brackets but they became somewhat brave in recent years and took away the brackets.  Now they are the republican party without any brackets.  What kind of republicanism is it that would bring forward an amendment like this? Would a republican party in the tradition of Wolfe Tone or Davis do that?  Fianna Fáil are supposed to be against sectariansim, for democracy and pluralism, for the type of society Wolfe Tone wanted when he gave such tremendous support to the French Revolution at the end of the 18th century, out of which the seeds of republicanism came to Ireland.</P>
    <P>Republicanism is not just a matter of getting the Brits out.  Surely after all these years Fianna Fáil realise that republicanism must be shown as something more than calling the Taoiseach a blueshirt or some ridiculous slogan like that at election times?  They must realise it must be proved by their actions in endeavouring to unite the people of the country, in endeavouring to developing a society where there is separation of Church and State, the type of society Tone and Davis wanted.  Surely they recognise the fundamental difference between the republicanism of Tone and the Catholic nationalism of Daniel O'Connell who in '98 was actually hunting down the rebels. That type of republicanism is not understood by Fianna Fáil and I should like either Deputy Haughey or Deputy Woods to define for the House what they mean by their republicanism. In bringing forward this amendment to the Constitution, they have abandoned all credibility to their claim to be republican.  They have no understanding of the concept of republicanism.</P>
    <P>We have seen the effect in this House and outside it in the past few months <Col N="2041" /> where confusion and division has been growing.  Just imagine how that will be during the course of the campaign throughout the country at the time of a referendum on this amendment.  We saw the kind of picket outside this House last Tuesday, when busloads of fanatics came with their posters about the slaughter of the innocents, about Herod and Hitler. This is precisly what will happen during the course of a referendum campaign when high emotional feelings will be built up and when there will be divisions even in families.  Meanwhile the world outside just gazes in wonder and laughs at us. They wonder what we are at while the economy is in absolute ruins, when we have the highest unemployment rate in the EEC and growing rapidly, when our finances are in bits and when we are dependent on foreign borrowers.  Here we have an amendment to the Constitution which is totally meaningless, of no benefit to anyone, but a grave danger to many women in the future.</P>
    <P>This is the type of campaign in which people's rights to express their views will be attacked and an endeavour made to suppress them.  I do not blame the Fianna Fáil Party for their smugness.  All they need do is sit back complacently and look on as the Taoiseach's party are torn apart and the Labour Party go in three or four different directions.  They see it as the only possibility of a breakthrough in the electoral scene and will use the electoral and political possibilities of this issue to their utmost to get back into favour on the political scene.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has shown that he is the leader of the people in Government.  He is the person that the people look to for leadership.  He is the person who should have made some decision a few months ago when he saw the situation.  We put down an amendment here months ago to have this matter referred to an all-party committee.  Surely the Taoiseach could have seen the difficulties being caused to the country, to himself, to his own party and the other Members and at that time could have referred it to an all-party committe where there could have been discussions and, perhaps, all-party agreement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2042" /> So far, in this debate all the speakers in favour of the amendment have confined themselves to condemnation of abortion.  They have done so day after day, week after week.  If a motion were before this House that it condemns abortion, there would be no problem and the motion would be passed.  However, that is not the issue.  The issue is a constitutional amendment which is before the House.  Surely we should be grown up enough to discuss this in a rational way; how it is going to affect us now and in the future; what the legal, medical and social implications will be.  Let us get information, statistics and so on and examine this question.  We have come in here with no background information, just hearing people shouting at us as we come in and we adopt these positions.</P>
    <P>Our party put down a number of amendments and, true to say, we thought long as to whether we should do so, or just leave the matter as it was.  The Workers' Party are totally opposed to any amendment being made to the Constitution on this issue, totally opposed to the Fianna Fáil amendment and also to the Fine Gael amendment.  Then why put down amendments ourselves?  We put them down as a fall-back &mdash; presumably, that is what the Taoiseach did also &mdash; to try to avoid the worst elements of the Fianna Fáil amendment and to have a discussion on these so that, at least, the House would be aware of what precisely we are talking about in the Fianna Fáil wording.  As a result of the collapse of the Taoiseach's authority in his party, which should result in his resignation, we are coming before this House knowing that the Fianna Fáil amendment will be passed.</P>
    <P>We put down these amendment for the purpose of discussing the issues.  The first was on the question of the life of the unborn.  We put down an amendment referring to the unborn human being, to substitute the concept of a human being for that of anything that is living and to allow account to be taken of developing what constitutes a human being, and not to restrict the courts, in construing the text, to a mere concept of life which, in fact, if one considers the wording, could <Col N="2043" /> include animals, or other sub- or prehuman life.  There is no definition whatsoever. Unborn what?  In the two months in which we heard speaker after speaker on the Fianna Fáil benches, they never told us this.  What unborn is it and what affects it?</P>
    <P>What is perhaps the most serious concern of any responsible elected representative here is the enormity of what this amendment proposes to do.  Here, in Ireland, in 1983, in Dáil Éireann, we are proposing to define what no other country at no other time in history had the temerity or audacity to do &mdash; we are proposing to define precisely when human life begins and what, in essence, is a human being.  If this amendment is passed it will have to be interpreted and that interpretation will mean such a definition.  We are proposing to do what medical science, the philosophers and even the theologians have been unable to do.  The theologians are finding it as difficult as in the days when they were trying to count the number of angels that would fit on the head of a pin.  We are making the decision here.  Fair dues to us.  We are away ahead of the world at least in one thing.  Throughout history, according to what medicine and science have been able to tell us, there have been varying definitions taken as the starting point of life.  For instance, at one stage the time of quickening, which was in about the sixteenth week of pregnancy, was the view put forward.  At one time some theologians held that the moment when life in the womb became truly human differed between male and female &mdash; it took longer for the female to become human than for the male.  There is, in fact, no consensus among scientists or theological experts as to when human life begins. Although dogmatic stands have been taken on a definition of human life and taken by the Fianna Fáil benches here as the moment of fertilisation, in practice the more common reference point is taken as the point of implantation in the uterus.</P>
    <P>In so far as society wishes to express its opposition to abortion in general in an expression of the value of human life, it <Col N="2044" /> is a positive aspiration and certainly one with which no socialist would quarrel. But in so far as this country&mdash;specifically this small body of politicians &mdash; decides to impose on society a precise definition of the moment of humanity, then we are making ourselves preposterous.  There is a view put forward by the advocates of this amendment that human beings exist from the moment of conception.  Many people are undoubtedly sincere in this view and have every right to hold it.  But there are many other views which are equally unproveable, equally possible, equally valid, that human life begins when the fertilised ovum is implanted in the womb, that human life begins when the brain begins to function many weeks later, or that a human life can be said to exist only from the point of viability. Scientific research may well yield new information which will and must change our views in the future.  Meanwhile we are to be burdened with an amendment which will have to be tested in court.  The definition passed in court will be ours to live with, whatever the consequences or whatever may be the changes in medical science or anything else.</P>
    <P>The irony of this amendment is that it might very well affect adversely the very people who want children, who are prepared to go to great lengths to have their own children.  Those infertile couples who seek the most modern medical treatment to help them conceive and bear children may well be victims.  The word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is defined as life from the moment of fertilisation and this could affect the possibility of their having children in the future.</P>
    <P>The other amendment which we put down was to discuss the issue of the equal right of the mother with the right of the unborn foetus.  When the wording of the amendment was first announced many people were reassured that what was being said was after all an expression of the sentiments of the majority of the Irish people, an acknowledgment that we do, on the whole, regard abortion as abhorrent and feel that the child in the womb is a human and entitled to the same rights as other humans.  Moreover, the fact that <Col N="2045" /> the amendment referred specifically to the mother's right to life as equal was seen in the beginning as particularly reassuring because we are not very far removed from the days when the moral dictate was that in the case of a conflict at childbirth between the mother's and the child's life, then the child was to be saved.  Many a pregnant woman, and many a man watching his wife in labour was haunted by the fear that this impersonal dictate would be carried out without reference to either of the parents' wishes, as was so often the case.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that while most Irish people are opposed to abortion they also feel very strongly that the life in the womb, in all justice, cannot possibly have a stronger claim on life than the woman concerned, a woman, who, in very many cases, is responsible for the care of other children.  Thus this phrase &ldquo;with due regard to the equal right to the life of the mother&rdquo; was seen in the beginning as an acknowledgment of the woman's claim on her own life, an enshrinement in some way of what we all truly believe.  However, this is not the case.  A close scrutiny of the phrase itself and the context in which it is set shows that it means practically nothing in real human terms.  In fact it may be interpreted in such a way as seriously to jeopardise present medical practice.  For instance, the right to life, as defined in the Constitution, is quite distinct from that concept of health which is implied in the Constitution as &ldquo;bodily integrity&rdquo;.  This distinction is important for, in terms of the proposed amendment, it seems to mean that the mother's life only, as opposed to her death, shall have equal status with the life of the foetus; it does not mean her life of any particular standard of health or well-being. In other words, the risk to the mother &mdash; it seems from this amendment &mdash; would literally have to be death for her to have any possible constitutional right to interfere with the survival of the foetus.</P>
    <P>As we know, conflicts of this kind, thankfully, are much rarer today than they were once but there are still today diseases affecting women which require forms of treatment in which such conflict <Col N="2046" /> could arise.  The most important of these is cancer, frequently treated with radiation or other drugs designed to kill malignant cells.  Obviously they may cause damage to other living cells, particularly those of the foetus.  One of the major causes of cancer deaths among women is cancer of the uterus.  In one out of four cases this cancer affects the body of the uterus.  Hormone treatment of this type of cancer is usually followed by surgery. In this country now the surgical removal of the womb of a woman with cancer is tolerated even when the woman is pregnant on the grounds that the aim of the surgery is to remove the cancerous organ and not to terminate the pregnancy.  This was stated specifically by Deputy O'Hanlon when he spoke on Second Stage at column 465, volume 340, of the Official Report, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Medical ethics are based on the natural law with regard to the equal rights of mother and infant.  A doctor would never have to say: &ldquo;I will save one life and I will let the other go&rdquo;.  The type of cases which have been mentioned by those who are opposed to the amendment are very rare, for example, where a woman has cancer of the womb.  Cancer of the womb in a pregnant woman is a very rare condition.</P>
    <P>He said that about five times.</P>
    <P>Where it does occur, if it is necessary for the womb to be removed, it will be removed.  If the woman needs radiotherapy, she will have radiotherapy. The fact that there is a pregnancy in the womb does not mean there is an abortion, because there is no intent on the part of the doctor to merely kill the child in the womb.  The doctor's intent is to remove the cancerous womb.  The same can be said about ectopic pregnancy, a pregnancy outside the womb.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon is there repeating a myth which has been propagated for months that termination of pregnancy in the case of cancer of the womb, or in the case of ectopic pregnancy, is not abortion, in other words that you can have termination of pregnancy which is not abortion.  That is a nice type of concept <Col N="2047" /> to relieve the conscience.  But when it comes down to legal practice as against medical practice, one is in an entirely different field.  The point Deputy O'Hanlon is missing is that it is grand now, there is nothing in the Constitution, nothing in the law, to prevent us from having this ethical, medical practice. Therefore, we can save the life of the mother because we can say to ourselves that it is not really abortion.  But if that is put into the Constitution, once it is put into the Constitution, it is taken out of the hands of the medical profession and placed in the hands of the legal profession.</P>
    <P>It is going to be a lovely day for the legal profession when they get their hands on that.  Will they decide on ethical practice, on moral values?  Are they even going to make the decisions on the basis of justice?  No, they are going to make their decisions on the basis of law.  They will make their decisions on the basis of definition &mdash; abortion is abortion, termination of a pregnancy is abortion, regardless of the circumstances.  Therefore, the law will decide what the medical profession may do and that is precisely what will be the difficulty facing Irish mothers and fathers if this amendment is passed.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in the treatment of cancer aim to avoid surgery.  Medical scientists believe that within a few years we may have a situation in which a woman could be treated effectively by way of drugs and radiation for cancer of the uterus and still retain her womb.  In other words, she could have children afterwards.  Obviously, if a woman is pregnant at the time the cancer is diagnosed, the problem presents itself: if the womb can be saved by drugs or radiation the decision is whether to abort the unborn and to give to the woman the opportunity of having children in the future.  Would that also be a termination of pregnancy that would not be abortion or would it directly be abortion?  I am merely mentioning these matters to draw attention to the issues that were not raised when this amendment was put forward glibly, when it was hoped to make abortion the issue and thereby avoid the <Col N="2048" /> issue of the economy.  In order to avoid abortion being the issue in the November election, the only reason put forward by Fine Gael for the amendment was that they were walked into it.  The question of the protection of mothers or of the protection of future children has not been considered.  The situation facing Irish women and their doctors in the event of this amendment being passed may well be the old fashioned surgery that is acceptable, although it involves termination of pregnancy, but with the same risks to the mother and to the unborn.</P>
    <P>Ectopic pregnancies now represent one in 150 of all pregnancies.  Yesterday we were told in answer to a parliamentary question that in 1982 there were 500 ectopic pregnancies.  There are complicated moral and legal questions to be asked.  At present the treatment of ectopic pregnancies, that is pregnancies occurring within the fallopian tubes, in Irish hospitals is by way of surgical removal of the entire tube.  Again, the operation is justified on the grounds that the intention is to provide medical treatment for the damaged organ of the woman with the termination of pregnancy being a secondary effect.  Nevertheless it is termination of pregnancy.  A new procedure under development would involve sucking out the misplaced embryo, leaving the fallopian tube intact and leaving the woman with the possibility of conceiving again.  However, the interpretation of &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; as life existing from the moment of fertilisation might mean that Irish women would be denied the benefits of this improvement in medical science and would be denied the opportunity of ever again conceiving.</P>
    <P>In terms of the rights of women it would appear that this amendment would mean that only in extreme and rare cases in which a woman's death was a certainty due to her pregnancy, could she present a case for having that pregnancy terminated, not in medicine but in law.  Even in that rare instance her rights would be only equal with those of the unborn.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from a statement from Archbiship Ryan and which was circulated on Sunday last.  The quotation <Col N="2049" /> from the publication, <i>The Archbiship Speaks</i>, is as follows:</P>
    <P>In the context of the current debate in Ireland, yet another criticism has to be looked at.  It is the suggestion that the Catholic Church is so concerned with the life of the unborn child that the life of the mother somehow becomes secondary.</P>
    <P>This is a calumny, sometimes supported by medical testimony of very doubtful accuracy.  It is the clear teaching of the Catholic Church that every human being, born or unborn, has exactly the same right to its God-given life.  If a situation should arise which threatens the lives both of a mother and her unborn child, it is the obligation of the doctor and of everyone else involved to do everything which medical science makes possible to save both lives.</P>
    <P>There can never be a question of &ldquo;sacrificing&rdquo; any one life for another.</P>
    <P>Is that not an impossible situation for a doctor?  This amendment puts the whole matter into the hands of lawyers.  In all other cases in which the mother's quality of life or standard of health or risk to life are concerned, it may well be that the right to existence of the tiny embryo would be superior.  Is this a just and right principle to enshrine in our Constitution now and for all time regardless of, and even heedless of, medical developments?</P>
    <P>We have put down an amendment to substitute the words &ldquo;subject to&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;equal to&rdquo; in the Fianna Fáil amendment. This change would give added protection to mothers, a protection to which they are entitled.  The rights of mothers have not been considered by the framers of this constitutional amendment.  Little thought has been given to its effects, first, on the political life of the country, the divisiveness which it will create and, secondly, on medical practice if the amendment is passed.  Let not Fianna Fáil be too smug about this because they might get some dirt on their faces.  People are not such fools as to walk into this type of thing with their eyes shut and just blindly follow Charlie.  They may get quite a suprise because people are gradually <Col N="2050" /> realising that this is not a vote on abortion and that this is a political issue which is being foisted on them.  They are getting more and more confused and coming to the conclusion that it would be far better if this issue was never raised at all, far better for the unborn as well as for the born.</P>
    <P>After the referendum there may be some surprises when the result is announced.  If the referendum is passed the issue then moves into the social field and some of the difficulties in that field were raised by the Minister for Health. It is significant that the Minister for Health said on two or three occasions in the House &mdash; it certainly has never been denied &mdash; that all the officials in the Department of Health, from the top to the bottom, see the grave difficulties of the amendment and are totally opposed to the Fianna Fail wording because of the problems it will cause.</P>

I am anxious to make the point that insufficient thought information or study of the implications for the social and political life and medical practice has been given.  I hope that during the afternoon some wider issues are discussed by the supporters of the amendment rather than listening to them coming up with the old hat pro-life material which is simply saying that we are all against abortion.  That is true, but it is not the issue.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have been a long time in public life and I have never entered a discussion with less enthusiasm or a feeling of greater sadness than I do on this occasion.  I believe that what the House is engaged in today, and what would appear to be the inevitable outcome of today's proceedings, will drag Irish society back decades, not because of any great clamour by the Irish people but because of what I can only describe as a combination of political opportunism and moral cowardice on behalf of the majority of politicians in the House.  I honestly believe that they will regret this and that Irish society will pay dearly for those motivations that led them to give in to political and moral blackmail by a relatively small number of people.  As the Minister for Health said this morning, I met the people who describe themselves as pro-life.  I met them on behalf of the Labour Party when I was leader of that party.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Health who was then Whip of the Labour Party.  That was when they first started this campaign.  The fact that they called themselves &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; was an indication to me of the way the campaign was going to develop, because the deliberate implication in that title was that those who were against them were against life, were anti-life.  The name they gave themselves was the start of their political moral blackmail which has been so successful but for which we will all pay dearly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike some Members I have never purported to be a religious person.  Some Members have made their political careers out of being professional Catholics, <Col N="2052" /> But I have religious beliefs, and very strong beliefs, with regard to abortion for a number of reasons.  I am against abortion. I believe there is sanctity in human life, that it derives from God and that God alone has the right to take it wilfully. That is a basic belief I have always held and still hold.  However, we are not talking about abortion or whether we will or will not legalise it.  We are talking about a different issue.  I will oppose any amendment being enshrined in the Constitution. I am opposed to it in principle and everything that has happened since it was first mooted has confirmed my belief in the wisdom of the decision I made at the outset: that I would not give tham an undertaking, that I would not be subject to or allow the Labour Party which I was leading to be subject to that kind of blackmail.</P>
    <P>I recognise, and I did then, that a lot of people are just political band waggoning on this issue.  Can any person say on an issue such as this, which has caused many difficulties of conscience to some Members that every Fianna Fáil Deputy believes in this approach?  Members of that party have not been allowed to exercise their conscience and one can only conclude that from that side of the House purely political advantage has taken precedence over everything else on an issue such as this.  As far as this side of the House is concerned, a number of Members have shown the moral cowardice that has brought us to this point, and we will all regret that.  When I met the pro-life people I told them that I have always been pro-life and that the Labour Party were opposed to abortion.  I asked those people one or two questions.  I said to them: &ldquo;You are talking about pro-life, the sanctity of life and I would like to know if you would be in favour, for instance, of a prohibition on capital punishment being enshrined in the Constitution&rdquo;. No, they were not.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: On the contrary, the Taoiseach is not in a position to say that I know anything to be false.  I do not know anything to be false.  I am entitled to ask the Taoiseach a specific question. If he gives an answer to that question I will accept it.  I resent his attributing falsehoods to me.  I am simply endeavouring to find out from the Taoiseach the truth of this matter.  It is widely alleged that this document, a copy of which I have to hand, the advice of the Attorney General on this issue, was given to people involved in the anti-amendment campaign either by the Taoiseach or by someone acting on his behalf.  It is a perfectly valid, legitimate question.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: The reason I answered as I did was that this question was raised yesterday by the Deputy and I said then that the allegation was false.  For him to raise it again implies that he did not accept my denial and it was to that fact that I was referring.  I note that he now <Col N="2054" /> accepts my denial, the second time it has been made, and I feel he should have accepted it the first time.</P>

      <P>: Accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Health and for Social Welfare, I met a delegation from the Alliance Party on 11 April.  We discussed the current situation in Northern Ireland, the New Ireland Forum and other matters of common interest.  The talks were constructive and took place in a cordial atmosphere.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: The meetings will take <Col N="2055" /> place at regular intervals.  That has not been defined but the words are used in the context of the absence of contact over quite a period of time between the Alliance Party and successive Governments. We had one meeting with them when we were last in Government.  With regard to other parties our position is that we are ready, happy and anxious to meet other parties which are democratic, which exclude violence and have members elected to the Assembly in Northern Ireland.  We very much regret the fact that we have not had the opportunity for regular meetings.  There have, of course, been informal contacts with such parties during periods when our parties have been in Government.  I had frequent meetings with members of the Unionist Party during my period as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I hope such informal meetings can continue.  Meetings of this kind between the Government and the Alliance Party can at least be maintained and this is intended.  I have to add that it has been the practice of all Governments to have regular meetings with the SDLP. That has continued at all times with all Governments and will, of course, continue in the future.</P>

      <P>: The Taoiseach has touched on a question I intended to ask. It might appear from the fairly solid arrangements he has made with the Alliance Party that the same situation might not exist in regard to the SDLP but I take it that the same procedure, namely, regular meetings at stated intervals with himself and a number of members of the Government, will obtain in the case of the SDLP and any other democratic party or group in the North of Ireland who seek it.</P>

      <P>: The improvement of television reception is primarily a matter for RTE but they accept that, due to local topography, Carlingford does not receive adequate reception from the existing transmitters.  RTE intend to proceed this year with the provision of a transposer at Greenore to improve reception in Carlingford. Frequencies which will be used as the transposer requires will be coordinated internationally.  This is in hand and it is expected that the frequencies will be available for use very shortly. Provision of the transposer station will then proceed.  RTE have no immediate plans to improve reception in the Omeath area.  There are a number of relatively small areas where reception of RTE television is less than satisfactory because of geographical and topographical features. RTE are proceeding to improve coverage in these areas as quickly as resources allow but they cannot say at <Col N="2063" /> present when they might be able to effect an improvement in the Omeath area.</P>

      <P>: The printed paper rate is applied to greeting cards with not more than five written words posted in an open envelope and the anomaly arises from the fact that charges for foreign and internal printed papers are structured differently.

For all items above 20 grams the internal rates are much the lower of the two.</P>

Specific plans for the house have not been formulated, but it will probably be adapted for use as office accommodation.</P>

      <P>: Is the Minister aware of the architectural importance of this building, which dates from the eighteenth century and is the sole Huguenot building in this city?  If he is so aware, would he not think that the bricking up of the building without any architectural supervision was in itself an act of vandalism which was absolutely unnecessary to secure the building?  Does he not feel that his Department are already guilty of negligence in this regard in that some irreplaceable fittings in this building, including an irreplaceable staircase, were removed from the building by thieves&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I understand that already a great deal of office accommodation is available to his Department for which his Department have no current use.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Before Question Time I was describing the interview I had at the start of this campaign with a delegation of people who call themselves pro-life.  I explained to the House that, having told them the Labour Party were very definitely pro-life, I asked them if they would consider a constitutional change on the matter of capital punishment. They showed a distinct lack of enthusiasm for that change in the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I then mentioned the question of the large number of women and girls who leave this country in order to secure abortions. I agreed with them that this was a very tragic situation.  I queried whether any change, such as the one they were seeking to make in the Constitution, would have any effect whatsoever on the number of women and girls leaving the country seeking abortions.  I asked them if they would consider campaigning for some changes in social attitudes and other matters such as comprehensive family planning provisions and proper sex education properly supervised in our schools.  I did not suggest for one moment that this would eliminate the number of women and girls seeking abortions but that, in my opinion, it would have a significant impact on those numbers.  They <Col N="2151" /> showed no enthusiasm for that approach either.</P>
    <P>They were single-minded.  They wanted one thing, a constitutional amendment in relation to abortion.  I told them &mdash; and I am extremely glad and proud that I told them &mdash; I was not prepared to give that kind of commitment on behalf of the Labour Party.  It would have been very good if other politicians had taken the same attitude.  I greatly fear the consequences on Irish society of what seems to be inevitable &mdash; the decision this House will take today.  It will take us back to the thirties and forties. We have seen some very disedifying stuff in the course of this campaign.  Unfortunately in my opinion we have just seen the trailer.</P>
    <P>I have two reasons for opposing any amendment to the Constitution along these lines.  The first is one of principle. It is wrong.  It is sectarian in its approach and, more important, it is seen by members of the minority churches as sectarian. It has put a considerable strain on the relationship between church and State.  That may be no harm in some cases, but of very significant harm is the fact that it has put back the relationship between the churches for a considerable time.  We have not seen the end of that process either.</P>
    <P>We have had differences of opinion between the medical profession with some for and some against, and with this opinion and that opinion, and the same in the legal profession.  As one eminent Irishman said, in some cases it has turned members of the same family against one another.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I can appreciate the frantic attempts to stop me from saying some of the things I have been saying about the Deputy's party, but that will not deter me.  I was talking about the number of amendments before the House.  This morning Deputy Mac Giolla spoke about the position of the Labour Party with regard to the amendments and I was trying to clarify that for the Deputy.  I can appreciate the difficulty for any Deputy in this House, but more particularly for people outside the House, who are confused on this issue and the stance taken by parties and individual Deputies.  I am extremely confused by the attitude of The Workers' Party on this matter.  I thought Deputy Mac Giolla made a very good speech this morning in relation to the confusion that would exist with regard to the law as it now operates under the 1861 <Col N="2155" /> Act if any of these amendments are enshrined in the Constitution.  I thought he made an extremely good case, but he kept saying he was totally opposed to any amendment to the Constitution.  However, although that party are opposed in principle they have submitted amendments, and I find that a little confusing. I find it smacking a little of political opportunism which, regrettably, has been the main feature of this whole sad and sorry affair.  It is regrettable that Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa at the last moment, out of an apparent sense of panic, have tried to grab some of that action.  When this whole matter is viewed in retrospect in a calmer light I do not think there will be any glory, benefit or credit in that approach.</P>
      <P>I have spoken to many people, particularly young people, with regard to this matter.  I accept that there is a considerable amount of confusion, but where there is a knowledge of what is going on, where young people have been able to tease out the implications of what is going on, the vast majority have seen the campaign for what it is and have rejected it.</P>
      <P>I said I had two reasons for opposing an amendment to the Constitution.  First, I oppose it in principle because I think it is sectarian and divisive and will do incredible damage to Irish society.  Secondly, no matter which amendment ends up enshrined in the Constitution, it will have one of two effects.  Either it will increase the risk to the expectant mother or it will increase the risk to the unborn child.  As it stands the law is adequate and the proof of that is that literally thousands of women who are resident citizens of this country go elsewhere to seek abortions. They do that because the present law is so effective that abortions cannot be obtained here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most regrettable features of this whole affair is the attitude we adopt on other major social issues, such as the two I mentioned to the so-called pro-life group which might have an effect on the number of girls or women who find themselves having to seek abortions.  People talk with contempt of these women and <Col N="2156" /> girls who seek abortions.  I wonder if they ever look at it from another point of view, of sometimes very young and inexperienced girls who find themselves in this situation in a society like ours which unfortunately is once again proving itself to be so unChristian in its attitude, approach and understanding.  Do they ever get a mental picture of a poor unfortunate woman finding herself in such circumstances, filled with fear of her fellow Christians and their attitude?  I am totally opposed to abortion but, at the same time, if we are so quick to condemn it is a great pity we are not a little quicker to help and understand.</P>
    <P>In this House there are rules that must be obeyed and some restraint has to be exercised by virtue of the rules of the House and the Chair's guidance over the affairs of the House.  We have received some indication of how this debate will develop.  Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan has insulted a leading churchman, Dean Griffin, a man whom I have known for years and who is a truly concerned Christian gentleman.  We have had that happening inside the House and can we imagine, for one moment, what will be said at the after-Mass meetings and at the hustings? What way will this campaign develop once this thing is passed tonight, which apparently it will be, and what damage will it do to Irish society?</P>

      <P>: The Deputy has had his head down so much during this whole debate that I am not surprised that he might have thought he discovered something. He might discover a lot more before this thing is finished.</P>
      <P>That is what I fear about this.  The argument has been put &mdash; and there is a justification for it &mdash; that The Workers' Party have put in amendments as a fall-back decision.  Another speaker described it as the lesser of two evils.  I have only one attitude towards something which I recognise as evil &mdash; I oppose it.  I want to make this clear.  I am not speculating, I know there are Members of this House who have genuine conscientious objections, who have genuinely sat up at night and worried themselves sick trying to arrive at the proper judgment according to their consciences on this issue.  I might not agree with the conclusions they reach, but I respect them for them.  I am not speaking about people who have tried to make a professional career out of it, but genuine people, not necessarily in agreement with me.</P>
      <P>I find it extremely difficult to accept the attitude of Fianna Fáil on this issue. Even at this late stage I appeal to Members on all sides not to let any amendment on this issue go through this House, not to create a situation &mdash; which I believe to be inevitable &mdash; in which this campaign, if any amendment is passed, pulls out into the streets and into every parish, village, town and city.  It will be the most divisive thing that we have seen in this country since the thirties.  This House is not at the people's demand or insistence, except for a small fanatical group, to inflict this amendment on Irish society.  I appeal to Deputies on all sides not to do that.  We will all regret it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have listened at length to Deputy Cluskey who talked about moral cowardice and about how Irish society is going to pay for this amendment. He did not explain in any way how society is going to pay for it.  He stated that this amendment is not about abortion, <Col N="2158" /> that it is a political issue.  This amendment is about abortion, that is the reality of it.  It is about the politics of how abortion, if it is ever to be introduced here, will be introduced.</P>
      <P>Like many other speakers I am disappointed at the political nature of the debate over the last few months.  It has been an extraordinary debate.  However, it is only right that the blame should be laid where it belongs, and that is on the shoulders of the Taoiseach.  Last November the Taoiseach was absolutely clear where he stood on the issue in numerous pronouncements, one of which was, in referring to the original wording of the Bill circulated: &ldquo;I think it is the best Amendment we can get and it seems sensible to say so in these circumstances.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>He also stated:</P>
      <P>What we had proposed and I pressed this very strongly in my Ard-Fheis speech, was that it should be literally a pro-life amendment which would strengthen the protection of life, the life of the unborn, and I was very relieved the amendment took that form.  I feared it might take the other form and when we examined it carefully and saw the wording of it and took advice on it, it seemed to us that it was about as good a formula as you could get.  I have to admit that in the Government's favour.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said that last November. The reason for the debate developing so unsatisfactorily is that he did a U-turn on his thinking on this issue.  The Bill which was circulated in November was circulated again to this House by the present Government as their Bill in the last days of January of this year.  Why was the Bill circulated then when there were these doubts about it?  The Government had then been in power for six weeks and if they began to have doubts about the wording in this Bill I cannot understand why they circulated it to this House in January as their Bill.  That is where the blame lies for the nature of the debate which is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 16 February, selective passages from advice given by the Attorney General <Col N="2159" /> to the Government were published in <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Why was not all the text given to <i>The Irish Times</i> for publication? That would have been a valuable contribution to this debate.</P>
    <P>I listened this morning to the Minister for Health.  In all honesty, I was appalled at what I believe is an abuse of his ministerial position in some of the comments which he made and, indeed, in some comments which he is reported to have made about the risk to women's lives if this amendment goes through.  One would particularly expect the Minister for Health to be conscious of the damage which he can do to Irish women of the child-bearing age by making comments, which are totally without foundation and for which there is absolutely no basis, that if this amendment goes through, women will be condemned to death.  The Taoiseach made similar comments and I will come to them later.</P>
    <P>This morning, the Minister for Health stated very seriously that legal interpretation of this form of wording would resolve the conflict of rights in such a way as to prohibit medical treatment which is currently available for life-threatening conditions.  That is totally false.  If our wording is written into the Constitution by way of an amendment, it will have absolutely no effect on the law as it stands at present.  The 1861 Act will still be the law.  He stated that every year between 300 and 500 ectopic pregnancies occur in Ireland.  I consider those figures too high, based on the information available, but the number is not important.  What is important is to give the impression to anybody that if there is an ectopic pregnancy present, in other words, if there is a pregnancy in the fallopian tubes, because of this amendment, or because of a change in the Constitution, a woman's life would be put at risk.  The treatment for an ectopic pregnancy is to remove the tube containing the pregnancy. Some of my very eminent obstetrical colleagues inform me that at operation they have never seen a live foetus in the tube when they removed it.  I cannot understand how the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health or anybody else who talks <Col N="2160" /> about it would expect that somebody might go to the court, to the High Court or Supreme Court to ask that a woman be allowed to continue her pregnancy, if there was a pregnancy in the fallopian tube, because it is not compatible with life.  No court would give a decision that would kill the mother, first of all, also knowing the fact that the pregnancy in the tube was not compatible with life.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health this morning quoted the Dean of the School of Medicine in Trinity College about medical care for the mother, that is, that it is a universal feature of medical care that the mother is accorded priority where necessary treatment may harm the foetus. The Minister continued to say:</P>
    <P>He instanced the use of antibiotics or treatment for acute leukaemia which might have an adverse effect on the foetus.</P>
    <P>No court, no doctor will decide that he will not treat pneumonia or leukaemia. The standards of medical treatment are laid down very clearly.  It is no harm to point out that medical ethics and treatment are regulated by the Medical Registration Council which was set up by an Act of this Oireachtas, the Medical Act. The treatment is straightforward, treatment for these conditions that has been continuing for the last 120 years since the 1861 Act.</P>
    <P>What was interesting this morning was that the Minister for Health did not quote from the professors who commented on the Taoiseach's wild remarks &mdash; I suppose that is the right way to describe them &mdash; that the original wording of the amendment would probably condemn to death women whose lives are now saved by operations which have been performed within the law for more than a century here and in the United Kingdom. The professors stated and I quote:</P>
    <P>Dr. Fitzgerald has also cast doubt on the legality of existing, well-established medical practice.  This cannot go unchallenged.  Doctors do not act on crude assumptions about the legality of their actions.  Dr. FitzGerald's assertions <Col N="2161" /> will be a source of much unnecessary alarm.  We have found the original wording proposed for the amendment to be entirely satisfactory. We believe that this wording would present us with no difficulty in the proper discharge of our professional responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that that statement was not included in the Minister's remarks here this morning.  That statement was signed by Professor John Bonnar, Professor Eamon De Valera, Professor David Jenkins, Professor Kieran O'Driscoll and Professor Eamon O'Dwyer, all eminent men in the field of obstetrics.</P>
    <P>Neither the Minister for Health this morning nor the Attorney General on radio on Sunday mentioned what I believe is a very important part of the wording of the original amendment, that is the qualifying phrases: &ldquo;with due regard to&rdquo; and &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;. That is very important.  When they say that a court will decide in law on the basis of the wording before it that both lives are equal and that because of that wording &mdash; leaving out the two phrases I have mentioned &mdash; the court will decide that the mother's life cannot be saved.  Having regard to those two phrases it is obvious that even if a case were to be brought before the courts the courts would not interpret the Constitution to say that the woman's life must be put at risk in order to save the child.</P>
    <P>Again to quote the Minister for Health this morning:</P>
    <P>Above all other considerations this proposed Constitutional amendment affects the future wellbeing of every woman now of child-bearing age in our Republic and of women yet to be born in our State.</P>
    <P>Then he continued with an extraordinary piece as follows:</P>
    <P>This almost all male and almost all Catholic Dáil seems by majority determined for the most part to impose its moral values and medical criteria on the women of Ireland for decades to <Col N="2162" /> come.  Shame on those of us who would do so today.</P>
    <P>In my view that is very intemperate language. Indeed if one continues to read the Minister's remarks this morning he makes the point himself when he said:</P>
    <P>It is also difficult to avoid the conclusion that the deep feeling of our people on this important issue is being used as a weapon in a party political conflict.</P>
    <P>I believe that describes exactly the quotation I have read about an almost all male and almost all Catholic Dáil.  As far as I am concerned, this has nothing whatever to do with sectarianism, has nothing to do with the Catholic Church, Protestant Church.  It should be the same law for the atheist, the Jew, anybody, because if one goes back &mdash; and there is medical input into this &mdash; to the Hippocratic Oath which was 4,400 years before Christanity, before Christ himself, there it is mentioned that abortion should not be procured on a woman.  That is the basis of my thinking on the subject.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health spoke this morning about the 55,000 women on the pill here and the 2,000 to 3,000 women who use intra-uterine devices, the importation of which is illegal.  This has nothing to do with this amendment.  If written into the Constitution this amendment will in no way change the existing law and has nothing to do with what is being used as a contraceptive device.  Even if one were to accept that the intra-uterine device was an abortifacient it would be impossible to bring a court case and to prove it because the first thing one would have to do would be to prove that the woman was pregnant in the first place.</P>

      <P>: I agree with the Minister that we should address ourselves to the Committee Stage.  I have before me a copy of the statement made by the Minister for Health this morning and I consider that I am entitled to reply to that Minister's comments.  He said that the provisions of the 1861 Act are adequate to meet our needs in relation to abortion.  I would not agree.  The 1861 Act is still on the Statute Book in the UK but there is also there the 1967 Act which exempts doctors from culpability within the terms of the former Act if two doctors believe that a woman should have an abortion.  As a result of the 1967 Act there have been more than 2 million abortions in Britain.  Consequently, I do not consider the 1861 Act to be sufficient for us either.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: At intervals of about six months an effort is made in the UK to bring in legislation to curtail the 1967 Act, to revert to what was intended originally by the proposers of that Act.  The last such occasion was in December in the House of Lords.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Health tells us that it is an insult to the Members of this House and to the traditions of democracy in Ireland that the suggestion be made that <Col N="2166" /> we should have a referendum of this kind. I do not understand that.  Surely on such a fundamental issue we should go to the people for a decision.  We must face the fact that abortion is a divisive issue, that there are people who are opposed to abortion and that there are people who favour abortion.  The only fair way of ensuring that the right decision is arrived at is to let the people have their say and to give them the opportunity, if they so wish, of having the amendment incorporated in the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The question of sectarianism has been raised in relation to this issue.  The Minister for Health said that if he were a member of the Northern Ireland community he would take a very poor view of what was going on down here.  It is no harm to remind the Minister that two leading politicians on the Protestant side in the North, Mr. Paisley and Mr. Molyneaux, opposed vehemently an extension of the 1967 Act to Northern Ireland. Regardless of what view anyone may have in relation to abortion, there will be respect for a society who are prepared to stand for the right to life of the unborn.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred at length to the number of girls going to the UK to have abortions.  I commend him for bringing up the matter with the Medical Research Council with a view to having the situation studied further.  I should hope that as a result of this debate here, the conscience of each of us would be stimulated into thinking of what we might do to ensure that it will not be necessary for any girl to seek an abortion.</P>
    <P>The difference I see in the original wording as circulated in the Bill and the wording proposed now is while there has been a lot of legal conflict about the existing wording, the new wording would mean that abortion could be introduced here at some stage without the question being put to the people by way of referendum. We must refer to the Constitution on such issues as land ownership and divorce.  Is it not only right that the Constitution should also include the issue of abortion so that it would have to be referred to in the event of there ever being a question of the introduction of abortion?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2167" /> The Pro-Life Amendment Campaign group consist of eminent legal and medical people and they are satisfied that the original wording proposed would not in any way cause problems for the medical profession.  In a statement which they issued yesterday they had this to say:</P>
    <P>Let it be clearly stated: there is nothing in the original form of words which would pose the slightest danger to Irish women.  No established medical practice would be interfered with, doctors would not find themselves powerless to intervene to save the lives of mothers and nothing in the amendment would oblige any court anywhere to forbid operations already legally and ethically permissible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>: I said that it was a statement issued yesterday by the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign people, a group comprising a number of eminent doctors and legal people.  They include the professors who were so critical of the Taoiseach for his wild and frightening statements to women.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla referred to my reference at Second Stage to treatment in the case of a ectopic pregnancy.  I have referred to that again.  What happens in such cases is standard procedure.  The same applies in relation to cancer of the womb, a condition which Deputy Mac Giolla said is common.  That is not the case.  The last report available in this respect shows that five women under 45 died from cancer of the womb in 1973 while in 1976 the figure was eight.  There is no indication, admittedly, that these women were pregnant.  It is important to realise that the writing into the Constitution of the pro-life amendment as put forward by us would not change in any way the 1861 Act.  That will be the law still.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was wrong for the Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and the Attorney General to mislead the people in the way they did.  They have caused unnecessary <Col N="2168" /> concern among women who are expecting and those who are now going to their doctor asking if it is true that their life will be at risk.  That is deplorable, and then on the Government side of the House they talk about the level and type of debates but that is the reason the debate has followed a certain line.  As a medical doctor and a politician, I am satisfied that our wording is satisfactory and should be voted through the House this evening.</P>

      <P>: The Chair is being respected but the Chair should not be so sensitive about questions on the order of business in the House.  To put the matter straight, I should like to emphasise that I was present this morning when the debate commenced.  I was present when the Minister for Justice made his speech and when Deputy Dr. Woods replied.  It is not correct to say that I was not present. I indicated to our Whip that I wished to make a contribution but I understood that the debate would carry on in the same way as any other Committee Stage, that Members would get an opportunity of discussing in depth with the Minister aspects of the wording he was proposing. However, a list has been put together so that speakers know in advance on this Committee Stage when they will be permitted to speak.  Consequently, because of the amount of time remaining, there will only be an opportunity, if people are permitted to continue to make Second Stage speeches, for about three or four more Members to get in.  That is not fair or right when dealing with a matter on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>: Like other Members I regard this as a sad situation and a sad debate.  On 17 February I spoke at length on this issue and I do not intend to spend <Col N="2172" /> as long on the matter now.  On that occasion I sounded certain warnings and, unfortunately, they have all been proved right.  On that occasion I looked in detail at the wording originally proposed by Fianna Fáil for a constitutional amendment. I pointed out, as a lawyer with no axe to grind other than taking the position which is identical to that of all Members, somebody who is opposed to abortion and disagrees with it, and sounded a whole series of warnings as to the possible consequences if those words were put to the people in a referendum and were later inserted in the Constitution. Those warning notes were reiterated by the Minister, Members on this side, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, a matter that has not been adverted to.  I appealed to Deputies opposite to deal with this issue not as a matter of party politics or as a political football but to engage in proper, sensible dialogue to see, if we have to have a referendum, if it would be possible to put an appropriate form of wording to the people.  I was anxious that the wording should not be ambiguous or create the difficulties that may be caused by the Fianna Fáil wording and would deal in a sensible and non-divisive way with the problem presented to us.  On that occasion I said I suspected that I would not be listened to by Deputies opposite, that we were engaging in a dialogue of the deaf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>: We are still engaging in a dialogue of the deaf.  In fact, today's speeches by Deputies opposite do not have anything to do with Committee Stage.  Questions have not been put to the Minister and Members have not tried to tease out the advantages of the different forms of wording before the House. We have had from Deputies Woods and O'Hanlon a series of assertions that their form of words is correct and will not cause any problem to anybody.  Because the pro-life amendment campaigners said the amendment will not cause any problem to anybody, <i>ipso facto</i> it will not <Col N="2173" /> cause a problem.  We have had statements trotted out from eminent doctors and lawyers, but of course a person is always eminent if their point of view coincides with the political point one is trying to make.</P>
      <P>There has been a total failure on the part of Members opposite to refer to comments made by many concerned members of the medical profession, by many concerned lawyers and by many churchmen of all churches who have expressed grave and serious doubts and worries about the form of wording contained in the Fianna Fáil amendment.  We have had the five gynaecologists trotted out to us on a regular basis.  No mention has been made of more than 100 members of the medical profession who issued a statement on 25 January expressing extreme concern about the consequences of this form of words becoming part of our Constitution.  No effort has been made to tease out the conflicting views which have been expressed by people whom we would all regard as eminent.  I regard Dr. Henry of the Rotunda Hospital as being as eminent as Dr. de Valera.  I do not have to attach the qualification of eminence only to those members of the medical profession who hold views I wish to propagate for political purposes.  There has been no attempt made to see if some meeting point could be reached in putting an appropriate form of wording to the people in a referendum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Woods, suffering from a form of political infallibility, has indicated that he is right and because he says he is right we are supposed to believe him.  We are engaged not in discussing what is an appropriate form of wording to put to the people in a referendum; we are engaged in a piece of party politics.  We are playing political football with an issue which is of genuine concern to many people outside this House.  At the end of the day we are not talking about the issue at all; we are talking about a beauty contest &mdash; do the people on the far side of the House regard Charlie as more beautiful than Garret or do we over here regard Garret as more beautiful than Charlie?  The issue has <Col N="2174" /> long since been lost in a plethora of party political commentary.</P>
    <P>Let us try to deal with the wording we are supposed to be discussing on Committee Stage.  Deputy Woods made some references to the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment and gave to this House the benefit of his interpretation of the effects of the Fianna Fáil wording.  He said it has been established in the courts in the context of existing personal rights contained in our Constitution that none of these personal rights is absolute or unlimited and he stated that the Fianna Fáil proposal does not contain absolute or unlimited rights for the unborn.  He went on to say that the law of the State may make provision for the right to life of the mother when it is threatened and that the mother will be entitled to medical treatment for illness, even if such treatment would result in termination of pregnancy. I do not know what Deputy Woods means by that.  Does he mean that the Fianna Fáil amendment allows the State to pass legislation to permit abortion? That is what he seems to be indicating.</P>

      <P>: The DPP has expressed grave concern as to the possibility of bringing proceedings under the 1861 Act if this amendment becomes part of the Constitution.  Deputy Woods has admitted in this House that the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment is ambiguous and open to a variety of different interpretations. That is what has been said by Members on this side.  He has admitted that it is deliberately phrased not in absolute or unlimited terms but is phrased in a vague way whereby there are different rights in existence upon which at some stage the courts will have to adjudicate.</P>
      <P>My understanding of the case put by those who propose the need for an amendment is that we need certainty in this area of the law, that the courts should be kept out of it and that the matter should be decided once and for all by way of some provision in our Constitution.  It is clear that the matter will not be decided once and for all by the inclusion of these words in the Constitution because the courts will have to tell us what all these words mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard from Deputy Woods and Deputy O'Hanlon that in the context of these words being included in the Constitution by holding a referendum we are engaged in a democratic exercise.  They ask whether it is not right on a fundamental issue of this nature that the people should be given an opportunity to make a final decision and to take the issue out of the hands of this House and, presumably, since this was the original rationale, to take the decision out of the hands of the courts.  The people will pronounce in referendum that this is the form of wording we have, the tablets of stone will be handed down to us and there the matter will rest uncontested.  Of course that is not the case because if the Fianna Fáil form of wording becomes part of our Constitution it may prevent the elected representatives in this House from enacting legislation to permit abortion &mdash; something no members of any party has suggested he would do or is desirable &mdash; but it will place it in the hands of five members of the Supreme Court to introduce abortion if they see fit on the phraseology <Col N="2176" /> of the wording proposed by Fianna Fáil.  This is the inverse of democracy. We are asking the people in a referendum on this form of words to deprive this House of jurisdiction or entitlement to legislate in this area and to transfer that authority to five members of the Supreme Court.  Where is the democracy in that? The only way this would be a democratic exercise would be if there were some full and final set of words which were not open to a mixture of different interpretations, a form of words which people could clearly understand and vote for. That is not the case with the Fianna Fáil wording.</P>
    <P>Just as Members opposite have milked the notion of eminence to give some sort of credence to their case, I would equally milk it by saying that there are as many eminent members of the legal and medical professions who see extreme dangers in this form of wording as there are members who are supporting it.  From the calculations I have seen there are a damn sight more people who are opposed to it than there are people supporting it.  The five eminent gynaecologists are a damn sight more noisy than are the 100 or more doctors who issued a statement on 25 January and looked aghast at the insanity in this House.  Let us get away from the shibboleth of suggesting that this referendum is about asking people to make a democratic decision, if the Fianna Fáil wording goes to the people.  It is about asking the people to put a form of words into the Constitution, the meaning of which no one in this House can be certain, other than Deputies O'Hanlon and Woods who have this infallible interpretation to which they feel they can adhere. They are convinced it is right because they have been told it is right by people who think it is right.</P>
    <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to go into any detail about the defects in the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment. The Minister has referred to them already and I have referred to them at length previously, as have colleagues of mine.  It is interesting to note that Deputies opposite have not been willing so far to engage in a Committee Stage analysis <Col N="2177" /> of the words contained in their amendment. They have not yet touched on the problem so well and unusually referred to by the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is interesting to note that all they can do is support the form of words they are proposing by assertion and by reference to other assertions made by other people. We have on the opposite side of the House a great monolithic party who believe that discipline on all issues is essential.  Members vote parrot-like on whatever issue comes before them on the basis of what they are told by the party leader.  Fortunately, in the Fine Gael Party, we have people who exercise their minds in regard to their responsibilities as legislators more seriously than merely being some form of lobby fodder to make crass political points.  I know, as do Members opposite, that there are a number of members of the Fianna Fáil Party who are as concerned about the implications in the Fianna Fáil wording as some Members probably are on this side of the House.  They are frightened to say a word about it in the House, they are frightened to articulate that concern because, if they do, they will be hounded out of the party for daring to act as legislators, for daring to sound a warning.</P>

      <P>: In relation to the Fine Gael wording proposed by the Minister for Justice there are a number of advantages in it that clearly place it in a far superior position in the context of a form of wording to be put to the people.  It is not ambiguous.  There is no doubt about what it says.  It says that no law can be declared unconstitutional by reason of the fact that it prohibits abortion.  It copperfastens the 1861 Act.  It does not create any problems for the Director of Public Prosecutions in bringing prosecutions under that Act.  It prevents the Supreme Court, as some people seem to believe is necessary, legislating for abortion through the side door by way of judicial decision.  It achieves all the objectives originally set out and described as needing to be dealt with by the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has not been any sensible or logical suggestion made by Members opposite in their contributions why the Fine Gael wording does not adequately meet the situation.  We are told by Deputy Woods, parrot-like, that it is not pro-life.  That is a fine phrase.  It is anti-abortion. I presume that if you are anti-abortion you are pro-life just as if you are pro-life you are anti-abortion.  We are not engaged in dealing with what is a desirable constitutional amendment.  We are engaged in an exercise of political semantics <Col N="2179" /> for the purpose of scoring political points.  If it is anti-abortion it is pro-life. Is anybody suggesting that if it is anti-abortion it is anti-life?  Is there any Member opposite who can suggest some interesting logical reasoning that can reach that conclusion?  I have not heard it said but, parrot-like, we trot out: &ldquo;Ah, well, it is not pro-life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am a Deputy in this House for only two-and-a-half years, I am only a mere lawyer; I have only been working in the family law area for about ten years.  I accept that I am something of a political innocent and maybe I am missing something in this.  The only thing I am missing in this is the game Members opposite are trying to play, which is to suggest that because Fine Gael have proposed a new form of wording maybe somewhere in the Fine Gael Party there are people who will be sneaking in some time, some day, to promote legislation to permit abortion in this country.  Every Deputy opposite knows that is absolute nonsense.  There is nobody on this side of the House who would favour the introduction of legislation to permit abortion but Members on this side of the House are concerned that the Fianna Fáil wording might be the very vehicle by which abortion could be introduced through our courts' system.  That is something the Members opposite will not countenance as a possibility.</P>
    <P>There is no possible argument to be made by supporting the Fianna Fáil wording as opposed to the Fine Gael wording other than that of political point scoring and using this as a cynical exercise to do what Charlie wants, in some way to use this issue to embarrass Garret.  They feel that it is a great issue and they have got everybody wrong footed.  It is the most cynical, disgusting piece of politicking I have seen in the House since I came in here, on an issue concerned with amending the Constitution.</P>
    <P>I have said in other places as well as in the House that in real terms there is no legal necessity for an amendment of any nature.  I spoke at length on this when I made my contribution on 17 February last.  I have been confirmed in that view by a judgment of the Supreme Court last <Col N="2180" /> Friday.  In that case the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice McCarthy, a dissenting judge, indicated quite clearly that in their view the Constitution as it stands at the moment protects the right to life of the unborn child.  In the context of that case Mr. Justice McCarthy said that he could not delimit the area in which the State might constitutionally intervene to restrict the right to privacy.  It is the right to privacy that the Members opposite and the pro-life campaign have suggested might result in the Supreme Court providing for some form of abortion.  He said he could not restrict the right of privacy nor could he overlook the present public debate concerning the criminal law arising from the statute of 1861 as to abortion, the killing of an unborn child.  He said that this was not an issue which arose in the present case but it might be claimed that the right of privacy of a pregnant woman could extend to a right in her to terminate a pregnancy, an act which would involve depriving the unborn child of the most fundamental right of all, the right to life itself.  He said he recognised there had been no argument in this particular case in relation to this issue but nothing in his judgment, expressed or implied, was to be taken as supporting a view that the provisions of section 58 of the 1861 Act making it a criminal offence to procure an abortion were in any way inconsistent with the Constitution.  The provisions of the Preamble of the Constitution, he went on to say, would appear to lean heavily against any view other than that the right to life of the unborn child was a sacred trust to which all organs of Government must lend their support.  As recently as last Friday the Supreme Court indicated clearly that the amendment campaign was nonsense and unnecessary.</P>

If we go to the country with the Fianna Fáil wording we will have a most divisive and unfortunate campaign that will have far-reaching effects and will do untold damage to the perception of the country by minorities living in it.

We must not put a form of words to the people which they will not understand or will not understand the implications of.</P>
      <P>The vast majority of people outside the House see this debate as an irrelevancy and something of an obscenity because of the way in which it has developed.  I believe from what I have heard directly from some Members of the pro-life campaign that they are deeply shocked at the way the debate has developed in the context of the divisions which have been created between the different churches. I deplore the selective quotations used by Deputy Woods to put forward his case and suggest that all minority religions fully support the proposal his party put to the House.  That is untrue.  We are not dealing with ordinary legislation but are seeking to arrive at a consensus for amending the Constitution.  It is a disgrace for a Deputy of long-standing and particularly one who was a former Minister to try to put forward a case of this nature which he knows is untenable.  He knows there are divisions.  There are divisions within and between all the churches on this.</P>

      <P>: The majority of people outside the House wish this debate would go away.  This debate has done something which no one in the pro-life movement originally envisaged.  It has taught people what abortion is all about and where one can get an abortion.  It is not just Deputies who found themselves assailed by different literature portraying in graphic detail the different forms of abortions one can get.  It has been distributed in schools, at ladies' clubs and so on.  Instead of ensuring people do not have abortions we have taught them how to have them and where to go to get them.  We have done nothing to tackle the real problem of 5,000 <Col N="2183" /> women going across the water to have abortions.</P>
      <P>I do not believe my contribution will result in any sanity being brought to bear on Members opposite.  However, if I did not make my contribution to the debate I would be abrogating my responsibility as a Member of the House to state my views on the issue and attempt, futile as it might be, to influence Members opposite to adopt a more responsible approach to this issue.  I do not expect that they will.  I suspect we will kick the political football until 6.30 p.m. today.  I hope some of the Deputies opposite who have genuine doubts and worries about the issue will think about the implications of the Fianna Fáil wording.  They should seriously consider the responsibility which rests on their shoulders as legislators to support a form of wording which does not have the divisive element or the ambiguities contained in the Fianna Fáil wording and which will not transfer responsibility in this area from this House to the shoulders of five members of the Supreme Court.</P>

      <P>: I hope it will be possible to have a normal Committee Stage discussion from here on.  I do not intend to make a speech but to ask the Minister some questions.  Deputy Shatter said this amendment copperfastens the 1861 Act. How does the Minister see it doing that? In his speech this morning, which was unprecedented in that it was a formal speech introducing an amendment on Committee Stage, he said the Attorney General advised the Government that the original words proposed by the Minister, that is, the words &ldquo;or to deprive of force or effect&rdquo; were adequate to protect the 1861 Act.  The Minister said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>... it was entirely adequate to achieve its objective and that the technical criticisms that had been made about the alleged insufficiency of the word &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo; were not well founded.  Nevertheless, because the criticisms had been made and were being persisted in, I did not think it right that we in this House should <Col N="2184" /> embark on a futile and time-wasting argument about a side-issue and, as the Attorney General was satisfied that a few words could be added without harm to the meaning, the amendment that I am now formally putting to the House includes, as well as the word &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo;, those extra words, that is, the words &ldquo;or to deprive of force or effect&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying there is no need for the extra words to protect the 1861 Act?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>: Criticisms were made that by the use of the word &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo; legislation passed prior to 1937 would not be covered by this amendment.  I do not accept that nor does the Attorney General but because I envisaged a situation where we would spend a lot of time arguing about the effect of the amendment it was decided to strengthen the words.  I refer the Deputy to Article 50º of the Constitution:</P>
      <P>Subject to this Constitution and to the extent to which they are not inconsistent therewith, the laws in force in Saorstát Éireann immediately prior to the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution shall continue to be of full force and effect until the same or any of them shall have been repealed or amended by enactment of the Oireachtas.</P>
      <P>The force and effect phrase is taken from Article 50º and is to be in accord with that and not because the amendment was defective.  There is a tendency in this issue to be sidetracked.  In my innocence, I wanted the House to debate the merits and demerits of one wording against the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Let us do that now. The Minister has quite clearly put on the record that the Attorney General, who advises the Government on legal and constitutional matters and he, the Minister, acting on the Attorney General's advice in these matters, do not see the necessity for adding any words to protect <Col N="2185" /> pre-1937 legislation to the original words he proposed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Those words are in the amendment.  If that is the view of the Attorney General and if he has advised the Government that invalidation will cover pre-1937 Acts, he is running contrary to the judgment of the Supreme Court which I am sure the Attorney General is aware of and must have so informed the Government in a case that is widely known, the State (at the prosecution of Francis James Sheerin) v. Michael Kennedy, 1966 Irish Reports, page 386.  It specifically states:</P>
      <P>... the question of determining the validity of a law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution can only refer to laws enacted by the Oireachtas established by the Constitution ... where the law referred to is not expressly referred to as a law of the Oireachtas ... must be treated as meaning that the validity in question is a validity to be determined by the provisions of the Constitution in respect of something purporting to have been done within the terms of the Constitution and within the powers conferred by the Constitution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am quoting from a Supreme Court judgment, not as Deputy Shatter has wrongly implied, one opinion from one judge in a matter not before it.  He called that a Supreme Court judgment in respect of an <i>obiter dictum</i> of one judge.  The Deputy must know that that is not a Supreme Court judgment.  I am quoting from a <Col N="2186" /> unanimous judgement of the Supreme Court.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>... the question of determining the validity of a law having regard to the provisions of the Constitution can only refer to laws enacted by the Oireachtas established by the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the light of that, the Minister is telling us that the Attorney General who is charged to give legal and constitutional advice to the Government, said that the original words which referred to &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo; could cover pre-1937 legislation.  If that is so, the Attorney General and the Minister accepting his advice are flying in the face of established laws and they must know it.

I am suggesting they are not.  The Minister indicated this morning that even though the Attorney General was so satisfied, he decided to advise, so that we would not be engaged in a time-wasting exercise, that the inclusion of other words &ldquo;or to deprive of force and effect.&rdquo;  Although not necessary, the Attorney General apparently said to put them in there anyway. Even putting them in does not cure the defect in the ministerial amendment. There is another established principle of law, a principle of construction and interpretation, that where you add words like &ldquo;or to deprive of force and effect&rdquo; and they follow specific words such as &ldquo;invalidation&rdquo;, then they must be interpreted under the principle of <i>justum generis</i>, of the same nature, as applying to the same condition as the original word, namely, &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo;, by Supreme Court decision, only applies and is restricted in this context to post-1937 Constitution.  Therefore, the addition of what the Minister sees as a futile gesture in any case&mdash;&mdash;</P>

So as not to be sidetracked along the lines that Deputy O'Kennedy has been sidetracking the House we decided to put in the extra words.

      <P>: The Minister has replied with a very bland statement and said that his advice is that the original words he introduced apply to pre-1937 legislation.  I quoted from the Supreme Court judgment in a very well-known case which clearly said the opposite.  Is the Minister saying now that his advice is that the Supreme Court, unanimously in that case, were wrong in their interpretation? He and his Attorney General will find, if they go before the Supreme Court on the basis that they bind themselves by a unanimous decision already taken, that the court will hold that the terminology he has does not apply to the post- or pre-1937 Constitutions.  It is not enough for the Minister to say in reply in the face <Col N="2189" /> of that kind of evidence, &ldquo;my advice is&rdquo;, and then to imply that the question I raised is being raised purely for the sake of political hassle or something of that kind.  It is not.  Confining myself to the text of the Supreme Court judgment, if Deputy Kelly, who is not engaged to advise the Government, now comes to his aid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

If one person in this House can demonstrate that I will give way to him, but it is not enough for the Minister to say, &ldquo;I am advised that&rdquo; and then to imply that the Opposition when questioning that advice are engaging in what someone called political football.

The Minister is now saying that, despite the fact that it covers pre-1937 legislation, to avoid any hassle in this House he is going to bring in some extra words, &ldquo;or to deprive of force or effect&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is all right, I know what the judgment is about.  If I recall correctly, the point about the judgment is that it disentangled various usages in regard to the constitutionality of legislation. Only Bills under the Article 26 procedure could be spoken of as repugnant. Acts passed before the present Oireachtas came into existence had to be spoken of as inconsistent with the existing Constitution and Acts subsequent to 1937 &mdash; I hope I have already got full marks from some of the people over there for this &mdash; are spoken of as being valid or invalid as the case may be, having regard to the provisions of the Constitution.  The Minister's <Col N="2192" /> original draft of his amendment contained the word &ldquo;invalidate&rdquo;.  I have not had a chance to look it up but I believe that that word does not occur in the Constitution as distinct from the word &ldquo;valid&rdquo; in any context material to what Deputy O'Kennedy has been saying.  Any judge standing on his heels and not on his head would hold that word adequately to cover all legislation whether of this Oireachtas, the last Oireachtas or the pre-1922 authority then passing laws for this country.  I may be wrong in thinking so.  If the Minister thinks so I will agree with him, but there is the other point of view that perhaps, if the Sheerin judgment is to be interpreted as pedantically as Deputy O'Kennedy suggests, this word might be held to apply only to post-1937 legislation and therefore not to insulate the 1861 Act which was passed by the former authorities and accordingly an Act to which some expression like &ldquo;inconsistently&rdquo; would be more appropriately applied.</P>
      <P>The Minister has solved this &mdash; he does not think that this problem exists nor do I &mdash; to the satisfaction of those who doubt it by saying that we will look at the Article of the Constitution which carries over and keeps in force all the pre-1937 legislation, whether it be that of the old Oireachtas or of the British.  That article speaks about such laws remaining in full force and effect unless inconsistent with the Constitution.  That phrase which the Minister put in is specifically designed to insulate pre-1937 legislation.  With all the other absurdities in this constitutional and political pantomime we are engaging in here, this is the bottom.</P>

      <P>: We talk about a law which prohibits abortion but I want to ask the Minister precisely what he means by that.  Is it a law which prohibits abortion in all circumstances or in some circumstances? In his proposal the Minister <Col N="2196" /> uses this phrase: &ldquo;Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate, or to deprive of force or effect, any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion.&rdquo;  Does that apply to a law that prohibits abortion in all circumstances or in some circumstances?  Can it be said to be a law which permits abortion in some cases but prohibits it in others? I do not know exactly what that phrase means and this is what a court interpreting this legislation would have to look to. How general or extensive is it?  As has been asked many times, what is it that prohibits abortion?  As the Minister knows, abortion is not legally defined and has not been legally defined, although it is legally and constitutionally being used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is not contained in the relevant provisions of the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, which at the moment prohibits the act called abortion. The word is not used in that Act. Of course it is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary which is often looked at by lawyers when they try to interpret the normal meaning of words.  There it is defined as &ldquo;a miscarriage&rdquo; or &ldquo;the procurement of a miscarriage&rdquo;.  It is also defined as &ldquo;a dwarf or deformed person&rdquo;. They are the known definitions.  A spontaneous miscarriage by a pregnant woman is frequently if not usually referred to by the medical profession as &ldquo;an abortion&rdquo;, or &ldquo;a spontaneous abortion&rdquo;. I want to know from the Minister what is he suggesting to be the meaning of &ldquo;abortion&rdquo;?  Does it apply to a law that prohibits abortion in all cases or in some cases, and if in some cases what kind of cases does it extend to?  What does &ldquo;it&rdquo; refer to in the Minister's wording of Part II of his amendment to the Schedule, which states:</P>
      <P>Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate, or to deprive of force or effect, any provision of a law on the ground that it prohibits abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does it refer to the provision in a law or <Col N="2197" /> the full law itself?  The Minister is introducing something very fundamental and it is important that the parliamentary draftsman or the Attorney General would be able to tell us what exactly is the legal definition.  I think the House should be given some response by the Minister.</P>

I will be brief because I do not share with many Members the concern and the serious views which they seem to share about the possibility of abortion being legalised here either by the House, which is a bastion of conservatism, or by a Supreme Court as at present constituted.

      <P>: I am working from notes.  I will be reading some extracts from the Dáil Official Report.  Deputy Woods is speaking about lack of definitions. During the election campaign I said I had many reservations about the implications of the amendment as proposed by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I have felt since that those reservations were justified.  The Attorney General, in offering his opinion on the interpretation of some of the words in the Fianna Fáil proposed amendment, has vindicated my opinion.  I accept his legal opinion, which points out the difficulties of interpretation by the Supreme Court of certain words and phrases, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn.  It is clear that the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is likely to be interpreted by the Supreme Court as the moment at which the human ovum is penetrated by a sperm &mdash; the moment when human life commences.  In the course of the Second Stage debate on this topic Deputy Woods made the point &mdash; and I find it ironic now <Col N="2198" /> that Deputy O'Kennedy should be questioning the Minister in relation to the lack of definition &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy is recorded in the Official Report for 9 February last at column 1386 in the following manner:</P>
      <P>Despite what would undoubtedly have been the wish of the promoters of this amendment and the majority church in this island, there is no attempt in the wording of the amendment to define the moment at which the life of the unborn begins.  The amendment does not attempt to make this definition.  Most, of course, would argue that it begins at the time of conception, but this is a matter of theological and scientific argument and in preparing the wording of the amendment we felt it was not appropriate to the Constitution to have such definitions.</P>
      <P>I do not understand, if one side do not think it appropriate to have definitions, how they can then turn around to the other side and ask them for definitions of the very words they were not prepared to define themselves.</P>
      <P>The whole issue here is lack of definition in the 1861 Act which we should be updating and not attempting to tackle our Constitution in this haphazard manner. If this interpretation should be placed on the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; then I believe some forms of contraception which are now acceptable would be declared illegal and the phrase &ldquo;with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother&rdquo; could mean that various established medical practices which are now ethically acceptable could be declared illegal.  With these fundamental legal objections to the Fianna Fáil wording, I believe there is also the possibility that the Supreme Court could rule on the Fianna Fáil wording in such a way as to permit abortion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, as far as I am concerned it can be clearly seen that there are major defects in the Fianna Fáil wording which, if passed, the people of the country would be asked to vote on, knowing that the <Col N="2199" /> Supreme Court almost certainly will have to rule at a later stage and which ruling would have serious social implications.  It is both inappropriate and unfortunate that we the legislators would allow something to be passed here this evening of which we are not sure of the definition and the scope or the extent of the effects it will have on Irish life in the immediate and long term future.</P>
    <P>Since the wording was published, I and many others have become increasingly disturbed by the implications which it has for religious harmony in this part of the island.  It has become clear that the Protestant Churches here regard the passing &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am entitled to express my opinion.  The Protestant Churches see the passing of the Fianna Fáil amendment as including in our Constitution a definition of &ldquo;life&rdquo; which reflects the theological position of the Catholic Church. Regardless of the validity of this view, we should give due consideration to having included in the Constitution a section which is seen by a substantial minority as objectionable.  I do not believe that due consideration has been given to this.  It is my opinion that we should be looking to the new Forum to develop a Constitution which in the final analysis could unify the people of the country.  The inclusion in the Constitution of the Fianna Fáil <Col N="2200" /> amendment could not in any way contribute to Irish unity but could seriously damage the trust which we seek from Northern Unionists.  In the past, Fianna Fáil always claimed, and they do so now, to be the Republican Party.  Yet they appear to be totally oblivious to the objections to their wording raised by the Protestant Churches.  I would be interested to hear from them how they see their amendment as uniting Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter under the common name of Irishmen.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>: Another disturbing aspect of the pro-life campaign has been its failure to address itself to something on which everyone in this House would agree, that is, that the problem we are talking about is abortion.  The passing of this amendment will do nothing to reduce the numbers of Irish girls having abortions each year.  The vast majority of girls who have abortions do so not because they want to, but because of social and economic pressures which they are unable to withstand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a society we must adopt a much more caring attitude to this problem.  We must abolish the status of illegitimacy and remove the stigma which attaches to it. We should welcome every child into our society and help the mother feel pride rather than shame.  We should make economic provisions for women so that there <Col N="2201" /> would be no question of abortion for economic reasons.  These areas are fundamental to a reduction in the number of abortions.  If the time and energy spent on this amendment had been directed at the root causes of abortion, namely, the economic and social conditions for pregnant women, our society would be the better for it today.  We must create a caring society in which the quality of life is understood to be important.  I do not see how this amendment in any way could further that cause.</P>
    <P>I have stated that for the reasons given I am opposed to the Fianna Fáil amendment as drafted.  Nothing has been said in the course of this debate, either on Second Stage or today, to convince me that there is an overwhelming desire or necessity for such an amendment, particularly in view of the <i>obiter dicta</i> in the Norris judgment last week by two Supreme Court judges, which clearly showed that there is implicit protection for the unborn in our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I am also extremely concerned about the statement made by the Director of Public Prosecutions that he could find it more difficult to prosecute persons carrying out abortions if the Fianna Fáil amendment before us were passed and enacted by the people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <P>: There are serious implications in this.  Many times in the past I have heard my colleagues across the floor of the House making pleas to the Labour Party to do certain things, more often when we were in Government than when we were in Opposition.  They said they wanted to assist the Labour Party and would appreciate it if we took certain courses of action.  There must be some people amongst the 75 Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches who have minds of their own and who can think about the possible wording of the amendment to go before the people.  I do not accept that the Whip should be imposed on them on this issue because reservations have been expressed in public.  This evening their <Col N="2203" /> voting pattern should reflect those reservations rather than their obedience to the party Whip or party unity.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil amendment will make bad law.  It will cause serious problems in future.  I regret that neither of the wordings before us has been properly defined. We should have the definitions in this House and not in the Supreme Court which, likewise, has been dragged into disrepute in the course of this debate.  I consider that totally unnecessary.  If we have not got the ability, the authority or the guts to define the amendment in this House, we should not be going before the people.</P>

      <P>: A number of Deputies are very concerned about terminology.  It is not widely enough recognised, possibly due to the hysterical and rushed way in which the campaign for this amendment has been conducted &mdash; and the rushed way in which debate today has been conducted; we opposed the guillotine this morning and got no support for our opposition to it &mdash; that the wording of the Fianna Fáil amendment could well spell the end of the only safe methods of contraception now available to thousands of Irish women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This point was the primary concern of the doctors who held a press conference on 24 January last to voice their opposition to the amendment.  It is important to note who these doctors are.  In many cases they are leading specialists in their fields, men and women we entrust with <Col N="2204" /> the health and future well-being of our people.  Can we afford to ignore their fears?</P>
    <P>No doubt Deputies on various sides of the House can produce other eminent specialists who will offer alternative views.  The facts are that there are many differing views on this issue.  For that reason it is very important that the issue should be discussed and it was for that reason only that we put down the amendments to the Fianna Fáil wording.  We wanted to get a reasonable, adult, sane debate on the issue, which we have not had so far today, apart from the contribution by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Shatter who attempted to approach the actual issues which will arise if an amendment is passed here today.</P>
    <P>This amendment could dramatically affect not only the health but in some cases the lives of women.  Professor Dermot Hourihane, Dean of the School of Medicine at Trinity College, Dublin, had this to say last January:</P>
    <P>We have been advised that a number of methods of contraception at present commonly prescribed by doctors could become illegal if the amendment once passed receives an interpretation defining the term &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; as existing from the moment of fertilisation.  In some cases these are the only really safe methods available to our patients, particularly to older women.</P>
    <P>Among other things Professor Hourihane was referring to the intra-uterine device, one of the few methods of birth control available to women who smoke, who are for various reasons unsuited to the pill, or who have reached an age at which the use of the pill becomes increasingly dangerous.</P>
    <P>One theory is that its presence in the uterus creates a condition which increases the number of white blood cells which in turn destroys spermatoza, in which case the IUD could not be seen as interfering with the fertilised ovum. Other theories, however, are that the presence of the IUD inhibits implantation of the fertilised ovum in the womb, in which case the IUD could be interpreted as an abortifacient and, thus, <Col N="2205" /> become illegal if the amendment is so interpreted.  This is what we are leaving ourselves open to.  We have already seen a display of the differences that arise between lawyers whom we assume have studied the cases involved and have come to different conclusions.  If this method of contraception were to be banned, it would put hundreds of thousands of women in jeopardy of further pregnancies, in danger of bearing children they do not want in circumstances seriously threatening to their own lives and health. More than 2,500 IUDs were inserted in 1981.</P>
    <P>What is of particular concern to The Workers' Party is that in practice the IUD is overwhelmingly used by working-class women.  Last year Dr. Helen Watson conducted the first comprehensive study of the use of the IUD in Ireland.  She found that 34.7 per cent of IUD users were wives of manual workers; 27 per cent were wives of unemployed men and that 35.4 per cent of IUD users were also medical card holders.</P>
    <P>Dr. Watson also found that more IUD users had four to six children than women who used other forms of contraception, and that a far higher proportion were in the 35 to 44 year age group.  She concluded that &ldquo;a significantly higher proportion of women using IUDs have large families; are entitled to medical card treatment; have husbands in the lower occupational groupings; have husbands who are unemployed and come from the lowest socio-economic parts of Dublin.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Dr. Mary Henry, Consultant Physician to the Rotunda Thrombo-Embolic Unit, has found that the number of deaths due to thrombo-embolism have fallen dramatically in women over 35 years with many children.  This fall is due in the main to the increased use of the IUD or coil. Yet, we are talking about passing an amendment that may make illegal the use of this device.</P>
    <P>If the fears doctors have expressed with regard to the interpretation of the amendment are realised, the women this amendment threatens to most affect are precisely those women already most over-burdened with the injustices of this society &mdash; large families, low income or <Col N="2206" /> no income at all but the dole, poor housing and high prices.  Why is it that the advocates of this amendment have carefully concealed this fact, have neglected to give publicity to the fact that the 40-year old working-class wife with half-a-dozen children, the woman struggling to make ends meet and rear her family responsibly in extreme hardship, is very probably going to be the first victim of this amendment?</P>
    <P>There is another form of contraception quite likely to be banned should this amendment be interpreted as Professor Hourihane described, and that is the Progesterone Only Pill.  The consequences of banning this will have serious medical effects for the great numbers of women, who because of their age, have too high a cardiovascular risk to take the combined pill, women who have vascular heart disease and cannot take the combined pill and women who are breast-feeding. This pill is also the only pill suited to diabetic women.  As a medical development the Progesterone Only Pill represents a significant advance and the numbers of women taking this form of treatment have increased considerably in recent years.</P>
    <P>Are we now to become the only country in the modern world today to deny women the benefits of medical research because a small minority insist that one area of philosophical debate be defined in their terms, and in their terms only, and imposed on the rest of the nation? The medical facts appear to be that all women who use the pill may be put at a disadvantage by this amendment.  Since 1980 a new form of pill, the &ldquo;triphasic&rdquo; pill has been on the market with a very low dose of oestrogen.</P>
    <P>Many of these pills may not inhibit ovulation as the older versions of the pill do but may also act by preventing implantation of a fertilised ovum.  These new pills are much safer for older women and for younger women alike because of the very low doses of hormones used are less likely to produce changes in the blood associated with clotting.  If low-dose pills are to become illegal, we will be the only country in the world to force our women <Col N="2207" /> to use high-dose oral contraceptives with all their attendant medical risks.</P>
    <P>Finally, we must look at the question of post-coital contraception.  In recent years the availability of safe and effective &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; treatment to prevent pregnancy has become a reality.  The woman who is at risk of pregnancy from unprotected intercourse &mdash; whether the event was an unplanned encounter, whether she is a victim of accident or misplaced diaphragm or whether she is the tragic victim of rape &mdash; can now avail of a simple and effective means of protecting herself from an unwanted pregnancy. The treatment consists of two doses of oral contraceptive tablets taken within three days of the event.  This acts by preventing the implantation of the fertilised ovum in the womb and there is no question but that its availability has already prevented hundreds of thousands of unplanned, unwanted pregnancies.</P>
    <P>One of the most important aspects of the &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; pill is that it may be the most effective means yet of reducing the abortion figures.  In the University of British Columbia, where post-coital contraception was made available seven days a week and widely publicised, the rate of abortion among college students dropped by half.  Many continental doctors are hopeful that with enough education and facilities similar improvements could be made on abortion statistics throughout the world.  Yet, ironically, here in Ireland we are actually considering an amendment to the Constitution that would outlaw post-coital contraception and do nothing practical to help reduce the abortion rates in this country.</P>
    <P>I appeal to Deputies on the Fianna Fáil benches who know this amendment is wrong to refuse to support it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister for Health speaking in this House this morning said that the public debate that has taken place has proven to be divisive to an extent unprecedented in recent times. He said it has generated confusion and bitterness that do not provide a stable basis for decisions on matters as important as changing our Constitution.  Further <Col N="2208" /> in his speech he mentioned what Deputy De Rossa has been speaking about, namely, the possibility that contraception as it is practised at present would not be legal if our amendment were introduced.  I am glad Deputy De Rossa has taken such an intensive and authoritative course on the types of contraception that seem to be available. Obviously he has carried out a considerable amount of reading on the matter.</P>
      <P>I wish to state that what the Minister and Deputy De Rossa said, that contraception as it is practised might not be allowable, is totally untrue.  I wish to quote from the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 4 March 1983.  The article written by Kevin Moore states:</P>
      <P>The Irish Medical Association has declared that the Fianna Fáil wording of the anti-abortion Amendment to the Constitution does not conflict with medical ethics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will continue with the quotation:</P>
      <P>This is the view of the Association's Ethical Committee which has been endorsed by the IMA Central Council. It runs counter to the reservations expressed by the present Attorney General, Mr. Peter Sutherland, SC.</P>
      <P>The IMA Central Council wanted guidance on whether there might be conflict between the right to life of the mother and the right to life of the unborn and on whether certain contraceptive methods might be banned.</P>
      <P>A member of the Central Council said yesterday that the Ethical Committee found that there would be no departure from existing medical practice.</P>
      <P>The Attorney General, Mr. Sutherland, has suggested that certain contraceptives and family planning techniques might be outlawed if the Fianna Fáil wording were adopted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However the IMA's Ethical Committee found that the use of contraceptives would not be affected and this <Col N="2209" /> interpretation was backed by the meaning given to the term &ldquo;contraceptive&rdquo; by the Supreme Court in the Magee case.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister for Health and Deputy De Rossa have been attempting to confuse the public more by what they have been saying.  We can see clearly who has been creating the confusion.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil form of words is clear and unambiguous and would copperfasten within our Constitution the right to life of the unborn from the time of fertilisation and would also copperfasten the equal right to life of the mother and the unborn child.  Amazingly, prior to the election of November 1982, Fine Gael clearly and unequivocally accepted this form of wording.  Unfortunately, now, some months later, after their election success, the present Taoiseach is prepared to renege on his promises and his commitment.</P>

That is not so.  I am disappointed that the Minister for Health did not make himself aware of the facts in relation to medical ethics concerning the treatment of pregnant women who have particular conditions. An ectopic tubal pregnancy is a medical emergency which needs an acute surgical operation to save the life of the mother. An ectopic tubal pregnancy cannot survive. There is no question of a mother <Col N="2216" /> with such a pregnancy being allowed to die if the amendment with our form of wording is introduced, any more than there is any danger of any pregnant woman with any condition, whether it be leukaemia, or cancer of the womb, being left untreated because she is pregnant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East</i>): I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate here today.  I am sorry that, to a large extent, it seemed to be a re-run of the Second Stage debate rather than Committee Stage.  In particular I thank Deputy O'Kennedy because he made an attempt to render it a Committee Stage debate.  He raised three points at the end which were not answered and I should like to answer them.  He asked if the text I am proposing gives constitutional protection.  Only where the provision prohibits all abortions, not for example under section 58 of the 1861 Act which appears to permit some.  I think that is the point he was making.  The advice I had from the Attorney General was that he saw no reason to give the text this narrow meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second point Deputy O'Kennedy raised was on the meaning of the word &ldquo;abortion&rdquo; in the context of procured or spontaneous abortion.  The word &ldquo;prohibit&rdquo; would quite clearly suggest here that what we are talking about is procured abortion because obviously one could not prohibit spontaneous abortion. Deputy O'Kennedy asked also what does the word &ldquo;it&rdquo; in the English text refer back to, was it to a law or a provision of the law?  If he looks at the Irish version of the text he will see that there the <Col N="2219" /> translation of &ldquo;it&rdquo; is &ldquo;si&rdquo; and it quite obviously refers back to &ldquo;foráil&rdquo; in that context rather than to the law itself.  If the Deputy looks at the Irish version it is obvious it refers to a provision rather than to the law itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods made the major contribution from the Opposition side.  I posed some questions when I was introducing the wording this morning.  Since the amendment I am proposing as Minister for Justice substitutes for wording in the Bill I think that has put Deputy Woods in the position in which in effect he is sponsoring the original wording.  I asked him some questions about the original wording and I am sorry he did not clarify them.  Deputy Woods is now Opposition spokesman on Justice.  But, I understand, when the wording was published, he was Minister for Health and the responsibility for introducing this Bill in the previous administration lay with the Minister for Health and the Department of Health, not with the Department of Justice.  I am surprised that, on his memory of events, if he did not have the documentation available, he would not have been able to carry out an analysis and defence of the wording in the original Bill.  He failed to do that and I wonder why.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): Why could he not answer the questions I <Col N="2220" /> raised?  As far as I can gather, in general, Deputy Woods has taken the line, in much the same words on different occasions, that there is no problem about the existing wording.  He wrote about it recently in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 20 April 1983 and something similar appears in today's newspapers.  The opening part of his argument is that none of the personal rights of the citizen is absolute or unlimited and that their exercise may be regulated by the State.  He goes on to say that the original wording does not create an absolute or unlimited guarantee for the life of the unborn but specifically acknowledges the equal right to life of the mother.  The laws of the State, he says, may therefore provide for the exercise of that right when it is threatened and if a mother's life is threatened by illness she is constitutionally entitled to appropriate medical treatment even if such treatment would result in the termination of her pregnancy.  That is the line of argument Deputy Woods followed today in the early part of his contribution.</P>
      <P>I should like to look at that argument. The first point made is that the State has the right to regulate the exercise of personal rights.  I think a question could be raised immediately as to how the word &ldquo;exercise&rdquo; could be applied at all to the right to life&mdash;one would not normally think of the process of living as the exercise of a right to life.  But, leaving that aside, it is quite clear that if one speaks about the State regulating the exercise of a right one is talking about some form of restriction on its exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come now to the next part of the argument where it says that the wording acknowledges the equal right to life of the mother and that the laws of the State may therefore provide for the exercise of that right when it is threatened.  In sharp contrast to the opening statement the Deputy goes on to talk about regulating, about providing for the exercise of a right, that is facilitating or allowing for it, which is almost the opposite of restricting it.  I cannot understand the logic of the Deputy's positions, where he has moved from one side of the argument to the other in the early part of his contribution this morning.  Apart from that, the suggestion <Col N="2221" /> that it is permissible for the laws of the State to provide for the exercise of a constitutional right is a rather strange one, the reality being, of course, that the laws of the State must allow for the exercise of such rights.</P>
    <P>Having made those introductory propositions&mdash;the meaning of which, as I have indicated, is open to considerable doubt&mdash;Deputy Woods then went on to make the assertion that if a mother's life was threatened by illness she would be constitutionally entitled to appropriate medical treatment even if such treatment would result in the termination of her pregnancy.  I am afraid I have to say very plainly that that assertion is no more than an assertion, unsustained by any argument whatsoever because the statements that preceded it are irrelevant to the conclusion. That is why I objected to the fact that we had a Second Stage speech from Deputy Woods in which he concluded with an assertion to which the arguments did not lead.</P>
    <P>I must ask those who are so completely happy about the present wording to face the real questions.  Nobody suggests that the wording gives to the unborn child an unqualified right to life.  Of course it does not.  But it does acknowledge a right to life which, on the wording, the State is obliged to uphold in equal measure with that of the mother.  There is no point in saying that that obligation is qualified by the words &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo; and that that is why those words were included. Those words had to be included because they are already in Article 40.3.1º.  Even if they had been included for the purpose stated, it does not follow that they are sufficient or even relevant.  The issue is not practicability.  It is &ldquo;practicable&rdquo; for the law to forbid such operations.  Such a law would be indefensible and outregeous but not impracticable&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We are therefore back to the stark question whether the carrying out of such an operation can be reconciled with the specific words of the original text which, I must repeat, requires that the right to life of the unborn be upheld in equal measure with that of the mother.  The difficulty that has been raised is that, where such an operation is carried out, <Col N="2222" /> necessary and legitimate and laudable though it be, the right to life of the unborn is not being upheld and it is not sufficient for anybody to say that the mother has a constitutional right to protect her life if in fact the Constitution is expressing, without any qualifications whatsoever, an equal right for the foetus.</P>
    <P>It is very easy to be misunderstood on an issue like this.  I am very well aware of the fact that people's thinking in this respect can be influenced by the fact that they believe that the right to life in both cases is intrinsically equal.  It is no part of the case that I am making that the wording should express a different principle. In my view it does not need to do so but I continue to believe that, if it is to express with clarity what its sponsors intended to mean, then, without purporting to express any principle on the matter, it should have acknowledged that in certain circumstances certain forms of intervention would not be unlawful&mdash;that is to say, that the law of the State would not intervene to stop such interventions. That would involve no statement of basic principle as to the respective values of the two lives and therefore no conflict with basic principles which very many people hold as sacred.  It is so well known as scarcely to merit repeating that there are many things which, in the Judaeo-Christian tradition, have been universally regarded as wrong but which, for good and sufficient reasons, the law of the State does not declare to be unlawful.</P>
    <P>I am afraid, therefore, that what Deputy Woods has said does not answer the questions I have raised.  What he has said does not really face the questions at all.  I was very disappointed with him in this respect this morning.  I think I am entitled to inquire if the Deputy bothered to listen to or to read what the questions were.  He alleged here today that one of my questions was a fundamental one about whether we should have a Constitution and what we should have in it.  I said nothing, by way of question or otherwise, remotely like that.  He said I asked what was the position of the State in relation to protecting fundamental rights and went on to comment that the killing of the unborn is an issue affecting the <Col N="2223" /> secular and social order of the State as if I had suggested the contrary.  I put no such question and, far from denying that abortion affects the secular and social order, I would regard it as so self-evidently true as not to need saying.</P>
    <P>The Deputy refers me to a document by Professor Walter Murphy of Princeton as if in some way I had expressed some different opinion, and tells the House, by way of explanation, that I asked for some relevant references.  A script of my remarks was circulated and can be checked.  There is not a word in it about my seeking relevant references.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): I asked the Deputy questions but he evaded them by answering questions that I did not put. If the Deputy as Minister sponsored the original text, he should be prepared to explain it to the House, as I have explained our amendment.</P>
      <P>The simple fact, as I have said, is that the questions I put have not been faced. There is no point in telling us that similar language is used in the Constitution to express and regulate a whole host of other rights.  We are all aware of that. But the relationship of mother and unborn child is unique in its intimacy. Nowhere else, as far as I know, does the law have to cater for a situation where something may be done to save one life in the certain knowledge that it will lead to the loss of another life.  That, fundamentally, is why wording that is quite acceptable in ordinary situations can cause problems here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I repeat my question.  Why did the text take a form that, at best, clearly calls for a considerable degree of interpretation when its intended meaning could have been stated clearly?  I do not understand that.  I can see that what concerns people here today more than anything else is the question of the respective rights of the mother and child.  Deputy Woods admits that the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is ambiguous and vague but to a large degree he has repeated what he said on Second Stage, <Col N="2224" /> that was, that despite what undoubtedly would have been the wishes of the promoters of this amendment and of the majority Church on this island, there is no attempt in the wording of the amendment to define the moment at which the life of the unborn begins.  He went on to say that most would argue that life beings at the time of conception but that this is a matter of theological and scientific argument and that in preparing the wording of the amendment Fianna Fáil considered it was not appropriate to the Constitution to have such definitions.  In effect that means that there was a failure to take a decision as to when the protection of the unborn life should commence and that Fianna Fáil were leaving it to the courts to decide that matter.  In so far as Deputy Woods answered the questions at all he said on Second Stage that he purposely allowed the wording to be ambiguous because he wanted it to be ambiguous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick East</i>): If this had been a normal Committee Stage debate, the Minister would have been on his feet several times today but the debate did not proceed on those lines.  I am picking up the main points made by the Opposition and which are relevant to the words before us.  Deputy Woods made a major contribution.  I am not misquoting him.  He says that the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; is used without qualification as a matter of policy so that it might be interpreted subsequently. Will it be interpreted as meaning from the point of fertilisation, as from the point of implantation or from the point when the foetus develops a brain? I do not know what decision the Supreme Court would reach in that regard.  I am <Col N="2225" /> only saying that Fianna Fáil wish to have enshrined in the Constitution an amendment which the person who put it forward in the first place is declaring to be unfair.</P>
      <P>Clearly it is possible to draft an amendment which gives a right to the unborn and which also provides that intervention necessary to save the life of a mother need not be unlawful.  For some policy reason a choice was taken not to go along those lines.  I have answered the points raised and I have expressed the effect of the amendment I am proposing.  I am not sponsoring the amendment put forward by Fianna Fáil but that party have failed to deal with the points raised on this side of the House throughout this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one point on which I would agree largely with Deputy Woods.  He expressed the hope that this debate would not become sectarian.  In a small country such as ours it would be regrettable if a debate about something so fundamental were to be sectarian.  However, even something trivial could become sectarian if Churches took opposing views on it or continued to argue on opposing sides.  The debate in question was not sectarian at the beginning but there is grave danger now, if we are not already into that area, that we are approaching a stage where there is a sectarian dimension. I appeal to Deputies on all sides at least from this point forward to cool the situation in that respect so that we may not become involved in a divisive and sectarian debate that would divide the <Col N="2226" /> country in the course of a referendum campaign.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to say that the amendment I am putting forward tonight substitutes completely for the original wording.  What Deputies will be doing when they are voting on my amendment is that they will not only be voting for my amendment but against the words already in the Bill.  It is proposed on this side of the House that that will be the test for one or the other.  We will vote on it in the clear knowledge that we are voting for the amendment I am proposing and, at the same time, voting against the original wording.  Beyond that we do not propose to vote and, depending on what happens in the vote, we will not obstruct the passage of the Bill further.</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy N. Andrews on 26 April 1983:</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann, recognising the seriousness of political repression and disregard <Col N="2239" /> for life which continues to afflict Central America, especially the conflicts within El Salvador and Guatemala and along the Honduran/ Nigaraguan border:</P>
    <P>Expresses concern for the two million people and refugees forced to flee from their homes in El Salvador and Guatemala due to the conflict.</P>
    <P>Condemns the continuing violation of human rights which has resulted in 46,637 dead in El Salvador since 1979.</P>
    <P>Deplores the massacres, abductions, disappearances, tortures, extra-legal executions which are being used in Guatemala particularly against the indigenous population.</P>
    <P>Condemns the failure of the Salvadorean Government to implement the recommendations of the 38th session of the Commission of Human Rights of the UN regarding the upholding of the rule of law and the punishment of members of the security forces and para-military organisations responsible for human rights violations.</P>
    <P>Calls on all States to respect the right of each country in Central America to conduct its own affairs without outside interference and further calls for the suspension of arms supplied to and military support for the countries of the region.</P>
    <P>Urges the Irish Government to continue to play an energetic role at the UN and other appropriate fora to help bring about a peaceful political solution to the problems of Central America and notes the urgency of the situation in the region particularly in Nicaragua and El Salvador.</P>
    <P>Supports all efforts to achieve a dialogue leading to negotiated political solutions in order to establish, in an atmosphere free from terror and intimidation, democratically-elected governments in the region; and <Col N="2240" /> Requests the Irish Government to make available to humanitarian bodies emergency aid to relieve the distress of refugees and the victims of violations.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete sub-paragraphs 5 and 6 and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>Calls on all States to abstain from intervening and to suspend all supplies of arms and military support to the Governments of El Salvador and Guatemala.</P>
    <P>Urges the Irish Government to play an energetic role at the UN to ease the threat of outside intervention and destabilisation of Nicaragua.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>: I want to emphasise that I have put down these amendments to protest against the manner in which this motion was withdrawn in the first place and subsequently changed without my permission.  I have no doubt Deputy N. Andrews was not the person responsible for the unpermitted changes.  Deputy Gregory asked me to say that he did not agree to the changes either and that he supports the amendments I put down restoring the motion to its original form.</P>
      <P>It is essential that this Dáil carries this motion as amended in order to ensure that peace can be restored to the region so that the people of El Salvador can settle their differences between themselves, that the Irish Government would recognise the forces of the people in El Salvador and that they would insist on the United States ending their intervention in Nicaragua.</P>
      <P>I am appalled and shocked at the information that interests alleged to be those of the United States have attempted to influence Deputies to change their position on Central America.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>: After the other debates here today it will be difficult for the House and, perhaps, the people in the Gallery, to re-focus on this debate, which began last night and which Deputy De Rossa resumed today. Recently I met the American Ambassador on a courtesy visit and in the pleasantries that were exchanged he said that when he was being briefed for his job in the State Department he was told one of the issues that was of significant importance in the Irish Republic was Central America.  He had expressed total amazement about what possible connection there could be between Ireland on this side of the Atlantic and Central America, so far away.  They told him in no uncertain terms of the extraordinary connection that has been built up in recent times between the people of Ireland and a number of the States of Central America.</P>
      <P>Tragically for the US, that connection frequently has gone sour in a way most people could not possibly have imagined, as recently as the anti-Vietnam demonstrations in 1966, 1967 and 1968.  In those far off days, when I used to walk around the US Embassy building, there were very few clerics or members of religious orders in the protests.  Now the reverse can be said to be the case.  On one extraordinary occasion there was a protest of dramatic impact substantially organised by people in religious orders of one kind or another.  They laid out in the forecourt of the US Embassy a white cross for each of the people who had been killed in the tragic civil wars in Central America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nobody could accuse those demonstrators of being rash, or irrational, or extremists. They could not be accused of having any party political motivation.  Why should they have selected the American Embassy for that extraordinary manifestation of their concern and their anger? The reason why they did it, and the reason why this motion should be passed here tonight, is because for a variety of misguided reasons the United States Government have seen fit to interfere in the internal affairs of Central America, <Col N="2242" /> with savage consequences for the peoples of those States.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews, Deputy De Rossa and the Minister last night recalled that we are talking about the States of Honduras, Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador, all of which are now in total turmoil, one effectively destabilising the other, all of them being swamped with military hardware when what they need are food and shelter; all of them being advised by military advisers when what they need are civilian advisers to help them to cope with the process of coming justly into the twentieth century.</P>
    <P>As far as the Labour Party are concerned, the equipment is American, the military advisers are American.  Their presence is negative to the lives and the welfare of the peoples who are there. Perhaps it is easy for people like the US Government to know that part of the world better than we can.  They can ask how the Irish Labour Party can say these things, what do we possibly know about a place so far away?  Some weeks ago, the Leader of my Party, the Tánaiste, met the leader of the Sandinista, the liberation movement in El Salvador, now in exile.  That organisation, with others, have an association with the Socialist International to which the Labour Party are affiliated.</P>
    <P>Consistently as a political party in the last five or six years we have been receiving details, substantial reports, from people who are on the ground either within those unfortunate countries or now, tragically, in exile.  In addition, the chairman of my party, Senator Higgins, with Deputy Andrews and other Members of this House, visited Central America. Senator Higgins met President Ortega in Nicaragua.  He spoke to the Council of State of the Government in that country.  I say these things to underline the fact that we speak with a degree of informed knowledge of what is happening on the ground and with a degree of recognition of the role people are playing in that area.  There is no doubt in the minds of the Labour Party International Affairs Committee that the intervention, successful, sustained and prolonged, of the United States in Latin America, <Col N="2243" /> particularly in Central America, is having a disastrous effect on the lives and welfare of all the people there.</P>
    <P>We are asking all groups and individuals, but in particular the US, to disengage from the type of military intervention, covert or overt, that has brought so much havoc, death and destruction in that region, because their intervention is resulting in unbelievable denials of human rights, murders, assassinations, so accurately described by Deputies Andrews and De Rossa last night.  In case what I have said would be misinterpreted as an attack on the US, <i>per se</i>, or that the United States is fundamentally evil in their intentions in that regard, I would point out that they are fundamentally wrong in their analysis of what is happening in Central America.  I will put it in the following way.</P>
    <P>In the corridors around this Chamber we have the images of the signatories of the 1916 Proclamation and of the participants in that struggle.  I put it to the House that if this was Nicaragua in 1982 and those signatories were still alive, they would be in the Sandinista movement, because the struggle that brought that Coalition together in Nicaragua is very similar to the struggle that brought together such diverse personalities as Connolly, the Marxist, and Joseph Mary Plunkett, the Catholic poet-dreamer. That is the span of the spectrum that we recognised in our national liberation coalition in 1916 under the umbrella of Sinn Fein.  That is the span of the coalition that is currently the Executive Council of State in Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I bitterly regret that it may be interpreted from Deputy Barry's statement yesterday, that somehow or other the people of Nicaragua, who had so successfully overthrown the US-supported Somoza regime, having gone through that agony would take on a dictatorship in a new form.  I do not share the American analysis of that revolutionary development in Nicaragua.  My party do not share it nor do many of the people who are intimately involved in Central America in one form or other.</P>
    <P>I should like to acknowledge publicly <Col N="2244" /> the level of awareness which exists among a number of Irish organisations who have played an important part in maintaining links across the Atlantic between political forces here and in Central America.  The tragedy of the American involvement is that arms are being used to kill innocent people, arms which could be turned into very necessary ploughshares, should the American President choose to do so.  If he persists and if the American Government persist in the kind of action in which they have been engaging so far, out of desperation and out of the economic and military counter-insurgency or counter-revolutionary forces they are supporting positively at the moment, they may create the kinds of Governments in those areas to which they are so opposed.</P>
    <P>Our analysis of what is happening in Central America is that it is the natural process for social development which has taken place in this State and in many other States throughout the world.  The struggle for land, which is at the core of much of the civil war within Central America, is identical in many respects to the struggle for land in this State in the past century.  If James Fintan Lawlor and Michael Davitt were alive today, they would be described in <i>Time Magazine</i>, or in <i>Newsweek</i>, or in statements on US policy, as somehow being tools of Moscow.</P>
    <P>Down through the centuries it has been a great tradition for super powers to confuse the legitimate aspirations of the people to better their social conditions with taking sides with another super power to which they are opposed.  On the east coast of this country we have testaments to that analysis, the Martello Towers which appeared to suggest that Ireland would enter into the super-power race with France against England at that time.  That is a false analysis.  America, tragically for itself and for the democratic world, is confusing the two things.  Speaking here tonight officially on behalf of the Labour Party, I should like to request the Americans to take note of what we are saying, the way in which we are saying it, and why we are saying it and not, as happened in the past, to construe our arguments tonight as some form of puerile <Col N="2245" /> anti-Americanism.  That is not the case and our arguments cannot be dismissed in that way.</P>
    <P>It is essential that all the military aid going into these countries should be terminated, all the military aid which is going to repressive Governments.  It is essential that the region is given an opportunity to stabilise itself.  Time does not permit a full exposition of all the factors and various forces involved.  I will not take up much more time.  I understand that other speakers on this side of the House wish to get in.  It is essential that the provision of military aid for the continuation of civil war should be terminated, and that countries which have evolved a popularly supported Government should be allowed a chance to develop and prosper.</P>
    <P>To that extent I support very much the comments made yesterday by the Minister in relation to the Contadora group of Central American countries who have the knowledge and the expertise to try to achieve some kind of cohesion and consensus in that region between the various forces involved.  They can do that only if the spectre of the super-power confrontation is removed from this natural historical and social struggle.  To refuse to do so, and to insist that somehow or other the prelude to the next world war or the ongoing cold war is currently being played in the jungles and the swamps and the favelas of Central America is to condemn those people to a continuation of the extraordinary repression and horror which have been consistently documented.</P>
    <P>They have been documented in a frightening manner on our television screens and in books like &ldquo;Political Killings by Governments&rdquo; published by Amnesty International and in a most graphic manner by Bishop Casey on his return from El Salvador for the funeral of Archbishop Romero.  This is no figment of our imagination.  This is no science fiction horror picture which we are describing from afar.  It is happening now.  It can stop, provided a collective international effort is made.</P>
    <P>It is our aspiration and our hope that as a Government, as a Parliament and as <Col N="2246" /> a people, with whatever leverage we have with a country for whose people we have the utmost regard and affection, and with whom over many years of history the people of Ireland have had an extraordinary link to the extent that 40 million people in the United States now claim some Irish connection or descent, we can persuade them to see that this is a valid criticism we are making of their super-power actions in Central America.  Such criticism is not in any way to be confused with antagonism or a negativism which might be attributed to States in other parts of the world.</P>
    <P>It would be a great tragedy for Central America, for the prospects of peace and for the relationship between us and the United States if the current President, who has not been shy about referring to his Irish antecedents and ancestors, would not recognise that the horrible poverty from which his ancestors fled this island over 100 years ago is the same horrible poverty which the Sandanistas and the FDR in El Salvador and elsewhere are trying to eliminate today.  That is the connection.  That is the historical continuum in which this struggle is being carried on.  For that reason the Labour Party support the motion.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to what appears to have happened, or what is reported in today's papers regarding the alteration of the motion.  We had no involvement in that.  The party Whip, Deputy Taylor, who agreed to the original motion was away when alterations were made.  I would be worried if the amendment in the name of Deputy De Rossa were to be accepted, particularly where it refers to &ldquo;all States&rdquo;.  It calls on all States to abstain from intervening and to suspend all supplies of arms and military support to the Governments of El Salvador and Guatemala.  That amendment does not include Honduras.  I am worried about the words &ldquo;all States&rdquo;.  They could be used by the United States to suggest they are not the only people involved in this exercise, and that other States are directly involved and giving direct assistance in the manner described.  That would be a mistake and, for that reason, <Col N="2247" /> we are not prepared to accept that amendment.</P>
    <P>Somewhere in the <i>demarche</i> the Oireachtas should request the Government to take at the appropriate venue&mdash;obviously the United Nations and the human rights forum within that organisation is the area where it could be done &mdash; we would like to see the following included: that there would be a call for the involvement of the FDR-FMLN as a representative voice of the Opposition in tandem with the Government of El Salvador. Both should be involved in any discussions that would lead towards a political solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>This is something we can influence directly by our political involvement in the United Nations and by our special relationship with the people of the United States.  We are speaking from the point of view of our own people who have direct knowledge of the situation, to whom I referred at the outset of my contribution. These people were here in Ireland and returned to those countries. They know that what is going on is wrong and they know that a motion like this and decisive Government action can make a positive contribution towards a peaceful solution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will be very brief in my contribution as I understand Deputy Owen wishes to speak also.  My main reason for intervening in the debate is to pay tribute to the memory of a great lady whom I had the honour of meeting with a number of my colleagues in Setanta Building some time ago.  I refer to Maria Elena Garcia.  If nothing else, my intervention should be seen as a tribute to a brave woman who died in the cause of freedom and for the beliefs she held very dear.  I understand her message was one of peace and was a call for a peaceful solution to the dreadful tragedy now afflicting her people.  If for no other reason than that I consider it a privilege to contribute to this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned that this should not be seen as a United States-bashing session.  I have the deepest respect for the <Col N="2248" /> people of the United States and I have the greatest respect for their democracy and their institutions.  I have been in their country on a number of occasions and have accepted their hospitality.  There is no doubt they are a great people and the world owes them much.  Having got that out of the way, I think it important to condemn without reservation the involvement of the American administration in El Salvador.  There is no doubt that they are propping up a military regime which is intellectually and morally corrupt and which is corrupting the whole body politic in the El Salvador area with a ripple effect into other countries in Central America.  That unfortunate involvement by the American Government in Central America, and in El Salvador in particular, is a tragedy for the American people.  I understood yesterday that the American Congress had refused arms and military aid to El Salvador. That reflects a changing opinion among American people because public representatives take note of what their constituents are saying.  That is a good development.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Niall Andrews and Deputy De Rossa for putting down this motion.  Sometimes people think the Dáil has no relevance but this kind of motion expressing concern for our fellow human beings in other parts of the world is obviously relevant. This debate is relevant, meaningful and concerned and for this I am grateful.  I consider it a privilege to have participated in the debate and, as a matter of courtesy to Deputy Owen, I will conclude my contribution.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should like to thank Deputy David Andrews for allowing me these few minutes to speak.  I should like to put on record for the benefit of those people who are taking an interest in this debate in the public gallery or who may read the debate afterwards, that many Deputies on this side of the House, and I am sure this applies also on the Fianna Fáil side, would like to have taken part in the debate.  This country has taken a vital interest in the troubles in Central America, in Third World countries and <Col N="2249" /> in many other victimised countries.  It is important to state that Deputies such as Deputy Molony, Deputy Barnes, Deputy Manning and Deputy Shatter came to me today to inquire if there would be time for them to participate in the debate. They knew I was involved in the debate and I said I would indicate to the House that they were interested in speaking but were not able to do so.</P>
      <P>We tend to get wrapped up in our own problems.  In the past few weeks politics has been a live issue.  Matters such as PRSI and PAYE marches, social welfare payments and so on have taken our attention in recent times.  At times we may question matters such as the freedom of the press, freedom to appeal cases to the courts and freedom of many of our systems but I say many millions of people would dearly love to experience the freedoms we enjoy.  All of these freedoms and rights are an indication that a democratic process is in operation in a country. A courts system and media that are workable and that are seen to be honest and incorruptible are rights that many of our fellow human beings do not enjoy.</P>
      <P>This country has a long historic connection with Central and South America through our missionaries.  For most of us as we grew up, Central America was a rather romantic sounding place, enjoying fine weather and holding Mardi Gras processions.  However, the Central America of today is not a happy or joyful place in which to live.  Being a refugee is not a joy.  There are in excess of 500,000 refugees from Guatemala and close to one million refugees living outside El Salvador who cannot return to their country because of the regime and the fear and danger to their lives.  Life for refugees is far from pleasant.  Recently I visited the Philippines and I saw how millions of human beings live in dire poverty that we will never experience.  That is the kind of life experienced by these refugees.  Even worse is the lack of freedom to return to live in one's own country.  As long as regimes exist as they do in some of the countries in Central America people will be displaced.  They will not have the freedom to work in their own country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Geographically Ireland is very small <Col N="2250" /> but in direct proportion to its size it has got far more power than larger countries. That is because we are a neutral country, we have a history that links us to Central America and a history of living for 800 years under the domination of another power.  That creates a bond with some of those countries.  That is why people who have worked in Central America and who have returned here have found a willing people throughout Ireland who will listen, try to aid their fellow human beings and highlight the lack of human rights, injustices, killings, detentions without trial, imprisonments of union leaders and others &mdash; the list is endless.  It is because of our bond with these countries that our power and the role which we must play are heightened and enlarged.  I should like to see us continuing to play that role. It would be wrong to say that we have not taken a forward-looking stand and an interest in what is going on.  I urge the Minister and all Members of this House in whatever way they can to continue to take that interest and highlight the problems of these countries.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the role of the United States in Central America and I must agree with much of what was said.  However, it would be naive to think that if the United States were to withdraw all their military power and support from these countries the problems would go away.  None of us thinks that would happen.  We talk about meaningful dialogue, but the parties participating in that dialogue should be able to sit down safely at the negotiating table without fear of their lives and, equally, if one section has might far beyond the other sections it is unrealistic for the United States or any other Government to believe that they can, as the American Secretary of State has said, face two related challenges, to alleviate longstanding political, economic and social problems in Central America and to have a meaningful dialogue in the hope of bringing about political solutions.  That cannot be done unless all the parties making up the country take part in that political dialogue.  One may not always like what they are doing, or always agree with it, but if they are part and parcel of what <Col N="2251" /> makes up that country and are fighting for a section of that population, those people must take part in the dialogue, if it is to have any meaning.</P>
    <P>I welcome, as the Minister and other speakers do, the role of the Contadora peace initiatives in Mexico, Colombia, Panama and Venezuela, which respects the right of individual countries to manage their own affairs without external pressure or external influences which add to their problems and do not help the people to face their problems, accept what they are and try to solve them.</P>
    <P>My appeal tonight is, first, to remind the United States Government that might is not always right, and that the bigger the power the bigger the responsibility to use that power properly.  The United States, which is acknowledged to be a great country &mdash; and I would join with other speakers in saying that this is not a bashing of the United States &mdash; has not used power properly in many areas.  It is up to countries like ours not to be afraid to tell President Reagan and the United States that they have a responsibility, that they are using their power and might in a way which is making human beings suffer.  Until they accept that that is the net result of pouring many millions of dollars of military aid into Central America, they are not facing up to their responsibilities. They must face their own people with the knowledge that they have power without responsibility.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that any group, whether religious or ordinary peasants trying to fight for a bit of land, are automatically branded, as the norm, as communist, Marxist and so forth.  That is not the case.  I have visited groups in the Philippines who are being called communists and Marxists.  They are ordinary human beings belonging to a community who are trying to live their lives better and get some semblance of human rights. There are not reds under every bed of every group that try to make their lives a little better.  They are not communists. If this blindness is eradicated from the treatment of these people, we may begin to see some semblance of humanity in the <Col N="2252" /> policies coming from the United States. This humanity is lacking at the moment.</P>
    <P>Finally, I thank those speakers who made it possible for me to contribute to this debate.  I urge our Minister and our country to continue to use their influence and power to ensure that when we are all dead and gone no historian will write about us &mdash; as was done about another leader many centuries ago &mdash; that we fiddled while Rome burned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>: First, I want to thank all those who participated in the debate and those who gave me moral support within my own and the other political parties &mdash; the Labour Party, the Workers' Party and Fine Gael.  We had some difficulty in getting this motion on to the floor of the House.  I have been told by the US Embassy only an hour ago that they did not in any way bring pressure to bear.  I want to put that on the record of the House, for a change.  Pressure certainly was brought to bear to try to ensure that this motion would not be debated here and the mystery still remains.</P>
      <P>We live on an island and sometimes we are so concerned about our own problems that we cannot grasp the reality of the world today, which is that 800 million people go to bed hungry, without shelter, without any form of relief, without any hope for the future.  This is an enormous and appalling statistic.  The chances of these people ever obtaining a decent life are further diminished by the history of the development of the regions in Central America, with the exploitation of these people by the multinationals and transnationals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a proud record on humanitarian aid and on human rights.  Members of this House from all political parties have taken a very strong interest in other countries, beginning with the League of Nations where De Valera made a very great impact for this country and &mdash; while some may be a little cynical about it &mdash; Frank Aiken, who took a great interest in the development of the United Nations.  We had Garret Fitzgerald and Michael O'Kennedy and, as recently as the last Coalition Government, Senator Jim Dooge who took an enlightened <Col N="2253" /> approach to Central America, to overseas development aid, human rights and humanitarian aid.</P>
    <P>We had here from the Minister for Foreign Affairs last evening a speech that sets this country back 20 or 30 years in those developments in international affairs.  The Minister made an enormous error in the type of speech he presented to this House yesterday.  So backward-thinking was the speech made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday that I am concerned about the future of Irish neutrality with this Minister as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I am concerned about how he will be influenced in international fora he will be attending on behalf of the Government and our people.  As a member of the Council of Europe I have been put under considerable pressure by various groups, committees and lobbies to discuss questions of NATO, military alliances, and that as an individual.  What then will happen to the Minister when matters of this kind arise at international fora?</P>
    <P>I might quote from the Minister's speech where he said:</P>
    <P>The overthrow of the Somoza regime and the victory of the Sandinista movement in Nicaragua in 1979 marks, perhaps, the most significant political event in that country's history. Once in power, the Sandinista movement promised that free elections would be held and that Nicaragua would be a pluralist society.  Events in and around Nicaragua have since led to the declaration of a state of emergency there with adverse effects on political freedom such as the imposition of censorship.</P>
    <P>That comes from a Minister for Foreign Affairs whom I would assume is informed.  He is talking about political censorship in a country that has suffered for 45 years under the most appalling dictator, a man called Somoza, whose murder, rape and robbery of the people of that country was an appalling performance &mdash; the robbery of a whole nation &mdash; I cannot speak about the atrocities that man perpetrated.  Then, the Sandinistas come up, they overthrow Somoza. <Col N="2254" /> Sixty thousand people died in the battle to overthrow Somoza and he fled.  What do we have now?  We have censorship. We have on the Honduras/Nicaragua border the CIA supplying money to Somoza followers who are destabilising the country with the hope of starving the Sandinistas into surrender.  But they are not being offered any alternative.  There is no other structure there to take the place of the Sandinistas, who have participated in the literacy scheme, who have built schools, provided education and health aids for these people.  How can a Minister in a democratic free state, make such a statement?  The Minister for Foreign Affairs went on to say that the elections there had been postponed.  Britain did not have elections during the Second World War; they were under attack. Does the Minister know that?  Does he know the history of war?  It was an appalling speech, sir, and one with which I hope this House will never again be confronted.</P>
    <P>Lest the House think I am overstating the case or that I am becoming a little emotional about this, let me say that the American Congress has come from passive acceptance of the American Administration's aid to El Salvador, to Nicaragua, to Guatemala, to defeat Presidential certification for more military aid to El Salvador and actually stopped the CIA from providing more funds for them. Are we suddenly to be confronted with a situation in which the American Congress are to be described now as Marxist-Leninists?  As Deputy Owen has said, are these people supposed to be destabilising the situation in Washington? The conclusion is self-evident.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs either does not care or is simply not sufficiently interested to read some of the reports available to United States Congressmen.  I want to read two extracts from evidence given before the Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs of the Committee on Foreign Affairs House of Representatives by a former Ambassador to El Salvador, Mr. White.  This evidence appears under the heading of &ldquo;Exchange of Military Assistance for Economic&rdquo; and reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2255" /> Mr. White.  It is absolutely true. Take the money that we are putting into the training of Salvadoreans, the whole military sphere, you know, have a new policy and put that money into economic and social assistance, into elected governments, and we would be out of this mess in a matter of a few years.</P>
    <P>But if you are intent on proving how macho you are in Central America and can, you know, kill just one hell of a lot of people then of course you are gradually and very rapidly going to lose not only El Salvador, but Guatemala and probably Honduras too.</P>
    <P>The other quote from these hearings &mdash; and I know my time is rapidly running out&mdash;appears under the heading &ldquo;Leftist Victory in El Salvador&rdquo; and reads:</P>
    <P>Mr. White: I do not believe that the security of the United States is so finely balanced, as opposed to, you know, that with the Soviet Union, whether El Salvador goes one way or another temporarily is of that great consequence. I think that whatever combination of forces of the left take over in El Salvador, it will be possible for this Government to work with them.</P>
    <P>It would be better for the United States if those leftists did not take over. But it would be an error of the first magnitude to put US troops into El Salvador.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, of course, they did.  As Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, mentioned earlier, a parliamentary delegation went to El Salvador in January of last year.  We met some of the finest people, by the way not in El Salvador because there we were not given the opportunity &mdash; we were locked up in armed jeep and driven around to various places to be given the line from Duarte to General Garcia.  But in Nicaragua we met some of the finest people I have ever had the honour and privilege of meeting. I would suggest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and to anybody else who doubts me to take the opportunity to go <Col N="2256" /> out and see the magnificent work they have done for those people.</P>
    <P>Despite the fact that we experienced some difficulty in getting this motion before the House I am glad it has and once again has afforded us an opportunity of speaking our minds on what is the situation in Central America, to try and appeal to our American friends, to appeal to Mr. Schultz, Mr. Enders and Mr. Reagan, and all those who care to listen, that there is an opportunity here for the American Government to bring about a negotiated solution.  Everybody who has any knowledge of the area realises that that is the only answer to it, a negotiated solution with all the forces there.  Do not let anybody say to me that the left&mdash;as we might interpret it sometimes in a rather conservative society &mdash; is something of a Marxist-Leninist communist plot.  It is not; it is not in El Salvador and it is not in Guatemala.  Ten thousand Indians murdered since Rios Montt came in as President and suspended all civil rights in Guatemala; 46,000 people murdered in three years in El Salvador.  We are talking here about human rights.</P>
    <P>I want to say finally: please, America, leave Nicaragua alone, leave El Salvador alone, leave Guatemala alone.  Instead of sending guns and arms of destruction to lunatic dictators, send aid, send food, send books.</P>
    <P>Finally I want to thank those groups outside this House throughout this country who have contacted me, the El Salvador Human Rights Group and the other people who have shown a specific interest.  All of these magnificent people are making a contribution in many ways to bringing about a resolution of the problem.  I trust we can now circulate the information and the record to those Governments who are interested, but particularly to the Americans.  Perhaps the Minister would take note of what is happening in these regions.</P>

      <P>: Since the oil crisis in 1979, the Office of Public Works have been especially active in endeavouring to conserve energy in the heating and lighting of Government establishments for which they are responsible. As a result of these efforts oil consumption was reduced by approximately 12½ per cent and 10½ per cent in the years 1980 and 1981 respectively, compared <Col N="2086" /> with 1979.  Reductions of approximately 1 per cent in 1980 and 4 per cent in 1981 in solid fuel consumption were achieved.</P>
      <P>Figures for electricity consumption are not readily available but details of the expenditure incurred indicate that there was no great variation in electricity consumption in 1980 and 1981.

    <P>When the development control plan for this hospital was being drawn up it provided for a first phase development accommodating the catering department, theatres, the central sterile supply department and an intensive care unit. The inclusion of these departments in the proposed first phase of the development presumably indicated the health board's priorities at that time.  The recent proposals, however, indicate that a different set of priorities has emerged.  In these circumstances I feel that the development control plan should be reviewed to take account of the changed views of the board and to allow a more flexible response to the limited capital resources which are available.</P>

      <P>:  The person concerned, whose husband died on 23 November 1982, claimed a widow's contributory pension on 13 January 1983 but her claim was refused as her late husband did not have sufficient insurance contributions to qualify her for such pension.  She has been notified accordingly.</P>

It is open to him to appeal against the disallowance.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The post-primary needs of the hearing impaired children are catered for separately within St. Joseph's Special School <Col N="2148" /> for hearing impaired boys and St. Mary's Special School for hearing impaired girls. A recommendation that &ldquo;The Irish Christian Brothers and the Dominican Sisters co-operate in the establishment and management of a co-educational post-primary school&rdquo; was made in a report published in 1972 on &ldquo;The Education of Children who are handicapped by Impaired Hearing&rdquo;.  In the course of an informal discussion in the mid-seventies the Dominican Sisters indicated their willingness to offer a site for a community school type provision.  No formal proposals in this regard, however, were received by my Department.  In view of recent representations I am arranging to have the matter further examined.</P>
