      <P>In a week like this when the order is outlined for the sitting until midnight it is almost impossible for me to find a more appropriate way of raising the issue.

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a short Bill the purpose of which is to enable a housing authority, at their discretion, in assessing housing needs to take account of persons resident outside the authority's functional area and also to build houses for and to let houses to such persons.  By so empowering housing authorities it will overcome the difficulties and confusion that have arisen in relation to the letting of some local authority houses and the transfer of certain tenancies following the Supreme Court judgment in the case of McNamee <Col N="1977" /> versus Buncrana Urban District Council (Reference 117 &mdash; 1983) which ruled that the council are not entitled to house people who are not resident in the functional area of the council.  In the case in question the plaintiffs, who were applicants for a house in a scheme provided by Buncrana UDC, sought a declaration that the council were acting <i>ultra vires</i> in purporting to allocate houses to persons residing outside the council's functional area.  The High Court granted the declaration sought on 8 March 1983.  This judgment was appealed to the Supreme Court by Buncrana UDC but the appeal was not upheld and the decision of the High Court was confirmed by the Supreme Court on 30 June 1983.</P>
    <P>In considering the case the Supreme Court had regard, in particular, to the provisions of sections 53, 55 and 60 of the Housing Act, 1966.  Section 53 places a duty on housing authorities to assess, at least every five years, the accumulated and prospective housing needs of their functional areas.  Section 55 imposes a further duty on authorities to prepare a building programme having regard to the housing needs of their functional area and taking account of certain statutory objectives.  Section 60 obliges authorities to make a scheme of letting priorities for the letting of houses having regard to certain statutory primary objectives. These primary objectives relate mainly to the elimination of unfitness and overcrowding and the housing of persons in need of housing who cannot afford to provide it for themselves.  In delivering the judgment the Chief Justice said in relation to these provisions:</P>
    <P>In my view, it is quite clear that these various duties and obligations so imposed on housing authorities, applied to each housing authority in relation to its own functional area, and, having regard to the housing needs of that particular area.</P>
    <P>Concluding the judgment the Chief Justice went on to say:</P>
    <P>I do not think the Buncrana Urban District Council are entitled to house <Col N="1978" /> people who are not resident in its functional area.  The duty of the Buncrana Urban District Council is to allocate the houses, which they have provided, in accordance with a scheme of priorities which enables them to house suitable applicants who fit within the designated categories and who reside or are domiciled within the functional area of the council.</P>
    <P>As interpreted by the Supreme Court, sections 53, 55 and 60 of the 1966 Act would put undesirable restrictions on individual local authorities in the execution of their functions in assessing housing needs and in the building and letting of houses.  The sections would hinder housing authorities in entering into mutually advantageous arrangements between themselves for the housing of applicants in a particular locality in the most speedy, economical and convenient way possible and give undue importance to the sometimes random effects of local boundaries on the rehousing prospects of needy families.  They would also cause difficulties for the inter-transfer of tenants between housing authorities, and could, in some circumstances, conceivably be construed as placing restrictions on the making by a local authority of loans for the purchase or building of houses.  Furthermore, it is right and proper that comprehensive assessments of the future housing needs of any particular area should be able to take account, and provide for, any anticipated migration from outside the area.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, satisfied that there is an urgent need to amend the provisions of the 1966 Act which have given rise to the kind of problems and anomalies I have mentioned, especially as there are, at present, a number of new housing schemes at completion stage around the country that were specifically provided to meet the needs of particular areas straddling local boundaries.</P>
    <P>The present Bill makes it clear that a housing authority is enabled, to such extent, if any, as they consider appropriate, to have regard to persons residing outside the area of the authority in the assessment of housing needs and in the <Col N="1979" /> building and letting of houses.  This is being done in the most straightforward manner possible by simply providing explicit powers in the three sections concerned enabling a housing authority&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to have regard to, in assessing the housing requirements of their functional area under section 53, the prospective demand for housing from persons residing outside the area who are likely for any reason to come into the area;</P>
    <P>(b) to have as an additional objective, in preparing their building programme under section 55, the provision of houses for persons residing outside their functional area; and</P>
    <P>(c) to have as an additional primary objective, in making a scheme of letting priorities under section 60, the provision of houses for persons residing outside their functional area who are seeking accommodation within the area and who are not in a position to provide it from their own resources.</P>
    <P>I should stress that these are enabling provisions and that the extent, if any, to which they are used by any housing authority is entirely at the discretion of that authority.  They do not compel a housing authority who decide otherwise to have regard to persons outside their functional area.  Basically, this Bill seeks to do no more than restore the position to what it was widely considered to be prior to the Supreme Court judgment. These new provisions are being given retrospective effect to remove any doubts about the validity of any past actions taken in good faith by housing authorities.</P>
    <P>On a more general note, I should say that there is now a need for a more fundamental review of Part III of the Housing Act, 1966, which relates to the provision and management of local authority dwellings and which includes the three sections now being amended.  I intend to proceed as quickly as possible with this review and the formulation of legislative proposals.  These proposals, which I <Col N="1980" /> intend to bring forward next year, will also contain measures to deal with the issue of homelessness.</P>
    <P>However, the object of this Bill could not await the more extensive proposals I have just mentioned.  I am satisfied that the problems flowing from the Supreme Court judgment are such as to require immediate amending legislation to restore the position.  Action on these lines has been sought by a number of local authorities and by Deputies from all sides.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Teachta Liam Kavanagh as ucht a phost nua mar Aire Comhshaoil, agus tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh maith le feiceáil ar an obair a bheas ar siúl aige sa Roinn sin.  Cinnte tabharfaimid cibé cabhair is féidir linn dó agus cuirfimid in iúl dó na heasnaimh a bheas ann de réir mar a théann an t-am thart.</P>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to extend my personal congratulations and those of my party to Deputy Liam Kavanagh on his appointment as Minister for the Environment and to wish him success in his new Ministry.  I assure him of our full co-operation in the interests of the people we both serve in this Parliament. I assure him also that we shall continue to remind him of any needs existing to which we feel he may not be giving adequate attention.</P>
      <P>In regard to the Bill before the House I want to make it clear at the outset that we support it as we recognise the serious difficulties that would obtain if effect were to be given in each local authority area to the Supreme Court ruling that only those actually residing in a local authority's functional area were to be considered for housing.  As the House knows, it has been the practice to consider also those who work in an authority's functional area.  As happened in the Buncrana case, which came before the courts, others outside the functional area of a local authority have been housed where it was deemed that a genuine housing need existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my view the 1966 Housing Act has worked very successfully and achieved <Col N="1981" /> many of the aims expressed by Deputy Blaney when introducing the Bill to the House in the mid-sixties.  At that time it constituted a major advance in social legislation here, enabling local authorities to plan their housebuilding programmes to meet the housing needs of our people in an efficient and realistic way.</P>
    <P>Having said that I believe that, after 17 years in operation now it must surely be opportune to review the operation of all housing legislation.  I am pleased that the Minister referred to this in the course of his introductory remarks.  But I would remind him that his predecessors also made similar references but that there has been no concrete evidence of the results of any such deliberations within this Department.  I understand that his predecessor promised to publish a White Paper on housing.  I urge the Minister to come forward with such a White Paper at the earliest possible opportunity.  It must be remembered that we have a growing population consisting of a very high proportion of young people, that we have housing needs which will constitute an even greater problem in ensuing years unless positive action is taken now.  Farsighted though it was, the Housing Bill introduced by Deputy Blaney in 1966 could not possibly be expected to cater for the housing needs of our people into the eighties and nineties.  Therefore, an obligation rests on the Minister to ensure that serious thought is given to the planning of our legislation and Government action with regard to taking positive steps to meet the real housing needs obtaining at present and which will continue to be exacerbated unless positive action is taken to deal with them.</P>
    <P>I do not believe it was the intention of the Oireachtas at the time Deputy Blaney introduced that Bill that its provisions should be interpreted in the narrow fashion of the Supreme Court ruling.  The strict legal provisions of that Act which that court has now determined would greatly inhibit housing officers exercising their discretion in allocating tenancies in their local authority areas.  It is my belief that practically all houses have been allocated to persons who did reside in the functional area of each local authority <Col N="1982" /> and that, where the opposite occurred, it was very much the exception and indeed for very good, practical reasons.</P>
    <P>With the expansion of major urban areas there is no doubt but that we have now reached a situation in which the boundaries of each local authority which, in 1966, seemed very real, clear definable boundaries, do not now have the same significance, as was mentioned by the Minister in the course of his remarks.  We cannot allow our housing authorities to be confined merely to the existence of a formal dividing line between theirs and an adjoining authority because of the spill-over of urban areas into other local authority areas.  At all times there must be very close co-operation between adjoining housing authorities.</P>
    <P>The practice to date has been that common sense has prevailed, that there has been a very high degree of co-operation between officials of adjoining local authority areas.  This case was brought forward very much to the surprise of those charged with implementing the provisions of the 1966 Act, as it had been taken as the spirit of the Act that no such restriction existed.  However, this House must take heed of the deliberations of the Supreme Court and we are happy to support the provision.  I am very pleased that the Minister emphasised that this Bill merely provides enabling provisions and will not place any great obligation on housing authorities &mdash; at least that is my interpretation of what the Minister said &mdash; to grant equal priority to people who reside outside their functional area.  At all times the housing official charged with making the allocations must be allowed exercise his discretion and common sense in determining where the greatest need exist and in determining the greatest priorities, within the scheme of priorities as laid down and approved by his local authority.</P>
    <P>The officials who during the years have been charged with the making of decisions on allocations have a very important and difficult role to perform.  To my knowledge they have exercised their duties in a fair and just manner, displaying wisdom and practical commonsense.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1983" /> If in future they are to be confined to operate within the strict terms of the Supreme Court decision I do not think it will add any improvements, because it will restrict unnecessarily the choices open to them when they come to make new tenancies.</P>
    <P>It is a pity the Supreme Court had to become involved in a case of this kind. Probably it would have been wiser to allow the commonsense of housing officers to decide the real priorities.  On balance, it has been the experience of all Deputies that these functions have been carried out in a fair and just manner by housing officers over the years.</P>
    <P>The 1966 Housing Act provides that each local authority are obliged to carry out regular assessments of the housing needs in their area.  This information is made available to the Minister when he comes to decide Government strategy in relation to housing needs.  I would draw the Minister's attention to a recently published NESC report &ldquo;Housing Requirements and Population Change, 1981-1991&rdquo;. It projects that annual housing requirements will average 30,000.  It must be clear to all sides in the House that this Government are not committed to a housing programme that would meet those needs, despite the statement by the former Minister for the Environment, Deputy Spring, that it was the intention of his Government to build 30,000 houses per year.  That is the figure deemed to be the required number of new house completions to meet the needs of our expanding population.</P>
    <P>However, we see from a recent reply in the Dáil by Deputy Spring that the number of new house completions in 1983 will number only 25,600, 4,400 below the stated target and the stated housing needs.  I urge the new Minister for the Environment to make greater efforts in the house building area than his predecessor did.  I can go back to ten years ago and recall that when I was in office the total number of new house completions in 1973 was 24,000.  It seems no great progress has been made in the intervening years if in 1983 our new house completions will number only 1,600 more <Col N="1984" /> than in 1973.  Other Governments have been in office in the meantime, but I am very pleased that my party succeeded in reaching a new house completion programme of 28,917 in 1981.</P>
    <P>Why has there been this dramatic drop in new house completions since 1981, at a time when there has been an escalation in the demand and the need?  The Minister has an obligation under the 1966 Act, in section 53, to which he referred this morning in his speech.  He and his predecessor have not fulfilled that obligation and the local authorities cannot be charged with failure to meet the housing needs of their areas if those who are responsible for funding the local authorities have not provided adequate finance to enable them to undertake those programmes. All of us know that the housing programmes undertaken by individual local authorities are determined completely by the action of the Minister for the Environment through financial allocations. It is not good enough for the Labour Party in Government, those who had been so critical when they sat in Opposition, to fail in regard to this great social need.  If any area required great Labour input it is in regard to housing, but it is clear they have failed miserably to establish an adequate house building programme to meet the needs of our people.</P>
    <P>There is no greater tragedy that could befall any family than not to have a roof over their heads and a warm comfortable house to live in, without being extravagant or expensive.  Week after week Deputies in their constituencies come across tragic cases of people living in deplorable conditions, not for weeks or months but for long periods, because the local authorities have not been able to keep up with the housing demand in their areas.  Local authorities are not just confined to providing housing in their functional areas.  We are now extending the obligations in regard to people living outside the local authority functional areas.</P>
    <P>There has been miserable failure in recent years to meet the housing needs, and the burden falling on local authorities in this regard will increase with the operation of this Act.  At the commencement <Col N="1985" /> of his new duties in the Department of the Environment it would be wise for Deputy Kavanagh to examine carefully all the studies which we have been told have been carried out on housing matters in the Department.  We have heard about work being done on the preparation of a White Paper.  The level of this work has been fairly extensive, and I hope he will come forward in the near future with the White Paper.  I hope it will be a realistic document setting out in stark terms what the needs and the costs are and what the programme will be to meet those needs and to provide finance to cater for those needs.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister that in the Estimates prepared by the Government there are two important items, one dealing with the money provided for private house grants in 1984.  The figure is £18.4 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been considering whether this is relevant and I have my doubts about it.  This Bill deals with a net point, to remedy the position arising from the Supreme Court decision. I have doubts as to whether a discussion on housing in general would be in order. It is not, and certainly a discussion on grants for new houses in the private sector would not be in order.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>So be it.  May I make a final passing reference to the question of grants?  The amount provided in 1984 for private house grants should be £20 million and £240 million should be provided for local authority housing.  I want to suggest to the Minister that because his leader and the Tánaiste have stated that, if 30,000 houses are to be achieved, the 1984 Estimate must provide substantially increased sums.  If that is not done we will have a further drop in the number of houses being built.  There has already been a substantial drop this year from the 1981 figure.  If the Government are serious about achieving targets and meeting housing needs there will have to be an increase in the moneys being provided. There must be at least £20 million provided for private house grants and at least £240 million for local authority housing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, I have to agree with Deputy Molloy as to what may be discussed.  Surely when we are talking about the needs of people for houses and local authorities being enabled to provide those houses it is relevant to raise those matters under this Bill.  Before finally ruling would the Chair consider carefully what is mentioned in the Bill, because the Minister made reference to his plans and the need for a fundamental review of the Housing Acts? Surely this is the most appropriate Bill <Col N="1987" /> now to discuss local authority housing and the need for such housing and how the problem is being handled throughout the country.  Deputies may have suggestions which would improve the Bill and, in doing so, it would be essential to make wider references.</P>

The Chair has to have regard to what this Bill is all about, and it is not about housing in general.  It is amending the law following a decision of the High Court concerning a net point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would emphasise that at least £20 million must be provided for private house grants and at least £240 million for local authority housing capital.</P>
      <P>Section 55 of the 1966 Act is also being amended.  This requires each local authority to prepare a building programme. I cannot see how this could be out of order since the sections we are dealing with are the kernel of the whole housing movement.  All local authority housing development is governed by these Acts and the financial allocations will determine the rate.  It is also important that policy should provide for equity in the distribution of access to the financial aids for housing, a greater choice and diversity in house types and tenure, and policy in regard to the rehabilitation of older houses.  I think a much more elaborate scheme of house improvement grants is required if we are to maintain the existing housing stock when one considers the high costs of building houses today.  Local authority houses are costing the State by way of subsidy&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Chair's ruling, but I want to make some suggestions to the Minister.  He should bear in mind the question of urban renewal and development. These are of great importance.  It is something to which the Minister should give special attention.  There is also the question of a better mix of private and public housing on new estates.  Greater mobility should be encouraged.</P>
      <P>Section 5 refers to the making or amending of a scheme of letting priorities under section 60 of the 1966 Act.  There is an area of neglect here.  The Minister referred to the need for more provision where homeless persons are concerned and suggested he would deal with this later on in another Bill.  I am disappointed to find he did not avail of the opportunity presented by this Bill to write in a section or else clarify the question of the exclusion of homeless people from consideration by housing authorities when they come to create new tenancies. The present position is an absolute disgrace.  I congratulate the Simon Community and Senator Brendan Ryan on the marvellous efforts they have made to highlight the scandal, and I regret very much that no consideration is being given to this category in this Bill.  Other categories are also affected.  We are extending certain categories and still we continue to exclude most needy sections.  I am referring to single people seeking housing.  I refer to the one person applicant, to the people who have fallen on hard times.  Still another category is the unmarried mother.  That is a problem causing concern to public representatives. Housing authorities are unable to provide accommodation for unmarried mothers who wish to keep their babies. There is a disgraceful situation in my town where once the children leave the hospital there is no official accommodation where they can seek shelter or can hope to establish a home.</P>

This House does not get too many opportunities to discuss housing legislation and I am suggesting that the House should also consider now extension to another needy category in our community.  It has always been the practice in debating legislation here that one should not be confined merely to what the Minister wants to do.  There has always been a duty and an obligation on Opposition spokespersons and Deputies to highlight other needs of which the Minister may not be aware or may not be catering for in the legislation he is bringing forward at any particular time.  All the Official Reports of debates in Dáil Éireann will show that debate has never been confined to the Minister's proposal only or that other suggestions were not allowable in the course of the debate.  It would be reducing debate to a useless exercise if we were merely to rubber stamp.  We could put down amendments to the Bill, and we want to do so, but how can we do so if we are not allowed to discuss in advance the type of improvements we would suggest?

      <P>We believe there are these other areas where this need exists.  I have mentioned some of them.  I am disappointed that the Minister is not doing something in regard to the homeless in this case.</P>
      <P>I would hope that the Ceann Comhairle would not stop me from calling on the Minister to give the House a full explanation of the existing law which has been interpreted as excluding local authorities from having any responsibility for housing the homeless and leaving homeless persons as the responsibility of health boards who provide only institutional or hostel type accommodation, which does not meet the real personal needs of the majority of the homeless.  I would urge the Minister to avail of this Bill to amend the law in this respect.</P>
      <P>The debate has been very confined by the Ceann Comhairle.  I do not wish to continue to transgress his ruling.  I do not agree with ruling but I have to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could I ask the Minister one or two questions?  The first question is: will a person resident in a foreign country have the same right under this new Bill to be considered for housing as a person who is permanently resident in this country? Up to now, as the House understands and as the court ruled, the local authority could consider only persons residing in their functional area.  Now the Bill extends the category of persons to persons resident outside the functional area. This extension does not seem to be confined to residents in the State.  As we know, as a result of our sad history of emigration, there is a large flow of persons born in this country who have roots in this country moving from other countries <Col N="1993" /> to this country.  Many of our people reside in England.  Many of them seek to return home and often make application to local authorities in this country before they make a move to be housed by the local authority.  In many cases they have been housed in England by a local authority at the time of their application. I would like the Minister to clarify whether such persons will receive equal priority with persons who have been residing permanently in this country.  The practical application of the scheme of letting priorities, as I understand it, has not given very high priority to persons who are not residing in the functional area at the time they made the application. Indeed, many local authorities insisted that they would not approve an application unless the person was residing in the functional area.  That restriction is now being removed.  The extension does not seem to confine consideration to residents in this country.  I would ask the Minister to refer to that when replying.</P>
    <P>Naturally, in the whole area of housing there are many matters of very great interest but the Chair does not wish us to extend the debate.  So I will not do so other than again to say that we will not oppose the provisions of the Bill.  We regret that the Bill does not seek to cater for other great needs and we would urge the Minister to introduce as soon as possible comprehensive legislation which would be capable of dealing with all the problems that are building up in regard to housing in the major urban areas and, indeed, throughout rural Ireland.</P>

      <P>I accept your ruling; I have made my point.  The Housing Bill, 1983, provides for the amendment of sections 53, 55 and 60 of the Housing Act, 1966. Section 60 has already been amended by section 16 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979.  Section 53 of the 1966 Act imposes a statutory duty on each housing authority to make an inspection and to assess the adequacy of supply and the condition of housing in their functional area every five years, or less if the Minister directs.  The 1983 Bill will widen the powers of the housing authority to enable them to consider the prospective future of persons who are residing outside their functional areas. This in itself is very desirable, but I shall return to the matter of the statutory obligation in a moment.</P>
      <P>Section 55 of the 1966 Act imposes a statutory duty on every housing authority to prepare and adopt a building programme for at least every five years, or at shorter intervals if the Minister directs. The housing authority must have regard to a number of given objectives, for example, houses that are unfit for human habitation, the elimination of overcrowding and so on.  The 1983 Bill proposes to include in this section the objective of providing housing to meet the needs of persons who are residing outside the functional area.  Like the proposed amendment of section 53, this is also a desirable provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the general question of sections 53 and 55, I think that with the experience gained by housing authorities <Col N="1995" /> since the 1966 Act was passed, the absolute statutory obligations imposed by sections 53 and 55 on housing authorities could be downgraded to, say a duty to make inspections, to assess adequacy of supply of housing and to prepare building programmes at intervals as required by the Minister.  This suggestion would not diminish the importance of assessments and building programmes but would rather recognise that a five-year building programme is subject to so many variables as to make it practically impossible to carry out.</P>
    <P>Every public representative, especially every local representative, knows that regardless of the best intentions, building programmes are affected by the availability of land, the provision of services, the early preparation of plans, changes in the employment scene and, above all, the allocation of capital.  The availability of land is being dealt with at the moment and we heard from Deputy Molloy this morning that it will be the end of March before the Joint Committee on Building Land report.</P>
    <P>Since those factors can change drastically in less than five years, a programme for that period could be unrealistic after two or three years.  A broad general programme is of course necessary for a local authority and this could be provided as a number of objectives of the development plan which would be either in lieu of the statutory building programme mentioned in section 5 of the 1966 Act or be declared to satisfy the obligation of making that programme.</P>
    <P>My suggestions about sections 53 and 55 of the 1966 Act would require some changes in the 1983 Bill.  I was very heartened to see what the Minister said:</P>
    <P>...there is now a need for a more fundamental review of Part III of the Housing Act, 1966, which relates to the provision and management of local authority dwellings and which include the three sections now being amended. I intend to proceed as quickly as possible with this review and the formulation of legislative proposals.  These proposals, which I intend to bring forward <Col N="1996" /> next year, will also contain measures to deal with the issue of homelessness.</P>
    <P>This subject is very dear to the hearts of all involved in government at local and national level.</P>
    <P>The other section of the 1966 Act which it is proposed to amend by means of the 1983 Bill is section 60 under which every housing authority is obliged to draw up a scheme of letting priorities. This allows discretion to members under a points system, for example, which is very popular in my part of the country where they can weigh the criteria to needs in an area.  It is with regard to this question that the judgment in the case of McNamee and Another v. Buncrana Urban District Council, in the Supreme Court on 30 June 1983, has caused the greatest difficulties for housing authorities in that the law has now been interpreted as prohibiting a housing authority from housing a person residing outside the authority's functional area.  In other words, it was deemed necessary to impose restrictions on members when making their schemes of letting priorities.</P>
    <P>Housing authorities find it necessary to consider housing applicants from outside their areas for a variety of reasons.  Urban authorities in particular are concerned about the needs of people living in the suburbs which extend into the adjacent rural area.  All housing authorities experience demands from people who must move by reason of their employment or who wish, on retirement, to return to their native place.  Representatives form rural constituencies are particularly aware of this problem.  Most of the urban boundaries are very narrow and the actual functional areas of corporations and borough councils are very small.  Over the years people have been rehoused from the centre of towns to suburbia in great numbers, perhaps too great numbers, and we must look at the situation now.  We have denuded many of our town centres, of necessity, but the wheel has turned the full circle and it is time we looked at the situation so created. The facts are that many people live outside the boundaries of these functional <Col N="1997" /> areas, people who are natives of the area, who identify fully with it, who are rearing their children and, hopefully, are working there.</P>
    <P>Leaving aside the legal question, the practice of housing applicants from outside the area can be justified and appears logical when one considers that the entire capital cost of providing local authority housing is subsidised.  The effect of the judgment of the High and Supreme Courts &mdash; which we must accept &mdash; has been to create difficulties which some local authorities have tried to cope with by agreement under section 109 of the 1966 Act and section 59 of the Local Government Act, 1955.  This, however, would be unsatisfactory as a permanent procedure as it would rely on a multiplicity of formal agreements between different housing authorities, and the simple amendment of the Housing Acts contained in the Housing Bill, 1983, is a far better remedy.</P>
    <P>A recent allocation of houses by Wexford Corporation highlights the problem created by the Buncrana case.  There were 320 applicants for 42 houses &mdash; 70 from people residing outside the authority's functional area.  Two weeks ago these houses were allocated by Wexford Corporation by having consideration to agreements under section 109 of the 1966 Act and section 59 of the Local Government, 1955, and even then, in my view, not all places could be legally considered. The important aspect of retrospection in this Bill will be very helpful to those authorities who had difficulty in juggling the existing legislation to suit their particular needs over the past six months. Housing people who are unable to house themselves is one of the most important functions of a Government.  The Government, by providing all the capital, enable local authorities to indulge in one of the few real measures of local government that still exist.</P>
    <P>I am one of those who believe that local government has been stripped insidiously over the years and we now have only a pretence of local democracy.  Local democracy and an efficient, effective local government system responding directly to the needs of the people is <Col N="1998" /> essential for stability and proper government. It is the cornerstone of any truly democratic country and it behoves all of us to ensure its future is in safe hands.</P>
    <P>At this point I would like to congratulate Deputy Kavanagh on his new position as Minister for the Environment.  I am very confident that the future of local government is in safe hands while he is in the driving seat.  A good system of local government is the cornerstone of a truly democratic country.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  I should like to take this opportunity to wish the Minister every success in his new appointment.  The Department of the Environment is a very prestigious Department.  This Bill relates to the letting priorities in relation to local authority housing which is a fundamental function of the Department of the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I appreciate your position.  This is a very confined Bill. Those of us who had hoped to broaden the debate to the whole housing area, both public and private, will not be allowed to do so under your ruling.  We will have an opportunity to do so on the Estimates if we can get in to speak on Thursday or Friday.  It is a little disappointing that we will not be allowed to develop our train of thought on housing, but I appreciate your position.  I trust that when the Leas-Cheann Comhairle takes <Col N="1999" /> over he will follow the precedent, lest speakers who come after us may have an advantage over us.</P>
    <P>The letting priorities throughout the country have been very consistent.  Of course the High Court ruling has created a problem.  Local authorities have always dealt with this matter in a sensible manner. The need for housing applicants who cannot house themselves has always been considered compassionately by the health inspectors, the housing inspectors and the social workers, in co-operation with the elected members of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>Because of the growth in our population in urban areas we have a problem. Urban areas have developed so much that the land bank owned by the local authorities is generally in the county council areas.  County councillors rather than urban councillors or town commissioners have the function of allocating houses.  Because of this the Minister and the local authorities should look at the question of the extension of the urban boundaries.  This has ramifications for the rest of the council areas.</P>
    <P>Recently in Navan, 24 houses were being allocated and there were 150 applicants.  The land was in the county council area and the county councillors rightly allocated half of those 24 houses to people living in the urban area.  The county council have the professional staff to deal with this matter.  Some urban councillors are wondering whether they have any real function, especially having regard to the recent Act which gave the county managers total executive functions.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to some needs which have been overlooked.  The single parent is not normally considered as an applicant in need of housing.  The single parent is usually the female of the species. Normally persons deemed to be in need of housing are married and have at least one child.  It is not mentioned anywhere that the single parent should be classed as in need of housing.  One of the social trends over the past decade has been that more and more single parents are living in our society.  If that is their <Col N="2000" /> wish, they are entitled to keep the child rather than opting for fostering or adoption. The Minister should point out to the local authorities that single parents are just as much in need of housing as married parents and there should be no barriers against the housing of that type of person.</P>

      <P>I want to say that I did not think up this ruling myself. I did not look up a precedent before I made the ruling because I thought my ruling was elementary.  Since then I got two rulings of distinguished precedessors of mine which confirm that what I ruled is in accordance with precedent.  One ruling said the scope of a Bill is determined by its content and not by its title and, more important, that in debating a Bill to amend an Act the provisions of the Principal Act not affected by the Bill may not be debated.  They are long-standing rulings.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I will abide by your ruling, but it would be very difficult to have three hours of relevant debate on the Buncrana decision.  There has been a change in social trends.  Separated couples, deserted wives, unmarried mothers and single parents have to be taken into consideration when it comes to the question of housing.  Senator B. Ryan and the Simon Community must be commended for pointing out to the Oireachtas the dire need to house the homeless in our society.  They have been ignored down through the years by housing authorities and the Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have these people in the cities and the bigger urban areas.  It is very sad that they have been overlooked.  Homeless people are in need of housing as much if <Col N="2001" /> not more than travelling people.  We need to house the travelling people and it behoves every local authority to ensure that the travelling people in their community are housed.  We have a very progressive programme for the housing of travelling people.  Last year we built nearly 20 houses for them and the scheme has worked out quite well in one estate, apart from our programme of housing one travelling person in every 20 applicants. I would suggest that a homeless person should be considered in that category because such a person is as much in need of a house.  Travelling people should be allocated loans by the local authority to buy or build their own houses because many of them would be well able to repay these loans.</P>

      <P>The reasoning behind my ruling is that Buncrana Urban Council housed people outside the urban area and somebody took an action for a declaration that they were not entitled to do that.  The High Court held that they were right and the Supreme Court held <Col N="2002" /> on appeal that they were correct.  The legislation seeks to restore what was thought to be the <i>status quo</i> and to give Buncrana Urban Council and every other housing authority the power to consider housing the categories of people whom they are entitled to house and who reside outside their functional area.</P>

I am ruling out discussion on the homeless, single parents and all the rest.  That is not within the scope of the Bill and it is not the fault of the Chair.  I do not know if Deputy Wyse was here when I read the ruling.  The scope of the Bill is determined by its contents and not by its title, and in debating a Bill to amend an Act provisions of the Principal Act not affected by the Bill may not be debated.

      <P>I appreciate that you have a capacity for tolerance.  The Minister said that there is now a need for a more fundamental review of Part III of the Housing Act, 1966, which relates to the provision and management of local <Col N="2003" /> authority dwellings and which includes the three sections now being amended. He seemed to broaden the scope of the debate but I will certainly not argue with the Chair and I fully appreciate his position.</P>
      <P>Even the best housing inspectors and social workers can be misled and often the advice of the member of the local authority who knows best is ignored.  The allocation of houses is a managerial function. The deserving applicant, the married man with a wife and child who rents the best house he can get, often loses out to another applicant who may not be as responsible and may, perhaps, use a caravan, because the latter is deemed to be in greater need of housing.</P>

I am pleased to note that he intends to review Part III of the Housing Act and I would ask him to consider that section which deals especially with the allocation of houses to people who cannot provide them from their own means.

      <P>The Minister should give particular attention to this section.  The Housing Act of 1966 was a major piece of legislation aimed at tackling in a <Col N="2004" /> planned manner the problems of inferior and inadequate housing.  It provided for a planned housing programme financed by loans and grants-in-aid to local authorities, who in turn would carry out the programme and be known as housing authorities under the Act, with the approval of the Minister concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing directly with the Bill.  Under Part III of the Act the housing authority have three main functions. Under section 53 of the Act they have to assess the housing needs of the area, the magnitude of the problem to be assessed by an inspection by each housing authority of all the houses in their functional area to ascertain the existing extent of poor housing and overcrowding.  It would appear from the judgment in the case of McNamee <i>versus</i> Buncrana Urban District Council that a housing authority in assessing housing needs were not entitled to take into account the prospective future needs of persons residing outside the functional area.  Under section 55 it was further required that a housing authority draw up a long-term building programme, having regard to the number of people on the housing list. These needs were to be considered in relation to the replacement of unsuitable houses and the elimination of overcrowding and the number of people who, from their own resources or income, were unable to provide housing for themselves and to take into account the size of their families.</P>
      <P>Under the same judgment, local authorities when preparing a building programme are entitled not to consider the needs of people residing outside their functional areas.  A judgment delivered on 30 June 1983 by the Chief Justice included the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that the Buncrana District Council are entitled to house people who are not resident in a functional <Col N="2005" /> area.  The duty of the Buncrana Urban District Council is to allocate the houses which they have provided in accordance with a scheme of priority which enables them to house suitable applicants who fit within the designated property and who reside or are domiciled within the functional area of the council.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation, of whose housing committee I am chairman, have over a number of years provided 62,000 houses &mdash; and also flats.  However, due to the scarcity of land within the borough area they have to build outside their functional area and have in the last number of years built 16,000 houses outside that area.</P>
    <P>In drawing up a scheme for the letting of housing accommodation Dublin Corporation provide a housing list and a transfer list.  On the transfer list are tenants who wish to transfer from one corporation property to another.  Following the Supreme Court judgment, it is not clear whether corporation tenants now living in the county area would be entitled to transfer to dwellings in the city area.  Secondly, there are those sub-tenants of corporation dwellings who are the children of tenants.  These would be people housed by Dublin Corporation in accordance with a scheme of letting priorities but outside their functional area. They may not have the same rights as children of tenants housed in the city area.  There are approximately 500 applicants on Dublin Corporation's waiting list who reside outside the city boundary. More than half of them are sub-tenants and practically all are children of corporation tenants.  As matters stand it would seem that Dublin Corporation have no option but to remove their names from the waiting list.  Dublin Corporation have treated tenants and their families living inside or outside the area in the same way.  It would appear, however, that the effect of the decision in the Buncrana case would be to force Dublin Corporation to act differently.  In effect, there would be two classes of citizens, one with rights superior to another, because of the unavailability of sufficient <Col N="2006" /> building land within the city boundary. This would be a serious injustice and for that reason I welcome the Bill before the House, the purpose of which is to amend the Housing Acts of 1966 to 1979 to enable the housing authority to have regard to persons residing outside the functional area of the authority in assessing the housing needs of their area, preparing a building programme and making a scheme of letting priorities.</P>

      <P>At the outset, I congratulate the Minister on his recent promotion to the Department of the Environment. It is somewhat a pity that the opportunity was not given to Members of the House to lend him their experience and tell him their views on many aspects of housing. For some reason it is difficult for any Member of the House to make a fair contribution towards the debate without being told that he or she is moving outside the various sections of the Bill.  What we are really talking about here is local authorities housing people outside their own functional areas and the qualification of the applicants for free housing.</P>
      <P>The Minister could look around the city of Dublin and see how the many derelict sites are being used by vandals, drug addicts and the like.  We should be talking about in-fill housing in cities.  The Minister must be given the views of the Members on this subject.  Members of my own party discussed this at length and were hoping to have an opportunity at least to make reference to a number of matters causing difficulties for local authorities.  These difficulties are not experienced by Cork Corporation and County Council, who have had an understanding down through the years.  The two authorities work together and house people even though they are not living within their functional areas.  People who have had to emigrate can make application to the local authorities in Cork and are given the same concession as those living within the functional area.  I congratulate those two authorities for cooperating with one another in ensuring the provision of the best facilities for housing our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a category of people &mdash; the <Col N="2007" /> physically handicapped &mdash; who are not provided with housing by any local authority in their own functional area. Certain facilities must be provided for these people, otherwise they could be housed.  They are people who because of their incapacity are deprived of housing, due to non-provision of the necessary facilities.  I hope that the Minister might consider setting aside 1 per cent of all housing schemes specifically for the physically handicapped, these houses to be specially designed to meet their needs. This is a very important aspect which has not been raised by any local authority I know of, and these are people within the functional area.</P>
    <P>Itinerants live in different functional areas, moving from place to place.  Many are not itinerants at all, but travelling people who have homes in other parts of the country and who come to do a quick deal in trading, occupying what we now call derelect sites within the cities and towns.  These sites should be used to house people living within the functional area for a number of years.  I have no objection whatsoever to an itinerant family being housed &mdash; we can house and educate them and ensure that they become part of the community.  However, we have the traders who are just moving from city to town and occupying&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to mention another thing, and if I am out of order I accept your ruling.  There are <Col N="2008" /> families living in the functional area of one local authority and because they are living in unsuitable accommodation they move to another functional area.  They may have lived in very poor housing conditions for two or three years and are considered eligible for rehousing by one local authority.  However, when they move to another area they are told they must fill in a fresh application form and wait for another three or four years living in very poor housing conditions.  Local authorities should accept that when people move from one area to another the date they made their original application for housing should be considered when they are being listed.  Surely they should not lose their place in the queue because they had to move from one local authority area to another when they were living in such poor conditions.</P>

      <P>I have seen unfortunate families moving from a city into a county because they were living under appalling conditions, many of them rat-infested. They may have the opportunity to move into another functional area where some slightly better housing conditions are available to them.  Unfortunately, they are then struck off the list by one authority and they are asked by the other authority to make a fresh application, which means enduring a further two or three years in poor housing conditions. Local authorities should be more progressive and work as one rather than two functional areas for the betterment of all the people.  Under the Constitution we all have that right, irrespective of what area a person lives in.  Managers can get together on many aspects of local authority administration.  It is time they sat down and considered the whole aspect of housing for our people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While the Minister was absent from the House I complimented him on his new appointment and wished him every success in his office.  I assured him of our fullest co-operation in the onerous task he is talking on.  I said I hoped that the <Col N="2009" /> Members of the House would extend to the Minister not only their compliments but their experience in the housing field in working with local authorities so that this will be a help to him in the near future when he brings in a more progressive Bill in relation to housing.  We have to take the ruling of the Chair that we may be stepping outside the contents of the Bill in raising this matter.  I hope I have made a case for the physically handicapped people and that local authorities will look at their case and at least provide that 1 per cent of every housing scheme will be specially designed to cater for the needs of such people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere congratulations to Deputy Kavanagh on his appointment to the portfolio of Environment. It is a very significant promotion for him and I am quite confident he is more than capable of discharging the onerous duties associated with his new position.  It is an important Ministry and a lot of important things have to be done. I would also like to congratulate the Minister's assistant, Deputy Fergus O'Brien, and wish both of them every success in the Department of the Environment.</P>
      <P>I, like many Members of the House, was very concerned at the ruling of the Supreme Court in relation to the housing of people outside the functional area.  As a member of a local authority and associated with housing allocations for a number of years I was always very concerned at the manner in which people may or may not get a tenancy.  I sometimes questioned why people could be brought from outside a functional area and be given a house before a person who had made application and was on a housing list in that particular authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that the Bill before us is an exteremely important one.  Every county manager and members of all local authorities were extremely conscious that something should be done very quickly to amend the law in relation to consideration of people in serious housing need who may reside outside the functional area.  The Bill, therefore, is purely an enabling Bill.  I am conscious of the ruling <Col N="2010" /> of the Chair this morning in relation to confining Members to the exact terms of the Bill.  I believe if that policy were pursued in relation to a number of other Bills going through the House there would not be any great need to consider reform.  I sometimes feel that debates in this House are an anachronism because people can range over wide areas which do not pertain at all to the Bill in question.</P>
    <P>The Housing Bill, 1983, amends sections 53, 55 and 60 of the Housing Act, 1966, which was a very comprehensive Act but I do not think that an interpretation such as that in the judgment on the Buncrana Urban Council case was ever envisaged in that Act.  Local authorities have acted with compassion in relation to housing needs whether within or outside their functional areas.  A number of housing programmes are designed and the needs are assessed based on information that straddles local authority boundaries. It would be extremely difficult not to take account of people, particularly with the growth of suburbia.  It would be impossible to arrive at a fair and accurate assessment of housing needs and then to allocate houses from that point of view unless this legislation is passed by this House.</P>
    <P>The 1983 Bill will widen the powers of the housing authority to enable them to consider the prospective future demand from persons residing outside their functional area.  This is very desirable, but I shall examine further the matter of statutory obligation.  Section 55 of the Housing Act, 1966, imposes a statutory duty on every housing authority to prepare and adopt a building programme at least every five years or at shorter intervals if the Minister so directs.  The housing authority must have regard to a number of given objectives.  They must consider houses which are unfit for human habitation, and considerable progress has been made in that area in most urban centres, not before its time. One aim is the elimination of over-crowding. Reference has been made here this morning to consideration of housing the homeless and that is appropriate to the section in question.  I do not wish to <Col N="2011" /> dwell on that. I do not want to detain the passage of this Bill for longer than necessary. The power to provide for the housing of people from outside the functional area is essential to county managers and I hope they will use it with discretion.  People come into areas in caravans or are in other totally unfit housing situations when a housing scheme is about to be allocated and they make use of the situation that arises.  The points system which is in operation in a number of authorities, particularly in the Dublin area, is highly commendable.  The case brought against Buncrana Urban Council might never have arisen were it not for the fact that the person in question felt wronged.  That person must have had a serious grievance.  The case was brought to the High Court because of failure to get a housing tenancy to which the person was entitled and he must have felt so entitled.</P>
    <P>Since the 1966 Act came into effect local authorities have been carrying out extensive housing developments in their areas and assessing housing needs, and all of us in this House who are local authority members are associated with this.  There are severe constraints in relation to it.  I do not wish to deviate from the Bill but I want to make a point which really comes into another section.  I refer to the cost of the provision of local authority houses.  It costs a local authority today almost £60 per week of taxpayers' money to provide a house in certain cases.  I know, Sir, that you will attempt to rule me out of order if I mention&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept your ruling. Housing need is considered in the light of what people can do for themselves. Therefore, facilities to enable people to cater for their own needs in this respect must be encouraged.  I have section 55 of the Housing Act, 1966, in mind when I speak of housing needs and the assessment of them.  The need would be far greater were it not for the availability of the Housing Finance Agency loan system. <Col N="2012" /> Irrespective of criticisms against that system at its initiation, it has brought home security to thousands of people who otherwise could never secure a home for themselves and would be putting further pressure on the local authorities to provide homes for them.</P>
      <P>I want to talk about legal interpretation. I am sure that the rulings of the High Court and the Supreme Court were taken in accordance with the Act of 1966 as they interpreted it.  We accept that it was necessary for them to give that ruling at the time.  I do not know whether the person was housed subsequently.  The effect of the judgment of the High Court and the Supreme Court has been to create difficulties.  I assume that the difficulties which have been created will be overcome by the enactment of this legislation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, on his appointment to the Department of the Environment and wish him every success in that Department. I really welcome this Bill. The decision of the Supreme Court in the Buncrana case has affected every housing authority throughout the country.  However, I would say that the two areas most affected by it were Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation. The movement of people from city to county and from county to city seeking housing accommodation is considerable.  Last June, Dublin County Council had an allocation for the Tallaght area of between 200 and 300 houses.  A couple of weeks later the Circuit Court announced its decision and that decision would have affected between 12 and 20 housing applicants who were recommended for accommodation and some of those people were very worried about the court decision then. The policy pursued by the Dublin County Council housing authority was and still is that a person who is a native of the housing area, irrespective of what other housing area he moves to, will be considered for housing accommodation. On the other hand, if he is resident in the housing area for four years and has the necessary qualifications he will be considered for housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who were affected by the <Col N="2013" /> decision were living in the housing area and had sufficient points to be allocated accommodation.  When the news broke these people were very disturbed and, regardless of their political affiliations, sought the help of every possible public representative.  When one is in need of housing one enlists the help of members of any party.  In this case those people were on the road day and night seeking the help of Members of this House or of Dublin County Council.  At a meeting held subsequently, the public representatives for the area affected, including myself, requested the county manager to seek senior counsel opinion as to how the decision in the Buncrana case affected these applicants.  I am happy to say that three or four weeks ago the advice received was that those people who had been recommended for housing would be housed when the accommodation became available.</P>
    <P>I applaud the Minister for introducing this Bill. It puts beyond any doubt the eligibility for housing of those applicants who qualify under the terms of reference. Throughout the country in the past few years the numbers on the housing lists have increased greatly.  All of us in public life would regret very much anything that would upset the system of the allocation of housing.  It is good to know that housing authorities are anxious to help anybody in need of housing but it was regrettable that the court decision should have affected so many people.</P>
    <P>There are many problems both for Dublin County Council and Dublin Corporation in regard to housing.  The corporation are building a large number of houses in the county area. When I speak of housing accommodation I am speaking within the terms of reference. Some time ago Deputy O'Brien, who has been transferred now to the Department of the Environment was present here when the question of transfers was raised. I do not know if he is still a member of Dublin Corporation.  I should like to refer to the problems that we as members of Dublin County Council have, particularly those who represent a constituency in which there is local authority housing by both the corporation and the county <Col N="2014" /> council. I refer to the situation in which people are allocated flats in the county area.  There is no proper relationship or understanding between the two authorities in regard to transfers.  This is an area I should like the Minister to consider. The only way in which a transfer can be sanctioned is by way of agreement on the part of the two authorities.  I wish to put in on record that Dublin Corporation are rather difficult to deal with in these situations. This, too, is an aspect to which the Minister should give attention.  I appeal to him to have the situation investigated with a view to bringing about more flexibility in this area.  The problem is one that arises very often.</P>
    <P>I shall not delay the House because there are many other Members who wish to contribute on this Bill but I am confident that the passage of the legislation will result in putting right the problems that arose from the court decision.  The legislation will help me as a member of Dublin County Council in dealing with the many problems in regard to those applicants who had been recommended for housing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill can be described briefly as a tidying up Bill but before dealing with it I should like to wish the Minister every success in his new Department.  He will have in the Custom House the back-up and support of a group of people who are perhaps the most dedicated of all civil servants.  The Minister may rely on the devotion and loyalty of the staff in that Department. They are extremely efficient and competent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill arises as a result of problems that ensued from the court proceedings. Regardless of whether a person is living outside a functional area or inside it, he is deserving of housing.  I wish to pay tribute also to the county managers and the housing officers who have responsibility for the very difficult job of the allocation of housing.  In both Counties Offaly and Laois, the county managers have been extremely sympathetic in their dealings with applicants, regardless of whether they are from urban or rural districts.  The types of problems that have <Col N="2015" /> arisen in other areas have not been experienced in that constituency &mdash; problems, for instance, in relation to qualification or to the ability of an applicant to pay.</P>
    <P>During the Cosgrave Government the then Minister for Local Government had frequent discussions with county managers in relation to all aspects of the Department but particularly in relation to housing.  The Minister in his consultations with county managers should make a special case for people living in overcrowded conditions whether they are within the functional area or not.  A special case should be made for couples who because of lack of proper housing accommodation must live apart.  Such separations cause serious domestic problems. Those living in overcrowded conditions or who produce a medical certificate in support of their application should be given priority on the housing list.  I accept that the allocations cannot be made unless the houses are built and in that regard I wish the Minister well in his effort to reach a target of 25,000 local authority houses per year.  It is important he achieves that target to help younger people who are experiencing great difficulty in getting proper accommodation.</P>
    <P>The points systems seems to work well in urban areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Deputy's concern about the points system and the problem of housing but he must remember that we are confined in the debate on the Bill which amount to a tidying up measure.  I should be grateful if the Deputy would keep to the terms of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept the ruling of the Chair. I had not intended making a contribution but having read the terms of the Bill I decided to make a special plea to the Minister to ask county managers to give priority to separated couples.  I hope all local authorities will make an effort to house such people so that families can live together. The Minister should see to it that the letting regulations permit county managers to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2016" /> I welcome the measure, which seeks to comply with the law.  Regrettably I do not have an opportunity to deal fully with all housing problems but that will arise within the next few months. The terms of the Bill are desirable and it is important that the measure is given a speedy passage through the House. When it is passed applicants will know where they stand and county managers will be complying with the law. I should like to associate myself with the good wishes to the Minister. I hope he enjoys his term of office in the Custom House.  I hope he will have a longer stay there than I had, but I should like to assure him that he will see a great standard of efficiency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I should like to congratulate the new Minister on his appointment to the Department of the Environment.  I am confident he will do a good job because in making representations to him in the Department of Labour I found him efficient and courteous. He responded to those representations promptly. Indeed, other members of the Cabinet could take a leaf from his book. I should like to convey my congratulations to the new Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Fergus O'Brien. I am glad that a Dublin Deputy has been appointed to that Department.  Deputy O'Brien has experience from his work on the country's largest local authority, Dublin Corporation, of all local authority problems. The Bill is welcome in that it will enable local authorities accept applications from those who live in other local authority areas. We have all experienced great difficulty in this regard. Tenants seeking transfers for genuine reasons to another local authority area have experienced great difficulties. In some cases people are anxious to transfer to be close to their place of employment while old people seek a move to be nearer their relations.  Old people have great difficulty in getting a transfer because of the lack of suitable accommodation for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the problem in regard to finance in the Department and this has led to a shortage of proper accommodation. I should like to remind the Minister <Col N="2017" /> that in England local authorities purchase large houses and convert them to apartments suitable for old people or newly-married couples.  The Minister should examine those schemes.  Irish people who have worked for many years outside the State always have great difficulty in getting housing accommodation when they return home. I received a letter yesterday from an old couple who have lived for many years in England and are anxious to return to live in my constituency. Under the existing regulations they will have to live here for approximately three months before they will be considered. We should not subject such people to long delays or red tape.  I would have had a similar problem when I returned home some years ago had I been looking for local authority accommodation.  Had I applied I have no doubt I would not have been considered.  A provision in regard to that should be included in the Bill. Like Deputy Molloy, I am also concerned about unmarried mothers who have difficulty in getting a transfer.</P>
    <P>I am concerned about the number of people who illegally occupy local authority houses.  Such people squat in an effort to be placed high on the housing list. Local authorities have to resort to the courts to have such people removed. That is a long drawn out procedure but at the end of the day squatters are always placed high on the priority list. That is unfair to the other people on the housing list.  I have no doubt that many Dublin Corporation houses are occupied by squatters and I hope the Minister will deal with this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment to the Department of the Environment.  I have no doubt the Minister will find it very rewarding although he will have to cope with financial stringencies.  I welcome the measure before the House which seeks to remove a difficulty that arose following a court decision.  When the Minister is putting the legislation into effect by order he should see to it that its interpretation by officialdom is not extreme or contrary to the spirit of it. I should like to give a quick example of <Col N="2018" /> that.  In my constituency in County Kildare we have approximately 2,500 people on the housing lists.  Geographically it is a rather spread-out area.  This means that, in a large housing authority area, a situation could arise in which a person, say, 50, 60 or 70 miles away could put an individual, or group of individuals, under pressure in a local authority housing allocation if officialdom were to interpret the regulations exactly as they appear to be set out.  This arose previously.  Simply it means this: there could be the case of a husband, wife and perhaps four children at one extreme end of a local authority housing area eligible in every sense of the word for re-housing at any given time. But they could easily be placed further down that list by somebody appealing from 50, 60 or 70 miles away on the same list at the same time, placing the former in jeopardy.  This can create considerable disharmony within local communities by virtue of the fact that the local people in the area in which the local authority houses were being allocated would see themselves being upstaged by somebody whom they would describe as an outsider. I know it would not be intentional or anything like that, but it should be pointed out&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume it is not the Deputy's intention to go outside the ambit of the Bill either. We are dealing with three sections of this Housing Bill.  The Deputy is discussing a question within a functional area that has no bearing on the three sections we are discussing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I beg your pardon, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I would suggest that it does.  It is purely in relation to how the directions relating to the Bill, when passed, will be operated by officialdom. It is for that reason I mention that prior to the introduction of this Bill a difficulty had arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In interpreting the regulations the officials concerned would be able to use their discretion rather than operate as per the written word, as it were.  I would contend that that comes within the ambit of the <Col N="2019" /> matter under discussion and would have serious consequences in constituencies with large geographical spreads.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that the purpose of this Bill is to enable a housing authority, at their discretion in assessing housing needs, to take account of persons resident outside their functional area and to build for and let houses to such persons. Those are the bones of the provisions of the Bill so if the Deputy would keep within them I would be grateful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should have explained that, in my constituency, there are three housing authorities; there is the local authority, which is the county council, the urban council with two other areas as well. That is the point I was endeavouring to illustrate.</P>
      <P>Until this Bill was introduced, and having regard to a decision taken in the courts, a situation could arise in which a person in one area would not qualify for housing in another.  The point I was endeavouring to make was that, as a result of this Bill, I should not like to see the complete reverse arise whereby an individual who would be eligible for rehousing in one section of a county could be completely rubbed off the list, as it were, by virtue of the strict interpretation of the provisions of the Bill by somebody perhaps 60 or 70 miles away.  It is very important, and I have had numerous experiences in the past where a person would be beyond an administrative boundary by perhaps two or three hundred yards and would not be considered eligible because they were deemed to be outside the functional area of that particular housing authority. Previously the administrators had powers to interpret the regulations favourably in such cases; in all cases they did not, in some they did.  But, by virtue of a court decision, it was imperative that this Bill be introduced to ensure that each and every individual had their constitutional rights adhered to in the consideration of the allocation of local authority houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  As somebody said earlier, I hope that, regardless of where <Col N="2020" /> we house our people, there will be sufficient houses for them which is the most important aspect at the end of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and wish him every success in his new portfolio which I believe to be one of the most important within government.  It stretches right across the community and I wish the Minister every success in his difficult task ahead.</P>
      <P>It was a pity that the Supreme Court had to become involved in this social area in which, in my experience, local authorities had been doing a good job in very difficult circumstances.  Their main problem always is that they have more applicants for houses than they have houses, which causes immediate problems for them.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but I am somewhat concerned that we are not endeavouring to realise fully the responsibility we are placing on local authorities.  There have been many new problems created for local authorities which are wide-ranging, such as people returning home from England, emigrants returning from various parts to an area in which there is considerable development.  Straight away any potential oil find off the south-west coast could draw an influx of outside people seeking housing, in which area there may have been people awaiting housing three or four years who would then find themselves waiting another two or three years, that just because of a sudden influx of, let us say, outside people because of the attraction of that local authority area.  We must be careful and ensure that we spell out exactly what the provisions of this Bill mean. It is easy for the courts to determine the Buncrana case and maintain that a local authority was wrong in giving a house to an outsider but I consider that the local authority were right in their decision.  It is easy for the courts to take a straightforward line in making a decision but, in taking such a decision, the local authority had to take into consideration many other factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any point in passing on responsibility to local authorities under the provisions <Col N="2021" /> of this Bill without taking into consideration the resultant problems?  As has been said already, we have insufficient houses for the needs of our people, this being the main point of my argument. At present in Cork there are approximately 1,500 applicants for housing, which has been the trend there in recent years.  With the implementation of these provisions I can see that trend increasing. Unless we examine other aspects such as the provision of additional finance to allow local authorities tackle this problem in the way they see best, the Cork housing lists anyway will only increase.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that today new problems have arisen with marital breakdown, separated parents, some with families divided between them, single parent families, young people not remaining at home, who have left home, are sleeping rough, who could be described as homeless. What will be the interpretation of such cases by local authorities under these provisions?  The Minister, in the course of his remarks, referred to homeless people and said he would be elaborating on them later.  Passing this Bill may be unfairly putting the onus on local authorities.  We are not identifying nearly all of the problems, and certainly not new ones that will be created for them by the passage of this Bill.  We have not gone into the whole issue in a proper or thorough fashion.  We are not being fair to local authorities in identifying the problems that will be created for them by these provisions.</P>
    <P>Perhaps an important factor which should be borne in mind and which might help local authorities in this area would be an examination of the system of loans. It must be remembered that there are now people coming on to the housing lists because any loans available to them are totally inadequate.  The problem becomes more severe with more and more people coming on housing lists and local authorities being unable to cater for new people coming into areas.  The Minister should look quickly at the overall financial position of local authorities <i>visá-vis</i> housing.  I realise that money is needed for other matters but more seriour <Col N="2022" /> consideration should be given to housing.  Otherwise we will be passing legislation to create bigger problems than those already there.</P>

I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  I wish him well in that efficient Department from whose officials I have always got the best help and advice possible in regard to local authority matters.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal especially with the problem of the homeless.  We should stop the buck being passed from health boards to county councils in this regard because somebody must be made responsible and the loophole must be closed.</P>
      <P>The Bill is necessary particularly in relation to Fermoy, which has urban and rural houses.  Recently we had 200 applicants for houses some of whom were rural and some urban.  There were 90 applicants for rural houses and the situation seemed insoluble until the county manager found a way around it. Applications are being examined and assessments being made and I hope there will be a solution.  It was decided to have 24 rural houses and a fixed number of applicants.</P>
      <P>I should like to see the necessary funds being made available to build houses in that general area, going as far as Mallow, for special category people, childless couples, for instance, who have always been neglected by local authorities. Many such couples have worked hard all their lives but had not the necessary money to build their own homes or the necessary security to borrow from local authorities or building societies.  I hope this problem will be sorted out without delay.</P>
      <P>Local authorities have been rather slow in regard to rural housing.  Their planners are inclined to set up large growth centres and neglect rural areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In dealing with the Housing Bill, I consider the Title, the Housing Bill, 1983, to be unreal because the debate is confined. If the Title was correct we could not debate it in two hours.  It was decided this morning by order of the House that we are expected to make our contributions to this important Bill in a few hours.  We cannot indicate where we are and where we have been in regard to housing in that short time.  I appreciate that the Bill arose <Col N="2024" /> from a Supreme Court decision.  It is a pity our discussion is being limited in this way.  Why are we being so limited?  Is it simply to get this measure through because it is necessary?</P>
    <P>I agree it is necessary because the Buncrana decision affected every local authority.  I represent a constituency that has two local authorities, and the Buncrana decision has seriously affected local authorities within local authorities, urban areas within county council areas. I do not want to be parochial, because the Bill deals with the entire country, but I must talk about my own constituency in Cork North-Central where threequarters of the constituency is in the county borough of Cork and a quarter in the county.  I am aware of the need for the Bill but I regret that we are being precluded from discussing the housing situation throughout the country.  We are confined to three sections of a Bill to correct something that needed correcting.  I hope the Minister will take into account the fact that this Bill deals with the functional area of each local authority. That is the phrase used. There is no reference in this Bill to what is known as joint enterprise between two local authorities and joint enterprise is something which should be considered.</P>
    <P>There is an aspect I must mention even at the risk of being called to order.  I know someone this morning talked about trees and of course trees are not relevant to this measure.  The fact is temporary accommodation is not available.  Young married people are not in an economic situation in which they can buy houses. Taxation is hitting them and in the future there will be even fewer in a position to buy their own homes. It then falls on the local authority to house these people.  We are behind in the provision of housing. Demand far exceeds supply.  In the current budget we had no less than £220 million taken out of the capital programme. That certainly affected the building of houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy now would confine himself to the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>When people fail to get <Col N="2025" /> accommodation from one local authority they move into an adjacent local authority area.  A Housing Bill should deal with capital programmes and the number of houses that should be built, but here we are precluded from talking about the most important aspects of housing.  If people living in Cork city cannot get houses they move into Cork county. Houses are not being built because the money to build them is not being provided. Why are we confined now to one small issue when we should be talking about the general housing situation?  To call this a Housing Bill is hypocrisy. More money should be provided for housing.</P>
      <P>Again, local authorities are running out of sites.  Cork Corporation are now moving out into the county in a search for building land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all in agreement with the Bill which is designed to correct an anomaly.  I understand that and I am not trying to obstruct the passage of the Bill.  But there is a problem inherent in local authority housing, a problem which is giving quite a number of people a bad headache.  As I said, Cork Corporation are moving out into the county in a search for building land but there is no reference in this Bill to joint enterprise.  There should be no impediment to joint enterprise between local authorities and between local authorities and private enterprise.  There is no reference to that in this Bill.  The position should be safeguarded.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to be associated with the expression of congratulation to the new Minister for the Environment. In particular, I compliment his predecessor for the speed with which he took this matter up.  The difficulties highlighted have been experienced in Clare <Col N="2026" /> and, more particularly, in the town of Ennis where 77 houses are awaiting occupation. I thank the Minister for the expedition with which he has introduced this Bill and I wish his successor well in his appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I also take this opportunity to wish the Minister well in his new appointment. I also welcome the Bill. The decision of the court created many difficulties in constituencies.  Problems in regard to the rehousing of applicants have been acute in County Louth, particularly in Dundalk and Drogheda, to which people have gravitated in search of jobs.  Consequently, rehousing needs will follow shortly afterwards.  The passage of this Bill will help to restore flexibility in the consideration of rehousing applications by various authorities.  We have been particularly fortunate in that Dundalk UDC have had a far-sighted policy of buying sufficient land well in advance of need.  The town of Drogheda has been in much the same situation.  Unfortunately, employment opportunities are not sufficient to facilitate the growing population but job opportunities have been well checked and projected and documented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the development of the nation people tend to gravitate towards the eastern seaboard, towards, Dublin, Dundalk, Drogheda and Belfast.  Centres such as Dundalk and Drogheda have attracted people from Cavan, Monaghan and the midlands.  Persons with a capacity for hard work and honest endeavour have considerably enriched these centres of population.  They acquire employment and, in due course, settle down and set up home in their new area of residence. Over the last 15 years or so there has been a considerable influx from Northern Ireland to places like Dundalk and Drogheda.  Inevitably this has created its own problems in connection with the already overcrowded rehousing list.  I suppose &ldquo;the troubles&rdquo;&mdash; an all-embracing phrase in the context of Northern Ireland &mdash; have seen people discommoded in the Six Counties and forced to seek accommodation in Border towns like Dundalk, Castleblayney and <Col N="2027" /> Drogheda, which is not very far removed from the Border.  All the factors I have outlined, taken in conjunction with the natural growth in population as a result of the industrial development of the sixties, has meant that Dundalk and Drogheda have become major centres to which people of diversified environments come.  It takes time for people to settle down.  Commentators and politicians have tended to select towns like Dundalk and Drogheda for adverse comment.  I say that in the context of the movement of people towards these areas from the North.  This adverse comment has had a damaging effect on the investment prospects of the area.  Certainly, industrial growth has been damaged as a result.</P>
    <P>I am sorry if I have slightly digressed from the line we have been on in the debate so far, but I did think it necessary to highlight the particular problems that exist as a result of the movement of population from the midlands and across the Border because of the troubles in the North.</P>
    <P>I would also say in passing that the urban council in Dundalk and the corporation of Drogheda have done commendable work down the year in rehousing persons.  Louth County Council has not been so successful in the provision of much-needed new houses.  I would hope that when the new Minister settles into his Department he will review the amount being provided for new housing schemes, the purchase of land and the various infrastructural developments, such as the provision of water and sewage to facilitate the development of housing and that he will provide sufficient money to allow local authorities to get on with the job.  Certainly, money is required for the purchase of land, which is the first essential before any housing programme can be undertaken by any local authority.</P>
    <P>Perhaps in the context of this Bill we might consider for a moment the rehousing policies of local authorities and their role as agents for the Department of the Environment.  This is an appropriate time to ask is there sufficient coordination between local authorities on the one hand and between the Industrial Development <Col N="2028" /> Authority, the Department of Education and other State agencies concerned with the provision of infrastructure.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>For one reason, that I do think the time has arrived when there must be a co-ordinated and integrated approach by the Department of the Environment and the local authorities, the local authorities working in conjunction with one another.  In a situation where urban district councils and county councils such as in Louth, a relatively small county, where people tend to gravitate towards the centres of population for their job opportunities, it is absolutely essential to have co-ordination and co-operation between authorities.  We were certainly in a very anomalous situation as a result of the court case in that persons in the county area were precluded from consideration by Dundalk UDC and the Corporation of Drogheda.  Hopefully, with the passage of the Bill that situation will be rectified.  It is a situation that has existed for a relatively short time but the rehousing prospects of quite a few applicants throughout the country have been blighted by that decision.  It might be a case of democracy in action.  Any person is entitled to take his case to court if he feels he has been ill done by by the local authority or the State.  The difficulties that decisions like this can create for many people have been highlighted.  I hope that when the Bill has been enacted all will be well again and that a sense of flexibility between the functional areas of various authorities will be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many other things that I would wish to say in regard to rehousing needs but I know that the Chair has not been too happy about the line some previous <Col N="2029" /> speakers have taken.  However, it is obvious that it is very difficult to have a debate on a housing Bill confined to the very narrow range to which the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle have been trying to confine this debate.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the close relationship that should obtain between various local authorities, it is difficult to continue a debate on this Bill for three hours if we are restricted to the very narrow subject of the legislation that must be enacted as a result of the case of <i>McNamee v. Buncrana UDC</i> in June last.  That case has highlighted the changes that the passage of time has brought in rehousing needs in the country generally.  We have come a long way from the time when we were a rural-based area.  We have come to the stage where there are large centres of population.</P>

      <P>while there is no reference in the text of the speech I made on that occasion, I believe that in an &ldquo;off-the-cuff&rdquo; remark during my speech, I referred to advantages that had accrued from the holding of the two elections on the same day in 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question asks the Taoiseach if he is still of the same view which he expressed on that occasion, the gala dinner of the Irish Council of the European Movement to celebrate ten years of Irish membership of the EEC. The Taoiseach, in addressing the gathering did, as he has confirmed now, state that it would be his desire that the local authority elections and the European election would be held on the same day. I understand the Taoiseach went into the matter at some length to explain the advantages to Ireland, one of which would be to ensure a substantial turnout in the number of the electorate going to the polls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question has not been answered.  I asked in a written question and I repeat it now, is the Taoiseach of the same opinion that this is what should happen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I made off-the-cuff remarks on that occasion which were not actually in the text of the speech at all.  They have been taken somewhat out of context by the Deputy.  There are, of course, advantages in holding the two elections on the same day and there are disadvantages.  It seemed to me useful to have had the two on the same day in 1979 and it is a fact which should be borne in mind among others, in deciding the question of the dates of the elections.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Rather than the casual remark which the Taoiseach now seems to attribute to his comments on that occasion, is it in fact not true that he spoke at some length on this particular matter and laid great emphasis on it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2031" /> There were many people present listening to him on that occasion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot remember the exact length I spoke on the subject but the remarks were not in the text of my speech.  They were made in an <i>ad lib</i> fashion.  As the Deputy knows, it sometimes helps to liven up such occasions to depart from the script and add in some remarks on the spot.  My recollection of the exact words I used is not entirely clear but I can assure the Deputy that there seemed to me to be a potential advantage in holding the two together.  I know there are alternative views, that it is a mistake to mix the two and that it creates difficulties for people in contesting the two elections.  There is a balance to be found between the two views and we have to make a judgement on each occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased that the Taoiseach has confirmed that he made these remarks.  He referred to it at great length, he expressed his own personal view on the matter.  Will the Taoiseach confirm if it is the case that on 30 November he informed this House that the Government would make a decision regarding the date of the local authority elections in a couple of weeks?  That was 30 November and today is 14 December. Could the Taoiseach inform the House if the Government have yet made this decision?</P>

There are other views to the contrary and the question of how compelling that argument is is something <Col N="2032" /> to be weighed up against other considerations on any given occasion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that since last June, in reply to questions I have raised with him and with the former Minister for the Environment, the House and I have been informed that the question of fixing the date for the local elections was under consideration?  It seems from the answers which I have received which are on the record of this House, that this matter has been before the Government since last June but they have as yet failed to make a decision on whether the elections will be held in 1984 if we are to accept what the Taoiseach now informs the House, that no decision has yet been made?  I thought this was to be positive Government, capable of making decisions.  It is a matter of very great importance.</P>

      <P>The responsibility for the testing of milk for butter fat and making payment to producers rests with the co-operatives which, as the Deputy is aware, are owned and controlled by the milk producers themselves.</P>
      <P>My Department carry out spot checks of the samples taken by the co-operatives from the milk delivered to them so as to ensure that the methods used by co-operatives for payment on a butter fat basis are fair and accurate.  I am satisfied that the range and frequency of these check tests are satisfactory.  Producers may also, on payment of a nominal fee, have a private check test carried out by the Department on a confidential basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister trying to create the impression that all the milk outlets here are owned by the co-operatives? Can he tell us the number of inspectors in his Department who are on constant butter fat testing, the number of times they visit each creamery monthly and what is the average variable figure allowed by his inspectorate over the past year with regard to butter fat testing in all milk outlets?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In answer to the Deputy's first question, I refer him to his original question which refers to milk supplied to co-operatives, and that is what I have answered.  In reply to the second part of <Col N="2040" /> the question, I know there has been a controversy in the newspapers regarding the butter fat content of milk.  This controversy arose in September of this year. In that month my Department's inspectors checked approximately 84 random samples of suppliers' milk in the Kerry Co-operative alone and the results did not disclose any irregularity.  Between January and October 1983 a total of 455 samples also taken at random were check-tested and all of these were also found to be satisfactory.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is widespread dissatisfaction with the present system of testing?  The system of testing carried out is a bimonthly, two-fortnightly test and the least a farmer should be entitled to is the knowledge of his test after the first two weeks and again after the second two weeks.  In practice it is the 20th of the following month before a farmer knows the test result for the previous month.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Total imports of dairy products in 1982 were valued at £19 million as compared with £710 million for exports of such products.  Over 50 per cent of the imports consisted of butter for re-export and low-grade cheese for processing here.  Even though the value of imports represented only about 3 per cent of the value of exports, the aim should be to replace as much as possible of them by home-produced items.  As import prohibitions or restrictions cannot be imposed, replacement can be achieved only by producing here comparable products of high quality and at competitive prices.  Some welcome progress has, in fact, been made in the past few years in extending the range and variety of dairy products produced here but there is still great need for wider diversification. IDA grants continue to be available for the provision of facilities for the production of highly processed products.</P>

However, quite a high percentage of the £19 million worth of dairy products comes from Northern Ireland and is coming here for re-export.  It is not being utilised in this country.  In 1982 imports consisted of cheese to the value of £8.3 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the proposals he has to control the excessive use of hormones in meat for human consumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The results of tests undertaken on behalf of my Department do not show evidence of excessive residues of hormonal substances in meat for human consumption.  To ensure that these substances are used responsibly in livestock production I propose to introduce the following measures: tighter controls on availability of hormones; rules on how, by whom and to what species of animal such substances might be administered; systems to facilitate checking that withdrawal periods for hormones have been observed; power for veterinary examiners in abattoirs and slaughterhouses to examine and test for hormone residues and to reject animals and carcases where such residues are present.</P>
      <P>Consultations with the various farming, veterinary manufacturing and trade interests on my proposals are currently being conducted and I hope to have the new measures in force as early as possible in the new year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the new measures which he announced will control the problem which the Minister seems to think does not exist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know where the Deputy got that idea.  I would be the last <Col N="2046" /> to deny that there is a problem in this area.  Of course there is a problem and I have said so publicly on several occasions in the last few months, as long as six months ago when Deputy Shatter raised the matter initially.  We must be vigilant because our whole export trade and indeed our home trade could be affected and I am determined to see that any abuses which exist are eliminated.</P>
      <P>I shall outline some of the measures which I intend to take regarding the availability and uses of hormones. The appropriate regulations would be under (a) the Animal Remedies Act, 1956, (b) the Poisons Act, 1961, (c) the Agricultural Produce (Fresh Meat) Act, 1930, and the Pigs and Bacon Acts.  Regulations under (a) will update existing prescription only controls and extend them to include all hormonal growth promoters. Regulations under (b) will prohibit the use of hormonal growth promoters in all food animals except bovines and will stipulate appropriate conditions for use.  The administration of hormones will be confined to veterinary officers in accordance with a veterinary prescription or to persons known to and nominated by a veterinary officer.  Cattle identification cards will be endorsed with the name of the substance used and the date on which the withdrawal period will expire. A veterinary officer may not issue a prescription if the ID cards are not presented to him.  The sale for slaughter of an animal for which a withdrawal period has not elapsed will be an offence, as will the sale of meat which contains residues.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of improvements in the inspection and testing procedures for meat from slaughtering premises which cater for the domestic market has been under consideration for some time.  My Department have had discussions in the matter with the Department of Health and other interests concerned and a survey of all the slaughtering premises has been carried out by veterinary <Col N="2048" /> officers of my Department.  There are nearly one thousand such premises altogether and the results of the survey are now being analysed.  When this analysis is completed it is envisaged that there will be further discussions with the interests concerned with a view to the introduction of necessary modifications and improvements. The proposed control measures on the sale, distribution, use and residue monitoring of antibiotics and hormone implants, which I announced recently, will have a direct bearing on these follow-up discussions and any changes made.</P>
      <P>I should say, however, that since meat for home consumption is derived from animals coming from the same farms from which the export market is supplied, it is reasonable to assume that the high standards of quality disclosed by tests on meat consigned for export also apply to meat destined for the home market.</P>

I would point out that originally the Commission's proposals give a bare outline of price increases, merely indicating that the increase will be 5 or 6 per cent or perhaps that there will be no increase.  All the various small deals regarding cost premiums, subsidies for lime, for A1 and so on are worked out in the latter stages of the price negotiations.

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The present strategy for the eradication of bovine tuberculosis is based on an annual round of testing of herds.  Reactor herds are subjected to repeated tests and herds contiguous to them are specially tested as a precautionary measure.  Programmes of special check tests are carried out in badly-infected areas.  These measures are supplemented by a requirement that cattle over six weeks of age must have passed a TB test in the previous 30 days before movement out of a herd.</P>
      <P>I will be reviewing this strategy and the overall operation of the scheme in the light of the progress achieved at the end of the present round of testing which is due to finish early in the new year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied that the rate of progress in the eradication of TB is satisfactory, though the progress in the eradication of brucellosis is satisfactory. It has been very successful but we are not content at all with the manner in which the disease eradication programme has <Col N="2056" /> progressed.  The incidence of TB amongst herds is 2.25 per cent.  For the round test for 1981-82, when the last full round took place, the incidence was 2.76 per cent. The 1980-81 round test indicated herd incidence of 2.11 per cent which is just less than the current figure.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, in view of the enormous cost to taxpayers, the great hardship to farmers and the health hazard to humans caused by the failure of the campaign to eliminate TB in cattle, he will now review the whole campaign and specify a date when TB will be finally eradicated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that the campaign to eliminate TB in cattle has been a failure although it may have been unsatisfactory in many aspects.  Since the scheme was introduced in 1954 significant progress has been achieved.  Incidence of TB in cattle has been reduced from 17 per cent to 0.2 per cent.  It is important that we do not get confused about the number of cattle affected and the number of herds affected.  The incidence of herds affected is more than 2 per cent but the incidence of cattle affected is 0.2 per cent. The Exchequer costs of the scheme must be related to this progress which guarantees for our cattle continued access to British, European and many other markets. In addition the risks to human health from bovine TB have been greatly reduced.</P>
      <P>In line with the experience in other countries which have carried out eradication programmes, the elimination of the final residues of TB infection is proving difficult.  Therefore, with a view to speeding up the eradication process I have already made arrangements to review all aspects of the bovine tuberculosis scheme when the current round of testing ends early in the new year.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commend the Minister for taking the positive step of reviewing the scheme.  I should like to know what the Minister views as failures.  The scheme set out to eradicate <Col N="2060" /> bovine TB but it has not been eradicated after almost 30 years.  Surely the Minister will agree that that amounts to a failure. Is the Minister aware the Exchequer costs, updated to 1983 figures, would amount to £1,000 million?  Does the Minister consider that such expenditure was worthwhile as far as farmers, taxpayers and consumers are concerned, the losers in all this?  Is there a racket in the whole scheme and whose racket is it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not deny my own suspicion that there is a certain amount of sharp practice, but it is unfair to lump everybody involved into that accusation. Virtually all farmers are anxious to have the disease eradicated and the majority of vets are of the same view.  They mean to do a good job.  However, there have been abuses of this scheme and a television programme on the subject about six months ago indicated some of the obvious sources of abuse.  I will be looking at that in the course of my review.  I should like to tell the Deputy that I am not competent to give an up-to-date cost. The figure given by the Deputy is an estimate.  The determination of the cost in today's financial terms is better left to the Minister for Finance.  I do not think it could be said that the scheme was a failure although I accept it has not been as satisfactory as it should have been. The statistics quoted at the outset qualify that statement.  In 1954 the incidence of TB in cattle was 17 per cent and today it is 0.2 per cent.  That was a considerable reduction.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the following Order in draft:</P>
      <P>Double Taxation Relief (Taxes on Income and Capital) (Australia) Order, 1983,</P>
      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on the 29th day of November, 1983.</P>
      <P>The agreement between Ireland and Australia was signed on behalf of the respective Governments on 31 May 1983 at Canberra.  The White Paper containing the text of the convention was laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 25 October 1983.</P>
      <P>Under the Income Tax Act, 1967, an arrangement with a foreign Government to afford relief from double taxation will have force of law in Ireland provided the Government make an order accordingly. Before such an order can be made it must be laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann and a resolution approving it must be passed by the House.</P>
      <P>The draft order was laid before the Dáil on 29 November 1983 and contains in its Schedule the text of the agreement. An Explanatory Memorandum which outlines the effects of the agreement has also been circulated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Ireland, the agreement will be effective for income tax and capital gains tax for any year of assessment <Col N="2292" /> beginning on or after 6 April in the calendar year following that in which the agreement enters into force.  For corporation tax purposes the agreement will have effect for any financial year beginning on or after 1 January in the calendar year immediately following that in which the agreement enters into force.</P>
    <P>The agreement follows the general principles of the Model Convention published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 1977. Generally, the agreement provides that when double taxation of income or gains arises relief will be given by the country of residence in respect of tax borne on the same income or gains in the country of source.  I will briefly outline the main features of the agreement.</P>
    <P>Article 4 provides a series of tests, in accordance with the OECD model, to determine for an individual the allocation of residence for the purposes of the agreement to one or other of the countries. This article also provides that where a person other than an individual &mdash; for example, a company &mdash; is resident in both countries that person will be deemed to be a resident of the country in which its place of effective management is situated.</P>
    <P>Article 11 provides for payment to Australian resident portfolio investors of a tax credit in respect of Irish dividends, subject to a tax charge at a rate not exceeding 15 per cent on the aggregate of the dividend and the tax credit.  Portfolio investors are investors owning less than ten per cent of the voting power in the dividend paying company.  In the case of a direct investor, that is an investor controlling, directly or indirectly, at least 10 per cent of the voting power in the company which pays the dividend, no payment of a tax credit will be made by Ireland.</P>
    <P>In the case of dividends paid by an Australian company to an Irish resident, the rate of Australian withholding tax is not to exceed 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends</P>
    <P>Under Article 14, income or gains arising from the disposal of real property as defined in the article may be taxed in the country in which the property is situated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2293" /> Income or gains from the disposal of property, other than real property, will normally be taxable only in the country of residence of the alienator.</P>
    <P>Article 19 has a special provision relating to governmental or local authority pensions which secures that such pensions will be taxable only in the country of residence of the individual.  The OECD Model Convention and the double taxation arrangements Ireland has negotiated with other countries usually reserve the right to tax these pensions to the country paying the pension.  However, a change was included in this agreement to accommodate the Australian approach which is that, as far as possible, pensioners should have to deal with only one tax administration.  Other pensions and annuities will, as is normally the case, be taxable in the country of residence.</P>
    <P>Article 25 is the general article dealing with the elimination of double taxation. Where elimination of double taxation has not been accomplished by other articles of the agreement or by the domestic law of either country, Article 25 ensures that double taxation does not arise.  Broadly, it provides for reciprocal relief of double taxation by means of the &ldquo;credit method&rdquo;, under which the country of residence allows against its own tax on income or gains from sources in the other country, a credit for the tax of the other country on that income or gain.</P>
    <P>In particular, the benefit of Irish tax incentive reliefs for an Australian company with a branch in Ireland will be preserved under the terms of the agreement. This position will also apply to Irish dividends received by Australian companies as under Australian domestic law no tax is effectively charged on these dividends.  If there is any change in Australian domestic law in regard to giving relief for dividends, negotiations are to take place to establish new provisions concerning the credit to be allowed by Australia against its tax on the dividends.</P>
    <P>Article 29 covers the entry into force of the agreement.  The usual provision is made in this Article so that the agreement will enter into force upon an exchange of instruments of ratification between the two countries.  This new <Col N="2294" /> agreement brings our double taxation arrangements with Australia into line with our arrangements with other countries and with international practice generally.</P>
    <P>I recommend that the House approve the draft order.</P>
    <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Title>Fóir Teoranta (Amendment) Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: That the Bill be now read a Second Time.</P>
      <P>Fóir Teoranta was established in 1972 to provide finance for industrial concerns which might be in danger of having to close down or suspend activities because of inability to obtain their financial requirements from the normal commercial sources.  In order to be eligible for assistance from Fóir, a concern must comply with certain requirements which have been specified by the Oireachtas. The employment content and the capital employed in it must be significant either nationally or locally and the owners must have made a reasonable contribution to the total capital.  Furthermore, failure to receive financial assistance must have serious repercussions at national or local level.  Finally, and of greatest importance in most cases, the concern must have reasonable prospects of profitability on a permanent basis.  To date, Fóir has assisted about 450 concerns, almost half of them on more than one occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an enormous increase in Fóir's spending on rescue cases in recent years.  In 1981 Fóir spent £4.8 million. In 1982 annual spending had grown to £14.1 million and this year's outturn is likely to be as high as £23 million.  All of this is a reflection of the deep recession which has had such a severe impact on our manufacturing sector over the past few years.  Indeed, I would remind the House that when the legislation which fixed the present limit on Fóir's borrowing powers was brought before the Dáil two years ago, the view taken was that the increased limits would suffice for a further four or five years.  Yet in the period of less than two years since that <Col N="2295" /> Bill became law, Fóir's spending has accelerated to such an extent that the present statutory limits of £70 million on both Exchequer advances and borrowing powers will very shortly be reached.  The primary purpose of this Bill is to increase these limits to enable Fóir's operations to continue without interruption.</P>
    <P>The period since the passage of the last Fóir legislation has seen some major developments for the company itself. When Fóir was established more than ten years ago, it made a contract with the Industrial Credit Company under which the ICC provided management services, including staff.  This agreement was terminated by mutual consent earlier this year.  The decision to terminate the agreement was taken by Fóir's board of directors in the context of a general reorganisation and expansion of the company to meet the increased demand for their services.  Fóir now have separate divisions dealing with new clients and with the monitoring of existing clients.  Their management executive unit have also been doubled in size.  This is an especially significant development since management problems are generally regarded as a major cause of difficulties experienced by industrial concerns.  Fóir, through their expanded management unit, are now much better equipped to probe management weaknesses in companies requesting assistance, to advise on organisational and management changes required as a precondition for a financial rescue package and to work closely with the company in carrying through these changes.</P>
    <P>Another important development has been Fóir's decision to discontinue publishing the names of their clients so as to enable the company's relationship with their clients to be on the same footing as that of other financial institutions.  The board of Fóir emphasised the importance of this change on several occasions both to me and to my predecessor.  They are satisfied that this decision has already had a beneficial effect in that it has made firms less reluctant to approach the company, thereby enabling Fóir to help them before their positions have become irretrievable. <Col N="2296" /> I am aware that some Deputies are unhappy at the non-disclosure of the names of companies receiving financial assistance but if, as Fóir say, its effect has been to encourage more firms to seek assistance before it is too late, thus saving badly needed jobs, then I believe it will be seen as being a positive development.</P>
    <P>There has always been close co-operation between Fóir and the Industrial Development Authority in rescue activity. Both agencies are conscious of the need at all times to strengthen and formalise this co-operation.  In this context, I am happy to be able to tell the House that earlier this year Fóir and the IDA negotiated liaison arrangements which provide that Fóir take the lead role in normal rescue cases where the objective is to ensure the survival of potentially viable existing business concerns while the IDA are primarily responsible for takeover, joint venture and similar cases. Over time, I expect this agreement should increase still further the effectiveness of the State rescue services.</P>
    <P>Deputies on both sides of the House will appreciate that, because of the nature of the company's operations and objectives, Fóir have a particularly difficult task.  We can all be satisfied, however, that Fóir carry out their functions conscientiously and that they consider applications for assistance throughly and with a full understanding of all the implications of their decisions.  I would like to pay a personal tribute to the board and staff of Fóir for the understanding and indeed imagination which they bring to their task.  In 1982 alone, the board of Fóir approved assistance amounting to almost £23 million for 84 concerns employing almost 8,000 workers.  There will be an even higher level of activity in 1983.  This clearly demonstrates the importance of Fóir's activities and their impact on both production and employment. It is particularly important that we have an effective agency of this kind in today's difficult economic circumstances.</P>
    <P>Fóir's operations inevitably give rise to a cost to the Exchequer and thus to the taxpayer.  At the end of 1982, Fóir had a cumulative deficit of almost £20 million. The cost of Fóir's operations are reflected <Col N="2297" /> in one of the provisions of this Bill which relieves Fóir of the liability to repay more than £10 million in Exchequer advances. Similar provisions will arise in future Fóir legislation.  Deputies will appreciate that this situation is an inevitable result of Fóir's role as a lender of last report.  The fact that the costs are not higher is a tribute to Fóir's diligence in operating its statutory criterion of helping only potentially viable firms.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the provisions of this Bill. The primary purpose of the Bill, as I have said, is to raise the existing statutory limits of £70 million on Fóir's borrowings and on Exchequer advances to Fóir. These advances are Fóir's only source of borrowings.  Its borrowings from the Exchequer now amount to more than £62 million.  Sections 3 and 4 of the Bill provide respectively that these limits be increased to £150 million.  I should mention that for convenience a technical change is being made in relation to the limits which has the effect of bringing the outstanding borrowings of £6.3 million which Fóir took over from its predecessor, Taiscí Stáit, within the overall borrowings and Exchequer advances ceilings for the first time.</P>
    <P>I should mention also that section 5 of the Bill discharges the company from the liability to repay £10.24 million in Exchequer advances in respect of amounts which Fóir has formally written-off in its accounts up to end-1982 and certain amounts which, although not formally written-off, are now regarded as irrecoverable.  Taking account of these various provisions, the net effect of this Bill is to increase Fóir's borrowing capacity by about £84 million.  This should be sufficient to meet the company's requirements for the next three to four years, particularly as the beneficial effects of the emerging improvement in the world economic situation begin to be felt here in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill provides for an increase in the maximum number of directors of the company from seven to nine.  The purpose of this proposal is to enable representatives of the Departments of Finance and Industry and Energy to be appointed to the Fóir <Col N="2298" /> board.  The nature of Fóir's activities is such as to require close ongoing contact with these Departments.  This close relationship is indeed already reflected in the administrative arrangement, introduced on Fóir's establishment, under which the prior approval of the Ministers for Finance and Industry is required before Fóir can provide assistance above a certain limit.  Because of Fóir's increased importance to industry and the resultant implications for both the Exchequer and industrial policy, it is now opportune to strengthen these contacts by placing departmental representatives on the Fóir Board.  I am confident that this provision will contribute further to the better co-ordination of assistance from public resources.  I would stress the point that the intention of this measure is to improve that co-ordination to improve and heighten the level of both co-operation and understanding as between the board of Fóir and the two Ministers primarily responsible for its activities so that in the interests of everybody concerned a more efficient and expeditious job can be done.</P>
    <P>It would be possible to accommodate Departmental representatives by reducing the number of directors from the business world.  Such a move would, however, deprive the board of some of the expertise of such directors whose practical experience has been invaluable to the company.  For that reason, I consider the alternative of increasing the size of the board as being more appropriate in the circumstances and as being the course of action most calculated to allow us to continue to have the benefit of the advice and experience of people who have spent all their working lives in business activity.</P>
    <P>Sections 6 and 7 are intended to make certain of Fóir's remuneration and superannuation arrangements subject to the approval of the Ministers for Finance and for the Public Service.  The provisions are those generally applicable to commercial State bodies.  It is opportune to introduce these provisions for Fóir at this stage in view of the reorganisation of the company to which I have already referred. These provisions essentially put into a legislative framework powers which the <Col N="2299" /> Minister for Finance already has under Fóir's Memorandum and Articles of Association.</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, there is an administrative limit above which Fóir requires prior ministerial approval before making funds available.  This limit was increased from £250,000 to £1 million following the enactment of the last Fóir legislation early last year.  I propose to make no change in the limit for the present.</P>
    <P>In summary, the purpose of this Bill is to enable Fóir Teoranta to continue its vital operations.  Accordingly, I commend it to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister in introducing the Bill indicated that Fóir has a particularly difficult job, like so much that comes from the Minister, it was a masterful understatement.  I would like in the first instance to make the point that the Bill we are now discussing is one that warrants major consideration of this House not just over days but over a number of weeks, not so as to enable us here to look at the details of the Bill, which are not too complex, but so that this House would have an opportunity, quite frankly, of looking at the situation, with our native industry particularly, which is demonstrated very clearly in the figures the Minister himself has mentioned in introducing the Bill.  It is time that we had a full debate in this House on the total failure of Government policies to create a climate in which industry, and particularly native industry, can survive much less thrive and that is what this Bill is about.</P>
      <P>The Minister's opening speech highlights the fact that whatever we are going to do here by agreement at this stage&mdash; and I am not going to make Fóir's role more difficult by opposing this Bill &mdash; but whatever we are going to do by agreement will unfortunately only be remedying after the event.  Let me demonstrate from the Minister's own figures.  I am quoting where he says, in paragraph 2:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been an enormous increase in Fóir's spending on rescue <Col N="2300" /> cases in recent years: in 1981 Fóir spent £4.8 million.  In 1982 annual spending had grown to £14.1 million and this year's outturn is likely to be as high as £23 million.</P>
    <P>Further on, the Minister indicated that Fóir had at the end of 1982 a cumulative deficit of almost £20 million.  So, there we get a stark admission on the part of the Minister that within two years the rescue operation necessary to help some of these industries to survive &mdash; and we are talking basically in almost all of these cases of native industries &mdash; increased four to fivefold. The Minister, I have to suggest, is being unduly optimistic in the light of current policies &mdash; I should not say being pursued &mdash; but not being pursued and the lack of any overall policy.  He is being optimistic in his assessment that the extended borrowing capacity we are now prepared to agree to will last for four years at current trends.  If the rate of demand on Fóir Teoranta continues at the level experienced over the last two years, it is regrettable but it is true that within two years again the Minister of the day&mdash;and the indications are that it will be a Minister of a different side&mdash;will be coming back asking again for an increase in the borrowing capacity of Fóir because of the lack of any management policies in this Government and particularly in the Minister who, unfortunately now appears to be too busily engaged elsewhere to deal with this very important legislation in this House.  It is the Government who have ordered the business of this day and if the Minister who is responsible for Fóir Teoranta cannot, frankly, manage his business, as we have had to do, so as to be here for this debate, it is too bad, because it is obviously as a result of a policy that might be identified with what is seen simply as a policy of fiscal orthodoxy&mdash;which, of course, is not the policy in any event&mdash;that we are in here today discussing this inadequate response to Irish industry.  It gives me no pleasure to say from this side of the House, because there is enough depression around the place, that wherever you turn in these days you find that the statistics, the indicators, are all in one direction.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2301" /> It is not enough for a Government to draw up a series of reports, analyses, to ask committees of various types to look at trends and to inform us, as they have in the last week, that the trend will continue &mdash; I am talking about the drastic unemployment trend &mdash; until 1992.  That is the kind of comment that one might expect from the OECD, from economists, from others whose role it is objectively to analyse, in the absence of corrective policies, what the trend will be; but it is not what one expects from Government.  The people have been waiting 12 months for this Government &mdash; and the events of recent days, with which I will not deal, out of charity as much as anything else, underline this &mdash; to supply what has been lacking &mdash; any central, co-ordinated, agreed policy which would create the conditions in which the Irish people themselves would respond and do it for themselves.  That is not what has happened.  Let me just say in passing &mdash; because I will deal with it further during the course of the Adjournment debate &mdash; we have waited for this Bill for some time; we have waited also for the Estimates for some time.</P>
    <P>If we are looking for a sign of management policy, from the Government from the Estimates that have been published, I am afraid we had better tell all of those who believe that our resources should be developed to bring us through this recession that the Government are turning their backs on any such hope or direction.  Fisheries is down in real terms, forestry is down in money terms, education, the real guarantee for the future, is down and agriculture is down.  What is growing?  This seems to be the characteristic of this administration, the administrative costs of trying to convey the notion that we are providing services for the unemployed, which are of no consequence if the climate for industry in this context is not such as to encourage people to go and do it for themselves.  The fall off in investment in industry is so bad at the moment that we are now at a level of just over 22 or 23 per cent of our GNP. This figure compares unfavourably with every year with the exception of the <Col N="2302" /> depressing years of the mid-seventies. The downturn in investment in this country at the moment is one of the clearest indicators that confidence is missing and that those who should be encouraged to go and do it for themselves and for the rest of us have no such intention.</P>
    <P>There was a very interesting set of articles in <i>The Irish Times</i> about the climate for business activities.  A couple of matters emerged very clearly from those articles.  If you have a person with a project with the expertise, the entrepreneurial interest and the determination to deal with it, before that person starts, as a person in one of those articles indicated, he must have the services of an accountant, preferably as a member of the company, to bring him through the maze of the tax laws, the tax provisions, the PRSI and the VAT.  All of those have been increasing at such a rate in recent times that before such a man begins to start he should, first of all, consider the cost of this enormous State burden on his effort and the disincentive effect of this.  It is not surprising that even the money provided for the IDA and SFADCo in relation to advance factories is being wasted at the moment.  We have advance factories in our constituencies but we cannot get businessmen or investors who are foolhardy enough to go in at this time and use them.  We can build the advance factories, we can use them for storage, we can tarmacadam the entrances, have nice entrances and layouts but people are not using the advance factories.  This is the position in relation to new industry, never mind the position of existing industries.</P>
    <P>I want to make two preliminary points in relation to our attitude to this Bill over and above the general criticism I want to make of Government policy, which I will follow through later on the Adjournment Debate.  One relates specifically to employment in industry.  An issue which arises in this case is the whole question of the role of the State and semi-State bodies and the confidence we repose in them, the particular responsibility which they have and in this case the responsibility which Fóir Teoranta have had delegated to them since 1970 since this Bill <Col N="2303" /> was first introduced.  The Minister is proposing a few things.  He will add two civil servants to the board of Fóir Teoranta, one from the Department of Finance and one from the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism, thereby ensuring that, whatever degree of independence, autonomy or capacity to react to events would be demonstrated by the activities of this board, that will be undermined under the enveloping role of an administration which is growing and growing.  The basic independence of these State bodies, which were particularly underlined when this Bill was introduced, is now being undermined.</P>
    <P>I am trying to find the source in relation to the attitude taken by the Government when they were in Opposition and the Fóir Teoranta Bill was introduced.  We will see what was said by the Minister's party when this Bill was introduced in 1970.  I will quote from Volume 256 of the Official Report of 1971.  The Bill was introduced then so that we could have a new body that would be able to respond quickly and that would be linked in to the needs of industry because of the expertise the people on the boards would have in business themselves, so that it would be removed from the administrative preoccupation, which was a characteristic of Taiscí Stáit Teoranta, Fóir Teoranta's predecessor.</P>
    <P>The purpose of the Bill was to ensure that Fóir Teoranta would not only be aware of the problems but, having regard to the expertise of the people on the board, would be equipped from their experience to deal with those problems. When the late Deputy Colley introduced the Bill here he got full support from all sides of the House.  The present Minister for Defence had very encouraging words to say at that time for the then Minister and the approach he was taking in bringing about a better type of representation on the board and, particularly, making it more sensitive to the needs of industry as distinct from the conservative approach that had been adopted by Taiscí Stáit Teoranta.</P>
    <P>It is very important that the actual references are stitched into the record of the <Col N="2304" /> House to demonstrate that this particular Bill is moving in the other direction in ensuring that we have two further representatives from the Department of Finance and the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism not just to monitor what is happening on the board but to guarantee that the board are subject immediately to expenditure control and a naturally fiscal preoccupation, which I understand perfectly well from my time in the Department, of the Department of Finance, but not such as to enable the board to react in the way that was intended when the Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>In the Official Report of 17 November 1971, Volume 256, column 2215, Deputy Cooney said in relation to the constitution of the board at that stage:</P>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister is going to constitute the new board.  As he indicated, up to now the board has been comprised of civil servants &mdash; the secretaries of four Departments.  Without any disrespect to the gentlemen of the present board, people of wider commercial experience would be required.  I think the Minister should consider as members of this board people who are prepared to experiment in matters of industrial management, who are willing to get away from the traditional management philosophies we have had in this country and which we have had to import from differently structured societies because of the size of our country and the average size of firms.</P>
    <P>At column 2212 of the same volume he said in relation to the orthodox approach which was being adopted hitherto by Taiscí Stáit which was, as he indicated, controlled almost by the civil service at the time:</P>
    <P>In the past few years, as the Minister pointed out, the direction of Taiscí Stáit in involvement and investment has been in fire brigade operations rescuing firms on their last legs.  The Minister has indicated this has not been very profitable, not through any fault of Taiscí Stáit, but because the firms concerned have left their approach for help too late....</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2305" /> He went on to indicate that the orthodox and conservative commercial criteria being applied by Taiscí Stáit up to this were not appropriate to the needs of industry at that stage, that the approach adopted was too conservative and &ldquo;too bureaucratic&rdquo;.  He was supported by Deputy Tully who represented the Labour Party in Opposition at that time. They described the approach of Taiscí Stáit as being too conservative and, without being ultra-critical of civil servants, questioned whether they were the people equipped to deal with the needs of industry. That was the position argued by the Opposition of that time in support of the Bill being introduced by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Colley.  All the reasons they gave then are equally valid now.</P>
    <P>What is the purpose of this Minister and this Government in ensuring that they will have a greater degree of direct representation from the civil service? What is that purpose in the light of the need to ensure that Fóir Teoranta are capable, through the representation on the board, of acting quickly and effectively in the rescue operation for which they were launched?  What is their purpose, having regard to the track record of this Government in relation to State boards?</P>
    <P>We have seen in recent times indications of what this Government think about the autonomy of State boards. They can be autonomous so long as the membership on those boards happens to coincide with the views of Government as to the suitability of the people involved.  It is clear that this Government particularly have one end in view and that is to undermine what always was the respected tradition and precedent of Government succeeding another Government and to ensure that wherever there seemed to be a balance of Fianna Fáil Government nominees they must be removed.  The board that looks like being a Fianna Fáil board must be dealt with. Some type of implication that they will not discharge their responsibilities properly prompted the extraordinary decision of the then Minister to endeavour &mdash;<Col N="2306" /> because he has not been quite successful yet &mdash; to abolish An Board Pleanála without adhering to the terms of the legislation under which that board was set up. The terms of that legislation provided that if members of the board were to be removed from office the stated reasons should be notified to them and also to this House.  That was not the way this Government went about it.  No stated reasons were notified to the members or to this House and suddenly the members are fired, but of course the matter is now <i>sub judice</i>, not surprisingly.  We will wait to see whether the Judiciary take the same view as to the autonomy of State boards who have not a majority of appointees from this Government.</P>
    <P>Whatever the rights or wrongs, one thing has resulted from the Udarás na Gaeltachta debacle.  Udarás na Gaeltachta have been undermined.  Confidence in their capacity by industrialists or investors has been undermined.  These trends, taken in conjunction with what the Government are now proposing to appropriate to civil servants who will be immediately amenable to the direction of the Ministers involved, never mind the appointments made from time to time, indicate quite clearly that the whole role of the State boards is being undermined without any review of Government policy in relation to that role.  We on this side of the House would welcome an opportunity to review the role of the administration generally and of the semi-State sector also in many areas.  We are prepared to take a very responsible and, I hope, consistent approach in relation to the level of public expenditure being applied, the answerability of these companies to this Oireachtas and to the people through this Oireachtas, to ensure that not one penny of taxpayers' money is wasted.  I will go along with the Government on that if they bring in here some general policy in relation to State bodies that we would now, late in 1983, be allowed to consider and analyse.  Some of those bodies had been allowed to be very successful in the sixties and seventies.  The role of Government and Parliament is to review the role of these bodies, but this party will not go along with this kind of chipping <Col N="2307" /> away of individual State bodies in the exercise of their executive functions to ensure that they are brought into the maw of the Government in every possible area.  We will not go along with the appointment to these boards of people nominated from outside who would have a certain sympathy for Government policy nor with the overloading of the boards with civil servants who will diligently do the job required of them.  Nothing I say here is to be taken as undue criticism of civil servants as such.  I have had the experience of working with them for a considerable time and I know the capacity they have and the motivation that can exist among them, but if more of them are appointed to State boards the reaction of the private sector to what they would see as the Government bureaucratic control will be strong.</P>
    <P>At the moment Fóir Teoranta are handling about 200 cases per annum.  The pattern used to be that after the rescue effort was tried approximately one-third of the firms would have to be dissolved in liquidation or otherwise, approximately one-third remained marginal for some time and one-third survived and became healthy.  Unfortunately the indications now are that the percentage of firms who will have to close will grow, those marginal companies are finding it more difficult to stave off closure and those surviving find it very difficult to survive, never mind to thrive.  This is because of a most unfavourable climate for investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the economic recovery, implying that the problems of industry will fade away in the next few years.  Even if the Minister is not aware of it, economic recovery has been underway in the United States, which country has a major impact on the world economy, in Japan, in the Federal Republic of Germany and even in Britain. The trends are favourable particularly for an open trading economy such as ours.  Demand is growing and representatives of the FUE or the CII will confirm that at this stage demand is buoyant. The problem they face is to satisfy that demand at a level that will not drive <Col N="2308" /> them further into debt because of the excessive costs here and the unduly unhealthy climate for industrial activity.</P>
    <P>Does one have to mention the level of indirect taxation which is oppressive in the extreme in comparison with other countries?  Does one have to mention the level of direct taxation?  As I told the Minister at the beginning of the year, not surprisingly the income tax yield is lower than the figure for which the Minister budgeted.  Does one need to mention the levies imposed on industry and the extra costs of electricity, transport and so on? All these factors make it impossible for our industry to avail of opportunities that exist now.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his colleagues in Government should turn their attention to this matter.  They have been in office for a year but they have not yet come forward with any policy in this area.  Yesterday Deputy Cluskey spoke about the Joint Programme for Government and what it did not include.  He feels free to be critical of the lack of an adequate programme in relation to our resources. Of course there was no agreement in relation to that matter in the joint programme. They were too busy agreeing about matters that do not matter.  We are all aware of the little sop about the income related property tax &mdash; the major achievement of the Labour Party.  At the end of the day perhaps we will get £400,000 or £500,000 out of that tax, but what was not in the programme and is not there now is an overall agreement on the development of industry, agriculture, fisheries, forestry and education.  They have no policy to which the people can respond and that is why we are here today, reacting to the growing problems of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>When Fóir Teoranta come into the picture they do so at a late stage.  I agree that Fóir Teoranta try to promote the idea that their services, as distinct from their rescue element, should be sought much earlier than has been the case up to recently.  It is not right to wait until the liquidator is about to come in before calling on the services of Fóir Teoranta. Their services, particularly in the management advisory area, are quite sophisticated <Col N="2309" /> and I should like to compliment the organisation on developments here. Firms should call on them much earlier than has been the practice.  By the time many companies come to Fóir Teoranta they already have commitments to the banks who will be the first creditors with legal rights to take certain actions.  I know that Fóir Teoranta consult with the banks to get a certain understanding from them that they will not move in to liquidate their assets while Fóir Teoranta are engaged in their rescue operation.  However, in view of recent events with regard to the chipboard firm, where the Government were the majority shareholders, can we be assured that the banks will not be encouraged to take the action they are entitled to take as the secured creditors with the first right to realise their assets? What guarantee do we have that the State will not sit back, leaving Fóir Teoranta with no guarantee to protect the industry concerned?  What will happen if the banks decide to realise their assets by putting a firm into liquidation?</P>
    <P>The banks are in a privileged position in our society.  Our financial structures give the associated banks in particular a very privileged position in relation to, say, rates of interest which are fixed after consultation with the Central Bank. However, the obligation that follows from that privilege cannot be discharged by the banks encouraging people to borrow in good times and then taking action against them in bad times.  In this connection I am referring to farmers, small builders, agricultural contractors or business people.  I hope we will have an opportunity in this House in the near future to look at the role of the banks and the structure of our financial institutions. I have never tried to argue against profits in the banking sector but they should not be realised in good times and secured in bad times by the liquidation of companies.  That is something about which one cannot feel too reassured having regard to developments in relation to the chipboard factory recently.  In that case the Government, although they were the majority shareholder, did nothing to head off that difficulty.</P>
    <P>I should like to make the point that the <Col N="2310" /> export trends have been reasonably encouraging for the manufacturing industry in recent times.  But we might as well recognise &mdash; and the Minister should also recognise this &mdash; that the growth is due almost entirely to new industries brought in here in the sixties and seventies, especially technological, pharmaceutical and the para-medical industries. Although I do not want to make party politics, all the industries which the Government have been boasting about are attributable to the Fianna Fáil Government.  If you inquire as to the trends of any of the established industries it is clear that, far from growth, it is quite the reverse.  The food industry, the drink and tobacco industry, the textile industry, the clothing, leather and footwear industry, the timber industry, the paper and printing industry are not experiencing any growth.  They are more and more calling on the services of Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>In 1973 there were approximately 213,000 people employed in manufacturing industry.  In 1983 there is a very considerable drop which brings the figure down to 195,000 people employed in the manufacturing industry.  We should remember that the figure includes all the new industries which were brought in since 1973.  The level of employment in manufacturing industry has dropped and yet the Government are supposed to be concerned about unemployment or, looking at it more positively, with policies for employment.  Even in 1979 the level of employment in total manufacturing industries was in excess of that in 1973. It was approximately 219,000 by December 1979.</P>
    <P>They are the numbers employed, but do the Government know that we have a growth area here apart from the black economy?  We have a growth area in our population and if the employment level is dropping in net terms to the extent that it has in the last ten years and there is growth in the labour market, clearly the trend in unemployment will continue to expand, as even the Government have mildly acknowledged, until 1992.  With these kinds of policies it will not end in 1992, if we ever get that far, if the social <Col N="2311" /> order and the stability of society is not undermined in the meantime.</P>
    <P>That is why all the efforts of Fóir Teoranta, unfortunately, will not enable industry to overcome their problems. The best opportunity and assistance to industry is to create a climate in which they will do it themselves.  A small businessman in his own town with a sense of commitment from his work force will do it.  You and I, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, know this because we have seen them grow in our towns.  However, if you ask them now to invest in further expansion they will tell you fairly smartly where to go with your advice.  They will launch nothing now.  We are waiting with all the empty shelves, SFADCo bays and IDA factories.  I am afraid we will be waiting much longer unless the Government create some kind of climate to avail of the boom &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; that is now under way in the United States of America.  If the Minister went to Shannon or Dublin Airports any day he would see small business people going out there for three or six months and investing in the new economic boom.  It is not just banks which are involved, printing and stationery businesses are also involved. They are investing in America and in Britain, and who is to say they are wrong?</P>
    <P>In December 1979, when I was Minister for Finance, although that is not the reason I am mentioning these figures, the level of unemployment was 85,000.  Now it is well over 200,000 and growing, like the black economy.  What has been happening to industry?  The Minister will find figures in the Industrial News Report No. 39 of 19 October 1983 which says that company closures are increasing at an alarming rate.  The latest figures released by Dun and Bradstreet, publishers of <i>Stubbs Gazette</i>, show that the number of company collapses is increasing at an alarming rate.  Figures for September show that 54 firms went into liquidation, receivership or were wound up.  This represents an increase of up to 26 per cent on the same period last year and that surely is a growth area.  Broken down, that means that 35 firms went into liquidation, 13 had receivers appointed and <Col N="2312" /> six were wound up.  The picture for the first nine months of this year is not encouraging.  During this period a total of 574 firms went to the wall compared with 518 firms in the same period last year.  The worst affected areas were manufacturing, construction, wholesalers and retailers.  It is no wonder, having regard to the level of indirect taxation.  General services and engineering are also affected.  We are aware of that problem in view of the extraordinary decision of the Government in their public expenditure allocations to cut back on the capital programme for development of roads, housing and so on, and to waste it in other areas.  Garages and the hotel sector are also suffering.</P>
    <P>The prediction for 1983, unfortunately, is not much better.  Dun and Bradstreet say that up to 800 companies will collapse before the end of the year, a rise of about 15 per cent on last year's figures. If you think of the effect of a 15 per cent rise on a diminishing number of survivors the impact should hit even this Government and bring home to them that they just cannot sit back and wait for others to suggest, in committees and otherwise, how to solve the problem.  Something much more direct is called for from the Government in terms of their fiscal and taxation policies, which everybody now realises has been the biggest single disincentive to industry.  The complexity of taxation, which the Commission on Taxation recognised when I established them in 1979 has increased much more since then.</P>
    <P>All of these factors are driving industry to the wall as any Deputy with experience will realise.  Apart from the problems created by the Revenue Commissioners for industrialists, their greatest problem these days is in coping with those who are there to help from the State side.  These agencies are proliferating at such a rate under this Government that any small industry would almost need a separate section to deal with them.  To that extent, I would put the word assistance in inverted commas.  Is it not time that on both sides we had a good look at this whole area and acknowledged that the role of Government is not necessarily to <Col N="2313" /> convey the notion that they are providing assistance, services and advice?  President Reagan may not have been too far wrong when he said, &ldquo;get the Government off your backs&rdquo;.  Instead of nailing industrialists to the ground with taxation, with bureaucratic forms and so on, we should create a climate in which they know that when they develop their ideas, their efforts will be rewarded in terms of profit, not only for the investor but for the worker.  The tax level is hitting both investor and worker equally.  Instead of this bringing about a degree of cohesion in common suffering, it is creating further tensions and divisions as between employers and employees and that is something that we need least of all at this stage.</P>
    <P>We have a level of income which is about half that of countries with the same degree of public expenditure as we have. There are other ways of considering the situation.  If we take public expenditure, most of which goes towards feeding the administration, as a proportion of GNP for this year we find that it is of the order of 70 per cent while the corresponding figure for 1970 was 37 per cent.  If we take those countries with a low level of public expenditure in proportion to GNP, we find that those are the ones which had the biggest rate of income growth in the past ten years.  This is according to OECD figures.  We find that those with a level of public expenditure in proporation to GNP of below 30 per cent have a growth rate in real income of more than 5½ per cent, while those in respect of whom the corresponding figure is more than 50 per cent &mdash; and we are well above that &mdash; have a growth rate in real income of marginally 1 per cent on average.  Does that not indicate that the growth of administration is the problem and not the solution?  This Bill is merely moving in the traditional way.  There will be more administration and we will have two further representatives from the Civil Service to ensure that whatever autonomy, independence or effectiveness this body may have will be undermined.</P>
    <P>I trust that the scenario I am portraying is not too gloomy, but there is not much cause for optimism when we have regard <Col N="2314" /> to the fall-off in employment, the growth in unemployment and a dependency rate that is now the highest in the OECD countries.  For how long more are we going to merely sit back and engage in the kind of wasteful discussions with which this Government have been preoccupied in the past number of months? The level of dependency at 2.8 per cent or almost three dependants to each person at work refers not only to manufacturing productive employment but to the service industries and to the Public Service.  Do we really think that any economy can survive with that sort of trend?  Obviously, we have not been insulated against the economic recession.  I am not suggesting that all of this is attributable to the failure of Government policies, even the policies of this Government. Times are difficult for any Government but I am suggesting that in the face of the realities of the deepening recession here and the recovery outside, the inertia of this Government, their lack of direction, of policies and of motivation are killing the spirit of our people.  The Government do not even seem to be aware of this situation, much less have a plan to promote small industries, craft industries and so on.</P>
    <P>The level of VAT increases speaks for itself.  I recall telling the Minister for Finance on at least two or three occasions at the beginning of the year that to achieve the figure he mentioned in his budget statement in respect of VAT he did not need a 15 per cent increase all round.  I said that specifically at the beginning of the year on a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme in which the Minister for Finance took part also.  I have the transcripts and the Minister's response was that it was just as well I was not Minister for Finance if that was the way I did my calculations.</P>
    <P>Before the debate adjourns I shall read into the record exactly what the Minister said in this House on this matter.  In the course of the year I told him that on the basis of advice available to me, the sort of advice he must have ignored, the level of VAT he had imposed was far in excess of what he required to bring in the amount estimated in the budget in this <Col N="2315" /> respect.  The position now is that VAT is about £150 million in excess of what the Minister budgeted for.  I told him also that in view of the depressing effects of the policies being pursued by the Government, income tax receipts would be less because there would not be people to pay the tax.  The Minister would not accept that either, and we find now that the income tax receipts are down, not quite as much as the VAT receipts are up, but more or less of the same order.  To complete the picture, our appeals to the Minister in regard to the increases in excise duties and indirect taxation were ignored also.  We said that these increases would dampen the economy and kill the services and tourist industries as well as the drinks industry and all the others.  The Minister has one capacity and that is to become fixed in a certain way.  It is a condition that a Professor Laffer who is an adviser to President Regan has referred to as the MEGO or, my-eyes-glaze-over, complex. In other words, in concentrating on the budget deficit the Minister's eyes became glazed to the extent that he could see nothing else.  We have reached the point of diminishing returns in so far as excise duties are concerned.  Is it any wonder that apart from the black economy the biggest growth must be in the transport industry to Newry and Jonesboro?  People from the Republic are spending up to £2 million per day in those towns.  Fair weather to those who can buy the goods cheaper than the prices at which they are available here.  Unfortunately, it is not to the Exchequer that their payments are accruing but to the Exchequer of Her Majesty across the water.  There may be a new relationship between both Governments but I hope it does not get to the point that that relationship is based on the fact that we will have to contribute significantly more to their Exchequer than we do to our own. The reality is that in those three areas the Minister and the Government got it wrong.  Excise duties are much less than budgeted for and we told the Minister so. VAT will be much more than budgeted for and income tax will be less than budgeted for.  In those three instances we told <Col N="2316" /> the Minister that his figures were wrong.</P>

Later this evening I will have to consider the Estimates.  I am anxious to relate my contribution to the climate for industry.  What is happening is not just driving the fiscal policies of the Government off course but is damaging industry generally.  I should like to refer to an industry that should be included within the terms of reference of Fóir Teoranta, the hotel industry.  That industry is on its knees and figures issued by those involved clearly indicate that the level of unemployment is growing at a rate which is frightening, even in comparison with the rest of the industrial sector.  On the other hand the employment potential of that industry is considerable. One of the main reasons why the industry is on its knees is the level of indirect taxation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend finishing in a moment.  The Minister should consider extending the terms of reference of Fóir Teoranta to enable them to help the hotel industry in their rescue operations.  The Minister should also consider extending the terms of reference to include the <Col N="2317" /> building industry.  The projection for April next year in the building industry is that 54 per cent of its total work force will be unemployed.  Most of our major construction companies are investing abroad.  Hoteliers who can afford to are investing abroad also.  If we are talking in terms of employment we should consider taking real action to ensure that the potential all industries have, manufacturing, hotels, service and building, is utilised as distinct from being suffocated daily by Government policies.  The role of Government is to create a climate in which people will create jobs whether in their own communities or outside, but the Government have demonstrably failed in that role.  They do not have any management policy and there is no direction that anybody can respond to.  In the absence of any such policy or direction I plead with the Government to limit if possible, the impact of the negative policies in terms of the level of taxation. That is the way we can help native industry. The increased borrowing powers being given to Fóir Teoranta will not contribute as much to the success of that organisation as would a change in Government policies, or at least some evidence of a positive direction at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy O'Kennedy I shall confine my contribution to the terms of the Bill before us.  It was interesting to hear Deputy O'Kennedy's discourse on revenue returns, trade statistics and so on but in a confined debate like this it is more appropriate to deal with the terms of the legislation.  Fóir Teoranta, the State rescue bank, have performed an invaluable service since their inception in 1972.  I shall refer to the whole area of rescue and the areas where Fóir Teoranta can improve their operation and relationship with the public.  The whole economics of rescue add up.  We have the obvious social need to preserve employment but on purely financial criteria we have, through the efforts of Fóir Teoranta, been saving companies from going to the wall.  We have saved redundancy payments, a saving on social welfare payments that would have to be paid <Col N="2318" /> out, got added tax revenue in the form of PAYE and PRSI and made an obvious contribution to the balance of payments. Some of these industries are often the sole indigenous manufacture of certain goods.  Spin-off employment is also applicable. All this must be related to some type of critical analysis and the one I suggest Fóir Teoranta should operate on is a cost-per-job-saved basis.</P>
      <P>If we look at the figures we will see that in 1981 the cost per job saved, given the total expenditure of Fóir Teoranta and the number of jobs they saved, has jumped from £1,200 per job to approximately £2,000 per job in 1982 and a 25 per cent increase for 1983, to £2,587 per job.  If we are making this analysis on the effectiveness of Fóir Teoranta and the type of money the Exchequer is putting in we have to make a comparision also between the start-up costs of industry. Fóir Teoranta is very cost-effective in relation to the comparision of start-up industries of a large multinational type that are IDA-sponsored but is equivalent to the cost of setting up jobs in the small industries sector.  On balance Fóir Teoranta are doing a good job but there are areas where improvement is required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides an increase in board membership from seven to nine, to include a nominee from the Departments of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and Finance.  There is also a provision to increase the company's aggregated powers to borrow from £70 million to £150 million and to increase the advances by the Minister which are non-repayable from £70 to £150 million, also on an aggregate basis.  Two years ago when the Minister's predecessor introduced the last Bill dealing with Fóir Teoranta proposing to increase powers to borrow from £35 million to £70 million on an aggregate basis, it was stated that that provision would last for three to four years.  It is indicative of the depths of recession we have reached that a Bill like this has to be introduced every two years.  I hope the provisions in the Bill will last for at least four years.  There are two write-offs in the Bill amounting to £2.1 million and £8.1 million, a recognition that companies <Col N="2319" /> had become insolvent.  There is also a change in the Articles of Association and Memorandum of the company to comply with the Act.  A funny section in the Bill brings the remuneration and superannuation of officers and servants of the company under the auspices of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>The Export Promotion Bill which was passed last week provides the very same section and this Bill is in line with the Devlin Report findings which state that there should be uniformity throughout the public and civil service in relation to terms of employment, pay and conditions. I suggest that the difference in this area undermines the independence of the board, certainly in relation to getting the best people to do the job.  Specialised activities like those engaged in by Fóir Teoranta require the best people and if you categorise them on a strict criterion of pay from the chief executive officer right down the line this does not give the board freedom to recruit the best possible personnel.</P>
    <P>In the subdivisions within State bodies we see the ACC and the ICC as the equivalent of Fóir Teoranta, being bankers, but they are in division 2 of the category in terms of employment and it is most unfortunate that Fóir Teoranta personnel are in division 3.  Therefore they cannot attain the same levels of pay and thus cannot obtain the type of employees required.  This should be adjusted.  If this Bill is to implement the Devlin Report and does not go further than the grey area of guidelines and recommendations it will be a step backwards rather than forwards.</P>
    <P>The best way to look at the affairs of Fóir Teoranta would be to examine their interim report published on 16 November last.  It is the first time they have published an interim report.  It shows their operations for the first nine months of 1983.  They have already spent £18.2 million and estimate they will have spent £25 million at the end of the year.  Of that sum, £23 million is made up of a straight payment from the Exchequer and £2 million repayments of loans, which is low by <Col N="2320" /> any commercial criteria.  They reckon that 7,700 jobs were saved by them in the first nine months of 1983.  By comparison with 1982, the number of companies affected are roughly the same &mdash; 64 in 1982 and 68 this year so far.  The loans have gone up from £17.5 million to £20.1 million, but the jobs saved have gone down.  The jobs this year are 7,700 but last year the jobs saved were 8,482.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy obviously has not read this interim report because he was inaccurate in the figures he gave.  He said that one-third of the company's concerned were marginal and struggling to survive, one-third had closed down and one-third were into profitability.  I would advise the Deputy to read the report.</P>
    <P>A touchy subject with the Department of Finance, Fóir Teoranta and the companies involved is the publication of the names of the companies that Fóir Teoranta have saved.  There is no official publication by Fóir Teoranta of the companies, even though the taxpayers put £26 million in in 1983 and a considerable accumulated figure during the years.  The only way the public can know what is going on is through the Irish Trade Protection Association weekly magazine. The public should be thankful to Donal Buckley of the <i>Irish Independent</i> who consistently has been analysing the data from this magazine and has produced details of the number of companies that have had mortgages registered against them by Fóir Teoranta.  However, no public information is available on equity injection.</P>
    <P>Whatever about mortgages, in respect of which there is a charge on the assets of the company, in terms of equity the taxpayers have a far greater investment but have less chance to get it back &mdash; their investment is more long-term.  The reason put forward by Fóir Teoranta and others is that publication would have an adverse effect on the companies' trading position with their creditors and their cash flow.  This is indicative of what is wrong about Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I do not say Fóir Teoranta are doing a bad job but from this point of view they are not seen to have the required openness which is essential in any State <Col N="2321" /> agency, especially with large sums of money concerned.  If they suggest that the creditors are nervous about the names being published I would point out that these matters are published anyway in the Irish equivalent of <i>Stubbs Gazette.</i> There is also information that certain credit controllers have publicly stated that they would favour publication simply because they would be relieved to see companies had got support from Fóir Teoranta on the basis that Fóir Teoranta have a very strict <i>modus operandi:</i>&ldquo;A client must have a reasonable prospect of profitability on a permanent basis&rdquo;.  If Fóir Teoranta are satisfied that that criterion is met, why not publish the information? That information would be good news to the creditors who would be relieved that somebody has confidence that these companies have long-term prospects of viability and they would also have the confidence that money is being pumped in.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the reason for not publishing details in relation to equity injections does not stand up.  If this is a Government of accountability and openness I suggest the Minister should give serious consideration to this.  The only other State equivalent is the IDA rescue section who have no qualms about publishing their data on investments, and that does not seem to send shivers through creditors.  I do not accept the reasons for Fóir Teoranta's reluctance because I think the reasons are phoney. A new openness would give Fóir Teoranta a new positive image and everybody concerned with the company, including the banks, could play their part. It is public money and the public have a right to know.  Even if Fóir Teoranta are still nervous that they would affect the sensitivity of any company I see no reason why they cannot publish sectoral accounts of their expenditure, without any reference to particular companies. They could indicate whether the companies were involved in textiles, wood or furniture, or whatever.  This type of extra accountability must be demanded by us.</P>
    <P>Another point is the number of companies&mdash;this is also a sensitive point&mdash;in which Fóir Teoranta have invested which <Col N="2322" /> have not worked out.  I will name just three, Murphy's Brewery in Cork, Lemons Sweet and Confectionery factory in Dublin and Lunhams.  There are many more.  There is reason to believe that a number of companies are going into receivership or liquidation in an unacceptably short period after Fóir Teoranta have invested money in them.  One could understand if a company folded up two, three or one-and-a-half years after Fóir Teoranta investing money but sometimes there are instances in which companies fold up within six months or one year of investment.  They go into receivership or liquidation.  There are two instances where Fóir Teoranta got involved not only once or twice but three times.  This applies to Murphy's Brewery.  The question then arises: was the investment a good investment?  Why were the problems not seen the first time round?</P>
    <P>It is alarming to note, and I do not understand it, that very often Fóir Teoranta having made a big investment, the Revenue Commissioners are owed a considerable amount of money. Obviously there is some breakdown in communication.  I do not want to go into detail about individual companies or list them other than to say that this year alone Fóir Teoranta have aided companies which have folded.  I mention Irish Dunlop and Doreen Fashions.  There are others.  They have all gone into liquidation.</P>
    <P>I am not blaming Fóir Teoranta for their going into liquidation but the question is to what extent is good money being thrown after bad?  How good are investment procedures if they do not work out? Fóir Teoranta invest a considerable amount of taxpayers money and that obviously requires certain obligations. How careful are the vetting procedures? There is something that does not add up and I would ask the Minister, his Department and the board of Fóir Teoranta, for the members of which I have the deepest respect, to scrutinise the situation.  There are continuous reports in the media of a litany of companies set up that go bust. I accept that Fóir Teoranta's answer is that if they had a 100 per cent success rate and if, as they are, companies were <Col N="2323" /> going bust all the time, they would be failing in their job.  They must have an element of failure to gauge the problem. I accept that.  It is a reasonable argument, but in areas where Fóir Teoranta have been refused money by the commercial banks, have only a second charge on the assets and a lower rate of interest, they are entitled to have a very strict vetting procedure and, whatever else may be done, this vetting should be done.</P>
    <P>Now if one of the reasons for the collapse of the company subsequent to Fóir Teoranta investment is the collapse of the parent company, which is sometimes the case, I would strongly suggest that they be vetted thoroughly and some long-term commitment be given to the Irish operation by that parent company. I agree with the only relevant point Deputy O'Kennedy made.  He said that Fóir Teoranta should diversify into other sectors.  I think all Deputies would agree that the financial problems of companies are not restricted to the manufacturing area.  Ancillary services are related to manufacturing industry.  The only change I would ask for in the Principal Act is a review whereby, if it is agreed in consultation with the Minister and the board and other State agencies that flexibility should be given to diversify into other sectors to help them, that diversification should take place.</P>
    <P>One of the obvious failings of companies that have to be aided by Fóir Teoranta is in relation to management. I understand that Fóir Teoranta this year set up a management service unit.  When the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies investigated Fóir Teoranta it was said that where money was involved a proper scrutiny should be carried out to find the root cause, which may be faulty or poor management, the whole philosophy being that if the company is not developing it is moving backwards.  I would hope the linkage between Fóir Teoranta, the AnCO management trainee advisory service, the IMI and outside consultants who are employed could be harmonised in such a way as to provide a very comprehensive management unit, integrated <Col N="2324" /> in such a way as to let it be not only a precondition in relation to appointments to the boards of aided companies, which is a very common practice, but also to ensure that on the factory floor there would be management back-up paid for by Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>In regard to the banks there is something here that sticks in the craw of a lot of people when the State rescue bank, Fóir Teoranta, is asked to pick up the tab for unacceptable risks so far as the associated banks are concerned.  By and large most banks are with Fóir Teoranta by virtue of the fact that, the banks regard a company an unacceptable risk and then it is &ldquo;Go to Fóir Teoranta.  We are not interested.&rdquo;  Indeed, the banks often state as a precondition that they be allowed to put in a receiver at any time.  Fóir Teoranta do not request that and to some extent Fóir Teoranta may be letting the commercial banks off the hook.  The fact they are investing in an ailing company means that the banks, which are heavily involved, have a lot to lose in terms of the debt ratio if a company goes out of business.  This suggests to me that some new structure might be set up within Fóir Teoranta to which the banks would contribute. As things stand, there are only two sources available to Fóir Teoranta, namely, the repayment of loans and the Exchequer.  There should be a third whereby the banks would have some role towards funding Fóir Teoranta and one of the preconditions should be that Fóir Teoranta do not carry the total failure. Those are ways in which the banks could contribute.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</P>
    <P>Another point is the necessity for an early warning system.  I understand there is an inter-departmental agency at the moment consisting of Industry, Finance, Labour, Coras Tráchtála and the IDA for monitoring purposes so that an early warning will be available when companies are running into trouble.  No one can force a company to admit that the chips are down before they are willing to admit it.  A lot of the fault in relation to Fóir Teoranta is that they are asked to come on to the scene far too late when the debts and the write-offs are too high <Col N="2325" /> for people to be allowed to continue.  In the instances where an earlier intervention would solve the problem I suggest that the State already has an institution which knows the score in each company. We have an institution that monitors each company not only on a monthly basis but on a weekly and daily basis.  I refer to the Revenue Commissioners who know very quickly, if current payments of PRSI, PAYE and VAT are not met for two or three weeks in a row, that there is something wrong with the company.  I suggest that on the early warning system mechanism the Revenue Commissioners should have a nominee who would, without divulging any State secrets, ensure that they have an input to whatever package is necessary to get the company restructured and going again.  That is one way. The other way is to have the banks involved.  If the banks have a nominee on this early warning system mechanism they would also be able to say when repayments were not being met and we would have an effective early warning system and an effective mechanism for dealing with these problems before it is too late.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Revenue Commissioners, if I could make only one point on this debate it would be that in the whole rescue area the main reason why rescues are prohibitive in certain instances is because of the preferential status of the Revenue Commissioners.  I believe from my information from contacts in the business world that because the Revenue Commissioners have a preferential status it means that after a month of non-payment of current taxes owed they do not rush in and ask what is wrong, what is the problem or how they could help or they do not come screaming down the backs of those people.  They wait for six months, nine months or even a year until you come into huge figures of £100,000 and £200,000, so that anything the banks or Fóir Teoranta can do will not be done because of the question about who will pay the Revenue.</P>
    <P>I suggest that if the Revenue Commissioners want preferential creditors they would not wait until the day of receivership or liquidation to move in.  They <Col N="2326" /> would not sit back on the basis that they knew they could get the money anyway. They would be in there on the first day looking for money if they had not this preferential creditor status.  I suggest that one of the most important and fundamental improvements that could be made in this area is to remove this preferential status without in any way trying to diminish the Revenue Commissioners' right to get the money.  This is not a surreptitious proposal by me to suggest that people should not pay their taxes or that the Revenue Commissioners should not be obliged to follow this through.  If it can be used in a positive way to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners can get in earlier before the principal sums are not so high, that is a very positive step.</P>
    <P>In relation to the board members and appointments generally, it has been alleged that in years gone by companies aided, and board members of Fóir Teoranta, as well as the board nominees on to companies, have been of a political flavour.  This is not my allegation.  There will be two new members on the board with the passage of this Bill.  To the extent that there are suggestions that people who have been known to have certain affiliations associated with certain companies have been known to get aid, I suggest that political parties in the House are leaving themselves open to the widest possible type of cynicism from the public unless they ensure that there is a very strict criteria in relation to this matter.  It could well be that the best commercial brain in the country happens to be a paid-up member of a political party.  In that case I say there are skeletons in all cupboards.  I suggest, however, that where possible the appointments to companies by Fóir Teoranta subsequent to rescue aid should be made strictly on merit through business consultants; or, if it is to be a ministerial nominee to the board of an Fóir Teoranta, it should be seen to be an independent nomination and to be done strictly on merit.  In this way the allegations and innuendoes are avoided which suggest and So-and-So knows So-and-So who knows So-and-So. This affects the political process and is unacceptable where State money is concerned. <Col N="2327" /> I do not believe the Government should leave themselves open to this.</P>
    <P>When Deputy O'Kennedy accuses the Minister of being negative and less progressive by appointing two civil servants to the board I suggest that he should reflect deeply on some of the allegations that have been made by people outside this House.  I suggest that at this time it is wise and prudent to nominate two civil servants who can interlink between the two Departments and Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with sections 6 and 7 whereby the Minister for the Public Service takes in the employees of Fóir Teoranta.  I would like clarification on it. My information from people who are directly involved is that it is as I suggested. If you want to get the best people you must have flexibility to pay them. These sections remove that flexibility. Secondly, when the chips are down it can at times undermine the independence of the board.</P>
    <P>With regard to the type of investment Fóir Teoranta make in any company, the recent report by the NESC in relation to finance for industry makes interesting reading.  I hope the Fóir Teoranta board members will have it by their bedside because it clearly states that the basic problem with indigenous companies is that they have been overstretched from day one.  Their problems were that their financial structures was so under-capitalised that they were always struggling on loans and were setting themselves impossible targets from day one and there was no way they could pursue the matter.  I suggest that the area of equity injection requires a whole new think-out by the Government in all its areas.  The IDA grant aid section and the proposed NDC should look at equity and the banks should be asked through tax paid standing schemes to inject equity venture capital. Fóir Teoranta, instead of giving debentures and loans, mortgages and so on, which of their nature carry the same risks as equity, should look to equity injection if they want to do something for the company on a long-term basis.  This was recognised in an NESC report.  I <Col N="2328" /> suggest there should be a priority in this area for Fóir Teoranta and it should be their stated policy.</P>
    <P>In relation to the openness and positiveness I spoke about earlier in relation to publishing the data in respect of the companies they invest in, Fóir Teoranta could well move into the area of starting up businesses in terms of venture capital.  By their nature they are identical with the risk factory type of investment propping up ailing industries.  There is a need for a State agency to help people who have an idea, who have thought it through, who need an equity injection and who have approval for IDA grants and bank loans but have not the financial package to tie it all together.  People in Fóir Teoranta will tell you that if they were involved from day one with companies the type of blood transfusion they have to give would not arise.  It is too little, too late, when they are called in, and the prospects for recovery are not good and lead to the failure rate I spoke of earlier.</P>
    <P>In relation to the rescue area, receiverships are common today as opposed to liquidations and voluntary liquidations. There is a problem with receiverships in so far as the banks are reluctant to send in a receiver unless the chips are really down, the game is up and they have first charge on the assets.  Fóir Teoranta are not anxious to put in a receiver.  Also when companies are cracking up the financial institutions will not put in a receiver but will not honour the cheques, so the company cannot trade or go into receivership because they do not have a creditor big enough for them to do so. Therefore they are forced into voluntary liquidation and the name of the businessman is mud and his prospects of setting up again are damaged because his relationship with his creditors has broken down.  There is an urgent need for a code of conduct in relation to receiverships so that people know where they stand. Where companies cannot continue to trade the accepted practice should be that the banks or Fóir Teoranta would take the responsibility from the shoulders of the companies and where all alternatives or options have run out put in a receiver. <Col N="2329" /> This could be done in a businesslike way through a code of conduct with accepted practices and norms.</P>
    <P>I have some questions to ask of the Minister.  What is the level of the ceiling of Fóir Teoranta aid approval required before it goes to Government?  It used to be £.25 million.  What is the present rate? If Fóir Teoranta recommend aid for a company of £X million, what is the figure below which they have discretion themselves? At what stage must they get Government approval and how does that relate to the IDA grant aid level for which Government permission must be obtained?  Secondly, what is the total amount written off by the IDA rescue section and Fóir Teoranta since their inception?  Thirdly, what percentage of applications for Fóir Teoranta aid was received in 1982 and so far in 1983?  I hope to get some gauge on the activity of Fóir Teoranta, although we are dealing with a drop in the ocean of problems.</P>
    <P>I support the Bill, and I support the board of management of Fóir Teoranta. Frequently State agencies can be hypersensitive in many ways.  They become paranoid about criticisms and see them as far more sinister then they are.  I ask them to improve their image and their openness. Let them publish the names of the companies involved.  They should diversify. Let it be seen that they are satisfied that a company can be viable.  It is public money and the public who are paying for it have a right to know what happens.  I would like to see Fóir Teoranta diversifying into other sectors.  I would like to see a guarantee that a full management packet would be available in all investments they make.  I would like to see the preferential status of the Revenue Commissioners removed, and further bank involvement in Fóir Teoranta.  In terms of type of investment I would like to see a priority for equity.  That is the way forward.  Unlike Deputy O'Kennedy, I will not indulge in semantics or give a diverse oration on the economy.  I will deal with what needs to be done about Fóir Teoranta.  I hope my comments will be seen as positive and instructive and that by the time we leave <Col N="2330" /> Government the number of queries they will have to deal with will be minimal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is to be regretted that we must bring in a Fóir Teoranta (Amendment) Bill, 1983.  It is only two years since Fóir Teoranta came to the Government again looking for increased spending powers.  With the condition of the economy at the moment, and all indicators seem to point downwards, we will not have to wait too long before Fóir Teoranta will be back at the door of the Government seeking more money and increased powers to borrow.  However, Fóir Teoranta as a rescue agency have done some fine work for businesses in trouble and it would be wrong for anybody to stand up here and say that they are not fulfilling a very important function in our economy.</P>
      <P>As the Minister stated in his opening speech, it looks as though the coming two years in particular will be a busy time for Fóir Teoranta.  All we have to go on is the Book of Estimates circulated to Deputies today.  If that is to be the criterion on which we are to build our economy, Fóir Teoranta will be the most over-used agency in the State.  The Bill provides for the appointment of two new directors.  One of these appointments should be given to somebody from a commercial background.  The appointment of two civil servants to the board of Fóir Teoranta with the background civil servants have &mdash; I do not mean this in any personal way but they work within narrow constraints &mdash; does not give due recognition to the importance of having industrial viewpoints represented on the board.  Therefore, it is a pity that one of those appointments is not of someone in industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Deputy who spoke earlier referred to the involvement of the banks in the case of liquidations.  I agree with many of the sentiments he expressed.  It is unfortunate that the banks play such a narrow role in company liquidations.  When deals are being negotiated between Fóir Teoranta and the companies applying for loans it seems that all the cards may not be on the table in all cases.  Fóir Teoranta succeeded, it seemed, in negotiating a <Col N="2331" /> good rescue package for Lemon &amp; Co., yet within four months the company was being wound up.  I do not believe that the fault was with Fóir Teoranta that Lemon &amp; Co. had to go into liquidation.  I understand that a loss of a contract promised to them and which was part of the deal caused that company to fold up.</P>
    <P>A more recent case, close to me, was the liquidation of Keenan Brothers in Bagenalstown.  If we are to believe reports circulating in the press at the moment Fóir Teoranta approved a loan of £450,000 to Keenan Brothers.  This loan was based on a rescue plan that was drawn up by Keenan Brothers in conjunction with their bankers and Fóir Teoranta.  However, only £250,000 was paid when Keenan Brothers went into liquidation.  The role of the banks in this case must be questioned.  Speculation is that the bank, having being privy to the negotiation of the rescue package, withdrew its facilities from Keenan Brothers as the Fóir Teoranta money became available.  When Fóir Teoranta realised what was happening they refused any more finance.  At the end of the day the facilities which Keenan Brothers needed to continue trading were not available but at that stage Fóir Teoranta had already put up £250,000.</P>
    <P>The banks have a privileged position in Irish business.  They will be guaranteed their money and as a secured creditor they will not have too much to worry about.  Certainly they will not have as much to worry about as had the unfortunate work force in the case of this liquidation. Having worked a week in advance they found their cheques were returned by the bank.  It is not right for any institution to hold such a privileged position.  They have a moral obligation to the work force and to the management of any company that is experiencing financial and trading problems.  I hope at a later date to get clarification on these facts.  When the matter has been cleared up I shall look for certain answers.  I believe the banks are answerable to somebody.  In this case I hope we will find out the facts when the official liquidator has finished his job with the company.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2332" /> Fóir Teoranta will have a more important position in the future.  In principle I support the Bill.  I shall be looking for some explanations with regard to Keenan Brothers.  I ask Fóir Teoranta to keep in mind that they are dealing with taxpayers' money, money that has been hard earned by working people and, in some cases, which has been collected with great difficulty by the Revenue Commissioners. When rescue packages are being negotiated I hope the points I have made will be borne in mind.  It is getting increasingly difficult to get money and we shall have to be careful about the way we spend it.  It should only be spent when there is a fair chance of employment continuing in an industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  A rescue agency such as Fóir Teoranta is essential for the survival of industry. They have performed a significant and valuable function in assisting ailing industries since they were established in 1972. Deputy Yates dealt eloquently and effectively with the general operations of Fóir Teoranta but I shall confine my remarks to their operations in relation to the rescue of certain enterprises.</P>
      <P>Where money is granted and a scheme for survival is drawn up I am greatly concerned that within a matter of months some companies go into receivership and eventually into liquidation.  In my view, and this is shared by many taxpayers, obviously there is something wrong with the way information is collected and assessed with regard to the viability of a company.  As has been mentioned by Deputy Nolan, a sum of £250,000 was spent in the case of Keenan Brothers and there was a guarantee that £450,000 would be provided.  A number of independent assessments were made on the viability of the company and there is no doubt that it was capable of being viable. Yet, between April and November a receiver was appointed.  Some 90 jobs were at stake in that case and possibly there was a greater number of jobs in associated industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As was stated earlier, banks have encouraged firms to borrow to practically any extent.  Yet, when there is a downward <Col N="2333" /> trend in a time of recession the banks are the first to recover their entire loan.  There may have been problems in Keenan Brothers over a period that related to a number of factors but the withdrawal of banking facilities meant that a receiver was appointed.  Prior to the withdrawal of facilities the company had negotiated a loan of £450,000 from Fóir Teoranta.  The money from Fóir Teoranta was conditional on the Irish banks maintaining their existing levels. Clear guidelines regarding the conditions under which this money would be paid were set out in a letter to the management of Keenans.  Although I am speaking only for one company, I also do so in the interests of the public with regard to the allocation of any such moneys or rescue packages in this respect.  Within a few months of receiving considerable State subventions, several companies folded and this indicates that there must be something wrong with the mechanism of investigative methods.  Keenans received £250,000 from Fóir Teoranta and, subsequently, the bank reduced their facilities by £350,000 &mdash; it was originally at £600,000.  Fóir Teoranta should not have accepted that situation.  It was anticipated that there would not be any upturn in the market for a few years and they should have been asked to sustain certain losses over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>It is easy to say subsequently that the loss of a market or contract were the causes of the problem.  My understanding is, therefore, that £250,000 of taxpayers' money was used to reduce the exposure of the Allied Irish Banks Group to Keenans, rather then assisting the company in implementing a survival programme which envisaged no upturn in business until 1985 at the earliest.  It was on that basis that the deal was arrived at and yet a receiver was called in within five months of the deal being finalised.  What is the purpose of arriving at such deals and why are moneys being used to bail out the interests of the banks involved?  I should like the Minister to answer this.</P>
    <P>I am speaking in this debate mainly to draw attention to Keenans.  Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the pharmaceutical <Col N="2334" /> and higher technology industries and how they were responsible for job creation. Agriculture-related industries have been in severe recession.  This did not start with the advent of this Government; it goes far deeper than that.  Keenans employed 250 people on a permanent basis and also gave temporary work to perhaps another 250 people.  It was one of the biggest companies of its type.  I am not suggesting that Fóir Teoranta should give them more money but I am complaining at the way the rescue package was drawn up.  It was intended to enable the company to survive and Fóir Teoranta must have known that there were difficulties in April whether on the management or the workers' side.  They did not suddenly come to light six months later.  The same is true of many other companies and the State cannot afford to be pumping taxpayers' money into ailing industries unless there is a real possibility of survival.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned with the growing level of unemployment.  Very few Governments have had answers to the problem.  Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned investment abroad and buying consumer products outside the country.  The Buy Irish campaign could create a significant number of jobs but it seems to have fallen on deaf ears.  There is very little patriotism when it comes to buying Irish products.  Coming up to Christmas there will be a considerable growth in expenditure which will result in the purchase of foreign manufactured products and in 1984 and 1985 Irish industries will be calling on Fóir Teoranta and the IDA to rescue them because they cannot find suitable markets for their products.</P>
    <P>Keenans had the prototype of a forage harvester design.  We have talked about the jobs that can be created in agriculture and that prototype would have been invaluable to the industry if it had been given the opportunity to develop.  This case is a significant example of the banks' withdrawal from the industrial scene.  Is it not our duty, as politicians, to ensure that this type of heavy handed action by the banks should cease forthwith and, specifically, that public funds are not used to benefit the shareholders of private <Col N="2335" /> banks?  Of the £23 million that Fóir Teoranta will consume in 1983 to rescue certain industries, how many will survive and to what extent will that ensure the return of the investment to those banks? If a halt is not called and if there is not a serious examination of the level of participation, a commitment and investment by our banks in Irish industry, not necessarily to pull out when there are difficulties and to save the skins of their investors, we can never create the jobs we all desire.</P>
    <P>We must examine the role of the banking institutions aligned with that of the State rescue agencies.  We must try to secure a commitment that will at least give opportunities to industry.  It has been suggested that the recipe for survival is promoted too late.  That may be so.  Why is there so much fear on the part of Fóir Teoranta to disclose to the public that such companies are experiencing financial difficulties?  I am concerned basically about taxpayers' money being used to pay off certain banking institutions.</P>
    <P>I welcome and support the concept of Fóir Teoranta.  I commend them on their attempts which, though not always successful, have helped many ailing industries. However, I implore Fóir Teoranta to ensure that when they are thinking of investing State money they have a guarantee that is greater than the possibility of markets because they may find six months later that those markets have been lost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no more important, more vital or more essential legislation to come before this House than the Bill we are discussing.  I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the work of Fóir Teoranta and to the manner in which they have so generously assisted, advised and co-operated with many industries at times of great difficulty.  One of the reasons for the Bill being so important at this time is the steady decline in industrial production and the growing numbers of unemployed.  If we examine the categories of employment, we find that the professions in which there appear <Col N="2336" /> to be greatest scope are those of liquidator, of administrator or of receiver. Every day we read in the newspapers that some concern are to have their affairs managed by some of those people with the consequent loss of employment, with grave distress, general inconvenience and what is even more important, the loss to the community concerned and to the economy as a whole.</P>
      <P>When I entered this House first, one of the most prosperous and expanding towns in my constituency was the town of Clara.  Now it is practically a wayside village.  I witnessed the expansion of the textile industry that flourished in Tullamore and which branched out to Mountmellick. I knew the workers who were employed in these industries before they fell victim to the very early years of the recession.  The result of all this is that there are now almost 6,000 people unemployed in my constituency.  As a public representative it is becoming increasingly embarrassing to meet these people because their first question is to ask what we are doing in the Dáil in relation to these problems.  They ask what is being done about providing employment for them.  I am talking of people who have been mainly industrial workers but who have been made redundant because of the general slackness and falling off in trade in the industrial sector.  This appalling state of affairs would have been much worse if it had not been for the existence of Fóir Teoranta and for the commonsense and intelligence with which the directors of that body approached industrialists who were facing difficult times.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us today that since 1972 finance for industrial concerns was made available to all those industrial projects that were in danger of closing down or of suspending activities and who were in urgent need of help if they were to keep their doors open.  The Minister has told us that the employment content and the capital input were always of national or local importance and that if many industries had not received financial assistance there would have been grave local repercussions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1972, 450 concerns have received assistance from the funds of Fóir <Col N="2337" /> Teoranta.  This is worthy of note, but we should consider also the amounts of money that have been spent by Fóir Teoranta in the past few years.  In 1981 the figure was £4.8 million, in 1982 it was £14.1 million and this year it is likely to be £23 million.  That is an indication of the extent of the serious plight in which industries have found themselves.  We must ask ourselves the reason for all this. One of the reasons is that we Irish are very slow to give an expression of approval to what we produce ourselves. Other Deputies have referred to the failure of the Irish to buy Irish, to speak of Irish and to boast of Irish.  I venture to say that our industrialists and our industrial workers turn out products that are as good as can be produced in any other country in Europe or elsewhere.  Have we lost all our sense of national pride? Have we lost all sense of helping our own industries by buying what they produce? Every time we buy goods made abroad we are helping to provide employment outside our shores, thereby adding to the ever-growing dole queues.  This is to the discredit of all of us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for reminding me.  I will condense my contribution to a few words.  The Minister should shake off the shackles of EEC fear in relation to an extensive &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. We will not get any outside help to promote the sale of our own products at home and it is necessary that we should support such a campaign.  I should like to draw the Minister's attention to the report of Mr. Van Lannep of the OECD. That report should be given serious consideration because its contents are not very encouraging for the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My final point relates to the Scarriff chipboard factory.  Members may ask why the future of that factory is of concern to me but they will understand when I tell them that a lot of the timber used in that factory came from the Kinnitty district <Col N="2338" /> in my constituency.  The fact that the Scarriff industry is not functioning properly is causing widespread disappointment, depression and inconvenience to those who were involved in the supply of the timber from the Kinnitty district.  The Minister should consider introducing legislation based on the American system whereby banks cannot step in to close an industry, cause widespread unemployment in an area and distress in homes.  Our system is wrong. There will be a very gloomy Christmas in thousands of homes as a result of quick decisions taken behind the prosperous desks of bank directors on behalf of banks who are boasting substantial profits. Where there is private investment, and the State are contributing, the banks should be prohibited by law from bringing in liquidators, receivers or administrators. The system is wrong and unjust. There is no reason why our people should have to suffer or be thrown out of employment.  Many children are being deprived of the pleasures of Christmas as a result of the drastic action of well paid bank directors who have been responsible for the closing of many Irish industries. I hope the Minister for Finance will consider that point.</P>
    <P>I hope to have an opportunity to expand on this topic at a later date.  I welcome the Bill.  Fóir Teoranta are deserving of our support and co-operation. I have certain reservations about the failure to disclose information in relation to public money being allocated by Fóir Teoranta.  If the salaries, allowances, and pensions of Members are made public then, if we seek information about where public money is going, we should be given it, at least in confidence. If representations are made by interested parties about the allocation of money to save or assist industries, public representatives should at least be told in what direction and to what extent the public money is invested in industrial projects. I make that appeal bearing in mind that there has been a great falling off in private investment in industries.  The money we are sanctioning today will be put to good use in an effort to keep factory doors open.</P>
    <Col N="2339" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The first thing I should like to say about the debate that has taken place is that it shows that the House is at one in providing, legislatively and in financial terms, for a continuation of Fóir Teoranta's activities in providing, at the level I proposed, the resources required to keep the company in operation on the basis on which it is now involved.  It is important that we should mark that point because it indicates that the House has a serious concern with the condition of manufacturing industry generally here and the difficulties of individual firms and is marking its own approval of the procedure which was first introduced with Taiscí Stáit and, subsequently, with Fóir Teoranta of using taxpayers' funds to assist industries that are having difficulties of this type.  It is important also that the House, as it has during the debate, should make clear that it believes that this assistance to be provided to industries should not be provided by the State only&mdash;that has been the thread running through the debate so far&mdash;and should not be provided without serious consideration being given to the use to be made of that assistance and the results we are going to get from it.</P>
      <P>It is important when we are dealing with public funds to make sure we have the statutory basis and the mechanisms to ensure that the funds are being put to the use for which this House approves and, secondly, that they are being used in the most efficient manner possible.  We are dealing with public funds and we have a duty to discharge to the public to assure them that the funds are being used for reasons with which the House has agreed. From what I have heard and understood during the debate it appears that the House is of the opinion that Fóir Teoranta are doing a good job and are properly discharging their responsibilities as to the use of public funds and in relation to the firms to which it comes in aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle of the Bill has been well accepted by the House.  I should like to refer to some of the points made by Deputies during the course of the debate. Some of the points do not arise on the <Col N="2340" /> Bill but, nevertheless, in the tradition of Second Stage debate, I may make some glancing references to some of them. Deputy O'Kennedy was the first speaker to refer to the role the banks should play in operations of this type.  He made the point that banks have an important role to play by identifying more closely with the business objectives of their clients and providing advice and expertise without confining themselves to the narrow financing appraisal of investment proposals. On the face of it, that is a remark with which one would not take exception. I would agree with it strongly if the sense of the remark is that we should encourage our financial institutions to take not just a short-term view of the value or viability of projects with which they are involved but that they should take a longer term view, particularly in some of the more traditional industrial sectors where either new firms are starting off trying to break into a market or in existing sectors where firms are trying to expand.  It can be a long job to get a toe-hold in a market or to expand market share.  However, I am not so sure that I would go along with a criticism of our banking system that would say flatly that it is excessively influenced by the financial appraisal of investment proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say that.  The Minister did not give the precise quotation. Other Deputies said the same but I did not say that precisely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the Deputy was the first to refer to it and I intend to refer to what other Deputies mentioned in this connection.  I would not go along with the flat criticisms of our financial institutions. They have a particular role and special obligations.  We cannot forget that financial institutions have a responsibility to their own depositors, a very important one which they take very seriously.  As well, they have a wider responsibility because of the part they play in our economic system.  State regulations place prudential obligations on the Associated Banks in particular but also on the banking system generally, and other financial <Col N="2341" /> institutions so to conduct their affairs that they will remain viable so that they themselves do not get into difficulties, because if our financial institutions, God forbid, ever were to find themselves in difficulties there could be no great hope of salvation for those who have to rely on credit.</P>
      <P>Therefore, though I agree with the general tenor of the remarks made, we would have to put that qualification on those remarks.  Our banks are involved with Fóir Teoranta and the IDA in rescue operations, the kind of operations Fóir Teoranta were set up to carry out.  I am not giving away any banking trade secrets when I say that in many cases the banks show a certain forbearance and a certain readiness to take a long-term view of the position of the firm and this has been of assistance not only to Fóir Teoranta but, more important, to the firm concerned.</P>
      <P>Is it reasonable to think, perhaps, that our banking institutions could play a more active part in this regard?  On the face of it that is a question we can usefully pursue.  I have discussed it with Fóir Teoranta Chairman and I intend to discuss it informally, at the beginning, with the banks.  We all have an interest to ensure that the maximum possible effort will be deployed to maintain and expand our industrial base in the particular interests of employment and the overall level of production.  I would not like to prejudge the outcome of such discussions.  It is important to realise that our financial institutions have played and continued to play a substantial part in putting together rescue packages.  It is important the House should appreciate that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is equally important to point out that businessmen and small industralists have played a major part in ensuring that the banks play their part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an inter-dependent system.  The point I am concerned to make is that there is another inter-dependent interest, the general interest of the community at large, in continuing to have confidence that our financial <Col N="2342" /> institutions can properly fulfil their role in our economic system.</P>
      <P>Deputy Yates in some respects asked questions similar to those put by Deputy O'Kennedy.  Deputy O'Kennedy said the Bill should be the occasion for a wider-ranging debate and he took the opportunity to raise matters on the Estimates published today, and he referred to budgetary factors.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot pass up the opportunity to take a few passing swipes. Deputy O'Kennedy trotted out something he has been saying during the course of the year.  He said he told me at the beginning of the year that my VAT estimates were too low and that the income tax and excise estimates were too high.  VAT revenue this year will turn out rather higher than was expected at the beginning of the year but not for any of the reasons the Deputy predicted or even imagined at the beginning of the year.  It happened for completely different reasons which I do not propose to go into now because we will have another opportunity. Equally, income tax revenue will turn out rather below the target at the end of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an understatement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be so not for any of the reasons the Deputy predicted at the beginning of the year.  The reasons are completely different.  I will leave the pleasure of discussing this for another occasion.  I can assure the Deputy that the margin of difference that will emerge at the end of the year pales into utter insignificance compared with the margin by which the Deputy's Government got their figures wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the involvement of the Revenue Commissioners. They are involved in a number of these cases but it would be wrong to go into detail in this House.  I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy is aware that the Revenue Commissioners are fairly <Col N="2343" /> deeply involved in a number of these rescue operations.</P>
    <P>Questions were asked about the appointment of public servants as members of the Fóir Teoranta board.  I went to some pains in my introductory speech to point out that that should not be read as an intention either to limit the freedon of action of the board or to introduce a level of ministerial control or interference in the operations of the board.  It is intended, simply and solely, to increase and facilitate the level of information available for those who are involved in these operations, including the Ministers for Industry and Finance.  Fóir Teoranta are different from other bodies because their funding comes totally from the Exchequer, and to the extent that we can bring that funding to bear more rapidly and efficiently on overall industrial policy, rescue operations can only stand to gain from that.</P>
    <P>A question was asked about the success rate of Fóir Teoranta.  First of all, in terms of the cost per job rescued, that has changed from £1,479 in 1980 to £2,585, estimated, in 1983.  In regard to what has happened to firms with which Fóir Teoranta have been involved, up to the end of September last from the establishment of Fóir Teoranta in 1972, the concerns closed or liquidated were 39 per cent of those who went to Fóir Teoranta for help; those who repaid their loans in full represented 13 per cent and those still on Fóir Teoranta books represent 47 per cent.  We cannot yet draw definitive conslusions from this because there are substantial numbers of recent cases on the books, influenced obviously by the kind of recession we have experienced in recent years.</P>
    <P>On the other points that were raised&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to interrupt but, by agreement of the House, I understood we were to move on to Committee Stage at 6.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  One point I would like to make is the fact that the board no longer publicises the names of firms.  Deputies raised questions about <Col N="2344" /> that.  It has been shown that firms are now more ready to go to the board earlier. We all know that one of the problems was, once the word came out that a firm had approached Fóir Teoranta, other financial institutions suddenly became a great deal more copy in their dealings with the particular firm.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the section which proposes to increase the number of directors from seven to nine.  The Minister has acknowledged that these two directors will be nominated by himself from officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Industry and Energy.  We will have two civil servants appointed to the board.  I am not by any means reassured by the Minister's attempt at reassurance.  I want to go back now to the reasons why the board was constituted as it was and the reasons which were relevant then are even more relevant now.  They were supported by both sides of the House.  Let me quote Deputy Cooney at column 2213 of Volume 256:</P>
      <P>...I found that the approach adopted in Dublin was too conservative and too bureaucratic &mdash; I do not use the words in a pejorative sense &mdash; and enough cognisance was not taken of the problems on the ground so to speak.</P>
      <P>At column 2215 he said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know how the Minister is going to constitute the new board.  As he indicated, up to now the board has been comprised of civil servants &mdash; the secretaries of four Departments.  Without any disrespect to the gentlemen on <Col N="2345" /> the present board, people of wider commercial experience would be required.  I think the Minister should consider as members of this board people who are prepared to experiment in matters of industrial management, who are willing to get away from the traditional management philosophies we have in this country and which we have had to import from differently structured societies because of the size of our country and the average size of firms.</P>
    <P>That is the general vein in which Deputy Cooney spoke.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tulley, who represented the radical Left, spoke in precisely the same vein in welcoming what the late Deputy George Colley was doing, particularly in relation to changing the constitution of the new board from what was regarded as a Civil Service-dominated board.  He said: &ldquo;Deputy Cooney used the word `conservative' in respect of the State companies but I would put the word &ldquo;ultra&rdquo; before that.  The ultra-conservative approach of some of the people in these companies has a dampening effect on firms seeking assistance, but perhaps that is the intention&rdquo;.  Again, at column 2222, talking of the need to react quickly to small industries and businesses, he said:</P>
    <P>This must be spelled out very clearly because I can see a group of people, and particularly civil servants, saying to a firm with 25 to 30 workers that they are only little chaps, that they do not qualify, and the Minister says so.</P>
    <P>Those few extracts make the point.  First of all, whether or not the civil servants on the board would attempt to do what Deputy Tully feared they would or what Deputy Cooney was apprehensive about, if they are perceived by the people who are determined to make the effort and are entitled to some reward in the almost impossible climate in which they operate as an administrative bureaucratic control on behalf of the Minister, then that will be in effect what they are and no assurance by the Minister introducing this unwelcome change&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I did not.  Check the record.  I know this Government do not think too highly of Cabinet confidentiality. As Deputy Cluskey put it, they have drawn back the curtains.  I presume what the Minister is talking about are discussions that may have taken place, informally or otherwise, between officials of the Department and me as Minister for Finance.  Is that what the Minister is at? This is sinking to a new low.  Whatever confidential discussions took place the test is, and the Minister must know it, the conclusion I came to at the end of the day.  This does not embarrass me one bit. I discussed many things which the Minister in fact subsequently did, but the test is I did not do that.  Check the record. That is the first point.</P>

      <P>The second reason we oppose this section, apart from all the valid arguments produced then by both sides of the House, which are equally valid today, is the determination of this Government to undermine the whole State sector in relation particularly to the constitution of the members of the board.  It may not be the particular intention of this Minister but it is quite clear that those who have been appointed to these boards under a previous administration now feel a lack of confidence, a lack of security, a lack of a guarantee that they will be allowed and even encouraged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

This party are dissatisfied. In view of what the Government have done in relation to An Bord Pleanála, Údarás na Gaeltachta, Bórd na gCapall, Bórd na gCon and wherever people happen to be unfortunate enough to have been appointed by a Fianna Fáil Administration, the Coalition Government will ensure at the earliest possible date that they will either negative the impact of these undesirables, as they see it, on the State boards, or else they will find another way of doing it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will have an opportunity to make his point.  I said that, apart from the specific concern of adding two civil servants, my second point is that we are opposing the section as a matter of protest in the light of what the Government have been doing generally in respect of a whole range of bodies which are meant to be independent and autonomous.  I cannot go into the arguments in relation to matters regarding the Chairman of Bord na gCon but if the Minister wants to go into each particular case I ask him this question: Did the Government, in respect of a whole range of people whom they removed, give any of those people stated reasons, as required under legislation?  In many cases like An Bord Pleanála, did they bring the matter before the House, as required under legislation?  They did not do either <Col N="2348" /> of those things and they forced honourable people, with professional qualifications in many cases, to resort to litigation to have their rights vindicated.  That is why we are not prepared to allow the Government to further undermine the independence and capacity of people, who should be recognised for what they are, people of experience, commitment and interest in the development of industry. Those two very persuasive reasons are the reason why we are opposing this section.</P>
      <P>I want to make another comment in relation to this matter.  I mentioned the traditional ratio and said I had reason to believe that it would be changed in view of the problems of industry at this stage. The traditional ratio was always one-third success, one-third marginal and one-third liquidation.  The Minister has now indicated that the figures have changed and that less than 40 per cent go into liquidation, 13 per cent remain all right, which is much less than it was, and 47 per cent are still marginal on the books.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but they are not launched out into profitable activity as the 13 per cent are, which used to be 33 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to interrupt the Deputy but as a matter of fact I said 13 per cent have repaid the loans Fóir Teoranta made to them and the remaining 47 per cent are on the books.  This is a matter of clarity.  Of that 47 per cent there are some who are in continuing difficulty and there are some who are making payments, as in the agreed schedule of payments set out by Fóir Teoranta, and cannot necessarily be regarded as in difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not implying that all of the 47 per cent are in difficulty but the figures the Minister gave indicate that a greater proportion of them are going into liquidation than was the pattern, a smaller proportion of them are able to repay the loans than was the pattern, and <Col N="2349" /> a larger proportion of them remain on the books.  They will be in the last proportion, obviously subdivisions that I do not want to go into.  I know what the pattern has been over the years and the Minister will have to accept it.</P>
      <P>In view of that kind of trend I am also worried about the understandably orthodox reaction civil servants will have in regard to applications coming before them.  They will be orthodox and they will not be as sensitive to the real needs on the ground as the present Minister for Defence, Deputy Cooney, the former Deputy Tully and the late George Colley felt they should be.  In view of that and the other reasons I have given, the Minister should drop this particular provision and let those boards have some degree of hope to be independent and discharge the role they have been discharging.</P>

      <P>I would have liked to have spoken on the Second Stage of this Bill but there are a few remarks I would like to make on this section.  I would like to put it on the record of the House that I would like to see the transfer of An Fóir Teoranta from the Department of Finance to the new Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  I hope the Minister will consider that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope, seeing that CTT and the IDA are under that Minister, that the Minister will consider transferring Fóir Teoranta to that Department so that all of the difficulties which some companies are facing&mdash;some of them are in my constituency&mdash;can be considered under the umbrella of one Minister.  This would help in dealing with some of the bottlenecks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we have to finish this Bill by 7 o'clock I will relate my remarks to this section.  With regard to the appointment of the directors I would like the Minister to make it a condition of the appointment of those directors that they widen their terms of reference to ensure that they come to the assistance of companies if <Col N="2350" /> the failure of those companies would worsen the situation in the eyes of the State.  I have come across companies where assistance from Fóir Teoranta would have helped them to continue in business profitably but they did not find it possible to do so since their terms of reference in their view did not allow them to take into consideration the country's balance sheet.  I want to get this on to the record.</P>

      <P>You have given me great latitude and I am about to finish.  I would like to ask the Minister to ensure that on the appointment of these directors they will agree to broaden their terms of reference to ensure that they will assist companies if it is in the interest of the country that those companies be assisted. It is quite ridiculous for directors of Fóir Teoranta to say that they cannot help companies even though it would improve the country's balance sheet because it is outside their terms of reference.  I would like the Minister to take that up with the directors on their appointment.  It is very important, particularly to small companies. I thank the Chair very much for his latitude.  I know I wandered a bit from the section but since the debate is finishing at 7 o'clock I wanted to get what I have said on the record.</P>

      <P>I want to say a few words about Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks.  I consider he is trying to whip up a particular feeling, which is a very unconstructive way of going about this particular job.  I do not think he is doing any favour for the people about whom he professes to be concerned, the people who have been looking to Fóir Teoranta for assistance, or anybody else.  I am sure Deputy O'Kennedy is aware that the boards of seven of the 22 commercial State bodies have departmental representatives on them; the boards of 24 of the 36 major non-commercial State bodies have departmental representatives on them, <Col N="2351" /> all for very good reasons.  In some cases it is because it would be nonsensical for the shareholders not to have a representative on the board, in other cases because the State in one way or another makes a major contribution to sustaining the board's operations or an investment programme of the entity concerned.  It is not surprising that in those cases the State, that is the taxpayer, should have a representative there to protect that interest. Deputy O'Kennedy is equally aware that of the seven members of the IDA two are civil servants.  I have not heard it said that the IDA have shown the influence of what Deputy Wilson chooses to call the cold and clammy hand.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Had we had a more direct link between the State and some of the boards concerned we might have avoided the kind of troubles we are dealing with now and will have to deal with in the years ahead in some of these operations. Deputy Wilson should not venture on to ice as think as that because the cold and clammy hand he might meet will come from below.  I do not think that Deputy O'Kennedy intended us to conclude from his remarks that public servants have no imagination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The second point Deputy O'Kennedy made was the need of these boards to react quickly.  I have not noticed that public servants as members of any of the boards we are talking about have reacted any less or more quickly than their colleague co-directors and members of those boards.  A principle is involved here.  This is surely an opportunistic <Col N="2352" /> campaign by Deputy O'Kennedy.  Taiscí Stáit had a board composed solely of four secretaries of Departments and it was made clear when Fóir Teoranta took the place of Taiscí Stáit that that did not seem to have been an inappropriate arrangement.  I agree fully with that, and there is no contradiction between my agreeing with that and the provision of this section of the Bill.  I said clearly in my introductory speech that I did not want to create a situation where we would lose the benefit of the experience and advice of existing members of Fóir Teoranta drawn from the business community.  It is extremely valuable and it is essential that it be there. For that reason I am increasing the number of members of the board rather than replacing any member of the existing board with the addition of these two.</P>

      <P>Now we have provided £23 million in 1983 solely from State funds and it is right that the providers of those funds should be directly represented. There is a point of view there that needs to be presented, that can legitimately be presented and that can have something to add&mdash;even in the sense of the remarks made by Deputy Mitchell&mdash;to the overall consideration of projects that come before Fóir Teoranta.  I have no reason, quite the contrary, to suppose that the proposal that I am making of appointing these additional members of the board will do anything but facilitate the job of the Minister for Finance who must provide the money, and the Minister responsible for Industry, who must provide other inputs.  My proposal will only facilitate the more rapid consideration of these cases and the more speedy provision of the money.  Deputy Wilson should not credit everybody else with the empire-building tendency he may have himself.</P>

      <P>I want to express my gratitude to Deputy Denis Gallagher for giving me a few moments of his time to allow me to speak in this debate.  I regret that the Minister for Social Welfare is not present; it is a sad reflection that he and Members of his party are not here.  It is also a sad reflection that the Government are being represented by a Minister of State who is leaving his Department and who, from tomorrow, will lose all personal interest in one of the greatest tragedies that has happened this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Previous speakers have outlined why this scheme was introduced by us in the sixties.  We all know the benefits it has conferred and it is very wrong to see a Government being defended by a Dublin Deputy.  I see the Minister for Social Welfare coming into the House.  I should like to extend to him a personal invitation to visit the parts of the country where&mdash;I say this without resentment or rancour&mdash;he is regarded as more harmful than Cromwell because of the way these people are affected by his actions in recent times.  The Minister should know that this supplement which people existed on has now been taken from them and that many homes are without any income whatsoever from the end of September to the end of May.  On a number of occasions I have made a simple request, in writing, to the Minister's Department which was not answered. Could the Minister please let me know how these people will exist in the winter months?  They have no income whatsoever. I wonder if the Minister is aware of the great harm he has done, particularly to the poorer parts of rural Ireland. Recently I was at a meeting in Corrigkerry on the Limerick-Kerry border and there was disbelief that a Labour Minister with connections in County Cork could <Col N="2358" /> turn his back on these poor people.  It is very wrong to do such a thing.</P>
    <P>I do not mind what system the Minister applies as long as he looks after these people.  I should prefer to see the old system in operation but if he must change it&mdash;and I am not sure that the High Court decision made him do so&mdash;it must still be a system that will help people who urgently need help.  Many have been reduced overnight to no income whatsoever. It is an exceptionally bad day's work.  Small farmers are not being given any allowances for legitimate expenses necessarily incurred by them.  This urgently needs to be changed.  What allowances are given to small farmers for electricity for their milking machines and cooling plants?</P>

      <P>I notified a case to the Minister's Department where a man was given an interest subsidy of £400 to help him to pay off interest charges on what he borrowed from the bank.  The Department's social welfare officer held that that money was income.  Can the Minister tell me also what allowances are given for each child?  I can tell him, it is £100 per child and people on PAYE get about £400 per child.  Can the Minister tell me what allowance he gives a small farmer for his wife?  The answer is none.  The Minister would do both himself and the country a service by visiting some of those homes in which there is nothing but gloom and despair at this Christmas time.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2359" /> I know of cases in which money was withheld as early as last June.  These cases are still on appeal.  Despite this situation, this Labour Party Minister tells us that he is concerned about the worse off.  Is it necessary to leave these people without money for such a long period?  This should not happen.  It is very wrong and the sooner something is done about it the better.  I would prefer the notional system but regardless of which system is applied, allowance should be made for legitimate expenditure.</P>

      <P>The Minister would need to take a day off very soon and visit the homes of those people to whom he and his Minister of State are causing severe distress.  I am surprised that the leader of the Labour Party who represents a country constituency has not warned the Minister as to the consequences of what he is doing.  I am surprised, too, that the Government backbenchers have been quiet in this regard. Under the older system there were people who were legally entitled to benefits, who got those benefits but who could have done without them, while there were many, too, who got benefits under the old system to which they were not only entitled but were urgently in need of.  I am asking the Minister to take steps immediately to provide a scheme to help those who are in urgent need.</P>

      <P>I should like to comment on some of the points raised during the debate last evening.  It would seem that the Opposition are trying to deny that they had any part in the processing of <Col N="2361" /> the events that led up to the discontinuance of the notional system of assessment. The Opposition would want this House to believe that the whole process commenced only on the day this Government took office &mdash; 14 December 1982.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked up the records and the facts are as follows.  The High Court judgment which started the whole matter was given on 30 July 1982. The consequences were considered in the normal way, legal advice was sought and it was accepted that the notional system of assessment could not continue and would have to go.  On 13 December 1982 a circular was issued by the Department to all their local officers instructing them to discontinue the use of the notional method of assessment and to use factual assessment in future.  This all happened while the last Government were in office and it is simply not good enough for the Opposition at this stage to attempt to deny responsibility for what they had done.  They were part of the process. Obviously, they are running around the countryside now telling people that something horrible has been foisted on them but omitting to say that Fianna Fáil were responsible for this.  That is the reality. It is a message that must go out loud and clear.  Fianna Fáil would like to do the Pontius Pilate act now and wash their hands of the whole matter.</P>
      <P>When the present Government took over on 14 December 1982 they reviewed the position, considered the legal advice which was available and proceeded to deal with the matter in the way which was outlined by the Minister in his speech last evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We had no intention of introducing legislation.  The Coalition brought in the notional system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The question was raised also as to whether the High Court decision declaring certain sections of the <Col N="2362" /> Valuation Acts unconstitutional was applicable to the payment of benefits such as unemployment assistance under the notional method of assessment as distinct from the levying of taxes.  The position about this is that legal advice was sought and that advice was clear and straightforward.  The advice was that the notional system of assessment for unemployment assistance purposes was no longer lawful and would have to be discontinued. It is therefore quite incorrect to suggest that the abolition of the notional system was unnecessary.</P>
      <P>When this Government took office therefore the situation had been reached where by the existing system of notional assessment had to be discontinued.  All the advice that had been received led to this conclusion and the Minister for Social Welfare had no option but to face that hard fact.  References have been made to alternative notional arrangements but they have only been references and no attempt whatever has been made to outline even in the broadest terms what alternative arrangements could be introduced.  The introduction of some other type of notional scheme is easier said than done and any such scheme would have to practical, workable and equitable.  Each of these considerations is equally important.  There is not much point in talking about introducing something. We are open to all suggestions but the facts are there and, above all, we must be practical.  We must be prepared to face reality and not be shedding crocodile tears.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>When the difficulty about the PLV system arose somebody came up with the idea that the system should be updated to make it relevant to modern-day conditions and thus fair all round.  This sounded a very reasonable and logical solution until what would be involved was examined.  I have seen it reported that the conclusion was that it could take at least ten years to carry out such an assignment and apart from the timescale the cost involved would <Col N="2363" /> obviously be great.  So much for simple solutions.</P>
      <P>It was, therefore, necessary to replace at short notice the notional system of assessment by something that was practical, workable and equitable.  A readymade replacement was already available in the method of assessment used for the unemployment assistance scheme generally which is based on the actual means of the applicant.  When the notional system was abolished some 12,800 smallholders were receiving assistance on that basis.  Some 89,000 however, were receiving unemployment assistance having had their means assessed on a factual basis. We should think about those figures.  This is not something new, it has been ongoing.</P>
      <P>The question of equity is an important one and there is much to be said for treating all applicants for unemployment assistance alike on the basis of their actual means.  When it became necessary to replace the notional method of assessment, the decision to apply a common means test to all applicants for unemployment assistance was logical and reasonable because the system was working. It cannot be questioned that it helps to ensure equal treatment for all those involved.  Under the system everybody will be treated equally and I do not think there can be any complaint about that.  It is not inequitable if everybody is put on the same footing and I do not think the Opposition will disagree with that.</P>
      <P>In his contribution last evening the Minister referred to the criteria for factual assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes which had been circulated to all Deputies.  I am familiar with this document because I discussed this matter with a number of delegations which I had received.  As a result of these discussions it was clear to me that there was a great deal of misunderstanding about the whole question of the means test.  I decided, therefore, that it was time to put down in black and white what was actually involved in the means test.  I had the officials of the Department prepare the document to circulate it to Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Obviously, all Members have not read <Col N="2364" /> that document.  I am certain that the last speaker did not read it because he was unaware of the system.  I can recall when speaking at a by-election meeting in Cork that Member describing me as a Dublin Jackeen.  That was very narrow-minded of him.  As Members of the House we represent people of all shades of opinion whether they are small farmers, businessmen, unemployed or whether they are from Dublin or rural Ireland.  It surprised me to hear a Deputy of his standing utter such nonsense.</P>
    <P>The document I circulated illustrated the points I have mentioned.  I also asked my officials to prepare a questionnaire for social welfare officers so that when they are dealing with people they have the full facts in front of them.  My concern is that any system must be fair.  I have made every effort to ensure that this is the case.  It may be that there was a misunderstanding about this but I am anxious to eradicate that and I believe the document I circulated helped in that regard.  I am sure people can see the reasonableness of our decision.  Deputies should realise that the last thing I want to do is to make life harder for people.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies have questioned the fairness of the means test and in the case of smallholders have maintained that account is taken of gross income only, while no allowance is made for expenses. I do not accept this and I hope Members are of the same opinion.  In the document which I had circulated there is a special section dealing with farm income and this sets out quite clearly how means from farming are assessed in the case of unemployment assistance applicants.</P>
    <P>The calculation is done on an income and expenditure basis and represents the income from farming less any expenses actually and necessarily incurred in earning that income.  The basis of the calculation is the net income over the 12 months preceding the investigation of means.  Details are ascertained in respect of this period of the total gross income from farming activities, such as the sale of stock, the sale of crops and other produce, sale of milk to creamery and the letting of land.  Account is also taken of farm produce consumed by the family <Col N="2365" /> and any grants or subsidies received, for example, headage payments.  Deductions are made from the gross income to take account of the cost of earning the farm income.</P>
    <P>In general, these deductions take the form of outgoings such as rent payments, annuities or rates, cost of seeding and purchase of feeding and fertilisers together with the cost of labour.  Deductions would also take into account outgoings such as veterinary expenses and the cost of renewal of tools and farm machinery and of repairs to fences and farm buildings.  In relation to borrowings, only the amount of interest paid by the applicant during the 12-month period preceding the investigation of means, on loans obtained by him for the specific purpose of running his farm, may be allowed.  The net yearly sum is then divided by 52 and the amount arrived at is deemed to be the weekly farm income.</P>
    <P>These, therefore, are the criteria that are used by officers of the Department when carrying out assessments.  The Department do not apply double standards in any way, and means investigations of smallholders are carried out fairly and objectively on the basis of the guidelines I have mentioned.  I reject utterly any suggestion to the contrary.  If any Deputy has any case in which he considers that due account has not been taken of expenses necessarily and legitimately incurred by a smallholder in managing his holding, I will have that case examined if the Deputy will let me have particulars of the case.  Indeed I can say that during my time in the Department of Social Welfare I looked into a number of cases of this kind which have been brought to my attention and I did not come across even one case where a blatant error had been made.  In many instances the difficulty had arisen because of a genuine misunderstanding of what was at issue.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that everything that the Department do is perfect or that from time to time there may not be errors in fact or judgment.  What I am saying, however, is that the system is a well tried one that has worked in practice for a long number of years and is based on criteria <Col N="2366" /> that are fair and reasonable.  It must also be pointed out that there are safeguards in the system.  The final say does not necessarily rest with the officer who actually makes an assessment.  If any applicant is not satisfied with the amount of means assessed against him it is always open to him to appeal and bring forward the grounds on which he contends that the assessment was not correct.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the farmers' dole changed the face of the countryside, that it transformed the lives of the people and brought them a standard of living which they could not otherwise have had.  It was even suggested that emigration was halted by the farmers' dole.  I am glad to see that life in the countryside has improved, that living in the countryside has has become more enjoyable, that living standards have improved and that all of this has led to better times also for the towns and villages of the countryside.  I am glad to see that all of this has happened and it is my sincere wish that things would continue to improve.</P>
    <P>However, I think it is exaggerating more than somewhat to claim that all of this was due to the farmers' dole.  I really cannot accept such a claim, which I can only describe as emotive.  Many things have happened since the farmers' dole was first introduced in 1965 and standards of living have improved considerably in many areas even where there has been no farmers' dole.  We joined the EEC and it brought us many advantages which benefited the whole country, urban and rural alike.  As far as the Department of Social Welfare are concerned, the schemes and services which they provide have been expanded considerably down the years.  This has been done on a national basis and has improved the lot of urban and rural dwellers alike.</P>
    <P>In all of these matters, however, we must face reality.  We are in a time of severe financial constraint and finances are not as readily available as they may have been in the past.  We cannot put forward proposals or introduce schemes regardless of their cost to the Exchequer. Every proposal for a new scheme must be carefully assessed and costed and available funds must be spent to the best <Col N="2367" /> possible effect.  I know many people are critical of the means test and from time to time we have had calls to have means tests abolished.  Such calls, however, are becoming less frequent as people realise more and more that the State has no bottomless purse.  Every penny the State spends must first be found in one way or another.</P>
    <P>Where assistance schemes are concerned, the means test is an equitable way of ensuring that limited funds are given out to those who are most in need. I see nothing wrong, therefore, about extending the system of means assessment to cover all applicants for unemployment assistance.  I consider the principle is fair and reasonable and a genuine attempt at treating alike all sections of the community, urban and rural, on a national basis.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with the application of the means test as it affects smallholders applying for unemployment assistance.  I have outlined what is involved and the remedies that are open to those who may be dissatisfied.  I would like also to repeat what the Minister said last night: if anyone considers that the application of the system is unfair or unbalanced in any way, I would invite him to submit the case to the Department and I can assure him that it will be examined fairly and objectively.</P>
    <P>I would point out that this system was evolved as a result of the High Court decision after which officers of the Department were instructed, on 13 December last year, that the notional system could no longer be operated.  It is important to point this out now in view of many of the misleading statements made from the opposite side, totally inaccurate statements.  Our approach to this matter is humane, considering that we had to do away with the notional system.  What other system could we have devised?  We have a system which affects 89,000 people.  Because of that judgment we sought legal advice.  The other side of the House sought the same legal advice. What other system could you operate except the one that operates most satisfactorily for most people?  I am amazed <Col N="2368" /> at all the crying on the far side of the House about this when they were the people who introduced it.</P>

I have no doubt people will lose but even Deputy Collins admitted there were people drawing farmers' dole who should not be drawing it.  He cannot have his loaf and eat it.  He is a rural Deputy but he has not a notion how it operated.  That is sad but it is true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced neither the Government nor the Minister understood this special scheme of assistance for small farmers.  I am further convinced that the Government in moving away through the Social Welfare Act of 1983 from the notional system struck a disastrous blow to the social and economic development of the west and south-west.  It is not necessary for me to go into the history of the scheme but it is important why it was based on a notional system.  The system was designed to encourage smallholders in the west and south-west to stay on the land, to marry and rear families, to increase production, without it being necessary for them to look over their shoulders to see if a social <Col N="2369" /> welfare officer was coming in the door. The scheme was a tremendous success and the proof of that success is the fact that from 1971 to 1981 the population in the west not only held its own but actually increased at the same rate as it did in the midlands and on the east coast.</P>
      <P>If the Government were advised that they could no longer proceed with this scheme as a result of the High Court decision then they should have devised another notional scheme because it is only through such a scheme that assistance can be given to smallholders.  Such a scheme is being operated by the ICMSA unit account system.  Such a scheme is being operated by the Land Commission.  It should be possible to work out a notional system between the Departments of Agriculture and Social Welfare, the farming organisations and the Minister.  There is still time to do that. It is only through such a scheme that small farmers can be helped.</P>
      <P>The position is very bad in east and south-west Kerry.  Many smallholders have no income.  Those involved in dairy farming will have no milk cheques coming in between 1 November this year and 1 May 1984.  I know cases where smallholders have had their unemployment assistance disallowed.  This is very serious. From mid-January onwards social welfare officers will be investigating the circumstances of smallholders with a PLV of £9 and under.  Further hardship may result from this examination.  The input made by wives and families is not being taken into account.  The Minister should issue another reminder to social welfare officers as to those things which should be taken into account as expenses against income.  The Minister should take into account the value of the work put into smallholdings by wives and members of the family.  In many cases where sons cannot get work unemployment assistance is being reduced by about £20 per week because the value of board and lodgings on the farm is assessed at about £20 per week.  This is despicable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider this matter and to divise as soon as possible a proper scheme based on a notional system.  The present system does not suit <Col N="2370" /> smallholders.  It was never designed for them.  The notional system was a most successful system.</P>
    <P>There is an extraordinary delay in dealing with appeals where unemployment assistance has either been reduced or discontinued. Very often people have to wait three and four months for a decision. What is the position with regard to oral hearings?  Smallholders should be entitled to oral hearings and they should be facilitated in every way even to the extent of providing representatives for them, either fellow farmers or friends.  I ask the Minister to reconsider this scheme and to get back to the notional system.  I believe the present system will prove disastrous and will mean a serious setback in the social and economic development of the west and south-west for which the original scheme was set up and in respect of which it was most successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on the magnificent job he has done in fielding what must have been a very breezy and heavy ball for the Government.  The Minister gives the impression that the Government are very like a rabbit who becomes paralysed when faced with a ferret: any unpalatable decisions can always be blamed on Fianna Fáil.  It is an indictment of the thinking of the Government that even a year after taking office they are still inclined to blame Fianna Fáil for what might have happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately the Minister and the Minister of State are very long in theory. They are very good armchair generals but their battle experience in the field is very limited.  Those of us who have to deal factually with the situation on the ground &mdash; and I include the Chair in that&mdash;know from experience what the real situation is about the so-called factual assessment. It is not factual.  Regardless of what the Minister is saying, nobody will explain, except in a very few cases, what rights people are entitled to.  The Minister looked for cases.  I have already sent him a case.  He replied and said he was sorry there was nothing he could do.  In that case everything was paid for by cheque. Every item the man sold &mdash; he was in dry <Col N="2371" /> cattle not in dairying &mdash; was paid for by cheque.  This showed a net loss of £2,000 at the end of a year's accounts.  That man was credited with an income of over £6,000.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the standard form which is now coming from the Department. This is sent to every person and it says:</P>
    <P>You are not entitled to unemployment assistance because your means are over...</P>
    <P>The amount which suits the particular family is inserted.  It does not say what the person's means are.  It does not say that the means are £4,000, £5,000 or £10,000.  It says they are over £X and this figure is above the figure at which the family could get any unemployment assistance.  That is our experience, regardless of the letters the Minister sends out.  I would like to thank him for those letters because they clarified to some extent some of the matters.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies have experience of going to social welfare officers trying to find out exactly what the various families were being charged with.  There is no excuse for families having to suffer the loss of £30 to £40 at this time of year in particular when, as Deputy O'Leary said, most of the small farmers with six and seven cows would not have milk to send to the creamery.  The type of assistance they got tided them over the winter but that is now being denied to a lot of them.  It is not any answer for the Minister to come in here and say he has explained the position to Deputies.  I accept that he firmly believes in what he has sent out, but the reality which every rural Deputy faces is completely different from the scenario the Minister of State tried to give us tonight.</P>
    <P>We now come back to the very famous court case.  Why did the Government not wait until the case was decided by the Supreme Court?  The case has now been heard by the Supreme Court.  If the Supreme Court reverse the previous decision will the Minister come in here in a month's time when the judgment is out and go back to the notional system?  I am <Col N="2372" /> afraid he will not.  We got the reason for that when he said that we must face reality. The harsh reality is that many people are, as Deputy O'Leary said, going to supplementary welfare to get enough money to keep them and their families over the winter.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that available funds must be spent to the best possible advantage &mdash; yes, to the best possible advantage of Fine Gael and Labour.  But along the west coast, where there is very little for Fine Gael and Labour, I am afraid that unlike Cromwell, who said to hell or to Connacht, this Government have said get out of Connacht or go to hell.  That is the harsh reality as far as we are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister also stated that the Department did not do everything 100 per cent perfect.  They do not.  If the system is working how can a person apply for unemployment assistance, be refused, have his appeal refused, reapply two months later and with the same means get unemployment assistance? Obviously changes have been made since the Social Welfare Bill was introduced earlier this year.  I stated then that we were going back to the stage when social welfare officers would literally be counting the chickens.  I am afraid they are counting the eggs now, never mind the chickens.  That is the experience of every rural TD.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan comes from my county, even though he does not represent it.  I am sure when he goes down to Mayo they will tell him that and a lot more in language I am afraid I would not be allowed to use here.  As the Minister rightly said, factual assessment was always there but it was done on a reasonable basis.  It was a considerable help even to those who were at that stage refused unemployment assistance on the notional scheme because they could still ask for and obtain an actual assessment.  In all the documentation which has come from the Department to all the rural papers through the Government TDs and Senators we were given to understand that this was the first time this could be done, that the people who were not entitled to it before could get it because of <Col N="2373" /> the factual assessment.  As the Minister of State said tonight, people could always opt for factual assessment or the notional scheme, whichever suited them best. Quite a number of them, as the Minister of State said, opted for and obtained factual assessment.  I believe if they opted for it now they would not get it.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to another matter raised by Deputy O'Leary: the despicable action happening all over where young men and women who have no work and who do not want unemployment assistance if they can obtain work are being forced to take unemployment assistance.  The sooner we kill the notion that young people are only interested in the dole the better.  They are not interested in the dole if they can get work.  If work is not available surely the valuation should not be taken into account.  We have the case of two people living side by side, one of them assessed at £24 for board and lodgings and the other assessed at £8.  They are both living in the same street, in the same <i>cul-de-sac</i> road. Where is the logic in such a system?</P>

      <P>I am somewhat surprised at Deputy Calleary's reluctance to allow responsibility to fall on the previous Government for any negative aspects of the policies they pursued.  However, I can understand it in the circumstances; but the same reluctance does not manifest itself when it comes to anything that is slightly related to a positive aspect.  As the Minister has pointed out, one must be prepared to face facts and realise that these decisions were taken and also that they were precipitated by virtue of litigation in the courts and that it was necessary to change the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that in many disadvantaged areas there is a need to supplement the income of the smallholder.  It would be <Col N="2374" /> absolutely impossible for very many small farmers all over those areas to exist or rear their families on the small income they can wrest from those holdings.  However, I am totally opposed to a social welfare system under which money is paid out to people without any expectation of return from them.  That has been soul-destroying and demoralising.  It has undermined the pride, self-sufficiency and independence of rural people in some parts of this country.  People on the far side of the House might well laugh.  It has been suggested that the farmers' dole changed the face of rural Ireland.  There was a need to supplement the income of those people, but irreparable damage has been done to rural Ireland in the sense that it has made many of the people there totally dependent on a system under which they can expect to receive payment without any increase in production whatsoever. There is a good case to be argued and I suggest that the people on the far side of the House take account of it because it would be to their benefit. Anything to be given by way of payment to people who obviously need it should be in return for increased output of one kind or another.  I do not mind whether the payment is weekly, monthly, by subsidy or otherwise, but it should be only in return for some kind increased production. Only then will the self-confidence and pride which was formerly theirs return to those people.  We should not have a subservient rural population. People in the rural parts were always proud of their heritage and their ability to live on their own farms&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>From the scenario given us by people on the other side of the House one would think otherwise.  The most important thing is to accept on the one hand the need to supplement the incomes of those people.  At the same time I ask the people on the far side to consider the possibility of changing the system to one under which the people who are dependent on some kind of supplement would receive that supplement, but in return for some increased effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2375" /> With 200,000 people unemployed it behoves everybody in this House to face facts.  The concept of paying money to people without expecting any return is ludicrous.  We cannot afford that luxury any more.  We can expect only good to come from any system that would reward people for greater effort.  It would be pointed out that some people cannot possibly increase production but some means can be found to encourage them down that road.</P>

      <P>We have heard the Minister and the Minister of State.  In fairness to Deputy Durkan he was the only one who recognised that this is a negative aspect of Government policy.  I agree with him on that.  The Minister of State made great play of the fact that following the High Court action the Fianna Fáil Government suspended the notional system. The Minister of State and the Minister who was here last night must recognise that this Coalition Government earlier this year in the Social Welfare Bill abolished the national system of assessment.</P>

      <P>The Minister of State told us here tonight that the former Minister on the advice of the Attorney General sent out a circular on 13 December, the day before the Government changed, telling the social welfare officers not to use the national system until some decision would be made by the Government. As has been the case down the years, Fianna Fáil would not abolish a direct supplement to the small farmers of the west.  The point made by Deputy Calleary can be taken up.  Why did the Government not wait until the Supreme Court gave its decision on the notional system? It is still before the Supreme Court, and I asked the Minister here last night &mdash; I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not reply tonight &mdash; if the High Court judgment included not allowing the Government to pay out benefits that were introduced in this House by legislation or if that judgment referred only <Col N="2376" /> to the collection of taxation.  That is relevant to this debate.  If, as I believe, it did not refer to paying out State benefits, I see no reason why the Government found it necessary &mdash; as this Coalition Government did in section 13 of the Social Welfare Bill earlier this year &mdash; to legislate to abolish the direct supplement to the poorer and smaller farmers.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State said that he did not come across even one case where a blatant error was made.  I do not know where the Minister was, but if he had looked at yesterday's Order Paper he would have seen 118 questions down for answer to the Minister for Social Welfare. There must be some reason for that. Last night here I quoted a case of a farmer with seven children who had a social welfare officer at his house one Saturday at 6.30 p.m.  He had been in receipt of £75.25 per week for two years.  A fortnight afterwards he found that amount reduced to £6 per week.  The reason for that deduction was that he had not readily available all this list of deductions to which he was entitled and which both the Minister and the Minister of State read out here tonight and last night.  After five months on appeal he was awarded £45 per week.  Surely no Minister expects a farmer, his wife and seven children living on a very small holding to be able to manage their affairs or even to survive on £6 per week.  Surely the Minister does not expect that one would accept that he did not come across one case where a blatant error was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the amount of money the Department of Social Welfare were spending.  That spending is a direct result of their own economic policies. During this year they have been warned often enough from this side of the House that their policies would fail and more people would be unemployed.  They allocated an extra £31 million in the budget this year to cater for the unemployed and still they were £70 million short, again the direct result of their economic policies.  They did not collect in PRSI the amount they thought they would take in and they have to pay out more in social welfare benefit than they had expected. Last night the Minister quoted the NESC <Col N="2377" /> as saying that farmers would not increase their land holdings because of the notional system, but he did not quote the NESC when they talked about abolishing the notional assessment and about reverting to pre-1966 factual assessment of income, which is what this Government did in the Social Welfare Bill.  I quote from Report No. 41 of the NESC:</P>
    <P>From an administrative point of view, however, such a change would be costly and time consuming.  Furthermore, a reversal to factual means testing could be regarded as a retrograde step in welfare administration.</P>
    <P>I should like to know if the Minister or the Minister of State have any views on that.  It is a realistic assessment of the situation in rural Ireland where people live on small holdings.  Deputy Durkan spoke about an increase in production. Nearly every Deputy in this House was in Donegal during a by-election campaign and they did not need the report of a social welfare officer to realise that people living on some of the holdings could not survive because the holdings were uneconomic.  They comprised rocks and bogland but some of the finest families in the land were reared on such holdings. They could not have survived there were it not for the direct supplement given by the State.</P>
    <P>Last night I was disappointed at the time the Minister spent in listing the various agricultural benefits that apply to the west.  In some way he seemed to be making the case that because these farmers were getting the benefits they did not need any social welfare assistance.  I say to the Minister the reason the farmers in the west are getting the benefits is a recognition not alone by the Department of Agriculture but also by the EEC that these people on totally uneconomic holdings are in need of extra assistance.  The EEC recognised there should be a supplementary income for farmers on small holdings and because there are so many of them on such holdings the EEC have given such schemes as the western package, the western drainage schemes and headage payments schemes.  If the Government had wanted to they could <Col N="2378" /> have introduced an alternative system. Last night the Minister told us he had discussions with An Foras Talúntais about the income of farmers in the west. If the Government thought they had to get away from the PLV system &mdash; I question whether that is necessary &mdash; they could have discussed with An Foras Talúntais the possibility of a new system whereby a direct supplement could be made to farmers without a means test and accept the recommendation of the NESC.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister told us about all the deductions to which the farmers were entitled.  He said there could be deductions for costs incurred in connection with working the farm, including rent, rates, annuities, the cost of seeds, fertiliser, feeding stuff, renewal of tools and farm machinery, repairs to farm buildings and fences, veterinary expenses, the cost of electricity, petrol, diesel and so on.  How do the Minister or the Minister of State expect a small farmer in the west of Ireland to have that information readily available when the social welfare officer calls without notice? How can the Minister tell us that the farmer can get an allowance for these expenses?  Surely he must know a small farmer would not be in a position to have that information readily available on the off-chance that the social welfare officer might call.</P>
    <P>In their amendment the Government referred to the 5 per cent increase to those on assistance from last October. That is typical of the social policy of this Government.  They gave only a 10 per cent increase to people on social welfare in April.  Too late they recognised they had to give some increase to ensure that these people would survive during the winter and they gave them a measly 5 per cent.  That is typical of the social policy of this Government.</P>
    <P>Last week the Minister told us that since the notional system of assessment was abolished 1,141 farmers had lost benefit. In a year of recession and rising prices these people will get no income from social welfare and another 12,132 had their payments reduced.  What effect will this have on small farmers in the <Col N="2379" /> west?  Deputy O'Leary, Deputy Calleary and Deputy Collins come from the areas hardest hit.  They have pointed out to the House what is happening.  Smallholders will not be able to survive.  In the document issued by the Minister of State it is stated that there are no statutory criteria for the assessment of board and lodgings, that each case is decided on its merits.  In some areas many people will not get any assistance because of that provision.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to consider the consequences of their action.  The social policy of all governments has been to maintain as many people on the land as is possible.  The Estimate for Health was published today and it appears there will be a drop of 6 per cent in the amount available to the health boards for their work next year.  Does this mean there will not be any doctors in the west?  Is it true that the Government are contemplating withdrawing medical cards from students, thus creating further hardship for smallholders in the west?  Last night I quoted a case where a farmer's daughter in Donegal got a grant to go to university. However, the small farmer's assistance was withdrawn from the farmer and he was not able to give his daughter the extra income and she was unable to go to university. Will there be more cases where the medical card will be withdrawn?  We will wait and see what this Government do.</P>
    <P>We have been talking about a supplementary income of £20 per week for some of the poorest farmers in the land, people <Col N="2380" /> working on rocks and bogland.  In the recent census it was shown that the number working on the land dropped from 288,000 to 196,000 in 1981.  The policies of this Government are such that that drain from the land will continue.  They should come along with some alternative scheme based on the notional system to ensure that as many as possible are kept on the land.  The dole queues are getting longer.  We do not want a situation where people will have to leave the west and come into urban areas with serious consequences for rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to get away from the social policy they followed this year. It is not only farmers who are suffering. On two occasions the Government promised to introduce a family income supplement. We were told this would be done in December.  This House is rising on Friday but there is no word from the Government about the great scheme they were going to introduce for the unfortunate people on low incomes who are working, not just the farmers but also people in urban areas.  They told us here last week that the double payment scheme at Christmas was the same as last year.  That is not correct either.  They told us tonight that it was the last Government who abolished the notional system of assessment. That is not correct, as was pointed out earlier.  I ask the Minister to introduce a proper supplementary scheme for farmers.</P>

      <P>It is an indication of the Deputy's ignorance of ministerial responsibility in measures such as this.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the merger of the Department of Transport and the residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs in a new Department of Communications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that after the vesting date of An Bord Poist and of An Bord Telecom only a certain number of residual functions will be left with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  It is these functions which it is proposed to amalgamate with those of the Minister <Col N="2384" /> for Transport in a new Department of Communications.</P>
    <P>I should point out to the House that the Taoiseach announced the Government's intention of establishing this new Department when he made a formal statement in Dáil Éireann on 27 October last.  Deputies will of course remember that on 11 December 1979 the then newly-elected Taoiseach also signalled his intention of creating such a Department. This merging of existing departmental functions in a single new Department underlines the importance of communications.  It likewise emphasises in a practical way the rational co-ordination under the aegis of one Department of all those functions relating to communications.  This of course has been also highlighted in recent years by the very fact that in all Governments since 1979 the Transport and Posts and Telegraphs portfolios have been held by the same Ministers.</P>
    <P>The residual functions of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs relate to the particular and specific areas covered by the various Telegraph Acts, the Telecommunications Capital Acts, 1924-1981, the Betting Act of 1931 and the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983.</P>
    <P>They include also the functions provided for under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1972, and the Broadcasting Acts, 1960 to 1979.</P>
    <P>The Bill contains provision for all the normal, technical and consequential changes arising out of the abolition of two Departments and the creation of a single new Department in their place.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides, for example, for the continuing legal validity of all outstanding contracts, bonds and securities, following the abolition of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and likewise with the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>Section 13 of the Bill will enable the new Minister for Communications to spend and account for the moneys which under the procedures of the House have to be provided in the name of the Ministers <Col N="2385" /> for Transport and Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>In effect this section ensures that four-fifths of the sums appropriated in respect of the Departments of Transport and of Posts and Telegraphs in the financial year 1983 may be issued to and spent and accounted for by the Minister for Communications during 1984.  Thus on the day that the Office of the Minister for Communications is created it can spend moneys provided for the two abolished Departments up until an Estimate for Communications is formally put through the House.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest we are a bit pedestrian in regard to our welcome for the new Department.  Seeing that there is a festive air developing, despite various traumata on the Government side, it might have been appropriate if the Minister had some bottles of champagne to launch the new Department.  It is some time since a new Department was launched &mdash; it may have been the Department of the Public Service or the Department of Labour &mdash; and I thought there might have been an invitation to such a celebration for the birth of the new Department.  It is interesting to reflect on the reason for the new Department.  My colleague, Deputy Leyden, considers it inappropriate that the Minister for the Public Service is not present but I understand the reason for his absence is that he was ill recently.  In another way it is quasi appropriate that the Minister for Defence should be introducing the Bill because I am aware that he made a gallant effort between June 1981 and January 1982 to get a Bill dealing with posts and telecommunications on the agenda for the Dáil.  I am aware that he did not have the co-operation of his colleagues in Government in his efforts.  For that reason I am sure he is pleased that Fianna Fáil during their brief period in office succeeded in having all the financial provisions of the Bill settled in a generous fashion and got the Second Stage through the House.  The present Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Mitchell, finished the Committee <Col N="2386" /> and remaining Stage of the Bill.  I would like to think that the Minister for Defence, having looked at the trauma of 1981 and 1982, will be pleased that this has been brought to a successful conclusion.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Departments of Finance and Posts and Telegraphs were asked to jointly prepare the financial provisions of that Bill, of which this legislation is a consequence, and that towards the end of August the Department of Finance, in their usual helpful way, decided to dissolve that committee which meant that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs had to bring forward a scheme.  That scheme was presented to the Department of Finance but the then Minister, who has my sympathy, could not make any progress with that Department. The Taoiseach took an interest in the matter and arranged a meeting for early January 1982 but Deputy John Bruton, now Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, who was then Minister for Finance, had already taken a hard-nosed decision in regard to the budget with the result that Deputy Cooney was frustrated in his efforts. Since then a lot of water has flowed under many bridges and we now have An Post and An Bord Telecom set to commence operations on 1 January 1984.  The provisions of the Bill before us will come into operation on the following day.</P>
      <P>It is well to reflect on what is left for the new Department.  It will consist of the total Department of Transport that now exists and will have the residual section of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. I understand about 100 civil servants will be involved in the change into the new Department and that the section dealing with RTE will continue under a principal officer to act as it has been.  I understand that there will be a similar section of the new Department, headed by a principal officer, to deal with An Post and another to deal with An Bord Telecom.  Three principal officers will deal with RTE, An Post and An Bord Telecom and a fourth principal officer will deal with the general running of the new Department.</P>

    <P>I should like to mention some of the <Col N="2387" /> functions that will be performed by the residual Department.  There will not be any great difficulty about the RTE section because there will not be any change in that regard.  An Post, An Bord Telecom and their related sections in the new Department will have to work out their own arrangements over the years and learn from their experience.  I gather that the functions of the residual Department will be the setting of policy and performance standards in regard to the quality of services and monitoring the results of that.  Of course, financial targets will have to be settled and a pricing policy set.  Licences for installation and maintenance of international services will be the responsibility of An Bord Telecom. There will also be the question of issuing licences to contractors for installing equipment in subscribers' premises. There is also a provision for the erection of worker representatives to the boards. The important international area has to be catered for such as the International Telecommunications Union, the Universal Postal Union and their subsidiaries.</P>
    <P>The House will recall that attention was given to user councils when the Bill was going through the House and, again, the residue of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, now in the new Department, will deal with such councils and consumer protection.  There will also be work to be done in regard to the annual estimates for the boards and capital provision. They will be the executive of Government policy in regard to pay and prices.  The House will also recall that there was provision for the two new companies, An Post and An Bord Telecom, to produce rolling five-year plans covering service and financial targets.  They have to be discussed and, I presume, modified by agreement between them.</P>
    <P>The transitional period will carry problems for the people involved in the new Department of Communications, and I am sure there will be general understanding of the difficulties so involved.  I know that the representative authorities of the two bodies are determined that the new Department will be effective, that there <Col N="2388" /> will be much new emphasis on marketing efficiency and the provision of a proper service for the customers.  During negotiations with them in my time in office I became convinced that they will bring a fresh approach to both the postal and telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>The emphasis on marketing will be revealing: how can An Post be utilised to improve the service and to bring profitability? No doubt the residual sections of the new Department will inform the House on developments there.</P>
    <P>The Minister's speech was surprisingly short.  In my opinion it hardly reflected the excitement of launching a new Department on which many people have been pinning their hopes.  The speech did not touch on the relationships between the Department of Transport and the newcomer.  I know this is a purely legal aspect, but the Minister did not explain how the new sections will be fused and accommodated, how the Secretaries of the two Departments involved will relate to each other either in the matter of promotions or the holding of rank.  Will there be two Secretaries holding the office of Secretary of the Department of Communications? It will be easy to manage the Assistant and Deputy Secretary status. Perhaps the Minister will enlighten us?</P>
    <P>As the Minister has said, the technicalities relating to the new Department are dealt with in detail in the Bill.  The obligations, financial and otherwise, residing in Posts and Telegraphs and Transport will be passed on to the new Department together with contractual obligations and so forth, and there will not be any legal loopholes as far as the transfer is concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden will have some more detailed remarks to make on the postal side of the venture.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been constituted in the country since we got our independence and it would be appropriate to pay a tribute to the long line of distinguished people who served that Department during the years, not merely for their input in the work of the Department but their involvement in culture and <Col N="2389" /> research which resulted in additional credit to the country.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport is a comparative youngster and has a reputation for efficiency.  So have many other Departments, but that Department more than others.  I have no doubt that the high standard of dedication and efficiency of the officials will be maintained in the new Department.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill as being the logical consequence of the hard work put in by the officials of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in particular.  I do not want to name any of the officers, particularly some who bore very heavy burdens. Some have retired in the meantime and I pay them a particular tribute, anonymously according to the traditions of the House.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an earnest of hope for an exciting future.  The children of the new Department have expressed their hopes for the future and we hope that the vision, the dream, will be realised because there is no doubt about the dedication of the chairman and the respective executives already appointed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>The launching of a new Department on the demise of two others does not frequently occur so this is a rare occasion for the House.  Since the foundation of the State, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have given excellent service.  My association with it goes back to the time when the late P.J. Little was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in the early forties.  I had to make frequent representations to him and I want to put on record my appreciation of the staff, from the postmasters down to the postmen, senior officials and a variety of Ministers, some rather dull, some exciting, but all possessing dedication and efficiency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to raise one matter in particular. I assume that when the Department of Communications is established it will have a permanent Secretary.  I hope and trust that no Deputy will be denied the right of access to the civil service heads of Departments.  There are only two Departments in which Deputies have <Col N="2390" /> been denied this right; one is the existing Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the other is the Department of Education. This is an impertinent restriction on the rights of Deputies.  It is very strange that the ordinary citizen has a right to communicate with the civil service head of a Department but Members of this House are denied that right.  As soon as the new Department is established under this Bill I hope that the rights and privileges of Members of this House will be speedily restored.</P>
    <P>I would like to ask the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister for Transport what is the motive behind this.  Now is the time to raise the matter in relation to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Will this embargo persist in the new Department of Communications? I have known the civil service heads of most Departments for the past 40 years, men of the highest integrity, men dedicated to the service of the country. They gave and give loyal service to every Government and they respected every Member of this House.  Any ukase on correspondence from Deputies to Departments of State is wrong.  It should not be tolerated and Deputies will be failing in their duty if they do not stand up for their rights.  Surely every Member of this House has the right to communicate with the civil service heads of Departments.</P>
    <P>From the civil service heads of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs over the years I have never received anything but the greatest courtesy and an excellent standard of efficiency and competence. No matter what might be said about the Irish civil service we have as high a quality civil servant as any other democracy in the western world.  Is it not somewhat extraordinary that Members of Parliament are debarred from seeking the assistance of the civil service heads of Departments?  I want to be assured by the Minister that there will be no interference with the rights of Deputies and particularly with the rights of Deputies who have served as Cabinet Ministers. Why should a former Cabinet Minister be denied the right to make representations? Why should an instruction be <Col N="2391" /> given that no correspondence should be entered into with Deputies and that any correspondence that had to be entered into should issue from the Minister's office?  That is wrong.  It is dangerous.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service heads of Departments are not concerned with politics. They are concerned with getting the work done with speed and efficiency, with courtesy and kindness.  I know the prohibition in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs was an acute embarrassment. It was a Department from which I always received the greatest courtesy.  I wrote to the Taoiseach about this but I am sorry to say I did not even get an acknowledgment. The ordinary citizen has the right to communicate with the Civil Service head of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, to get a courteous reply, but a Member of this House, a former Cabinet Minister, has not that right.  Why was that right taken away?  I take it it has been taken away from every Deputy.  It is very wrong and such a state of affairs should not be tolerated.  We could always rely implicitly on the Civil Service heads of Departments.</P>
    <P>I hope the new Department will be an unqualified success.  I hope the two boards will do a successful job.  The public expect a good service.  What was good enough in the twenties and following decades is not good enough today.  Under the new system I hope some effort will be made to deal with telephone bills. Deputies are demented and I hope the new Department or some responsible body will deal with the problems that exist.  When the Minister comes to reply I hope he will assure us that we have the right to make representations direct to the new Department and to the boards. I hope we will not be by-passed.  I am sorry I have had to raise this matter but I have been waiting a long time for a suitable opportunity.  I shall raise it in relation to the Department of Education when that Estimate comes before the House.</P>
    <P>The Civil Service heads of Departments down through the years have served the country and the people well. They have performed their duties with <Col N="2392" /> the highest standard of efficiency.  To the present Civil Service head of the Department I say that he is doing an excellent job but I am sorry that the good relationship that existed between Members of this House and the Department was cut short by the intervention of a Minister acting unjustly and unfairly and, in my opinion, extremely dangerously.  It is a dangerous practice to interfere with rights, particularly the rights of former Ministers.  I hope that in future we shall have the right to correspond directly and that we will receive the same standard of efficiency and courtesy we always received in the past.  I hope there will be an end to ministerial intervention.  I find it difficult to understand why any Minister should make an order that he was to examine my representations.</P>
    <P>For over 40 years I have been communicating directly with Civil Service heads.  As a former Minister I am familiar with all the tricks of the trade.  When I was in the Department of Defence I did not want to see every file.  I did not want to send replies.  I did not want to have anything to do with correspondence addressed to the Civil Service head of the Department.  Citizens have their rights. I did not interfere with them.  Members of Dáil Éireann are entitled to the same rights and from 1 January I hope Members of this House, particularly former Ministers, will have their rights restored. This Christmas will be my 41st Christmas as a Member of this House and never in all those years until now have my rights ever been interfered with.  They have been interfered with by only two Departments, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Education. Any Member who wants to correspond with these Departments has a right to do so.  There must be some motive behind all this.  Why should two Departments adopt this practice?  I shall deal with the Department of Education at a later date.  When the new Department is established I ask that the rights of Deputies to communicate with the Civil Service head of that Department be restored forthwith.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish Deputy Oliver <Col N="2393" /> Flanagan a very happy 41st Christmas in the Dáil.  It is an unusual record.  He is a great example to newer Deputies for the contributions he constantly makes here. I want to ask the Minister why there was not an explanatory leaflet issued with this Bill.  I understand the Minister for Defence is standing in for the Minister for the Public Service.  I was not aware that the Minister for the Public Service was ill, because if he is I would not ask the Minister why he is standing in for him.  If he is ill I wish him a speedy recovery to good health.  I expect the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs will be replying to the debate, and it will give him an opportunity to clarify some situations which may arise in the future in the new Department.</P>
      <P>I welcome the setting up of the Department of Communications which combines the residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs with the Department of Transport.  I had the honour of serving as Minister of State with my colleague Deputy John Wilson as Minister for Transport and for Posts and Telegraphs. I want to take this opportunity to compliment the fine staff who worked in both those Departments.  I believe that when they are combined together in the new Department of Communications we will have some of the most experienced personnel joining the new Department.</P>
      <P>The point made by my colleague Deputy Wilson is a very relevant one in relation to the position regarding the secretaries of both Departments.  At the moment there is an independent secretary of the Department of Transport, Mr. MacMahon, and then there is the secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Kelly.  I would like the Minister to clarify exactly which of those will become the official secretary of the new Department of Communications and the general effect this will have on the existing staff at that particular level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major change has come about as a result of the setting up of the two new boards, An Post and An Bord Telecom, which will take over the main work of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from 1 January 1984.  During the year when we had the discussion on the Bill <Col N="2394" /> setting up both boards I had the privilege, on behalf of my party, of contributing to the debate.  It will be an historic occasion on 1 January next when both boards take over the full responsibility for running the postal and telecommunications side of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. We are fortunate in having as the chief executive of both of those boards very experienced men who have had, over the last few years, an opportunity to study their particular briefs.  They are coming into their particular tasks with great experience because of their involvement in the Department over the years since they were first appointed as acting chief executives of the existing boards. Both men have behind them boards with great experience built up in the postal and telecommunications side.  I believe that both boards will contribute greatly to the running of the postal and telecommunications side of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>I must place on record the contribution made by Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs over the years.  The present Minister and the previous Ministers, Deputy Wilson, Deputy Cooney, Deputy Reynolds and other Ministers before them have had a great record over the years. We all have a certain nostalgia in seeing the demise of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the oldest Department in the State, which has been in existence since before the State was set up.  The quality of the personnel and the quality of the service must be admired.  The postal service is certainly the best in the world and the telecommunications side will come into its own in 1984.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to what Deputy Flanagan said in relation to the telephone accounts.  There is serious disquiet in relation to those accounts.  I believe the Minister should in the few weeks he has at his disposal give particular attention to this area and lay down a policy directive to An Bord Telecom to carry out a detailed examination of the many complaints in relation to bills.  There are between 40,000 to 100,000 queries concerning telephone accounts which leave the Department short of £23.5 million.  That is quite a lot of money.  All the people <Col N="2395" /> cannot be wrong.  I know there are some complaints which are not justified but my experience, in dealing with a number of complaints from my constituency and throughout the country as spokesman for my party for Posts and Telegraphs when I have received a number of complaints from different parts of the country, is that there is something seriously wrong with the system.  The only way we can satisfy consumers ultimately is to give them detailed accounts of all the phone calls they make.  I know this will come about because of the digital service we have installed.  I believe this should be seriously considered on a trial period to allay the fears of the public generally in relation to telephone accounts.</P>
    <P>I am very much in favour of having the accounts issued every two months or preferably every month.  If people get their accounts every month they will be more aware of the rising cost of telephone calls and they will be more cautious in using the phone except for necessary communications.  The conversion of the manual exchanges and the provision of totally automatic services is well on stream.  This policy was initiated under a Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>It is a particularly dramatic experience for the staff who will be made redundant. Some of the staff have already been made redundant.  I have received representations from many personnel of the existing manual exchanges who are particularly concerned about their position in the new year.  The Minister should, on every occasion possible, allay the fears of the staff who have been so loyal to the service over the years.  Those people have worked under extremely difficult circumstances. Many of the exchanges have had to work long hours with totally inadequate equipment.  People will be made redundant because they are not in a position to transfer to existing services. The Minister under sections 44 and 45 of the Act setting up the board should specify clearly that the position of those people is guaranteed as far as redundancy offers are concerned, that the present negotiated redundancies will be honoured <Col N="2396" /> by the incoming boards.  I do not believe the Minister can say this too often to allay the fears of the staff involved.</P>
    <P>I had a Parliamentary Question down on 26 October to have the position clarified. The Minister will have the responsibility of ensuring that the provisions of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill 1982 will be honoured to the very letter.  During recent weeks I have been asking the Minister to lay before the House the terms of the conciliation and arbitration scheme relating to postmasters. I understand the Cabinet made a decision last Friday accepting the actual recommendations of the scheme.  As the Minister is well aware, there are 2,000 postmasters of sub-post offices throughout the State.  They agreed roughly two years ago to enter into negotiations with the Department and an arbitration group was set up to investigate the pay and conditions of postmasters of sub-post offices.  The recommendations were before the Government who, I understand, have accepted them.</P>
    <P>In reply to me on Question No. 359 on 29 November 1983 the Minister stated, and I quote from the Official Report, column 467, Volume 346:</P>
    <P>The report has been received.  In accordance with the provisions of the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for postmasters, the report will be presented to the Dáil, signifying the Government's intention in relation to the recommendations.  This will be done as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Time is running out, and with the passage of this Bill, the setting up of both boards and the vesting date of 1 January, the pay and conditions relating to postmasters will not be the responsibility of the Minister. I ask him to make a statement to the House signifying his intentions in relation to the scheme of conciliation and arbitration.</P>
    <P>I will not have an opportunity of replying to the Minister, but I hope that within the recommendations will be a rent allowance for premises for the postmasters. The Minister is well aware that the postmasters provide their own premises, heat them, light them and pay rates, <Col N="2397" /> water and all other charges for those premises.  In many locations the cost of providing full service by the postmaster is prohibitive, and unless they are given an adequate sum for the upkeep of their premises it will be very difficult for many postmasters to carry on.  I hope that the Minister in his agreement on conciliation and arbitration will not only give a major percentage increase to the postmasters but will give also other facilities and increases to cover the prohibitive cost of running their premises.  I would like to say now, when the postmasters are transferring to the new board, that they have provided and will provide one of the finest services in the Department because of their detailed knowledge of the public in the area, and their contribution to the Department must always be recognised. They have provided communications for the people direct to the Department.  The workload of the postmasters in sub-post offices should be expanded, because they are in a position to provide far more services than they are allowed to provide at the moment.  Sub-post offices provide Government representation in every parish throughout the State.  They are a tremendous network of offices linked to the main Post Office.  The Government and the new board will have an outlet at every location and through those locations far more work can be stimulated and organised. I refer particularly to the expansion of the post office savings side of the Department, which must be given great priority because it has such great access and availability for the people.  I hope the Minister will announce the details of this scheme in the House and that the postmasters will be aware of their position before this Bill is passed by 10 o'clock tonight and before the vesting date of 1 January 1984.</P>
    <P>The new Department of Communications will have satellite broadcasting as one of their main responsibilities.  In that area it would be appropriate for the Minister to come before the Dáil and announce details of his proposals for satellite television broadcasting.  He is aware that we have been allocated a spot in the sky for our own satellite.  We have been allocated five stations and I understand <Col N="2398" /> that the Minister has sought tenders from four Irish companies and 11 companies outside the State.  One of the companies already named is RTE and the other is An Bord Telecom.  I would like the Minister to name the other companies involved.  It would be appropriate that the Minister would advertise publicly to allow other interested parties to submit tenders to the Department in relation to this very lucrative area, a futuristic development which could give great opportunities to many companies.  It has been said that to have franchise for provision of satellite television is like having an oil well.</P>
    <P>The Minister may also wish to express his views on the possible postponement of the programme in Britain.  The BBC have decided to postpone the implementation of an earlier decision to provide satellite television early in the next few years.  That may represent a great opportunity for us here to be ahead of other countries in Europe and provide that satellite at the earliest possible opportunity. However, we must be very careful first of all to see that Irish industry will be given an opportunity to tender for this satellite and that we will have control of the production and provision of material for one if not more of those stations.  It will give a great opportunity to RTE to utilise a large portion of their staff in the provision of programmes, and of using their facilities at Montrose &mdash; which are partly unfinished &mdash; to provide services for satellite television.  I request the Minister to give the House an opportunity in the New Year in the next session of the Dáil to debate the involvement of satellite television and its effect in relation to communication here.  It presents great opportunities but it could create great problems of censorship and so on.  The Minister owes it to the Dáil to come before the House and let us know exactly where he stands in relation to satellite television.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not agree, because we are dealing with the Department of Communications.  Surely satellite communications will be very relevant to the new Department.  I do not think I am straying from the main purpose of the Bill.  However, in two minutes I will sum up the position.  It gives me an opportunity to request the Minister to outline some of the opportunities and problems which will arise in the not too distant future.</P>
      <P>This is an historic occasion.  I do not consider the introductory speech of the Minister acting on behalf of the Minister for the Public Service was adequate to mark the occasion.  The setting up of a new Department is a major step towards a very welcome development.  I note the departure of the Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Donnellan.  I wish him well in his new Department and I must express satisfaction at the way he carried out his responsibilities in that Department over the last 12 months.  I regret that he has been moved to another Department.</P>
      <P>The Minister should give great priority to bringing before the Dáil the necessary local radio Bills.  This matter is pressing. Also I compliment the Minister on acting very quickly on the request I made last week in relation to illegal television transmissions which commenced some weeks ago.  It was the proper action to take and I commend him for taking it so speedily. I strongly recommended it and I am delighted the Minister acted in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of my party I should like to express our hopes for success for the new Department of Communications.  I should like to thank the outgoing officers <Col N="2400" /> of the Department of Transport and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the staff who will be transferred on 1 January 1984.  I wish them every success. I know they will have exciting times ahead.  From my experience of dealing with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Transport I know they have some of the finest personnel who could be found in any Department. They are men of the highest integrity and ability.  I know the new Department will be a great success, as will An Bord Telecom and An Post.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Opposition speakers for their comments in relation to the Bill before us and also the main Bill dealing with postal telecommunications.  I am sure my colleague, the Minister for Defence, acting for the Minister for the Public Service, will deal with those matters when he replies to the debate.  I am happy to see my colleague, Deputy Oliver Flanagan, present &mdash; given the historic nature of the Bill.  He is the most senior Member of the House and, as he said himself, he has seen many Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs and all Ministers for Transport in the past 40 years. Deputy Flanagan is known for his public adherence to Christian principles and I think it only fair that I should deal with him with regard to the matter he raised in a spirit of charity.  The Deputy spoke to me on almost every day the Dáil sat but never once did he raise with me the question he raised publicly in the House. I can only ask why he felt it necessary to raise the question publicly.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that in two Departments the Secretaries did not deal with his correspondence: he mentioned the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Education. As the Deputy knows, I am also Minister for Transport but apparently what he said does not apply to that Department.  It might lead him to ask the reason for that.  This arrangement was introduced on my directions in the past two months because of the transitional arrangements that are now in train and because representations from Deputies will no longer be dealt with by the Department after 1 January.  It was done because we are handing over to semi-State bodies and because the Secretary of my Department has been more than occupied in dealing with the transition in a most skilful and brilliant way, together with some other officials.  The Minister of State was occupied almost entirely in dealing with representations but as those representations will no longer be dealt with by the Department he has been transferred to another Department.  That is the simple explanation for the change in arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs is the senior Department in the State because it is the oldest.  In 1984 it will celebrate its bicentenary.  It was formed in 1784 and it has been presided over by a series of Postmasters General. In the 1920s the title was changed to Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  Still in this House I have counted six former Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs.  They are Deputies Neil Blaney, Gerry Collins, John Wilson, Pádraig Faulkner, Pat Cooney and Albert Reynolds.  It is appropriate that two of those Members, Deputy Pat Cooney, who is the present Minister for Defence, and Deputy John Wilson, who was my predecessor, are present for the debate.  There have also been other distinguished holders of the office including the late President Erskine Childers, Oscar Traynor, <Col N="2402" /> Michael Hilliard, Jim Everett and Conor Cruise-O'Brien.</P>
    <P>The Department of Transport is 24 years old and it has had a distinguished history.  It has made a significant contribution to the welfare of the State.  There are eight former Ministers of that Department in the House at the moment.  I refer to Deputies Brian Lenihan, Michael O'Kennedy, Albert Reynolds, Pádraig Faulkner, Pat Cooney, John Wilson, Peter Barry and Tom Fitzpatrick.  The late George Colley was Minister for a brief period of six weeks and Erskine Childers was the first Minister for Transport. It is an interesting point that he spent more time in the Department of Transport &mdash; ten years &mdash; than almost all his successors.  We have had a rather rapid change of Ministers for Transport.</P>

    <P>In the case of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs four former Secretaries are alive, some of them being very notable persons.  They are Mr. Leon Ó Broin, Mr. Joseph Scannell, Mr. Proinsias Ó Colmáin and Mr. Liam Ó Réagáin.  It is right that the names of former Ministers and former Secretaries should be mentioned because they have guided the two Departments in dealing with important matters.  Now both Departments will merge into the new Department of Communications. It should not be seen as an end although inevitably, as Deputies opposite have said, there will be a certain feeling of nostalgia at the passing of the Departments especially one that is 200 years old.  I regard it as a new beginning. The merging of the two Departments was recommended as far back as 1969 in the Devlin Report.  It has taken 15 years to effect the merger although we must <Col N="2403" /> acknowledge that both Departments have been run in tandem with the same Minister acting for both of them for the past six years.</P>
    <P>Deputies opposite asked about the Secretaries of Departments.  The position is that both Secretaries will remain.  Mr. Noel MacMahon will be Secretary of the Department and Mr. Seán Ó Ceallaigh will be Second Secretary of the Department.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of other points raised by Deputies in relation mainly to items which would be more appropriate to a debate on the Estimate for Posts and Telegraphs.  However, there was an important point raised by Deputy Leyden, the question of the sub-postmasters' arbitration award and I can tell the Deputy that that will be laid before the House tomorrow as it has been approved by the Government.</P>
    <P>This merger has taken a great deal of work.  It started with the Dargan Committee, which was set up under Deputy Faulkner's Ministry and, following their report, the then Government decided to proceed with the re-organisation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs into two semi-State bodies.  Two boards were appointed by Deputy Faulkner and I am glad to say that those boards are more or less intact and will be continued into the permanent boards.  No changes were made by me except that the boards, as required by legislation, were increased by three and three new names were added to each board.  It speaks for itself that the appointments made have survived a number of Ministers for Posts and Telegraphs.  They are two excellent boards and it is right that we should record here our very special thanks to them for the work they have done in preparing for this takeover and also to thank the members of the Dargan Committee.</P>
    <P>Most importantly, credit must go to the Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr. Ó Ceallaigh, and the Deputy Secretary, Miss Ita Meehan, the most senior lady civil servant in the State and who, sadly, is retiring next week.  I also want to thank Mr. Jimmy <Col N="2404" /> Joyce, Assistant Secretary in charge of reorganisation, and the reorganisation unit who have done a fantastic job with great skill and dedication in managing this transition and made it much easier for me to handle.  Their work is now bearing fruit and I cannot praise them too highly for their dedication and skill in preparing the legislation, the consultations with regard to the legislation and all the other different phases right up to the negotiations after the legislation was passed.  They dealt with the very many items involved in transferring half of the Civil Service to these new boards.  I want to thank them and I wish them and the other members of the two Departments every happiness and success in the future. I know they will continue to serve the State as well as they have always done and in accordance with the traditions of their present Departments.</P>

      <P>It is unfortunate that there is a fixed time for this debate because there is very little time for me to reply to some of the points raised by Deputies.  I sympathise with Deputy Wilson's sense of anti-climax regarding the script with which I introduced this measure but he, Deputy Mitchell, Deputy Leyden and I might perhaps have a particular insight into the magnitude of what this Bill encompasses in terms of the huge changes made in the public service.  Perhaps, from our point of view the matter might seem somewhat anti-climatic at this stage.  This legislation is the final stage in the process which started in 1979 and it is essentially a technical measure to complete that process by setting up the new Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson speculated that the Department of the Public Service was the last new Department to be established and he made that point in the context of the lack of celebration, so to speak, surrounding this one.  However, his memory does not do him justice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

There is a nice piece of political history encompassed in the recollection of the setting up of the Department of Economic Planning and Development. I have no doubt that if the present incumbent, the departing incumbent and the future incumbent on my left wish to invite any of their predecessors to indulge in the beverage to which Deputy Wilson referred, we would be prepared to enjoy it.</P>

      <P>As I said, it is a technical measure to set up the new Department. It is the culmination of a process which has been the subject of much debate, both inside and outside the House.  I do not make any apology for not rehashing the entire matter in my opening speech because it would have been tiresome, repetitive and putting on the record what is already there in great detail on numerous occasions when we debated White Papers, discussion documents and the Bill.</P>
      <P>I was privileged, as Deputy Wilson reminded me, to have been a participant in the genesis of the new boards but I am afraid his remarks about my suffering frustration from the then Minister for Finance are not accurate.</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that he did not fully comprehend the complex financial arrangements that had to be made, involving huge sums of money, in order to ensure that the capital structure and financial arrangements for the new boards would be equitable as between the boards and the Exchequer from which they were departing, ultimately in the taxpayers' interest.  Those discussions had to be conducted at some length and were finally incorporated in the legislation which was brought forward by Deputy Wilson on the ground work which I, as his immediate predecessor, had successfully carried out.</P>
      <P>The arrangements covering the staff in the new Department will be worked out by the Department in consultation with the staff associations in accordance with normal practice.  I have no doubt that the smooth transitional arrangements which have been taking place over a number of months will be continued to the final stage of staffing arrangements in the new Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no explanatory leaflet issued with the Bill, as mentioned by Deputy Leyden.  The Bill is very short and the self-explanatory memorandum which normally accompanies a new Bill would be unnecessary.  The winding up of the Department, which was responsible for the oldest public utility in the State, is an historic occasion and perhaps there will be some regret at the change.  However, we must be excited at the prospect of change and I anticipate that the challenge and the opportunity that the new boards will present to those forming and taking part in them will be met in such a way that the services to which we have been accustomed for so long will continue to be provided in a far more efficient and profitable way for the State.  I congratulate and thank all those involved in the past work of the Department and I join with the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs <Col N="2407" /> and the Minister for Transport in wishing all who will serve on the new bodies every happiness under the new regime.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>In my brief remarks last evening I referred to the mixed reception that has been given to this Bill.  There are some who fear that the Bill is going too far down the road towards the erosion of civil liberties and basic human rights while there are those who believe that it is not going far enough.  My opinion is that the Minister has struck a happy balance, that he has arrived at a happy blend, by on the one hand not acceding fully to the demands of the Garda and the various associations who were seeking increased powers for the Garda but giving in part what was sought while at the same time providing the safeguard that the Bill will not become operative until a complaints body has been set up. In this way the Minister is safeguarding the basic human rights and the civil liberties of citizens.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister in that in the mere one year since becoming Minister for Justice, his career has been eventful and he has been a successful Minister.  I can only express the hope that the coming years will be as successful for him in this very demanding portfolio.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies we have received various submissions from people who are concerned about the extra powers being given to the Garda.  We had submissions from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors in Ireland which were signed by provincials of the major religious orders. We have had submissions also from the Irish Council of Civil Liberties and from other groups.  It is only right and proper <Col N="2408" /> that responsible people who are apprehensive about any new legislation should make their views known to Members of the House and I congratulate all those who have made submissions in this instance.  They have expressed views that are constructive and I am confident that the Minister will take note of those views and that if in his opinion there are any grounds for concern, appropriate amendments will be introduced on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>However, the main thrust and direction behind the Bill is not to infringe in any way on the basic human rights or civil liberties of the law-abiding citizen but rather to protect him and to apprehend those who would deprive him of his basic rights.  Many of my colleagues on this side have outlined in detail the tribulations of older people living alone, and even of younger people who are afraid to walk the streets for fear of being molested or who cannot enjoy the pleasures of their homes for fear of being burgled or attacked.  Therefore, law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear in so far as this legislation is concerned.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the apprehension on the part of some people in this instance has an historical background.  For too long the law-enforcing agencies in this country were arms of an alien power.  For too long agents of the conqueror were in charge of implementing the law.  There may be a little residue of that situation remaining in the minds of the Irish people.  But they can be reassured in that since their inception the Garda Síochána have been made up of our kith and kin, of our neighbours' children.  Indeed, any Deputy who has received representations recently from the fine young men and women wishing to join the Garda cannot but be impressed by the type of people, the flower of Irish manhood and Irish womanhood, who are anxious to don the blue uniform of the Garda.  These people are products of our homes and of our educational system.  I am confident that the motivation for their wishing to join the force is to serve the nation in a worthwhile capacity.  It is my regret that many more of these excellent young aspirants cannot gain entry to the Garda.  Perhaps <Col N="2409" /> I will be allowed to digress briefly on the question of candidates for the force. Some experienced Garda officers have been in touch with me and with other Deputies also and have expressed at least a little concern that since the Civil Service Commissioners are now in charge of the recruitment of gardaí, some of the successful applicants may not make the best Garda officers.  I emphasise that that is the opinion of the Garda officers who have made these representations to us. In putting that viewpoint I do not wish to detract in any way from those who have been successful in the examinations and interviews conducted by the commission, but from personal knowledge I know that some very fine boys and girls have failed to gain entry to the force.  I would be hoping for a situation in which there would be a second opinion in respect of candidates.  If such a group was established there would be a flood of queries from unsuccessful applicants, but any outstanding men or women who have been turned down for no obvious reason should be given a second opportunity to gain entrance to the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I should like to record my personal regard for the members of the force for the amount of voluntary work they engaged in throughout the country, particularly in rural areas.  Members of the force are involved in many social, cultural and charitable organisations. They give valuable help to the disabled and mentally retarded and give freely of their time to youth organisations.  In short, they are a credit to the nation.  I should like to compliment them on the splendid work they are engaged in on a voluntary basis.  The gardaí stationed in remote areas also deserve credit.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the many musical thrills that the Garda Band, under the magic baton of Superintendent Tommie Boyle, have given us whether at concerts, international rugby matches or at festivals. This talented group of musicians and singers perform a tremendous public relations exercise for the Garda.  They deserve our compliments.  Unfortunately, for too long the Garda have been the butt of every type of verbal assault <Col N="2410" /> and are often described as being brutal and boorish, but the Garda Band has done a lot to change those views and enhance the public perception of the force.  I hope the financial support to the band is not curtailed.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the prowess of gardaí on the hurling and football fields, on basketball courts, in the boxing ring and in rowing clubs.  They participate fully in our national sports and are great examples to our youth.  I should like to pay a tribute to a constituent of mine, Ban Garda Brenda Hyland, the pride of Tipperary and this year's Rose of Tralee. She epitomises the standard of candidates for the Ban Gardaí by her charm, poise, personality and pleasing looks. Her success in the Rose of Tralee contest was remarkable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>Jealousy will not get the Deputy anywhere.  That member of the force deserves our congratulations because she is engaged in a tremendous public relations exercise.  I am concerned to put the record of the gardaí in its proper perspective.  If the occasion arises when the Garda should be complimented we should not neglect to do so.  We should compliment them on any achievements that bring credit to the force and, indirectly, to the nation.  I accept that some members of the force betray the trust placed in them, but that is only to be expected in an organisation of 11,500 men and women.  Thankfully, fellow officers do not hesitate to prosecute such offenders in the courts.  Members of the force who have appeared before the courts have been severely and harshly dealt with, and rightly so, for betraying the trust our people placed in them.  I hope the decision to establish the new complaints body will mean that all gardaí will do everything possible to uphold the high standard of the force.  I trust that those who infringe the code of conduct will be dealt with severely within their organisation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The task of the gardaí is hazardous.  In the report on crime for 1982 it is stated <Col N="2411" /> that wounding and other acts endangering the lives of gardaí increased by a massive 70 per cent, from 17 in 1981 to 29 in 1982.  Gardaí never flinch in their duty and take great risks in the service of the nation.  We can recall with pride that 24 members of the force gave their lives in the service of the nation and it is worth recalling that 202 members were awarded Scott medals. The House will be aware that this award was initiated by Colonel Walter Scott, the honorary commissioner of the New York City Police, in 1923.  He presented a £1,000 gold bond and directed that the interest from it should pay for a gold medal.  A condition attached to the award of the gold medal was that no action, however heroic, would merit the award of the medal unless it took the shape of an act of personal bravery performed intelligently in the execution of duty at risk to the life of the doer and with full previous knowledge of the risk involved.  In 1925 Colonel Scott presented a 500 dollar bond for the award of silver and bronze medals.  To date 58 gold, 79 silver and 65 bronze awards have been presented.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the older members of the force, those involved since 1922.  They worked in difficult times following the birth of our nation and at a time when some Irish people did not accept them.  However, by their integrity and commitment to duty they gradually gained the support of the Irish people. They do not owe their allegiance to any political party or Government and they have carried out their duties with the highest integrity at all times.  The older members of the force have passed on a proud and noble tradition to the young gardaí.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the causes of the increase in crime which have resulted in the necessity for this legislation.  In my view we have experienced a spillover of the horrendous crimes being committed in the North by para-military groups. Already more than 2,000 people have lost their lives violently and more than 20,000 people injured in that small part of the country.  I do not think there is any household there that has not suffered in <Col N="2412" /> some way or other from the violence.  As a consequence of the violence North of the Border the quality of life in the South has been reduced and so have our values because of the continuation of violence which now has permeated the whole island, and the people are being conditioned to this violence.</P>
    <P>I hope we will never regard life as cheap, that we will never accept the right of any para-military group to take innocent human lives.  When such dastardly acts occur we should cry to the heavens to indicate our utter revulsion at those acts.  Our sensibilities must not be dulled by these events, no matter how often they occur.  We must make it known that those people do not act on our behalf.  Unfortunately, the troubles in the North have had a spillover effect on us here and we see an increase here of violent crime.</P>
    <P>Many members of the Garda Síochána are deployed on Border duty.  This is very necessary but fruitless work.  Their time should be spent investigating crime in the South, patrolling our major towns and villages.</P>
    <P>TV films and plays have had a major impact on our acceptance of violence as the ordinary way of life.  We all know that TV is a powerful medium because of its access to every household.  People who would not dare to allow criminals or such characters into their houses are allowing even young children to view outrageous crimes being committed on films.  I suggest that the Censorship Act of 1946 should be invoked to control this.  I urge the Minister to have a serious look at that.  There has been a horrifying growth in the spread of videos.  I am amazed and horrified by the level of filth, indecency and obscenity that some of these videos portray.  They are freely available throughout the country. I urge the Minister to update the Censorship Act to ensure that such films and videos will not be freely on sale here.</P>
    <P>Unemployment has been given as a reason for increasing crime.  The father going out to work in the morning has not been the practice in many households. As the level of unemployment reaches 200,000 we can expect a corresponding increase in crime.  Idle hands will find <Col N="2413" /> work to do, especially among the youth who daily see on television all the things that they should be entitled to in a consumer society but which they are deprived of.  They are being tempted to have those products by hook or by crook, unfortunately mostly by crookery.</P>
    <P>There are other reasons for the increase in crime, such as poor social conditions, bad housing and bad environment. All these propel young people towards crime.  Crime cannot be curbed by giving extended powers to the Garda in this or any other Bill.  The whole social system must be revamped.  We must try to solve growing unemployment among growing youth.</P>
    <P>The Garda need specialised sophisticated equipment today to deal with sophisticated, educated criminals.  If the Garda are to make any impact on criminals they must be properly equipped to do so.  I suggest that members of the Garda should go on refresher courses every two years.  They should be brought up-to-date with the most modern forms of crime detection.  There should be exchange visits between them and their counterparts in Europe and in America so that they can all learn from each other in the job of apprehending criminals. What happens in America today will be happening here in six months because the world is very small, with television and other means of communication.  Fads and styles of living in America and in Europe today will be here in a short time.  Our Garda should learn from those.  They should particularly learn about methods of detection and prevention used by other police forces.</P>
    <P>Increasing crime is not a phenomenon peculiar to Ireland.  It exists in America and throughout Europe, and if gardaí went on the type of exchange visits I have suggested they would learn something from their counterparts to help to apprehand criminals.</P>
    <P>I am not glorifying in the introduction of repressive legislation.  I sympathise with our young unemployed people who are caught in the crime web, but in fairness and justice we must protect the innocent from the criminals.</P>
    <P>We have had references to the courts <Col N="2414" /> and to our prison system.  One would be loath to interfere with the eminent members of the Judiciary.  We should not try to restrict them in any way, but there seems to be an extraordinary lack of uniformity in sentences.  We can cite instances of people being given 12 months imprisonment for poaching a salmon while somebody might be released on probation for attacking and half killing somebody.  I know judges are only human like the rest of us and have their pet likes and dislikes, but I suggest that those learned gentlemen should meet occasionally and try to draw up a list of sentences that would give some semblance of uniformity.  I appreciate that in some cases there are extenuating circumstances and that the background to each case is different, and in many cases a slight variance in sentencing would be acceptable, but the present system is something of a scandal which causes lack of trust or confidence in our courts.</P>
    <P>In our prisons we should provide reform centres.  Rather than being purely punitive we should be trying to rehabilitate offenders.  The report on the prisons has just been issued.  It makes worthwhile reading.  It provides an insight into the enormous amount of good work that is being done by the prison authorities. Despite recent adverse publicity I think our prison system is a good one and, with the limited finances available, the personnel are doing a very good job and giving a very good service in very difficult circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is need to establish a code of professional conduct.  In the Bill in front of us we seem to be dictating to the gardaí what they should not do.  Now that is a negative approach.  We should rather encourage them to aspire to a higher code of professional conduct.  Such a code should be established.  The Council of Europe four years ago in 1979 in the Committee on Legal Affairs drew up a report on Document 4212 dealing with ethics and other things.  Some are worth while mentioning.  They would seem to be very opportune at the moment.  No. 2 says the police should act with integrity, impartiality and dignity.  In particular <Col N="2415" /> they shall refrain from and vigorously oppose all acts of corruption.  They shall carry out all orders properly issued by their superiors.  They shall refrain from carrying our any order they know or ought to know is unlawful.</P>
    <P>There are many other practical directions in this regard to the police.  There are 12 articles on the status of the police. The police officer shall receive internal training as well as appropriate instruction in social problems, human rights and, in particular, on the European Convention on Human Rights.  A fourth article says that the professional, psychological and material conditions under which a police officer will perform his duties shall be such as to protect his integrity, impartiality and dignity.  The Minister should have another look at this report.  He should recommend it to the Government. I understand it has not yet been adopted so it is not yet binding on member states.</P>
    <P>Article 16 refers to good relations between the police and the public as essential.  No police force can do its work properly without the active moral and material support of those communities in which it performs its duties.  I would recommend this to the Minister.  I see no reason why we should not adopt it.  I believe it would receive great acceptability on the part of the Garda Siochána because they would have a positive approach and it would give our police something to which to aspire rather than telling them not to do this and not to do that.  Their powers are limited to a great degree and, if things were put clearly and intelligently, as they are in this worthwhile report, the gardaí would benefit and so would the citizens.  It is a two-way system.  Without the support of the public the work of the gardaí cannot be successful.</P>
    <P>I want to refer now to the drug problem. I would like to compliment the drug squad on their success in combating this horrific crime.  Drugs are on the increase especially among young people.  Other Deputies have referred to the irreparable damage being done.  I would not spare drug pushers.  I would lock them up permanently. I would remove them from <Col N="2416" /> society so that they could not carry out their horrendous work.  I congratulate the task force on their successes.  I understand a committee is being set up and I wish it every success.  We have some figures of the numbers charged with the illegal possession of drugs.  The figure has risen from 1,500 in 1981 to 1,873 in 1982, an increase of 26 per cent.  An alarming fact is the amount of heroin which has been seized.  It has increased from 170 grammes in 1981 to 1,264 grammes in 1982.  I would urge the Minister not to spare any expense in giving the task force every facility to enable them to bring drug pushers to book.  Those who traffic in drugs deserve no sympathy whatsoever from anybody.  The full resources of the Government and the Department should be readily available to the task force to enable them to expunge once and for all this horrible crime from our society.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  There is a happy balance in the Bill.  The gardaí are given what is needed to enable them to apprehend criminals, the enemies of society, bring them to court, and to successful sentencing.  Heretofore the habitual criminal has exploited the law and has virtually snapped his fingers at the gardaí and has often left the courts through what are described as technicalities.  I hope the Bill will give the gardaí the powers they need to apprehend criminals.  However, all the law on the Statute Book will not solve the problems unless the gardaí have the full co-operation of the public.  I hope that when the commission is set up the serious worries of those who are concerned that civil liberties are being eroded in the Bill will be allayed and any doubts or suspicions in their minds will be removed.  I wish the Bill a speedy passage, and once again I compliment the Minister on having the courage to bring it before the House.  His immediate predecessor did not have the courage to do so.  I believe this Bill will go down as one of the finest Bills passed by this House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to say a few words on this very important and far reaching Bill.  Contrary to what the last speaker feels I do not believe it will go down as <Col N="2417" /> one of the greatest Bills ever enacted here.  I am a firm believer that any Criminal Justice Bill would of necessity be a diminution of our civil rights in one way or another.  The very name of the Bill suggests that.  In a perfect society there would not be any need for a Criminal Justice Bill.  Society requires that we order our lives, but that is not to say that we should give such great welcome to any measure which limits what are the most basic and fundamental rights we have, our civil rights.</P>
      <P>We must state quite clearly that this Bill goes down that road too far in some particular aspects of it.  I believe, when it comes to the Committee Stage, that it will be a long and tortuous job before it finally reaches the Statute Book.  This should happen if only to satisfy the general public that every single aspect of the Bill is teased out to its finality so that everybody is very clear that we are not putting something on the Statute Book which might very well work against our civil rights in the future.  It is to be expected that we must limit our civil rights in the future.  It is to be expected that we must limit our civil rights in times of great stress.  It is interesting that the justification being made for this Bill is that the level of crime is now at an unacceptable level.  That is agreed by all, and it is accepted that some measures must be taken to deal with this for the common good.  The climate is right for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe this Bill goes above politics in many ways.  Any Minister for Justice who promoted legislation like this some years ago would have got very short shift and it would not have got an easy passage. When this Bill was first introduced I was quite taken back that a lot of the legal people and those one would normally expect to respond immediately did not do so.  It is only very late in the debate that some inherent dangers in the Bill have been reflected on.  It is only when they are reflected on that they recognise that this might not be the best vehicle which can be used in support of the Garda in dealing with what is now the unacceptable level of crime in the State.  If the climate is right this should not lead us in any way to a false sense of security, in <Col N="2418" /> accepting legislative measures which would not in normal circumstances be accepted by the people.  That climate should not be used to further a legislative programme that would interfere to quite a considerable degree with what we have come to recognise are our fundamental rights.</P>
    <P>It would be preferable if all other avenues were tried repeatedly and proved to have failed before we resort to taking away any right no matter what form that might be.  I believe there are measures which could have been contemplated before this Bill in its entirety was brought in.  There are some aspects of the Bill which are long overdue, and they will have universal acceptance, but there are aspects of it which need to be questioned. It is no harm to mention some of them now.  I may have an inate fear of this Bill which is ill-founded, and I would be glad to have that disposed of by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I would like, before dealing with those matters, to deal with some of the measures which could have been taken and more recognition given to them before this Bill was brought before the House. The first and more essential thing, as far as the Garda are concerned, is that they must have the respect and co-operation of the public at large.  It is easy for me to say that in the kind of constituency which I represent where the gardaí are very closely knit into the community.  They usually hold very responsible positions outside their duties.  They are respected and are very active in all aspects of community life, so we do not have the same crime problem in my constituency as the people have in other constituencies.  At the same time it is just as important in the west of Ireland as it is in west Dublin or any other part of Dublin that we have the right kind of policing arrangements.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in saying that the most effective policing one can have is that they can be seen readily by the general public.  There is some talk that more can be done in that area and that there would be a better response even in the cities if the gardaí could be better integrated into the society in which they work.  If that involves extra gardaí, if it involves the development of gardaí from <Col N="2419" /> other areas, if it involves fewer gardaí in mobile units and more gardaí on foot patrols so be it.  It is important that I should reflect the attitude of the people who sent me here.  They would like the Minister to take the initiative in having more people put on foot patrol.  It is not generally recognised that there is a close integration with community affairs by foot patrols in the large urban areas which they serve.  I believe, until that formula has been experienced to its ultimate, we will not get the reduction in the type of crimes which take up most of the court time.</P>
    <P>I believe another look should be taken at the question of police training.  I do not believe that in this age of technological know-how that the short period which a Garda recruit spends in Templemore is sufficient to train him in all aspects of police work to deal with the modern criminal.  Sufficient time is not given to training to enable him to do the job effectively.  The Garda have not been provided with enough plant and equipment or enough training in new technology to enable them to do the job as well as they could do it with the manpower they have under their control.  These areas should have been examined and improved upon before some of the things in this Bill were brought into this House. Provision of money for plant and improving the technology attached to Garda operations would be welcomed and it would not be resisted in this House.  It would be granted in the sure knowledge that whatever money would be expended would be repaid not just in the relief of the mental and physical distress brought about by crime but in the amount of property that would be salvaged.  The benefits from plant and equipment such as is made available to other police forces would be enormous.  The training facilities for use of this equipment should be provided.  It is not possible to do that in our limited training school situation, and in the time element involved the individual garda has not the capacity to assimilate that training.  Whatever in-service training there is could very easily be improved upon.  Other professions provide <Col N="2420" /> in-service training on a regular basis, not just once or twice in a lifetime but often once a year. The Garda should have an integrated programme for all ranks to do in-service training here and selected members of the force to do it abroad. The we would have an internationally integrated police force to deal with the crime situation that we have so often referred to in this House and outside.</P>
    <P>We might not be getting the results that we demand from our detention centres, our jails.  The arrangements are referred to very loosely by the general public as a bit of a laugh.  Offenders go into prison for what some of them may have come to regard as a short holiday. The social stigma attached to a jail sentence has diminished considerably.  It is sad that such should be the case, but it is so, and the recession may be one reason for it.  Matters come to public notice about short circuits being taken by people who would never have dreamed of doing so formerly.  Jail sentences are not viewed in the way they used to be viewed, and this factor will become more apparent as the years go by.  When a judge after listening to a case passes a sentence in accordance with the law of three months or whatever it is the general public, the taxpayers, expect that the person will serve that sentence taking account of the normal remission for good behaviour. They expect us to make the arrangements necessary to enable sentences to be served.  What percentage of crime committed by young people represents a repeat performance because there is not now the recognition that crime will be punished by the full penalty imposed by the law?  Statistics relating to offences show that more than 50 per cent of offences are committed by people under 21 years of age.  That shows disrespect for authority, but it shows something else.</P>
    <P>A certain type of crime now is regarded as justifiable and will continue to be so perhaps because of a whole range of social problems.  At the same time there are ways of dealing with it.  If it could be established absolutely that a penalty given or a sentence passed by a court must be honoured and the debt to society paid in full except for remission, that <Col N="2421" /> would go a long way towards cutting out some of the second offences and would reduce the level of minor and juvenile crime.  This is not being said flippantly. Doing a stretch in Mountjoy Prison, whether for a couple of hours, a day, the weekend or whatever, does not seem to have the desired deterrent effect on many young criminals.  Maybe it is because the system there does not seem to impose the kind of rigours the general public expect from a detention system.  If a centre was located in some other area and a proper work schedule was attached to the sentence, and if the in and out system that seems to exist in some of the biggest centres of detention did not operate, many young criminals might not be too happy to go back for a second trip.  I am not talking about rough-neck tactics by the prison officers or anything like that. I am talking about the work patterns in some detention centres and it being mandatory on certain individuals to do a certain amount of physical work in a location not half a mile down the road from their native environment with all the to-ing and for-ing.  It might very well reduce the number of people anxious to go back to cutting turf for a further three months.</P>
    <P>More attention might be paid to the receivers of stolen goods who are known as fences.  To take one offence, 80,000 or so burglaries took place last year.  At that rate over a six year-period half a million houses would be affected.  I have suffered from this.  My home has been burgled six times in the last six months. They have got to the stage of not inflicting the same physical damage as they did before.  Perhaps it is because the equipment I have there is no longer worth taking.  The matter has come to that. Perhaps I do not take the necessary precautions with regard to expensive locks and alarm systems.  It seems to me the same places have been robbed on several occasions.  That has been proved in certain areas of the city, and now some people have decided to sell their detached private residences and live in apartments where they will have security all the time.  It should not be so.  We have reached the stage where the old person <Col N="2422" /> cannot feel he has a safe and secure home and the worker living in the suburbs cannot leave his or her home in the full knowledge that it will be in the same condition when he or she returns.</P>
    <P>The question arises where is all the stuff going.  It is fenced at a fraction of its value and it is moved on to be sold in other locations.  I accept that much of the high value low-weight stuff may find its way out of our jurisdiction, but many items are obviously being sold in this jurisdiction.  However, we do not hear on a continuing basis about people being brought before our courts, at least not often enough.  Burglars cannot operate effectively unless they have some way of cashing in their spoils.  Any reduction in the number of burglaries would be of enormous benefit.  We have been told that many of the burglaries have been carried out by people who are in need of quick money to feed another habit.  They are not concerned about going to another jurisdiction to sell the goods.  They do not want to keep them on hands for long. They have to convert them into money quickly.  They are carrying out the burglaries on the understanding that somebody is standing by who can off-load the material for them or they are acting under instructions of another kind.  This aspect could be considered and it might lead to a reduction in the number of burglaries.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of this Bill cause me concern. I dislike the principle of being detained without warrant on suspicion.  I do not think I am saying any more than the Minister would say.  This Bill is being forced on us and we should say that to the public.  We have to accept it but surely we should at least write a timescale into it.  If we could have avoided it we would not have this legislation.  I do not like the permanent nature of some of the things being asked of us.  It would have been to our advantage if some timescale had been written in so that we could consider the matter at another time when we would have mastered some of our present difficulties. Would it not be magnificent if, instead of having to bring in Bills dealing with criminal justice, we had a Bill restoring some of the things that have been taken from us?  It is unfortunate that we <Col N="2423" /> are moving always in the one way.  We should have a chance to restate the need for this legislation on a periodic basis.</P>
    <P>It is said that detention can only become effective when the garda or the member in charge of the Garda station has reasonable grounds for believing an offence has been committed which is punishable by imprisonment of five years.  I would have been much happier if the section stated that the member in charge of a Garda station had to have a senior rank rather than have a situation where, in smaller stations, it could be the most junior man just out of Templemore.  I accept that that young officer will have had a certain amount of training and experience.  I want it to be clearly recorded that anything I say is in no way reflecting on the gardaí.  I want them to do the job for us so that we can say we do not need a Bill like this any more.  I do not want it to work against the gardaí in subsequent cases taken against them under the complaints procedure the Minister is bringing forward.  If the most junior man is in charge of the station at that time and a senior officer brings in a person who is being detained on suspicion, I do not see that junior officer telling the senior man that he does not see it as justifiable to detain the person concerned. The section should be amended in order to establish that a member of some seniority has to be present to confirm the detention in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The Bill states that the detention will be for a period not exceeding six hours. I can see a reason for the six hours but I am not sure I can see a reason for an extension of a further six hours, even disregarding the rest period.  As I understand it, in another jurisdiction on the other side of the water, over 90 per cent of confessions obtained in interrogation were got within four hours.  If the necessary information cannot be got in six hours, I do not think it can be got at all. It leaves in my mind the uneasy suspicion that if the period were extended the resistance of the person being questioned might fade somewhat and, consequently, a confession might be got after a longer period but not for the right reason.  If the <Col N="2424" /> statistic is accurate &mdash; I have got the relevant reference to put on the record of the House &mdash; that over 90 per cent of interrogations or questionings achieved the desired result one way or another within a shorter period, I should think it is asking too much to extend it for a further six hours.  With eight hours in between as a rest period we are talking about 20 hours.  That is too long.</P>
    <P>While it is stated here that a rest period exists from 12 midnight until 8 a.m., there is provision for questioning to take place during that period.  That is reasonable if reason prevails at all times on the part of persons involved in the questioning. There is no statement in this legislation that says that the questioning during the rest period, the instruction of the authorising officer having been received, cannot proceed for the full eight hours.  There is a loophole here in that if the six hours elapsed at midnight and the necessary authorisation had been received, questioning could carry on for a further eight hours during the most difficult period in a day, twelve midnight to 8 a.m.  I should be happy to hear that there is a formula whereby that cannot happen.  I should like to be satisfied that the length of the interrogation in the rest period is very closely governed by some regulation in this legislation.</P>
    <P>A person must be charged as soon as there is enough evidence to do so.  It is normal to expect that that would be the case, but it might very well not be the practice.  If a garda felt that carrying on the interrogation or questioning beyond the period where they could be normally expected to say that they had enough evidence to charge, the temptation to continue must be very strong, particularly if there is a considerable portion of the first six hour period left.  It would be very difficult to implement a restraining influence.  It would be natural to go on. I can see myself as a police officer in hot pursuit of information, having got the man to accept responsibility for a particular action and knowing that there was other information which might be extracted which could be of enormous benefit in that or subsequent issues, carrying on to the end of the six hour period.  That <Col N="2425" /> will have to be very carefully monitored.</P>
    <P>While we always expect the people will not be detained without good cause, what about the person who is brought in but against whom no charge is preferred? How soon after you let him out can he be retaken in for questioning?  There is no provision here when it is decided, after questioning, that a case does not exist, that one hour later, perhaps when he is going out the door, he can be brought back in to start another six hour period of questioning.  The Minister is shaking his head in the negative, and that pleases me greatly, because these are the questions which people are asking and it is very important&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If I had my way I would make it mandatory on every TD to give his or her opinions on the Bill.  There are many Bills where this is not necessary, but this is the most fundamental legislation to come before this House in this or any other year.  While it is easy to take somebody in and detain them on suspicion, at the same time it is very difficult to restore a character when it is taken away.  Character restitution will certainly not be covered in this Bill but, in a small community when somebody is detained on suspicion, even if they are not subsequently charged, the public unfortunately have virtually condemned them <Col N="2426" /> anyway.  I do not know whether the complaints procedure will allow somebody who was detained on suspicion and subsequently not charged to get back his or her reputation.  Is there a formula being provided by the Minister to do so?  I have yet to hear details of his complaints procedure, but I think a safeguard like that should be obligatory.  If somebody is wrongly charged he should not suffer in person or in reputation subsequent to the detention.</P>
      <P>I am sure the whole question of photographs and fingerprints has been referred to by many Deputies.  Whatever procedure the Minister devises for guaranteeing the destruction of these documents when the time is right he will have to make it absolutely clear to this House what that procedure is.  This is not a reflection on the Garda Síochána, but any police force worth its salt depends to an enormous degree on its records and investigations.  There is no doubt that the records which would be provided by having a file on every single citizen in this State would be of enormous benefit to the police.  That should not be necessary in a democracy but, as it would be of such value, the temptation must be extraordinarily strong for the police force to commit much of this valuable information to the records for further reference. With regard to photographs and fingerprinting, there will have to be a guaranteed process which can be monitored to everybody's satisfaction, including the gardaí so that they will not subsequently be the subject of actions and that these documents if necessary to follow on in the proceedings of subsequent charges, will be maintained properly and, when it is time for them to be destroyed, that it will be done and that complete destruction will take place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on the provisions in sections 9 to 11 on the question of bail.  He will have my support and I am sure the full support of this House for something that has been in need of reform for a long time.  I expect that sections 13, 14 and 15 will be welcomed also but I am not so sure about section 16, which I take to be the inference section. The totality of what might be applied <Col N="2427" /> in the interpretation of this section is not crystal clear in the Bill.  It is ambiguous and, consequently, should not be put on the Statute Book.  I shall not go into all the possibilities under this section except to say that the mental state of people detained, even if only on suspicion, is often totally different from what it would be outside of a Garda questioning room. There is no room for ambiguity either in what is inferred there or what might subsequently be of considerable damage to an accused.  Therefore, I expect that there will be a good deal of difficulty with that section at Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>There have been references to such phrases as &ldquo;ordinary language&rdquo; and &ldquo;it may not be taken&rdquo; and so on, but this phraseology is ambiguous.  There is no clear statement of intent as to what the situation will be in any given set of circumstances. If I am involved at Committee Stage I shall be giving instances of where that provision goes too far.</P>
    <P>We all expected to have had some details of the complaints procedure the Minister will be bringing in in support of this legislation, a procedure which no doubt he will be introducing in good faith, but asking the House to deal with this legislation and to pass the Bill without the details of the safeguards being known to us is tantamount to asking a soldier to walk blindfolded through a minefield.  This legislation should be amended, but even amended it must not be implemented in this democracy until the safeguards are spelled out not only in the interest of the individual who will be the subject matter of these new regulations but in the interest of the Garda.  It is paramount that we protect the Garda from the possibility of losing the respect that has been built up for them during a long period.  They do not wish to be left in such a vulnerable position.  While they may not understand fully yet the total implications of the legislation we are discussing, quite a number of gardaí realise that there are difficulties involved and that it will be virtually impossible in certain circumstances to implement some of the proposed provisions without actions being brought against them subsequently.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2428" /> There are many measures in this Bill that are needed.  They are necessary because of the climate being as it is and for that reason only, but there are some elements of the Bill which to my way of thinking do not guarantee the rights of the individual.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill and I compliment the Minister on its introduction. The deficiencies in the present system have long been apparent, and it seems that the scales of justice are weighted in favour of the criminal.  At least, that is the public perception of the situation, and we are talking of a public who are long suffering, who are not safe either in their homes or on the streets.</P>
      <P>Successive Ministers have been aware of the need for this Bill, but I am very pleased that the present Minister on being given the Justice portfolio applied the powers of positive thinking which resulted in the Bill being before us.</P>
      <P>I represent the constituency of Dublin Central, and that is the most deprived area in the country.  This is a fact that is accepted by every Member of the House who campaigned in the recent by-election. It is accepted that 60 per cent of all crime committed in the country is committed in the City of Dublin.  I suggest that the lion's share of that could be attributed to Dublin Central and particularly to the inner city, which is an area of great deprivation and one that has been designated down through the years. It is an area that has all the ingredients to qualify it for the reputation it has acquired.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the report of the Garda Commissioner which was published last month we find that there was an increase of 9.2 per cent in the crime figures compared with the figures for the previous year. When one considers the lifestyle that most of the citizens of Dublin have had to contend with in recent years, the prospect of a continuing increase in the rate of crime must be horrifying.  The extent of the continuing involvement of young people in criminal activity is particularly worrying.  Approximately one-third of all persons apprehended for criminal offences are under the age of 17.  This is a <Col N="2429" /> problem that must be tackled vigorously and with determination.  The vast majority of the public are not prepared to accept that this growth in the level to criminal activity is inevitable.  The enforcement of the law is essential if we are to have a civilised society.</P>
    <P>I have been surprised in recent years by what appears to be the failure of the State to take appropriate steps to counter the violence and the general disorder that is increasingly apparent in our society. Repeatedly, the reaction appears to be short-term and negative, with a concentration on more jail sentences, on detention for young people involved in violence, in fencing in brawling football fans, in masked gardaí with improved riot gear and so on.  I am not querying these measures, but my point is that of themselves they are not sufficient.</P>
    <P>They do not reach the heart of the difficulty, which is long term and rooted in the absence from the minds and hearts of so many today of the values that must be there if our citizens are to enjoy a civilised existence.  As a man is so shall he act.  He is shaped by the values that are instilled in the family, the home and the school, in the formative years and, later, by the values of the society in which he lives.  The problem has to be tackled there with the parents as the primary educators.  No amount of Garda numbers or additional equipment will cure the ills of our society today if we do not have the climate that will produce the type of citizens who are law abiding.  To say that the Garda can do that is tantamount to suggesting that one can hold back the tide with one hand.</P>
    <P>What continues to astonish me is the failure on the part of those with responsibility for maintaining standards to recognise this fact.  The feminist movement in their frantic efforts to liberate the women of Ireland have had their greatest measure of success in undermining and frustrating the majority of mothers who were devoting their time to raising the nation's children.  The permissive, increasing anti-authority society of today is not unrelated to this fact.  Successive Governments have failed to <Col N="2430" /> recognise and support Article 41.2 of the constitution, which states:</P>
    <P>In particular, the State recognises that by her life with the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said that crime, and its consequences, in one form or another, cast a shadow over much of our social life today and force us to reassess many of our traditional values and attitudes.  He also said that the question about the causes of crime remains unresolved.  He added:</P>
    <P>For instance, in what sense can poverty be said to be a cause of crime when in fact the great majority of poor people are never in trouble with the law?  Yet it is clear that poverty, unemployment and poor social conditions generally are factors that play an important part.</P>
    <P>Can it be denied that we, the elected representatives, have an obligation to show real concern for our society which is now almost bereft of any hope of employment for our young people.  What is the perception of those unemployed young people when they learn that many of those who receive adequate salaries as elected representatives are also taking from this impoverished State large pensions for past services rendered?  Surely it is a case of the rich getting richer while the poor get poorer.  Inherent in that are all the ingredients for real trouble.  The effect on our young population of 14 years of savagery and barbarism by all sides in Northern Ireland, committed in the name of the Irish people, must have had an impact also on the crime levels. We have had to suffer an economic burden with £250 million being spent on crime related services, money which could have been better spent on creating jobs for our young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that the purpose of the Bill was to give some new powers to the Garda Síochána to enable them investigate crime more effectively and to amend and update certain aspects of <Col N="2431" /> criminal law and procedure for the better administration of justice.  In the course of a statement issued yesterday the Incorporated Law Society welcomed some of the proposals in the Bill such as majority verdicts, the abolition of unsworn statements, notification of alibi defences and the proposal in relation to bail.  However, they express reservations on some aspects of the Bill which they felt could lead to a serious invasion of the rights of innocent citizens.  The Justice Commission of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors were concerned about aspects of the Bill.  In the course of their statement they accepted that the Garda needed more effective powers to deal with professional criminals involved in serious offences.  The Bill proposes to meet these needs.  It gives massive general powers to the Garda which may be used on petty offenders, juveniles and innocent people who happen to be in the vicinity of an illegal occurrence.  Those who are aware of the conditions that exist in the inner city know of the validity of that concern.  That group maintain that the use of these powers in a wider context would not reduce crime but create a destructive gap between the people and the Garda.</P>
    <P>In many areas of the inner city some of these proposals may trigger off a reaction which may increase and not diminish crime.  It is essential that in those areas we have good community relations between the gardaí and local people.  I was heartened to hear the Minister say that Dublin born recruits will be posted to Dublin stations.  That is a step in the right direction, because those who have grown up in the city and suburbs have a better chance of coming to terms with the problems of Dublin.  There is nothing more pathetic than to see a young recruit from a rural background who does not know one street from another in the city trying to maintain law and order.  I had occasion to call on one of those young gardaí to chase a handbag snatcher but, of course, the criminal was able to run rings around the young policeman.</P>
    <P>While appreciating that it is difficult to give the Garda powers for one purpose <Col N="2432" /> in such a way that they are not automatically available for another purpose I suggest that the Bill is strong in giving powers but weak in providing safeguards.  Section 3 (2) enables a garda with reasonable cause to detain a suspected person for a considerable period of time.  My fear about that provision is that the type of people they will be likely to come across in my constituency will be young, inarticulate and defenceless people.  They may be tough eggs but they would not be in a position to make their case or to know how to go about doing that.  That concerns me.  It should be necessary for a garda to state the reasonable cause to the suspected person and to the station sergeant or the garda in charge of the station. A station sergeant should have the legal obligation of accepting responsibility for the garda's decision to detain for reasonable cause.  If the garda's view of reasonable grounds was unsound the station sergeant could cancel the detention immediately.  The abolition of the right to silence in section 15 gives extraordinary powers to gardaí.  After a theft any person with anything in their hands or pockets may be asked to give an explanation for possessing them.  Further, if a garda believes he has reasonable grounds for making an inquiry, if he believes an explanation is misleading, he can detain a person.</P>
    <P>In the inner city areas of Dublin, in Dublin Central in particular, this section will have the effect of creating mutual suspicion in the basic relationship between innocent people and the Garda, and this could trigger off a further reaction that could result in increased crime rather than the reverse.  We must see to it that young people who do not commit crimes will have trust and confidence in the Garda.  Therefore, I suggest that this section should be restricted in its application to those who have been convicted already for precisely the type of crime they are being questioned about.</P>
    <P>The Bill covers a wide variety of offences such as misdemeanours, petty theft and shoplifting, and though I share the concern at the escalation of serious crime, the application of the section to minor offences will lead only to escalation <Col N="2433" /> of crime in these areas.  The section could be used against persons not involved in crime but who simply live in areas with a high crime rate.  Any person in such areas found in possession of property or money is liable to be detained by a garda, who does not have to inform that person the reason for his suspicion, and the person can be held for six hours at least.  Indeed such a person could be detained repeatedly on successive days for investigation of different crimes that may have occurred in his neighbourhood and about which he may have known nothing.  The extension of police powers without in-built compulsory safeguards will only lead to further deterioration of community-Garda relations.</P>
    <P>Questioning during detention should be electronically recorded.  Questioning should be restricted to the offence of which the person is suspected.  The Bill should not become law until electronic recording devices have been provided. The Minister has told us that the limit of six hours will apply no matter how many offences are being investigated concurrently. He has said that if there is any doubt he will amend the Bill on Committee Stage.  The Minister is concerned about our serious crime situation, and he is to be complimented on his attitude in regard to the Bill.  He has allowed wide discussion on it, and I have no doubt he will take account of the comments made by Deputies and that on Committee Stage he will make any amendments necessary.</P>
    <P>I welcome the special provision to cover people under 17 years of age.  It will be necessary to have parents or guardians notified immediately when such young people are taken into custody. Unfortunately many such young people are guilty of crimes, such as joyriders who are responsible for the taking of the lives of innocent citizens.

      <P>This Bill will serve the purpose for which it is designed, that is, <Col N="2434" /> to update our criminal law so that people who break the law can be brought to justice.  We have had archaic criminal laws, and evidence of this abounds. Ordinary people are denied their basic right to freedom and civil liberty because of the almost complete breakdown of law and order.  The serious consequences of this are that under present legislation law enforcement has become almost impossible. Those of us who have regular contact with the Garda are aware of their total frustration, having to operate under the framework of present legislation. Gardaí have informed me that because of the present law they find it is not worth their while to pursue criminals because of the end result.</P>
      <P>The element of professionalism in criminals today has come about because of the out-of-date laws under which we operate.  We hear of cases in which criminals taunt the gardaí and can get the better of the police force.  Aristotle wrote &ldquo;Justice is the supreme virtue of the good State&rdquo;, but I am afraid this can hardly be said here because of the hundreds of criminals who are free to terrorise ordinary people but who, in existing conditions, are not brought to justice.  This Bill is designed so that such people will be brought to justice, and I therefore welcome the Bill.  It provides a proper framework within which the gardaí can operate. It can be effective in establishing the guilt or innocence of suspects.</P>
      <P>Law abiding citizens need not have any fear of this legislation, but criminals had better take note.  I would go so far as to say that our present criminal law is an incentive to crime because criminals know they hold all the aces.  Therefore, this legislation will act as a deterrent because the freedom to continue to commit crime and to escape punishment will be curtailed severely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not so naive as to believe that this Bill will solve the problem of lawlessness and vandalism and the more serious problem of organised crime which has become prevalent here in recent years. The Minister should now tackle the other areas which contribute to this situation, such as improving Garda resources, putting the emphasis on crime prevention, <Col N="2435" /> increasing the amount and type of prison accommodation, tackling the growing under-privilege which exists in certain sections of our society which, because of their neglect are the breeding grounds of crime and vandalism.  The Bill, however, will improve the efforts of the gardaí in crime detection, which I understand is now as low as 33 per cent.  I believe that the Bill, therefore, will be successful.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the reservations and objections expressed by many people on both sides of the House because of what they term the dangers to civil liberty. There will, undoubtedly, be a restriction on the freedom and rights of individuals taken in for questioning by the gardaí, but I have full confidence in the Garda force that this restriction will not become a denial of individual rights and freedom. I have great praise for our Garda force, who are a much maligned force in our society.  I believe the problems in relation to crime in the community now are not the fault of the Garda.  I put the blame fairly and squarely at the door of politicians who have allowed the kind of legislation under which the gardaí have to work to continue until 1983.  When one talks to gardaí it is frightening to hear of their experiences in trying to enforce the law under the conditions they have had to work in recent times.  I have heard about a number of cases in Galway city where fairly young people with criminal records were brought into the Garda station to be interrogated and they sat and looked for the two hours or whatever period they were kept there at a spot on the wall and left the gardaí there, thus ensuring that because of their right to silence they cannot be questioned and interrogated.  Since I became a Deputy I have discussed the crime problem in Dublin with members of the Garda.  It must be very frustrating for them to bring a suspect before the courts, have the person charged and when he is allowed out on bail, he taunts the gardaí by committing the same crime and inviting them to watch while he is committing that crime. That is the state which crime and lawlessness have reached.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of everybody in <Col N="2436" /> the House must be to combat crime.  That is the reason I have been very surprised at the amount of criticism there has been of aspects of this Bill, which I am quite satisfied will never take away from people's right to freedom, their civil liberty, in anything like the same way as the right to freedom and the civil liberty of thousands of people in this city and throughout the country is being taken by the people who commit crime.  I give the Minister my full support for this Bill but I feel there are some aspects of it which need to be looked at more carefully. The sad aspect of this Bill coming in now is that it took until 1983 before we got around to updating our criminal legislation and bringing it into line with other countries in Europe.</P>
    <P>The opposition to certain sections of the Bill by many lawyers and solicitors, as well as the Law Society, should be viewed cautiously.  Quite obviously the opposition to certain sections of the Bill by many of those lawyers and solicitors is because of their vested interest in the type of legislation under which they operate.  While I acknowledge the professional ethics of all members of the legal profession the fact that they have been content with such an archaic legal system up to now leaves me in no doubt that they are not the best people to pronounce on the legislative changes which are necessary to meet the changing needs of society.  I suppose it is natural where the rules favour the clients of those lawyers and solicitors that they will not be anxious to change or oppose those rules. The blatant inadequacies of so much of our legislation in this area is a reflection on the legal profession who have been prepared to accept and go along with this type of legislation.  My feeling about the opposition from many lawyers and solicitors is to take it lightly, because they have benefited from the type of legislation they work under.  We have repeatedly seen in cases of serious crime in recent years that the people who are really being interrogated and cross-examined, when it comes to court cases, are not the people who are suspected of committing crime but the gardaí who have brought them there.  We are all aware of <Col N="2437" /> cases where big time criminals have been able to engage top lawyers and solicitors and we have seen gardaí, who would not be expected to have the grasp of legislation which they would need to face the kind of questioning they receive in our courts from those people, being cross-examined. We see the gardaí interrogated so that those top class lawyers can, hopefully, get their clients free on a technicality. Those lawyers and solicitors, who are now crying wolf at the introduction of this Bill, will have to concentrate their energies much more on finding the loopholes which up to this were too easy to find and which in so many cases have curtailed the role of justice.</P>
    <P>I believe this Bill can only be good. Like Deputy Flynn I feel that the day will come before very long when we find it is not necessary to continue with the type of proposals which are contained in this Bill.  The situation is now so bad that that day is a long way off.  I am very concerned about views which have been brought forward by people such as the Irish Council of Civil Liberties, which run contrary to this Bill.  I would like to quote one particular sentence from a submission they made to us.  They say:</P>
    <P>In effect these measures would transfer a very large part of the administration of justice out of the courts and into the police stations.</P>
    <P>I believe that type of statement, which is so wide of the situation, is leading many people to question this legislation.  All this Bill is doing is giving the gardaí an opportunity to ascertain if a person is guilty or innocent so that they can proceed from there to the courts.  The gardaí will have to give evidence of their conclusions when they go to court.</P>
    <P>Up to now the Garda have not been able to bring suspects so far because of the framework of legislation under which they operate.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson has applied for and been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the Government decision to cancel the decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture to Cavan town. Deputy Wilson has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, Sir, for giving me the opportunity to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment even at this late hour of the night.  However, the Chair will admit that I have been persistent in trying to get this debate on the Adjournment, and if I am inconveniencing anybody I apologise.</P>
      <P>I would like to call the attention of the House to the generally accepted principle that in a nation such as ours decentralisation is a desirable objective.  The density of population around the capital city is very high.  About 30 per cent of the population of this country is in the Dublin region, and any deliberate scheme of Government which rectifies this imbalance is good for the body politic and healthy for the nation as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to recap what happened with regard to the policy of decentralisation of Government offices.  In October 1980 the then Minister for the Public Service announced his programme for decentralisation.  The programme had been discussed and debated thoroughly in Government over a long period, and among the decisions taken was one that a section of the Department of Agriculture would be decentralised to Cavan town.  This was part of a large programme of decentralisation which is not immediately my concern, although I want to indicate that what we are discussing tonight was merely part of an overall pattern of policy which was decided by the Government.  Cavan was one of the designated centres then for decentralisation. We made rapid and substantial progress with regard to that decentralisation, on site acquisition, planning and design between October 1980 when the <Col N="2439" /> scheme was announced and June 1981.  A sum of money was paid to Cavan County Council for the site, which was at the back of the courthouse in that town.  I regret to say that since the Government decision to discontinue the project was taken that money is no longer regarded as a deposit on the site but Cavan County Council have been told that they can retain the money.  Plans and contract documents were available for invitation of tenders for an access road to the site in Cavan, to be followed by work on the offices proper.  When the Coalition Government came to office they put the programme under review &mdash; those were the terms used.  It was a euphemism for giving it a general anaesthetic.  The matter was dormant for a while and now apparently it is dead.  It was dormant throughout the first period of coalition.</P>
    <P>We put down a motion in December 1981 trying to probe the mind of the then Minister for Finance on this matter.  It was discussed fully here.  Various Deputies from this side of the House contributed to the debate as did Deputy Bruton, then Minister for Finance, and Deputy Barry Desmond, now Minister for Health and Social Welfare, then Deputy Bruton's co-adjutant.  As soon as the Fianna Fáil Government came back to office one of their first decisions was to reinstate that programme of decentralisation. We had the privilege of a visit from the Minister of State at the Department of the Public Service at that time, Deputy Calleary, who is present in the House now.  He came to view the site for the proposed new offices.  He visited the site and traversed it.  Some local politicians have mentioned inaccurately that there was a sod-turning ceremony.  That was not the purpose of the visit of the Minister of State then.  The whole decentralisation programme as far as Cavan town was concerned was under way.  The various arguments that we advanced at that time, and still maintain have full validity, were that if that office space had to be provided for various civil servants it would be less expensive to provide it in provincial towns than in the capital city. We had told the unions concerned that <Col N="2440" /> full consultations would take place and, of course, that the transfer would be by agreement.  The point was made in Government in this House at various times that a feature of the civil service for some time has been the desire of various officers in the various Departments to get a transfer from the capital city to the nearest provincial town where public offices are located.  Every Member of this House and, I am sure, every member of the Government, including the present Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, must know that that is so.  The last time we debated this matter in this House Deputy J. Bruton also realised and admitted it.  There was talk at that time of the possibility of privatisation, and I threw down a challenge in this House to Deputy Bruton when he was Minister for Finance, that if he had the courage to go ahead with this decentralisation then lack of money should not inhibit him from doing so.</P>
    <P>On a philosophical level various arguments have been put forward over the years with regard to the desirability of decentralisation.  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 23 November 1981 published an article by Dr. Michael Bannon of UCD in which he stated: &ldquo;In the absence of a coherent decentralisation policy new technologies will serve to reinforce the dominance of Dublin and perpetuate regional disparities, according to the author of a recent NESC report on problems of growth and decay in the Dublin area&rdquo;.  Dr. Bannon said that the present highly centralised Government bureaucracy should be dismantled in favour of strong urban-centred regional units where public sector decision-making could be relocated. The decentralisation of private companies should also be encouraged.  He said that careful and detailed planning would be necessary if they were to prove socially desirable.  He suggested that the capacity of a region to innovate, attract investment and generate self-sustaining growth was hampered by loss of leadership to the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>That thesis could be sustained in argument and debate in any instance.  Other people who strongly advocated decentralisation at various times and who have <Col N="2441" /> experience in public administration beyond what anybody else either in this House or outside could claim &mdash; for example Dr. Barrington &mdash; also claimed that it was essential to have a decentralisation policy in a country such as this.  I maintain that Dr. Barrington's thesis is incontrovertible.  As I have mentioned already, 30 per cent of the population is now in the Dublin area and this, as has been pointed out over and over again, is higher than the percentage of the total population of the UK concentrated on London.  This is higher than the percentage of population of Japan centred on Tokyo.  We cannot afford to allow the east coast to become top heavy at the expense of the rest of the country.  The fact that so many public servants are anxious to get back to their own areas is an indication of the change that has taken place in rural Ireland in the past few decades with improved amenities, educational facilities and the other things that make life worth living and improve the quality of life in a rural situation.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the situation of Cavan town with regard to public offices.  There is a basic injustice here which has developed during the years and which is a legacy of the kind of development we had in the past.  For example, the IDA office for the area is in Dundalk, practically on the County Down border.  The North Eastern Regional Development Organisation which covers County Cavan have not got headquarters in Cavan.  The income tax office for the area is in Dundalk. These offices provide employment for people and enrich the towns in which they are situated.  Cavan was chosen by Buchanan as a development centre for Counties Monaghan, Longford and Cavan.  These areas have not had the advantage of having these kinds of offices located in their areas.  The Army headquarters for the region are in Dundalk. I am tired telling the House that the Great Northern Railways and CIE met in Cavan town but that has also been discontinued.  When the headquarters for the North Eastern Health Board were established they were located at Ceannanus Mór in County Meath.  I am giving these examples to indicate how important <Col N="2442" /> to me it was from a developmental point of view that the offices of the Department of Agriculture should have been located in Cavan town, as we had determined when we were in office.</P>
    <P>At that time I considered it was important for the construction industry that this development should take place.  If that were true in 1981, it is a hundred times more true today.  The statistics available from the Central Statistics Office indicate that unemployment in the construction industry is much greater now than it was then.  I do not know the precise figure, but it is between 40,000 and 50,000 for the country as a whole.  The construction industry brings work to people in the fastest time.  I do not have to elaborate on that as far as Cavan town is concerned. If the 150 civil servants were transferred to the area and if the proposed building catered for other employees of the Department of Agriculture, the total number of people housed in the same building would be 230.  It is important to realise what would happen to a town like that if we had that increase in strength. We were hoping for the development of a military barracks, but that is in cold storage.  A Garda headquarters was mentioned, but all our hopes have been dashed by this Government decision not to proceed with decentralisation for the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>From my point of view one of the important aspects is that there would be a massive injection of human resources into the town and this would have a revolutionary effect on the town.  There are over 7,000 people on the draft register of electors for Cavan town.  This place is capable of development and is crying out for it.  I accuse the Government of going cold about decentralisation in respect of Cavan.  This happened when they were in Government in the period June 1981 to January 1982.  The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Bruton, would not say straight out that he was shelving the project but at that time he was laying his cold hand on it.  That cold and clammy hand has become a bit of a nightmare for me.</P>
    <P>This injection of human resources would help Cavan town, which has a great tradition.  The hospital is also a <Col N="2443" /> matter of concern.  I will not deal with it now, but all the delay has been a cause of great concern to the people.  A transfer of people by way of decentratisation would have social and cultural effects.  It would improve the quality of life in an area where we have certain strengths as well as the weakness of under-development. There is a fine social life in the area and a tradition in drama development. The Ceann Comhairle was instrumental in developing the Cavan Drama Festival, which is one of the oldest in the country. In fact, we have two festivals there.  We have a fine arts society, and the urban council and county council give support in this area.</P>
    <P>This new injection into the town would bring increasingly sophisticated demands from people working in the Department of Agriculture, and this would improve the town.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Finance to reconsider the whole decentralisation plan.  I am interested specifically in the Cavan project, but there are also projects for Ballina, Letterkenny and Sligo.  The Minister can study those in his own time. A deposit has been made on a site and is likely to be lost if the scheme is not proceeded with.  Skilled construction workers are ready to go into action and we want to see the town becoming a centre for development once more.  As the Minister knows, it has already suffered from being in such close proximity to the Border, so I appeal very strongly to him to reconsider his decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad to hear Deputy Wilson outlining the history and development of the dramatic arts in Cavan.  I have never had any doubt that there is a strong, vibrant and living tradition of those arts in Cavan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson made a statement to the effect that decentralisation is a desirable objective and, if you speak about it in a general way, very few people would disagree.  When you come to look at its specific application, however, it is rather different.  I was interested to hear Deputy Wilson referring to the Buchanan <Col N="2444" /> Report, which was a series of suggestions which had a very strong concern with decentralisation in a controlled way which did not seem to get public support because it did not spread things far enough.  We should not lose sight of this problem, which is relevant to our consideration of Deputy Wilson's concern. What he said about the results of the concentration of populations on the quality of life both in over and under populated areas are things with which I and many others agree, and we can all see the ill effects of both situations.  The question arises whether the decentralisation programme which was proposed would have made any great difference to that.  What would have been the net difference, if any, created in terms of overall employment, economic activity or any of the wider measures arising from the proposals? It is important to get this problem into perspective.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson made a fairly dramatic case for his own interests and, listening to him and others who have made the same arguments, one gets the impression that we have a very highly centralised public service.  In fact, some 60 per cent of our public service work outside Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that include the gardaí and teachers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That includes the postal and telecommunications services as well as gardaí, teachers and others.  We do not have the huge degree of concentration of the public service to which Deputy Wilson referred.  However, I have sympathy for the idea of decentralisation, having been decentralised myself from Dublin to Brussels and from Brussels to Kildare and being one of a family of Dubliners who have reversed the tradition in that three of four of my parents' children moved out of Dublin to other parts of the country instead of the other way around.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, not at all, Deputy. However, I have been involved in a personal <Col N="2445" /> way with decentralisation, and we must look at what it would cost and some of the other factors to which I have referred.  The decentralisation programme would have cost a further £45 million, and that was a material consideration which had to be taken into account. It was one of the main factors which led to our decision not to go ahead with this programme.  We also have to ask whether the programme which was intended to decentralise about 3,000 civil servants from their jobs in Dublin to the same jobs in other places was worth the money or was an urgent priority for the country as a whole.  Deputy Wilson did not refer to the costs except to make a claim about privatisation to which I will refer in a moment.</P>
      <P>I am not disputing the undoubted financial and social benefits which would accrue from a movement like this to the 12 centres involved, but there would have been no net gain to the economy.  There would have been no permanent extra job creation, and we decided that the sum of £45 million was too high a price to pay for such a programme in the present recession when it is incumbent on us to alleviate, as far as we can, the weight of the public sector and the economy of the regions about which Deputy Wilson and many others are properly concerned.</P>
      <P>If decentralisation had been proceeded with there would not have been any new job creation in the centres concerned, because we would have been transferring civil servants from jobs in Dublin to centres for which they had applied. Administrative efficiency would also be a concern in looking at a programme like this, and I know we are all concerned with improving the efficiency of our public administration and public service generally. I believe that if we had gone ahead with this programme the efficiency of the Departments would have been reduced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Brussels does not have decentralised Departments in the other member states, and one of the major headaches in the central administration of the European Community is the fact that it has a large body of people in Luxembourg.  One of the main problems of the European Parliament is that it has its offices in one place and meets in another.  That is decentralisation turned into a nightmare for the people involved. If we had gone ahead with decentralisation of the Department of Agriculture it would, I regret to say, have been to Castlebar, not Cavan, which would have administrative sense as part of that Department was already in Castlebar.</P>
      <P>It has been suggested that the cost to the State would have been less under privatisation schemes.  In fact, an analysis of the comparative cost of the State building its own office accommodation or leasing under the privatisation proposals showed very clearly that the privatisation proposals would have involved a higher cost to the State, and the figures are here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>The upward trend in cattle numbers is assisted by the headage grants in disadvantaged areas, the calved heifer scheme and the EEC suckler cow and calf premium schemes.  Under these schemes an extra beef cow and calf can qualify this year for total grants of as much as £169 in the severely handicapped areas, £150 in the less severely handicapped areas and £118 outside these areas.  These generous grants provide a worthwhile incentive to farmers to increase their beef cow numbers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 35 together.</P>
      <P>The number of applications so far received under the western drainage scheme is more than can be catered for within the 150,000 hectares ceiling set by the relevant EEC Directive.  It may not, therefore, be possible to accommodate applications received after 30 September 1981 under the present scheme.  It will take at least until the late spring of 1984 to process and approve applications that will exhaust the full 150,000 hectares and in the meantime the course to be adopted in relation to outstanding applications will be examined in the light of the budgetary position.</P>

      <P>Classification of disadvantaged areas in Ireland into &ldquo;more severely handicapped&rdquo; and &ldquo;less severely handicapped&rdquo; in the western region, is in <Col N="2072" /> accordance with Article 7.1 of Council Directive 75/268/EEC, which states that &ldquo;Member States shall fix the amounts of the compensatory allowance according to the severity of the permanent natural handicaps affecting farming activities&rdquo;.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 to 52, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>To abolish or raise the off-farm income limit for livestock grants under the disadvantaged areas scheme would involve an extra cost to the Exchequer in the first year of up to £4.5 million and would mean that less resources would be available to those farmers most in need, that is full-time farmers and those with low off-farm incomes.  In view of this and having regard to the current Exchequer position, I do not at present propose to remove or modify the limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would point out that social welfare payments to farmers are not regarded as off-farm income for the purposes of the disadvantaged areas schemes.  Payments of livestock headage grants are on the other hand taken into account in the factual assessment of farmers for small-holders <Col N="2073" /> unemployment assistance by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>I would also point out that the adoption here of the arrangements in operation in Northern Ireland would result in some 30,000 farmers losing the grants which they at present receive under the disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Legal Aid Board indicated in their annual report for 1980 that in their view, it would be necessary to establish at least 33 law centres to provide a nationwide service under the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.</P>
      <P>A total of eight full-time law centres have been established to date &mdash; three in Dublin and one each in Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway and Sligo.  In addition, the board have set up temporary law centres in fifteen places &mdash; Athlone, Carlow, Carrick-on-Shannon, Castlebar, Clonmel, Drogheda, Dundalk, Ennis, Kilkenny, Letterkenny, Mallow, Thurles, Tralee, Wexford and Finglas in Dublin.  All these temporary law centres are serviced by solicitors from the board's full-time law centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to further plans, no funds were provided in the Estimates for 1983 to enable the Legal Aid Board to open additional law centres this year and, while it is a matter for the board in the first instance to make proposals for extra centres in the context of the limited funds <Col N="2076" /> provided, it would be unrealistic to expect that they would be in a position to establish any additional full-time law centres in the immediate future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): As the Deputy will be aware I made certain changes this year in the means test provisions of the scheme of civil legal aid and advice.  These came into effect on 3 May 1983.  The income limit below which legal services were provided at flat contribution rates &mdash; of £10 for legal aid and £1 for legal advice &mdash; was increased by 60 per cent from £1,500 disposable income per annum to £2,400 disposable income per annum.  In addition the Legal Aid Board was given a discretion to grant legal services to qualified applicants who are in receipt of certain social welfare benefits or allowances as their only source of income, for a maximum income contribution of £15 for legal aid and £1 for legal advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the changes was to reduce generally the contributions payable by persons, including welfare recipients, on lower incomes, to the minimum rates applicable under the scheme.  The new discretion given to the board makes it possible for social welfare recipients &mdash; except those on pay-related benefit &mdash; to get all legal services available under the scheme for a maximum contribution of £15, even if their disposable income exceeds £2,400 per annum, subject of course to the overall eligibility of £3,500 disposable income per annum which applies to all applicants.  The change was also designed to cater for the effects of <Col N="2077" /> possible future changes in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>Because of the present financial circumstances it was not possible to raise the upper eligibility limit for services under the scheme.  This limit was of course increased in February 1981 by 40 per cent.</P>

Unless it becomes necessary to interrupt the work to give priority to more urgent matters I would hope it will be ready for introduction in the Oireachtas in the New Year.  Formal ratification by Ireland of the Convention should follow shortly after the enactment of the legislation.  However, I must point out that, even when the convention has been ratified by us, it will not enter into force here unless and until it has been ratified by all of the original six member States.  Up to now, so far as I am aware, only the Netherlands, Italy and Luxembourg of the original six member states have ratified the convention.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): I am aware that the DPP found it necessary to withdraw a charge in this case.</P>
      <P>Subsequently an article appeared in a Sunday newspaper and the phraseology of the Deputy's question appears to be taken from that article.  There have also been other references to it in the media. I think it right to make it clear that, since the document in question did not include the standard reference to the giving of a caution, it was not in a form suitable for handing to the suspect for her signature as a statement of admission.  This, however, does not mean that there was no cause for concern about what occurred. A concern remains despite the fact that a partial investigation has been carried out.  A fuller investigation will take place if the woman concerned or her solicitor is willing to assist.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities appointed a chief superintendent to investigate the allegations.  He contacted the solicitor acting for the woman concerned and arranged an appointment with her and her client.  The solicitor subsequently cancelled the appointment saying that she was seeking an assurance from the DPP that her client would not be further charged arising out of the crime which was the subject of the original charge. She did not subsequently contact the chief superintendent.  On 2 November he again contacted her.  I am informed that she confirmed that she had received the assurance she had been seeking from the DPP and that she said she had not been in touch with her client, that she would be getting in touch with her, that she was particularly busy but that when she was ready to see him she would contact him. She has not since contacted him.

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Law Reform Commission in their working paper entitled &ldquo;Domicile and Habitual Residence as connecting factors in the conflict of laws&rdquo;, said that The Hague Convention on the Recognition of Divorces and Legal Separations raised many questions for resolution before Ireland could adhere to it and that the task of analysing the implications of the convention as a whole and of considering the respective merits of the alternative policies that it embraces was one that involved extended research and deliberation.  It is proposed to defer consideration of the convention at least until after the publication of the commission's working paper on the subject.  As the working paper has not yet been published I do not think there is anything more helpful that can be said on the subject at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Shatter's question was first tabled last March, I am taking it that he is in effect asking for information relating to the period since March 1981.  I am informed by the Commissioners of Public Works that the works carried out at the homes of Ministers for Justice during that period have been as follows:</P>
      <P>At the home of Deputy J. Mitchell two huts, and toilet and electrical services, for use by the gardaí on protection duty were provided at a cost of £4,479.</P>
      <P>At the County Roscommon home of Deputy Doherty two huts, and toilet and electrical services, were provided for use by the gardaí on protection duty.  In addition boundary walls to a total length of approximately 350 feet and chain link fencing to a total length of approximately 460 feet were provided.  The total cost involved was £15,844.74.  Entrance gates were procured at a cost of £450 but were not erected.  A hut was provided at the Deputy's Dublin home at a cost of £65.</P>
      <P>At my own home two huts, and toilet and electrical service, have been and provided for use by the gardaí on protection duty.  A security lighting system has also been provided.  The total cost of these works was approximately £6,445.</P>
      <P>I should make the point that my Department do not become involved in the detailed arrangements for security works at the homes of Ministers.  It is normal for these matters to be settled in discussion between the appropriate Garda personnel and officials of the Office of Public Works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the wall at Deputy Doherty's Roscommon home, which has been the subject of media comment and speculation, the procedure followed was that the Garda submitted a written requisition, mainly in general terms, for certain protection works that were to be carried out, including the erection of a security fence.  The information available to me is that the question of the erection of the security fence was discussed between Deputy Doherty and a senior Garda officer with responsibility for security. Deputy Doherty, I am informed, agreed <Col N="2082" /> to the erection of security fencing as proposed, except along certain boundary lines, where he objected to it on the grounds that it would be unsightly and would obstruct the view from his residence.</P>
    <P>At the time, a boundary wall at the residence, some four feet high, was already being built by a local contractor at Deputy Doherty's own expense. According to the Garda Síochána, Deputy Doherty expressed the view that, in place of the security fence, the boundary wall under construction should be completed and that he would have no objection to this wall being raised to a height higher than originally planned, as a security measure, provided that it did not obstruct the view from the house. The Minister's wishes in this regard were conveyed orally to Office of Public Works officials.  I am informed, it was decided that the partially-built wall should be completed at public expense, presumably as part of the protection measures.  The contract for this work provided for the erection of a wrought iron railing on part of the wall, when completed, but this part of the project did not proceed as the need for it ceased following the change of Government in December 1982.</P>
    <P>It was intended also to provide entrance gates.  These, as I mentioned, were ordered by the Office of Public Works at a cost of £450 but their erection was not proceeded with, again as a result of the altered position following the change of Government.</P>
    <P>Part 1 of the question by Deputy Doherty asks specifically on whose authority a decision was taken to undertake certain works.  There is no record in my Department which enables me to answer that question unequivocally nor would it be expected that such a record would be in my Department.  As I have stated, my Department do not become involved in the details of matters such as I have described.  It appears, however, that the decisions taken in relation to these matters were arrived at as a result of oral discussions and understandings in which Deputy Doherty and Garda and Office of Public Works personnel participated at different times, possibly on a number <Col N="2083" /> of different occasions.  So far as I am aware no record exists which would enable this part of the question to be answered more precisely.</P>
    <P>Part 3 of the question by Deputy Doherty asks whether he himself requested or demanded that any of the work described, or any part of it, be undertaken. Garda reports indicate that Deputy Doherty participated in discussions that led to decisions in relation to what was to be done.  The only additional information I am in a position to give in relation to this matter is that a communication from the Garda Síochána to my Department in July 1982 stated that Deputy Doherty had expressed concern about the safety of his wife and family to the then Assistant Commissioner in charge of security and had requested that first-class security measures be provided at his home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Garda authorities consider that the creation of an additional Garda district to cater for the North Kildare area would not be warranted at present. One of the difficulties about establishing a new district is that there would be a need for additional personnel on indoor duty, thus reducing the manpower available for outdoor operational duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Garda are conscious, however, of the changing needs of developing areas in North Kildare in so far as policing arrangements are concerned and the divisional officer for Carlow-Kildare is at present reviewing his manpower and transport resources so as to ensure that <Col N="2086" /> they are deployed to best advantage in meeting the Garda needs of all the areas in his Division.  Apart from the possibility of the redeployment of resources within the Carlow/Kildare Division, the needs of the North Kildare area will be taken into account when the additional manpower now in training and being recruited becomes available for assignment. In addition, it is planned to instal the new Garda radio communications system in the Carlow/Kildare area within the next few months.</P>
    <P>Leixlip is served from Lucan station in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The proposed reduction in the area served from that station when the new station at Ronanstown is opened early next year should result in an improved level of patrolling in the Leixlip area.</P>
    <P>I hope that the measures which I have outlined will go some way towards meeting the various requests for improved policing arrangements in the developing areas of North Kildare.  It can be taken that the situation will be kept under review by the Garda authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 to 85 together.</P>
      <P>There are several task forces in the Garda Síochána, none of which has been disbanded.</P>
      <P>There is a security task force which was set up in 1978 to deal with certain serious crimes of violence, such as kidnappings, hijackings and the like.  It is based in Dublin and is attached to the special detective unit.  It operates as and when required throughout the State.  Deputy Woods's question refers to a speculative newspaper report of 10 August last that the disbanding of that particular task force was being considered.  In fact that report was the subject of an official Garda denial published on the following day.</P>
      <P>The other three questions appear to relate to divisional task forces which were set up in 1980 in Garda divisions outside Dublin and which were designed to deal with an upsurge in armed robberies.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities have in recent months made certain organisational changes under which the members of those divisional task forces have been integrated with the detective units in the various Garda divisions in which they operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that those changes have been made solely in the interests of better Garda organisation and efficiency and are not the result either of financial cutbacks or of any move away from specialisation in the force which in fact is not affected one way or other.  The members of the divisional task forces were already of detective rank and remain so.  The integration has not led to any change in the total detective strength throughout <Col N="2089" /> the country.  The Garda authorities are satisfied that the service provided by the Garda Síochána is more effective as a result of the changes and in particular that the protection accorded to the business community, including those who handle large sums of money, has been enhanced rather than diminished by the changes that have been made, which are calculated to provide for better supervision and guidance and also for better liaison between various members or units of the force.</P>
    <P>However, I should make it clear that while none of the task forces has been disbanded and no question of such disbandment is being considered, it is of course the duty of the Garda authorities to review from time to time the operation of these as well as other units in the force and to make any changes that are necessary, including, if the occasion arises, the disbanding of any unit that appears to have outlived its usefulness.</P>
    <P>It would not be in the public interest to disclose details of the strengths of the various task forces in the Garda Síochána.</P>

    <P>In the meantime the two existing boilers <Col N="2092" /> needed to be replaced.  One new boiler, at present peat-fired, was installed last year and another new boiler will be installed in a few weeks time.</P>
    <P>As part of the arrangements for replacement of the boilers, negotiations have taken place with the Dublin Gas Company and in the New Year both of the boilers will be gas-fired.  In addition it is intended to convert the present boilers at the training unit, adjacent to Mountjoy from oil to gas.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): An estimated total of 50,000 man hours were worked by members of the Garda Síochána in the Dublin Metropolitan Area arising from the events which occurred in Mountjoy Prison from 30 October 1983.  The cost involved is estimated at £400,000, taking into account overtime, subsistence and night-duty allowances payable to the gardaí who were on duty at the prison and to those who were on standby in the Dublin Metropolitan area.  In addition, gardaí on standby at centres throughout the country worked an estimated total of 55,000 man hours and it is estimated that the cost involved, taking into account, overtime, subsistence, night-duty and travel allowances is in the region of £450,000.</P>
      <P>The additional cost to the State arising from extra payments to military personnel as a result of the prisons dispute is estimated at £27,000.  As the security duty allowance payable to military personnel is calculated on a daily basis and is not related to the actual number of hours worked, the number of man hours involved in the duties undertaken by military personnel on this occasion is not readily available.</P>

      <P>I had earlier received a report from the Garda authorities indicating that on 24 November 1983, a Garda inspector attended a meeting with CIE officials, union representatives and members of the local residents' associations.  Assurances were given that Garda attention was being and would continue to be given to the areas about which complaints were made.  These assurances were not regarded as adequate by the unions and apparently they hoped for a virtual guarantee that no further attacks would take place.  Regrettably, that is not feasible.</P>
      <P>A second meeting was held on 1 December 1983 which was also attended by a number of public representatives for the area and the Garda position was further explained.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the concern of residents in urban areas generally at the increased incidence of crime and vandalism.  Various measures have been taken to provide an increased Garda presence in our cities and towns and the Garda are constantly seeking ways and means of controlling crimes such as house breaking, mugging and the unauthorised taking of cars by altering manning levels and by changing patterns of patrolling.</P>

    <P>As regards the particular measures being taken to combat crime in the areas referred to in the questions, the Garda <Col N="2095" /> authorities report that foot and mobile patrols from Crumlin station are being operated in these areas as much as possible. The services of the Crime Task Force based at Garda Headquarters and other specialised units from the Dublin Metropolitan Area Headquarters are frequently made available to supplement local patrols and to meet any special needs which arise from time to time.</P>
    <P>The total Garda strength at Crumlin is at present 65 and the Garda authorities propose to allocate two additional gardaí to the station from the group of recruits who will be completing their training on 22 December 1983.</P>

      <P>Activities similar to the work preparation units in Northern Ireland are already organised here.  Firstly, there are the AnCO Community Training Workshops and the Community Youth Training Programme. The workshops provide basic training for young people who have left school with little or no education qualifications while the Community Youth Training Programme gives basic training and work experience to young people under 25 years on projects of value to the Community which would not otherwise be undertaken.  Secondly, there is the grant scheme for Youth Employment administered by the youth section of my Department.  Under the scheme, grants are made available for the employment of young people on desirable community works of a type which would not otherwise be undertaken in the normal course at present.  Thirdly, there is the Work Experience Programme administered by my Department which gives participants experience of the world of work and increases their attractiveness to employers.</P>
      <P>In 1983, I expect 20,500 young people to participate in the schemes I have mentioned. The numbers participating in these schemes &mdash; and indeed, on youth employment and training programmes generally &mdash; have increased significantly in recent years because of the funds becoming available from the youth employment levy.</P>

    <P>In July last it appeared likely that around £11 million of the total of £83.55 million available would not be spent in 1983 although the throughput target of 45,000 young persons catered for would be achieved. The Government then decided that, in order to reduce the 1983 Exchequer borrowing requirement, the saving should be used in the current year to fund youth training and employment schemes, primarily under the vocational education authorities, which were being funded, wholly or partially, from non-levy sources.  The final allocations for 1983 are at present being settled.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware the major portion of the funds generated by the youth employment levy has been used for the expansion and development of training, work experience and temporary employment measures for the young unemployed through agencies such as AnCO, CERT, the National Manpower Service and other educational institutions.  In so far as the agency themselves are concerned <Col N="2118" /> they also devote some of their resources to the development of training and other programmes outside the ambit of existing agencies.</P>
      <P>From its establishment in March, 1982 to date a sum of £3.48 million has been allocated by the agency to the support of sustainable job creation and enterprise development.  In this way the agency has provided funding for the creation of 725 new jobs.  The filling of these jobs is spread over a period of time and 362 of them have been filled to date.</P>
      <P>In addition under the agency's Youth Self-Employment Programme loans have been approved so far for forty small self-employment businesses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to training and community employment and training projects, financing has been mainly through issues from the relevant subhead in my Department's Vote made direct to the major programme sponsors.  In the case of training, the major sponsors are AnCO and CERT and, in the case of community employment and training projects, the major sponsors are AnCO and the Youth Section of my Department.  Funding by the agency in these areas has, therefore, been supplementary to financing from the Vote of the programmes of the major programme sponsors.</P>
      <P>From its establishment in March, 1982 to date, the Youth Employment Agency have approved in the region of 110 projects, with an anticipated total cost of £17.3 million.  The period covered by individual projects varies and the actual amount expended up to end October 1983, was just over £6.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As many community projects funded by the agency involve a training element it would be difficult to identify exclusive figures for training places and community projects.  The total of £17.3 million <Col N="2119" /> approved can, however, be broken down into the following categories: (i) support for training, work experience and short-term employment projects, £13.39 million; (ii) support for sustainable job creation and enterprise development, £3.48 million; (iii) other, including schools/ industry links, £0.46 million.</P>
    <P>The figure of £13.39 million under (i) represents about 7,000 places.</P>
    <P>With regard to (c) of the Deputy's question, as the major allocations under each of these three headings relate to national programmes, it is not possible to give a county by county breakdown of the financial allocations.</P>

      <P>Ireland had played a considerable role in shaping the European Strategic Programme for Research and Development in Information Technologies (ESPRIT) which is designed to improve the competitiveness of European industry in this field.</P>
      <P>At the Research Minister Council on 5 November approval in principle was given for proceeding with the main phase of this programme which involves the expenditure of 700 MECU of Community funds (IR£500 million) over five years.</P>
      <P>The pilot phase of ESPRIT to which the Deputy refers, is already underway. Irish research and industrial interests have collectively obtained over 3 per cent of the total funding for this phase which is considerably in excess of pro rata return for Ireland from this fund.</P>
      <P>To a considerable extent this return was achieved through the efforts of my Department and the National Board for Science and Technology which acted as the national co-ordinator of the programme. A considerable level of consultation took place with the European Commission to ensure that the Irish interest in obtaining a significant level of involvement in the programme was assured.  This dialogue has been vigorously maintained in the preparation of the main programme.  This will continue to be the case during its implementation phase.  In promoting awareness of ESPRIT among potential Irish participants the NBST organised a number of seminars and kept in close contact subsequently with proposers of projects who were offered every assistance in the framing of these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2124" /> Additionally, 15 Irish researchers and industrialists have been asked by the European Commission to participate in workshops designed to define the technical work programme for ESPRIT. Ireland will be represented on the management committee for the programme.</P>

      <P>In 1983 grants administered by the National Board for Science and Technology (NBST) of approximately £200,000 are being allocated to Irish researchers working in biotechnology. An additional £200,000 is also being made available from the IDA and the NBST as part of their co-operative research and development grants scheme.  This money will go into projects where industry and the higher education sector combine resources in the effort to develop new products and processes in this field.  In addition the IDA paid £534,000 in grants to companies engaged in biotechnology in the pharmaceutical and food processing sectors during 1983; £114,000 of this related specifically to research and development.</P>
      <P>A special unit has been established within the National Board for Science and Technology which has as its immediate priority the promotion of biotechnology in the production of agriculture based products.  Seven biotechnologists of varying backgrounds staff this unit. Research work is also being undertaken by the Medical Research Council and An Foras Talúntais in their relevant areas.</P>

      <P>It is Government policy to seek to benefit from Community aid available for all eligible public sector projects in the energy field.</P>
      <P>Regarding aid for infrastructure investment related to the oil find off Waterford, it would be premature to say whether the possibility of Community aid would be relevant until further exploration and delineation of the find takes place and a clearer idea emerges of infrastructure investment that might be required.</P>
      <P>In co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities the Government will seek EEC aid for the construction of the natural gas pipeline to Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The Industrial Development Authority is promoting import substitution opportunities in the printing industry by identifying through its inter-company linkage programme product areas in which imports can be replaced from Irish sources.  As a result of these efforts a number of Irish companies now supply printing and stationery requirements which were formally imported, to newly established companies.  These requirements are principally for companies in the electronics and pharmaceuticals sectors.</P>

    <P>While the IDA are not grant-aiding companies within the general printing industry due to overcapacity in the domestic market, they are willing to consider grant assistance where a company <Col N="2127" /> can show particular opportunities for import substitution.

      <Col N="2133" /> I also agree that the continuing post-Stuttgart negotiations on, <i>inter alia</i>, the future financing of the Community and the adaptation of the Common Agricultural Policy, make it all the more important that debates on central Community issues are held on a regular basis.  As the Deputy will be aware, such debates were held recently in both the Dáil and Seanad.</P>

      <P>The Stuttgart European Council last June made it clear that, in the present negotiations on the future of the European Community, &ldquo;employment policy, in particular concerning young people&rdquo; should have a high priority.  The Taoiseach argued strongly in favour of this requirement on that occasion.  Subsequently, at the Special Ministerial Councils established by Stuttgart, I forcefully and consistently made the point that it is vital that our negotiations should lead to urgent and effective action being taken to respond to the growing unemployment problem in Europe, expecially youth unemployment.</P>
      <P>The discussions at the Athens European Council did not, however, develop to the stage where detailed consideration was given to this issue.  The Deputy can be assured, however, that it retains the highest priority of the Government.</P>

      <P>In response to the first part of his question, I would refer the Deputy to the statement issued by the Government on 15 November, the same day as the purported unilateral declaration of independence by the Turkish Cypriot Assembly. That statement read as follows:</P>
      <P>The Government have learned with deep concern of the purported unilateral declaration of independence by the self-styled Turkish Federated State of Kibris.  The Government reject this act, which is contrary to successive resolutions of the United Nations.  The Government reaffirm their commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and unity of the Republic of Cyprus.</P>
      <P>The Government believe that today's events represent a serious complicating factor in the search for a just and lasting solution to the problems of Cyprus.  The inter-communal talks, held under the auspices of the Secretary General of the United Nations, offer the best hope towards that end and the Government urge all parties to respond positively to the recent efforts of the Secretary General to give a fresh impetus to these talks.</P>
      <P>The following day, 16 November, Ireland joined with the other members of the European Community in issuing a joint statement which also expressed rejection of the declaration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the second part of the Deputy's question, I am not entirely clear as to which debate he has in mind.  Shortly after the Turkish Cypriot declaration the United Nations Security Council considered the matter.  On 18 November the Security Council adopted Resolution 541 which, among other things, deplored the <Col N="2140" /> Turkish Cypriot declaration, considered that declaration as legally invalid, called for its withdrawal, called upon all States not to recognise any Cypriot State other than the Republic of Cyprus and called upon those concerned to co-operate fully with the Secretary General of the United Nations in his Mission of Good Offices. Ireland fully supports the implementation of that Resolution.</P>
    <P>I should add that the General Assembly of the United Nations may yet debate the Cyprus issue at its current session but the timing of such a debate has not yet been finalised.</P>

      <P>On the basis of preliminary results it is estimated that any reduction in overseas tourist numbers in 1983 will be marginal.  Individual markets may, of course, for particular reasons register different levels of decline or growth.  For example, numbers from France are likely to be down some ten <Col N="2141" /> percentage points as a direct result of the French Government's currency restrictions on foreign holidays imposed in early 1983.  On the other hand numbers from the German market are likely to record a six per cent growth.  Notwithstanding such fluctuations in numbers as between different markets, I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the total expenditure in 1983 by overseas visitors is expected to be up by about 12 per cent on 1982.</P>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that it will continue to be part of Government policy to encourage in every way possible the further development of tourism.</P>

      <P>Grants totalling £3,682,701 had been paid to group water schemes up to 30 November 1983.  These payments relate to grants allocated before and during 1983.

    <P>However, I am aware that there have been lay-offs and short-time working in a small number of local authorities.  Even in those authorities where such measures have had to be introduced, I understand that every effort has been made to ensure as little disruption as possible to the services of permanent and pensionable employees.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of pensionable service, the reckoning of unpaid absences for superannuation purposes is precluded by statute.  The rule is of general application in the public service.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that available revenue be so managed as to minimise unemployment, short-time and lay-offs.  While I am satisfied that local authorities are making every effort in this regard, I will remind them of the necessity for adopting this approach when grants are being allocated in 1984.</P>

      <P>The new national differential rent scheme, which was agreed prior to its implementation with the National Association of Tenants' Organisations, does not provide for a flat £3 increase in all local authority rents but for a graded scale under which rents are related to income and family circumstances.  Where a rent calculated in accordance with the scale would exceed the maximum rent applicable to the relevant housing <Col N="2153" /> scheme (which is calculated by reference to the up-dated cost of providing the dwelling), the new rent is limited to the amount of such maximum rent.  Further, as a concession to tenants on maximum rents, the new scheme provides that no tenant will be required to pay a maximum rent that is more than £3 greater than the maximum applying to him under the previous scheme.  The Deputy will appreciate in the circumstances that the purpose of the £3 limit is to ensure that a tenant, who otherwise would have to pay, on the basis of his family income and circumstances, a rent increase in excess of £3, has the amount of such increases reduced to that figure.</P>

      <P>It has been an important aspect of housing policy for some years that all tenants of local authority dwellings, other than dwellings specifically provided for elderly persons, should be afforded the opportunity of purchasing their dwellings.</P>
      <P>While I consider that the existing tenant purchase scheme enables the majority of tenants who wish to do so to purchase their dwellings at very favourable rates.  I am aware that tenants of newer dwellings who may not be entitled to tenancy discount may find it difficult to purchase such dwellings under the existing scheme.</P>
      <P>I am therefore considering a number of options which could have the effect of facilitating the purchase of such dwellings by the tenants.</P>

      <P>As explained in reply to a previous question from the Deputy on 26 January 1983, the Programme for Government includes an aim to raise housing output towards 30,000 houses a year.  No specific timescale was laid down but it is the Government's aim to progress towards that objective as quickly as possible. Considering the sharp decline in housing activity and completions that had taken place in 1982, when completions fell by more than 7 per cent and the actual level of housebuilding activity by more than 12 per cent it would have been quite unrealistic to expect 30,000 completions to be achieved in the current year.</P>

      <P>The new national differential rent scheme for local authority dwellings which came into effect in the rent week immediately following 21 October 1983, provides for a review of all rents on the basis of incomes applicable in the week beginning 6 June, 1983.  The only significant change in principle, compared with the previous scheme, was a concession whereby in the case of a new or transferred tenancy, rent is calculated by reference to assessable income in the week beginning 6 June 1983, except where there is a change in family circumstances, rather than income at the date of appointment as tenant or of transfer as was the case in previous schemes.  Particulars of the 1982 and 1983 differential rents schemes, from which the changes in the 1983 scheme can be readily seen, are set out in a tabular statement which follows. At this stage, it is not practicable to give <Col N="2159" /> a reliable estimate of revenue increases <Col N="2160" /> which will arise from the changes in the 1983 scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, local authorities are responsible for ensuring the application of sound planning principles to all development in their areas.  In this regard they have a responsibility to ensure that the same general principles which govern the operation of the planning system in relation to private housing development are applied to their housing developments and that such developments are consistent in every material respect with the standards and requirements to which private housing development is expected to conform. Accordingly, in selecting sites for their housing purposes, local authorities are required to have regard to the provisions of their development plan for the areas. The proposed development must be consistent with the zoning objectives for the area and with any specific objectives in regard to water and sewerage services, road development, the renewal of obsolete areas, the preservation and development of amenities.  In addition, a proposed site should stand up to critical examination using the criteria applied to planning applications generally.</P>
      <P>Large schemes of local authority houses tend to create divisions between local authority areas and private areas. Local authorities have, therefore, been advised to build small schemes dispersed among private housing developments, wherever this is possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To ensure a reasonable mix of private <Col N="2162" /> housing within their housing schemes, local authorities are encouraged to provide serviced sites through the allocation of capital for site acquisition and development purposes and through the availability of subsidy where certain conditions are fulfilled and the sites are sold to certain categories of persons.</P>
    <P>In addition, Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council also operate &ldquo;small builders&rdquo; schemes whereby serviced sites are provided for small contractors to build modestly priced houses, which are then sold to approved purchasers, some of whom may be eligible for site subsidy.  This scheme is also intended to provide a reasonable social mix between public and private housing in a given area.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, a &ldquo;joint venture&rdquo; arrangement has been in operation since February 1982 whereby local authorities can provide building land to contractors for the purposes of building modestly priced houses for sale to selected purchasers. A number of housing schemes under this arrangement are either under way or are being considered at various locations around the country.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the hardship being caused to the citizens of Dublin by long delays in taxing their motor vehicles at the motor taxation office; if he will consider a number of alternatives such as allowing motor tax to be paid at post offices or setting up motor tax offices at suitable and convenient locations throughout the city and county of Dublin; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The matter of delays in taxing motor vehicles in the Dublin area has been the subject of consultation and discussion over the past few months between my Department and Dublin Corporation who are the statutory authority for the registration and licensing of motor vehicles in Dublin city and county.  Earlier this year, my Department sanctioned the employment of additional temporary staff and the purchase and deployment of additional equipment with a view to improving the level and quality of service by the Dublin motor tax offices.  Proposals for the employment of further staff are being examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> As a result of representations from Dublin Corporation, I have agreed in principle to a feasibility study being carried out concerning the establishment of a motor tax sub-office within the functional area of the licensing authority.  This proposal is now being developed by the corporation as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The proposed sub-office would be in the nature of a pilot scheme, the service initially would be confined to renewals of licences.  At a later stage, it may be possible to extend the range of services.</P>
    <P>As to the use of Post Office facilities for the payment of motor tax it is considered that this would give rise to serious practical problems.  The administration of the registration and licensing system, including the issue of licences is the statutory responsibility of the licensing authority.  Specially trained staff are required to deal, <i>inter alia,</i> with the determination of the appropriate taxation class and rates of duty applicable to vehicles as well as arrears of duty which may be due. Considerable security problems could also arise in relation to transfer and safe-keeping of licences (tax discs). Accordingly, I do not favour the use of post offices for the payment of motor tax.</P>

      <P>The number of members of the Reserve Defence Force who attended for annual training from the beginning of January until the 31 October of this years is as follows:&mdash; Reserve of Officers (First Line), Reserve of Men (First Line) &mdash; 476; An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil (Officers and Men) &mdash; 7,886; An Slua Muirí (Officers and Men) &mdash; 190.</P>
      <P>These figures represent 50 per cent, 48 per cent and 53 per cent of the respective strengths on the 31 October, 1983.</P>
      <P>Apart from the exceptions mentioned hereunder all members of the Reserve Defence Force who attended for annual training qualified for the full rate of gratuity. Six members of the First Line Reserve did not, for various reasons, fulfil the conditions prescribed in Defence Force Regulations for payment of the full rate of gratuity.  Each person involved qualified for a reduced rate of gratuity.</P>

      <P>Since the company was restructured in May 1981 the State has invested £1 million by way of share equity and loan capital in the company.  Government guarantees in respect of bank borrowings of £1.1 million were given.  A further provision of £1.012 million for capital grants at a rate of 60 per cent of eligible expenditure on capital equipment was made available for the company but it only availed of £195,000 since 1981.  In addition, no charge was made for standing timber supplied to the company and the harvesting expenses involved were subsidised to a substantial degree.  The value of this concession is of the order of £1 million.  Despite these State measures the company has up to the date on which it was put into receivership accumulated losses of the order of £0.9 million.</P>

      <P>The development of fish farming (aquaculture) around our coasts is a matter which has been and is the object of considerable attention by my Department in conjunction with other State bodies, in particular An Bord Iascaigh Mhara (BIM) and the National Board for Science and Technology (NBST).  Numerous surveys and tests have been carried out in many areas around the coast by scientists and marine biologists attached to the Fisheries Research Centre of my Department, BIM and the NBST.  These activities will continue in accordance with my Department's plans for fish farming development, and will ensure that a great amount of data and advice is available on all aspects of fish farming to persons or bodies interested in engaging in this comparatively new and exciting sector of the fishing industry.</P>
      <P>An aspect of the role of my Department in promoting the growth of this sector of the industry is the provision of grants for the development of fish farming projects around the coast.  The grants scheme is administered by BIM and under the scheme, grants are available for both pilot and commercial scale projects, as follows: (a) pilot projects &mdash; grant assistance is related to capital expenditure on suitable projects subject to an upper limit of IR £20,000; (b) commercial projects &mdash; grants are available for up to 30 per cent of the capital expenditure involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In areas under its jurisdiction, Údarás <Col N="2210" /> na Gaeltachta operates a grant scheme under which grants of up to 60 per cent of capital expenditure are available for suitable fish farming projects.</P>
    <P>Grant assistance from the EEC under the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (FEOGA) is also available for suitable commercial scale projects and may be up to 50 per cent of capital costs.</P>
    <P>One project only has been submitted to date for EEC grant aid under the recently agreed structures regulation.  In addition five other projects, originally submitted in 1982, were awarded grants totalling IR £671,712, in July, 1983 under a previous regulation.</P>
    <P>BIM have 22 projects under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta have six projects under consideration at present, all in the Connemara area.  These applications are at the negotiation stage.</P>

      <P>Because of the substantial losses incurred on its Cork-Pembroke service, the B &amp; I Company terminated the service with effect from 3 February, 1983. At the request of the Government, however, the company operated a summer service this year between Cork and Pembroke. Local support for the summer service, which was operated from 16 June to 12 September, was disappointing &mdash; as will be seen from the traffic figures given in my reply to a question on the subject on 6 December, 1983 &mdash; and the service incurred heavy losses.</P>

      <P>The information requested by the Deputy is as follows: (a) the original estimated capital cost in March 1979 of the Howth-Bray electrification project was £46.4 million excluding loan financing charges; (b) the estimated actual capital cost of the project on completion in 1984, excluding financing charges, is £85.7 million which is equivalent to £46.1 million at constant March 1979 prices; (c) CIE are financing the capital cost of the project, including capitalised interest charges, entirely by borrowings.  Interest charges are being capitalised until the completion of the project, after which they will be charged to revenue.  Capitalised interest charges are estimated at £29 million.  The interest arising from borrowings is estimated at £11.5 million (fully capitalised) in 1983 and £16.48 million (of which £7.85 million will be capitalised) in 1984; (d) approximately 50 per cent of the cost of the project (including capitalised interest) is being financed by borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. Those currencies are: Sterling, US Dollars, Deutschemarks, Dutch Guilders, French Francs, and European Currency Units.  The remaining 50 per cent of the cost of the project is being financed by borrowings denominated in Punts.  The increase in loan servicing costs in 1983 due to devaluation is estimated at £0.25 million approximately.</P>

      <P>The Barrymore level crossing referred to by the Deputy is an unmanned iron-gated crossing on the Athlone-Roscommon line.</P>
      <P>CIE intend to automate this crossing by substituting lights and bells for the gates and it is envisaged that Roscommon County Council will bear 50 per cent of the cost.  I am informed that the council are investigating the means of financing this and will not be in a position to make any commitment to CIE until this aspect has been clarified.</P>
      <P>The automation of Barrymore level crossing will require the making of an order by the Minister for Transport under the Transport Acts.</P>

      <P>It has not been possible in the time available to trace an application for a coin box telephone in the maisonettes referred to.</P>
      <P>Public telephones are provided only in areas where the use likely to be made of them would be sufficient to warrant their provision.  They are not provided in private residences.  A telephone can be provided at the location named only if one of the tenants or perhaps Dublin County Council is prepared to rent the line.</P>

      <P>RTE recently submitted an outline proposal to establish an additional radio service on the long wave band on 254 KHz.  The proposal is under examination at present and a conclusion will be reached on it as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The frequency 254 KHz was allocated to Ireland under the Final Acts of the Regional Administrative LF/MF Broadcasting Conference (Regions 1 and 3) held in Geneva in 1975.  The agreement came into force on 23 November 1978. Authority to introduce an additional radio service on the frequency was not sought until the present proposals were submitted.  The issue of whether such a service should be provided is not a clear-cut one.</P>

      <P>The improvement of radio and television reception is primarily a matter for RTE.  The quality of reception varies with distance from the transmitter, topography and the quality of the receiver used.</P>
      <P>In general, radio reception on medium wave is somewhat impaired during the hours of darkness in areas more distant from the transmitters at Tullamore and Athlone.  Reception of VHF radio and of television is generally satisfactory except in areas which are sheltered from the transmitter by mountainous terrain.</P>
      <P>RTE say that they are proceeding to improve coverage by their services as quickly as their resources allow but it is not possible to deal with many isolated areas at the same time.</P>

Attention to faults outside normal working hours is confined to consultants on call and key medical personnel in major hospitals. Such priority may also be afforded to the telephone number on call in areas where a panel of doctors exists to provide a 24 hour &ldquo;on call&rdquo; service.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of new jobs needed to contain unemployment at present levels will depend both on the number of jobs lost each year and on the increase in the labour force.</P>
      <P>Job losses have been the major factor contributing to the increase in unemployment in 1983.  The rate at which jobs will continue to be lost depends largely on the overall competitiveness of the economy. As the Deputy is aware, the Government have initiated discussions with the main interest groups to inform them of this serious situation and to explore means for improving the economy's competitiveness. Pending the outcome of these discussions, it would be premature to estimate the extent of future job losses.</P>
      <P>The labour force has been increasing in recent years by around 20,000 a year. However, it is unlikely that this rate of increase would be maintained if total employment continued to fall.</P>
      <P>Regarding the second part of the Deputy's question, some 100,000 additional jobs would be required to reduce unemployment to 1980 levels.  The annual rate would depend on the period over which this reduction could be achieved.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 to 346, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The proposal to provide a central waste facility was the outcome of special consideration in my Department (with the assistance of an expert group representing the IDA, the IIRS and the Geological Survey Office) of the problems of ensuring that suitable provision was made to meet the need for industrial waste disposal facilities.  A number of possible sites were considered but it would be inappropriate to give details of the properties concerned.</P>
      <P>I understand that the criteria fulfilled by the Baldonnel site were its location near Dublin where a large proportion of industrial waste arises, its ready access to Dublin port, and its relative remoteness from residential development.</P>

      <P>Brosna exchange was convered to automatic working on 7 September 1983.  The most recent telephone accounts issued early in October to subscribers connected to this exchange included charges for about a fortnight's calls made after the conversion.  The average amount charged for per subscriber in these accounts was less than in the corresponding quarter 1982 when increases in charges since then are discounted.</P>
      <P>Knocknagoshel was converted to automatic working on 22 June 1983.  The most recent accounts issued in October 1983 to subscribers connected to this exchange included charges for a full quarter's calls made after the conversion took place. The average amount charged for operator-assisted calls per subscriber decreased by almost 59 per cent as compared with the corresponding quarter in 1982.  But the overall amount charged per subscriber for calls showed an increase of 29 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Clearly what happened was that subscribers used the STD facility extensively without adverting to the length or cost of the calls.  It has been the common experience both here and in other countries that conversion of exchanges to automatic working or extension of STD facilities almost invariably result in an <Col N="2250" /> increase in call traffic.

      <P>I indicated in reply to a similar question from the Deputy on 5 July 1983 (Official Report, Volume 344 No. 7 column 1527) that applications of this kind involve detailed and complex examination of title and often protracted correspondence, and that the average time-span for completing such applications is unlikely to be less than 12 months.  The position is still substantially the same.

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works are satisfied that the positioning of rock on the <Col N="2291" /> beach in the vicinity of Rosslare Strand village would serve no useful purpose. The commissioners have received a proposal under the Coast Protection Act, 1963 for a capital scheme of protection works at Rosslare Strand.  The statutory preliminary examination of this proposal is being undertaken.  Meanwhile, the existing protection works at Rosslare Strand are being maintained, on an ongoing basis, by the commissioners.</P>
