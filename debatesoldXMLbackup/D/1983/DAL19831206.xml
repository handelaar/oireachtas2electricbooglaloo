      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will give the latest statistics available to his Department in relation to the level of contamination in milk, meat and in foodstuffs generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures in respect of 1982 in relation to samples of food, including milk and meat products, monitored for compliance with legislation on foodstuffs show that of a total of 8,697 samples, 5 per cent were found to be unsatisfactory.  The results of <Col N="1034" /> analyses ranged from deficiencies in samples relevant to the compositional and additives standards to problems of contamination in individual foodstuffs.</P>
      <P>Specific details of the unsatisfactory samples are available in the official reports of the three regional public analysts for 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a seasonal variation in this area and that the 5 per cent he has given us could be at a higher level at another time of the year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That may well be.  I do not have any information on that but it is important to note that 95 per cent of food samples taken by the health inspectors and analysed by the public analysts were found to be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister to comment on the report in this morning's newspaper which suggested that the Department of Agriculture report put forward the view that 80 per cent of Irish abbatoirs were unsuitable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The report will be examined by me and I have no doubt that it will be examined very carefully by the Minister for Agriculture.  I have no details of the report yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Departments in question, Health and Agriculture, have very little power in this area, that it is the local authorities who deal with it and that there is little legislation in the Departments guiding local authorities in this area?  Will the Minister look at that very urgently because it is a serious situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that assertion at all.  The Deputy is well aware of the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts, the food hygiene regulations of 1950 and onwards and the regular updating of these regulations and legislation. Any offender who is found to have broken the law in relation to these regulations is substantially fined or imprisoned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health whether there are any figures available to him as to the failure rate of antibiotics being administered to young children or to hospital patients generally; whether the medical profession have made any complaints to him on the matter; and if he will make a statement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Figures are not available in respect of the two categories mentioned. A number of different reports based on studies carried out in various countries have been published since 1962 which show a notable rise in the incidence of organisms resistant to the usual antibiotics. The cases on which these reports were based were in most cases sampled outside hospitals.</P>
      <P>I have not had complaints about a failure rate as referred to by the Deputy although I am, of course, aware of the profession's views in relation to the availability of antibiotics for veterinary purposes. As the Deputy is aware, the Minister for Agriculture proposes to introduce additional controls shortly on the supply and administration of such antibiotics.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a number of members of the medical profession were quoted recently as expressing concern about what they call the failure rate in hospitals?  Would the Minister consider asking his Department to try to compile some hard information in the future in this area as it is important?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department on a regular basis keep in very close touch with all of the health boards directly concerned. We have made inquiries through the medical director of the National Drugs Advisory Board and so far we have <Col N="1036" /> failed to elicit specific evidence of failure rates.  I am aware of the reports in the newspapers.  One newspaper, <i>The Irish Times,</i> reported on 3 November and that report is being examined and followed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can I pin this down? Is the Minister saying to me that in his Department's opinion there is little or no failure rate? Is that the official response?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We seek information and specific evidence of failure rates.  So far we have failed to elicit specific evidence. That is not to suggest that there are not any failure rates.  So far we have not received notification of them.</P>

    <P>4.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will bring forward specific proposals as a health measure to control the unlicensed sale of antibiotics and other drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Poison Regulations, 1982, which came into force on 1 March 1983, the retail sale of antibiotics and other potent drugs, whether for human or veterinary use, is confined to pharmacies and licensed sellers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I ask the Minister one question on this because there is a whole area here which one could cover but I will not get side-tracked into that as I know you would not wish that? I know the Minister referred to this last week and I appreciate him taking time to look at it.  Will the Minister make it necessary for the National Drugs Advisory Board to clear drugs which are put on the market for use in animals in the same way as these drugs have to be cleared for use in humans?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I reconstituted the Poisons Council some months ago.  That had not been done since 1978 and I did so for the purpose of examining the adequacy of the current controls and to advise me of the need for amendments. The Department of Agriculture have indicated that they propose to establish a consultative committee under the Animals <Col N="1037" /> Remedies Act, 1956, to advise the Minister on the making of regulations aimed at placing greater controls over the availability of veterinary antibiotics and hormones.  My Department will be represented on that committee but there are substantial regulations in force already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider a suggestion that the Drugs Advisory Board should clear drugs for use in animals in the same way as they have to clear drugs for humans?  Could I also ask him once more if he has any specific proposals to make sure that the same testing procedure applies to meat for home consumption as to that for export?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Agriculture is specifically responsible for the use of antibiotics in animals and I do not propose to devolve that responsibility on the National Drugs Advisory Board. That board have a great deal to do in relation to drugs for human consumption.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will appoint a paediatrician for joint cover between Cavan and Monaghan general hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The appointment of a paediatrician for joint cover between Cavan and Monaghan general hospitals would require the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal which has the statutory function of regulating the numbers and types of medical consultants in hospitals. It would be a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board to apply for approval if they desire to make such an appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that there was no paediatrician appointed because of the embargo? With regard to sessions in various hospitals, would it not make economic sense to have a number of paediatricians appointed, irrespective of the embargo in the Public Service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1038" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two whole time paediatricians in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, and one of them provides a service of two half days per month to Dundalk hospital.  The health board have made arrangements for a consultant paediatrician from Dublin to attend Cavan hospital for three days per month, a total of six sessions, two half days each month in Monaghan and one day each month in Navan.  As the Deputy is aware, there is no proposal for specific paediatrician cover in respect of Monaghan hospital although the health board applied to the comhairle for approval of such a post in Monaghan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The hospital under the control of the health board has the services of a paediatrician at so many sessions per month and it has been generally accepted that that is not a satisfactory system.  The committee recommended a considerable time ago that a paediatrician should be appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>My plans are that in-patient paediatric services for the Cavan-Monaghan area would be provided at the new Cavan general hospital and that there would be a consultant paediatrician based there who would provide out-patient clinics in Monaghan.  However, as the Deputy is aware, that matter is <i>sub judice</i> and I cannot comment any further on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that a consultant coming three days a month to one county and two half days per month to the other county is not a paediatric service?  If Comhairle na nOspidéal recommend a paediatrician to cover both counties, will he allocate the money for that appointment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is well aware that in relation to the new general hospital in Cavan it is my earnest hope, wish and recommendation to the comhairle that there should be a full-time consultant paediatrician based in Cavan.  At present there are ten children's beds in Cavan surgical hospital but none designated <Col N="1039" /> as such in Monaghan.  I hope that the comhairle will give approval on that basis but, unfortunately, due to circumstances beyond my control I am not in a position to deliver that because the matter is with the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about the years to come, we do not know for how long, and it is fair to point out that it is the Minister's bungling which is responsible for the fact that the hospital in Cavan was not started in time.  If the health board request the comhairle now to make such an appointment and the comhairle agrees will the Minister allocate the money?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the steps that have been taken to implement the recommendations of the ministerial task force on drug abuse with particular reference to the proposed urgent discussions with YEA, HEB, and Cospóir concerning priority for high risk areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Each member of the Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse has been given responsibility for ensuring that the recommendations relevant to them are implemented without any undue delay.  The task force meets at regular intervals to monitor progress made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Progress has been made to date with the introduction of the new Criminal Justice Bill, the more rigorous checking of applications for passports by the Department of Foreign Affairs and the development of video films and other educational materials by the Department of <Col N="1040" /> Education, in conjunction with the Health Education Bureau, for use within the context of &ldquo;life skills&rdquo; type programmes in second level schools, in youth clubs and with parent groups.</P>
    <P>Officers of my own Department have already met representatives of the board of St. James's Hospital to discuss the provision of a bed facility for the treatment of drug abusers.  They have also met representatives of Jervis Street Hospital about the development of facilities there. A meeting also took place with representatives of the Eastern Health Board and Coolmine Therapeutic Community to discuss the provision of a suitable therapeutic model for the treatment of drug abusers from socially and educationally deprived backgrounds &mdash; particularly those in the 12-16 age group.  These recommendations are being actively pursued.</P>
    <P>The task force have also met representatives of the Medico-Social Research Board and the Youth Employment Agency to discuss how both organisations might contribute in implementing the recommendations relevant to them.  Both organisations are currently preparing detailed work programmes for the task force which will be ready in the coming weeks.  Meetings with the Health Education Bureau and Cospóir, and indeed with the other organisations mentioned in the Government press statement will be arranged within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that there will be no undue delay in the implementation of the recommendations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  The question relates particularly to the urgency which was expressed in the Minister's statement announcing the recommendations of the task force when he pinpointed a number of places as high-risk areas.  One of those was the Ballymun area.  Has the Minister received any proposals from the bodies mentioned, the Youth Employment Agency and the Health Education Bureau, relating specifically to Ballymun or to the inner city area or to the Dún Laoghaire ward, all of which are high-risk areas?</P>

      <P>The meeting with Cospóir and with the National Youth Policy Committee are due to take place this month, while the meetings with the Youth Employment Agency have taken place already.  I will be keeping a very close eye on the situation.  I have received a number of progress reports but in the first instance these are being sent to the task force.  I assure the Deputy that the areas mentioned by him as well as parts of Cork and Limerick will receive special attention in the context of the proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister refer the recent RTE programme on this whole issue to the ministerial task force and ask them particularly to institute a follow-up to the frightening situation as revealed on that programme? Is the Minister prepared also to draw to the attention of his colleague, the Minister for Justice, the revelations of that programme concerning the apparent activity of illegal organisations in many of the areas mentioned? The activities of these organisations, as revealed on that programme, are frightening. It is a matter that the Minister ought to raise formally with the Minister for Justice.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Those are separate questions.  Question No. 6 asks whether the Minister intends implementing certain recommendations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking about the ministerial task force in which the Minister for Justice has an input.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so but the question on the Order Paper refers to a report.  The Deputy seems to be raising other matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received various progress reports.  The members of the task force are very much aware of the programme in question.  The Minister for Justice, too, is acutely aware of the efforts of criminal subversive organisations to exploit the situation.  I urge that residents' associations, particularly in the greater Dublin area, should not succumb <Col N="1042" /> to the deliberate manipulation of the problem by these subversive groups, notably the Provisional IRA, whether by way of initiating the problem or of attempting allegedly to control it.  These are groups who are masquerading on the basis of democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister bring to the attention of the ministerial task force the need to ensure uniformity of sentencing in respect of the prosecution and conviction of people involved in drug trafficking? In their further work, the ministerial task force might examine the need for such uniformity and recommend publicly that those engaged in drug trafficking, be they Irish nationals or otherwise, serve prison sentences.  We must ensure that those people are not treated differently by virtue of their nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would remind Deputies that Question No. 6 which deals with a report from the task force cannot be taken as an opportunity for an across-the-board discussion on drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate whether the task force will deal with the problem of sentencing.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has referred to discussions that are taking place with the Coolmine therapeutic centre regarding the provision of a residential centre for heroin addicts from socially deprived areas.  This is one of the recommendations of the task force.  Is there any time scale in respect of the establishment of such a centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The main centre that I have visited is the one that I opened officially is St. Martha's which is run by the Coolmine regime.  I have been deeply impressed by the work done at St. Martha's particularly in terms of the therapeutic model there.  The task force are considering the prospect of future developments <Col N="1043" /> in that area.  The Minister of State at my Department who is the Chairman of the task force is working directly and actively on this whole matter.  I would point out to Deputy Shatter particularly that a number of matters being dealt with are of a confidential nature, involving the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, and that a lot of action is taken to which we cannot allude in the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that Ballymun has been designated a high-risk area and since there is already a community-based group there providing counselling and advice to drug addicts in the area, a service that is proving very successful, would the Minister consider making available funding for a full-time co-ordinator as requested by this group so that their work might be extended?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a particular view in that regard and it is that work of this nature can be done under the general auspices of the Eastern Health Board.  I am reluctant to have <i>ad hoc</i> groups working separately and independently in this very sensitive and critical area, an area which has substantial security connotations. The funds available for such groups will be channelled through the Eastern Health Board on the recommendation of the task force.  I stress that the task force will be given broad policy guidelines in relation to the work to be done by the health board in their own areas.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a double-barrelled <Col N="1045" /> reason for it.  We have an enormous proliferation of hospitals of all kinds and all varieties of bed occupancy costing approximately £650 million per year.  We are spending now £13 million a week on hospital institutions and many people have very bright ideas about setting up yet another private hospital and then availing of VHI &mdash; who, I assure the House, are entirely solvent and in very good hands, lest my earlier comment be misconstrued.  The existing system of voluntary medical insurance must be protected and must not be exploited.  That applies to domestic entrepreneurs in the medical field or to international entrepreneurs. We have had proposals in that regard from America and we have resisted those proposals, or at least I have.</P>

This was done despite the general embargo which is in force on staff recruitment to the health services.  I am aware of the needs of St. Michael's House for further staff.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>Four sets of parents have accepted the <i>ex gratia</i> payments offered.  A total of 38 additional applications has been submitted for consideration by the Expert Medical Group since the announcement of the group's findings in July 1982.  The ages of the applicants and the years of vaccination, where known, are set out on a table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  It will be seen that the number of these vaccinated after 1975 is 3.  A report on one applicant has yet to be submitted by the expert group and, as soon as this has been received, I will communicate the findings to each parent in respect of their child.</P>
      <P>The chairman of the group discussed the reports with the parents of a number of persons who were examined prior to July 1982.  As a result of these discussions, the group re-examined some of the reports, the results of which re-examinations were communicated by the chairman of the group to the parents concerned.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister indicate why only four sets of parents out of the 14 whose children were judged to have been affected by whooping cough vaccine in the June 1982 report have accepted the <i>ex gratia</i> payments?  Why have the other 10 groups not done so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been closed by the Department pending fresh information.  On 4 November 1982 the then Government decided to offer payment of £10,000 on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis in respect of the 14 persons whose disabilities the expert group on whooping cough vaccination considered could be attributable with reasonable probability to the vaccination.  Only four have decided to <Col N="1056" /> accept the offer of payment.  It is entirely a matter for the parents concerned and I would be precluded from commenting on the reasons they did not accept.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the principal reason the other parents have not accepted is due to the restrictive nature of the conditions to which they must agree in order to accept payment?  These conditions are considerably more restrictive than those applicable under a similar scheme operating in the United Kingdom, exclusive of Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have examined the matter with great care.  Whereas I may have been critical of my predecessor on many aspects of the work done on the portfolio, I completely concur with the work done by him in this area and the offers made.  Our Department, more than that in any other European country or any state in America, have spent an enormous amount of time and devoted a considerable amount of work to this area and I do not think the 14 claimants concerned and the other persons seeking inclusion in the scheme have anything to complain about.  I have a very strong view on that.  Many of the records concerned are confidential to the expert group and to my Department and I am precluded from commenting on individual cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have always been in a position to allude to the general findings of the group.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the Eastern Health Board area a particular applicant who suffers from TB, an infectious disease, is still waiting for the health board to establish his eligibility for such an allowance?  He is a farmer who has had to sell off his stock and is precluded from carrying out his usual farm <Col N="1058" /> chores.  Is the Minister aware that the health board investigation requires that his wife should sign an affidavit stating that she does not carry out hairdressing for monetary reward in the home?  Does he not consider that this is conducive to the spread of TB rather than its eradication? It seems that the health board are more interested in finding out the income of the household than in eradicating the disease.

      <P>If the Deputy makes the details of this case available to me I will investigate it fully.  A means test has applied since this allowance was introduced in 1948 following the enactment of the 1947 Act.

I am not anxious to discuss the matter in much detail.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the building for which the health board are negotiating is not really suitable because the only entrance is at the top of a narrow <i>cul-de-sac</i> and the traffic that would be generated by a health centre would be totally unacceptable to the people in the area?  They want a new health centre on the site.  Was there at any time money set aside for the building of the new health centre and was it diverted elsewhere?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health when a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist will take up appointment in the maternity unit of Roscommon County Hospital; and the reasons for the long delay in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The post of consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist at Roscommon hospital was offered to a person following the holding of an open competition conducted by the Local Appointments Commissioners.  The person has <Col N="1060" /> indicated to the Western Health Board that he will not accept the post until support staff is provided.</P>
      <P>The health board have sought approval to 14 additional staff for the maternity unit.  In view of the current financial situation and the Government's policy in relation to the restriction of numbers employed in the public sector I am not in a position at present to provide the resources for the support staff sought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister now indicate when he will sanction the appointment of the consultant obstretician gynaecologist because we in Roscommon have been awaiting this appointment far too long?  I do not see why the Minister should deprive our county hospital of its necessary maternity services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter has been raised before.  We have had very detailed discussions with the chief executive officer of the health board.  The latest discussions were held on 28 October last.  It is important to note that the health board regard the funding of the maternity unit in Galway Regional Hospital as their priority.  It has been made clear to the health board that no additional funds are at present available for support staff for the obstretician post in Roscommon and that the only way in which that support staff can be provided is by the redeployment of existing resources within the board.  I understand that the board are at present considering this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister personally entertain this matter?  After many years of struggle by the hospital's action committee, public representatives and the local authority could he possibly end this long saga and give us the services we require in Roscommon?  I would hope he could make such an announcement prior to Christmas 1983, not in 1984.  I am sure the Estimates are at present being prepared. The Minister is totally responsible for the situation in Roscommon at present. I am asking the Minister now to intervene and effect a just settlement of this problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not stopping the appointment of an obstretician gynaecologist in Roscommon at all.  The person concerned, who was offered the post following a competition by the Local Appointments Commission, indicated that he would not take up the post unless he got 14 staff to work with him.  We have advised the health board that they have a responsibility to redeploy staff to ensure that the obstretician post is properly staffed.  They are at present considering the matter.  There are severe limitations on my funds and so far, at the conclusion of this Question Time, in relation to the Department of Health we have now spent £79.5 million.</P>

      <P>The Minister did say that he was not holding up the appointment. But would the Minister not accept that the consultant in question is correct not to take up duty until there is sufficient staff there to ensure that there will be adequate care for potential maternity patients in Roscommon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned has indicated that he will not accept the post unless the various staff criteria laid down are met.  For example, they want a number of porters; they want this and they want that.  I am saying to the Western Health Board and to the CEO that they can have the consultant obstretician appointed by redeploying nursing and other staff within the health board to Roscommon hospital, that they have adequate resources available to do that and that I will not agree to appoint 14 new staff for a particular post willy-nilly because I do not have the kind of money available in 1984 to enable me to do so.  I think the message has got through.  I think the Deputy will find a very resourceful CEO there and that both he and his outstanding programme manager will respond in an appropriate way without spending another £300,000 or £400,000 of taxpayers' money which cannot be provided.</P>

      <P>The Chair is proceeding strictly in accordance with Standing Orders.

You are, I am sure, aware, as is everybody else in this House, that there is, to put it mildly, very widespread public interest in this matter. Perhaps I might go further and say there is widespread public disquiet about the matter.  In these circumstances, Sir, if you persist in your ruling &mdash; and of course you are perfectly entitled to persist &mdash; that this Private Notice Question, which in our view is strictly within the terms of Standing Orders, cannot be allowed, would you permit me to ask the Tánaiste if he will arrange some time today to have the appropriate Minister make a statement to the House on this very grave matter because it is one which is causing great public unease throughout the country?</P>

      <P>The position, Deputy Haughey, is that such a question would beg another question and it is precisely that that Standing Orders seek to prevent.  As I said last week, there seems to be a very harmonious working relationship between the Whips, and I suggest that Deputy Haughey would have those channels explored.</P>

      <P>As you know, the Whips <Col N="1180" /> can only put into operation, and make technical arrangements therefor, something which the Government would decide to agree to.  I am suggesting to the Tánaiste in particular, and to Aire na Gaeltachta who is sitting beside him, that this is a matter of very far-reaching implications. All sorts of suspicions, rumours and counter-rumours are circulating.  It is very much in the public interest that a clear unequivocal statement be made by the Minister today about the matter.  If that course of action does not recommend itself to the Government we will have to pursue the matter through other channels.  In particular, we will be pressing for a judicial inquiry into this matter. At this stage the least we are entitled to is a clear statement from the Minister in justification, if that is possible, of his actions in this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to say a few words on this long overdue legislation which, unfortunately, is necessary in our society today.  Over the past number of years all types of crime have increased &mdash; robberies, rapes, murders and assaults.  The basic values of our society seem to be losing ground at an alarming rate and a general acceptance of the principle &ldquo;it is all right if I am not caught&rdquo; seems to be becoming more prevalent.  The notion of the right of the individual before and above the common good at all costs seems to rule.  I am not advocating that the common good should be the over-riding premise in judging individual cases but that the total emphasis on the right of the individual should be re-examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that there have been many cases before the courts where individuals who committed serious crimes were acquitted due to their lawyers being able to use loopholes in the law to their advantage.  To my way of thinking, this is wrong and no legal jargon or rationalisation will convince me that a wrong is right.  No matter what the world says, the spirit of the law should rule, and a person <Col N="1187" /> who has committed a serious crime and gets off because of the legal wizardry of his lawyer is still guilty in my eyes and should be made account for his wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provisions in the Bill, I was particularly delighted to see the provisions in sections 9 and 11 which relate to offences committed by the person out on bail.  As we all know, people out on bail often take advantage of the situation.  Many of them spend that time before they are brought back to court committing more crimes.  Up to now they have known that their sentences will be concurrent and therefore they do not worry very much about what they are doing.  I am glad to say this situation has been changed under this Bill.</P>
    <P>Another serious crime which is happening every day in our cities and throughout the country is the stealing of motor vehicles.  Not only is the stealing of a vehicle a serious crime &mdash; these vehicles are very expensive and most people have to go into debt to buy them and when they are found they are broken up or burned out &mdash; but the people who steal them joyride around the city, damage property and knock down people. Only yesterday a young lad stole a car and during his joyride knocked down and killed a citizen.  This has got to stop.  The provisions in this Bill to cover this crime are very badly needed and will be a real deterrent.  The sooner they are brought into effect the better for society.</P>
    <P>Robberies from building sites, shops and households are increasing at a dramatic rate.  The main reason is that people who do not have money steal these goods and then sell them.  To whom do they sell them?  They sell them to the ordinary people, our neighbours.  These people do not ask any questions.  The provision in section 15 which requires individuals to account for property they buy which a member of the Garda has reasonable grounds for believing has been acquired due to a crime, is good because until the people who buy stolen goods are made responsible for their actions there is very little chance of cutting down on these kinds of robberies <Col N="1188" /> and thefts from building sites.  This kind of legislation is very important in cracking down on this type of crime.  In my view the people who receive stolen goods are as guilty as the people who perpetrate the crime.  I am very glad therefore to see that section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The sections which seem to have given rise to most discussion are sections 3, 16, 17 and 18.  These relate to the rights of the individual. No doubt there is need for a period of detention for the purpose of questioning.  I cannot but accept that this must be but, side by side with that, there must be proper safeguards to ensure individual rights are not abused.  This is important from the point of view of the individual and it is also important from the point of view of the Garda Síochána. Over many years they have built up a good name.  They have built up goodwill and respect within the community.  If there are not proper safeguards in the relevant sections this goodwill, this good name and this respect built up over many years may become tarnished.  I would like to see the Minister bringing in certain safeguards to ensure that the rights of the individual are protected and the good name of the Garda is not tarnished.</P>
    <P>Sections 16, 17 and 18 have come in for a great deal of adverse criticism, and rightly so.  Under section 16 an obligation is placed on an individual to give information about a crime if he is interviewed in regard to it.  As we all know, questioned before a group of people there are bound to be things a person questioned may omit.  Hopefully, when we come to Committee Stage the Minister will bring in some safeguards in this regard.</P>
    <P>It would take a lawyer to tease out all the implications of the fundamental changes these sections envisage.  Deputy Molony in his contribution gave an indepth exposition of the changes and the results that may follow.  I believe the great majority of the people feel these sections should not be passed as they stand since they could lead to even greater confusion and greater injustices than possibly exist at the moment.</P>
    <P>In general, this Bill is an attempt to reduce the ever-increasing crime rate.  I <Col N="1189" /> do not believe it will succeed because of the wrong direction our society as a whole seems to have taken.  The underlying causes of the ills in our society are the ever-increasing rise in unemployment coupled with the breakdown in family life.  Unemployment means many idle hands and, as we all know, the devil finds work for idle hands to do.  There are more and more idle hands every day.  Yesterday another 1,500 were added to the unemployment register.  These people have nothing to do and they turn to crime.  Until the Government do something positive about unemployment there will be a continuing increase in crime. The family has been the basis of our society and the breakdown of family life today is a contributory cause to the increasing crime rate.  It is incumbent on parents to teach their children their rights and not only their rights but also their duties.  With rights there are also duties. As far as I can see, people spend most of the time talking about their rights and forget about their duties.  It is vitally important that duties should be taught as well as rights and there should be more education in regard to the duties of a citizen to his country.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, though I welcome the Bill in general, unless unemployment is tackled seriously and greater support given to the family the effect of this Bill will be minimal.  This may sound pessimistic but, as President De Gaulle once said: &ldquo;History does not teach fatalism. There are moments when the will of a handful of freemen breaks through determinism and opens up new roads&rdquo;.  I believe there are enough free men in the country and in this Parliament who, in time, will open up new roads throughout this country and make it a better place for all of us to live in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Over the past few weeks a great deal has been said about this Bill.  I would like now to express my opinion about many of the provisions in this Bill.  Many Deputies have praised the Bill.  Many have welcomed it.  I have read every line and every clause and I describe the Bill as too little too late.  This Bill is long overdue and I am very surprised at <Col N="1190" /> the many in public life and elsewhere who profess to speak on behalf of others and express reservations about certain provisions in the Bill.  It must be borne in mind that we are not living in normal times and, if we are not living in normal times, we cannot expect normal legislation. Those who object to many of the provisions in the Bill must be made to realise that we are in an emergency situation. No matter how harsh the Bill may seem to be &mdash; it is designed to deal with a chaotic situation &mdash; there is nothing to prevent this House from repealing any objectionable sections as soon as we return to normal times and normal conditions &mdash; in other words, as soon as crime may be said to be under control.</P>
      <P>I would have liked this Bill to have been introduced five to seven years ago. Had that been done many of the serious crimes that have taken place in that period would not have taken place.  How long does it take Government to realise the seriousness of many of the problems that exist?  It almost seems as if Government does not realise the seriousness until we are on the very brink of chaos. We are today on the verge of complete collapse.  Society has broken down whether we like it or not.  How many times have we been warned about society breaking down?</P>
      <P>Even if the provisions of this Bill were put into effect at midnight tonight, I doubt very much that they would make much difference in a society where respect for other people's property, for the law, for authority and, above all, for each other has gone.  Respect for truth, integrity, and honesty is gone.  How can we restore that respect in the immediate future?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This State is in a serious stage of decay. Parliament itself is not functioning as we would like to see it functioning.  Tens of thousands of people outside Parliament are losing respect for our parliamentary institutions, for what is said here, what is done here, for authority.  They have no interest in parliamentary proceedings. That is very sad and serious.  What will it be like in three years from now, or in six years from now?  If we double the decay over the past five years I do not think <Col N="1191" /> many people will wish to participate in Irish society.</P>
    <P>Irish society has broken down.  We cannot close our eyes to the fact that we as parliamentarians must take our share of the blame for allowing Irish society to decline to the extent to which it has declined.  This State is in danger.  How often do we have to underline those words?  When we address responsible Ministers of the Government, are we addressing people who let them in one ear and out the other and are firmly convinced that these things cannot happen? Any responsible Minister who does not believe we are on the threshold of a complete collapse has not got his feet on the ground and is not listening to the grassroots who know what is happening all around them.</P>
    <P>I would not make this speech in this House 20 years ago because the grounds for this speech did not exist 20 years ago. They are now of frightening proportions. Members of the House who believe this are not true to themselves unless they speak up with courage and determination in this House while we have a House in which to speak.  The State cannot function properly unless we have laws respected by all the people and enacted for the common good of the majority. We cannot have laws which will suit everyone 100 per cent.  We have a duty to legislate for the common good of the majority of our people.  This Criminal Justice Bill is for the common good of the majority of the people.</P>
    <P>There will always be a minority who will try to drive a coach and four through every law and every regulation.  Usually the one crowd is associated with every form of protest.  Usually the one crowd and their connections, colleagues, confederates and friends object and find fault, and try to organise ways to destroy what is designed to help the majority and to be for the common good of the people, their security and the proper functioning of the State &mdash; in other words, the preservation of democracy as we knew it in the past.</P>
    <P>The Criminal Justice Bill is necessary because democracy is breaking down, if <Col N="1192" /> it has not broken down already to a great extent.  How often must Members of this House rise in their places to warn all and sundry of the chaotic seriousness, the deadly seriousness, of the whole Irish scene.  We have organised crime in every shape and form.  There was a time when crime was committed in the dead of nght. When we look back we see those crimes were petty.  Now serious crimes are committed publicly in broad daylight.  Crime has taken root.  This is an attack on the citizens, and an attack on the proper and free functioning of society and of the State.</P>
    <P>If we are to have freely functioning democratic institutions, we must have the goodwill of the community.  We must have the support of the people, the admiration and respect of the people.  In turn, we cannot close our eyes to the demands of the people, reasonable demands for their own safety and protection, for the security of their property, their right to live and to possess property, their right to hold on to what they earned honestly and justly.  That is the kind of society I believe in.  That is the kind of society which is dying a quick and painful death.  What are we to do about it?  In dealing with many problems in this House and outside it we have not got our priorities right.  We should put first the security of our people.  All citizens should be guaranteed a safe awakening in the morning, with their property intact. Whether they live in a humble council cottage or one of the great mansions, remnants of the past, they are entitled to security and privacy, without fear of invasion from apprentice or experienced criminals.</P>
    <P>This is not a bad Bill because it will help the State to function properly, which it is not doing at present.  Our Army and Garda force are there not just to enforce the laws of Parliament but to safeguard and advise the citizens.  Any police force which is functioning properly is friendly towards the people, guaranteeing them their rights, their freedom and their security. One of the first signs of a breakdown in democracy is demonstrated by the Army and the police force being unable to cope with the situation.  I say with all <Col N="1193" /> sincerity and for the record that our police force is as good as that of any democratic state in the world but they must have the support of the community and the backing of Parliament in giving them the necessary authority to safeguard life and property.  Respect for life and property is at a very low ebb here at present.</P>
    <P>Some of us, by meeting with and discussing our problems with members of Parliament from abroad and by reading, like to ascertain what is going on elsewhere. In our own lifetime we have seen democratic government breakdown in so many European countries.  Democracy disappeared and then reappeared in Greece.  The same happened in Spain and also in Portugal.  We have seen a complete breakdown of law and order in Turkey. To remedy the situation of democratic collapse, drastic action has had to be taken, mainly based on the safeguarding of the lives and property of the citizens.</P>
    <P>The wave of crime which we have been experiencing has been compounded, as the last speaker said, by our present economic conditions of close on a quarter of a million unemployed.  Unemployment undoubtedly leads to all forms of crime. The year 1983 is a singular one in that so many well-educated people are now unemployed.  They have time to think, to plan.  They have nothing else to do and the future holds very little for them.  With the best intentions in the world, many may be forced through economic necessity to embark, perhaps unintentionally, on crime, in order to provide food for their dependants.  This is made evident by some court cases.  You cannot have society functioning reasonably well on one side and not on the other.  If this Bill helps to maintain law and order in the future, with it must come a complete change in our attitude to our economic conditions.  We must change the economic circumstances which lead to crime, such as bad housing, broken homes, broken marriages, unemployment and lack of money.  The gap between our poor and our rich is getting ever wider.  This leads to people questioning why others have the world's goods and they have not and <Col N="1194" /> they blame society and Parliament.  They are entitled to their share of the goods, with security.</P>
    <P>The present economic circumstances are a source of disorder and discontent and lead to grave problems for our police force.  This means that the police do not get the full backing of the entire society in their fight against crime.  When the State was founded, our Army, Garda force and our courts were established.  It was not an easy task establishing a police force and an army.  It was an extremely difficult task establishing the courts.  We are a young nation in comparison with many countries, but I am afraid we now appear to be approaching a very serious and dangerous crossroads in our history. Our Army are there to assist the Garda force in the event of a complete breakdown of law and order and our Garda force are there as the first line of civic defence to ensure the rights of citizens and the safeguarding of their life and property.  The courts are there to administer the law.  Since our Army and our police force were established they have acquitted themselves well.  Our Judiciary are men of a very high standard of integrity.</P>
    <P>The gardaí who will enforce the laws and regulations in this Bill can be described as men of integrity who are there to protect all citizens rights.  For our very survival as citizens of a free country we depend very much on the integrity of the Garda force, the strength of our Army and the impartiality and integrity of the men who are sitting on the benches of our Courts in order to administer the law as they find it and as passed by the House.  We speak of courts, but the vital supreme court in the land is this House.  We make the laws here.  Not alone should we be seen to make the laws but we should make the laws to meet the occasion, to meet the circumstances and to make those laws fit in with the times and conditions in which we live.</P>
    <P>This Criminal Justice Bill is not out of place in the House today.  It should have been passed a long time ago.  When the Bill becomes law it will give additional powers to the Garda Síochána.  There are many people who do not want the Garda <Col N="1195" /> Síochána to have those powers.  If a person is law-abiding he need never fear those who will implement the terms of the laws passed in this House.  This Bill will at least scratch the surface.  However, I have a feeling that things are going out of hand so rapidly that all the provisions of this Bill may not be sufficient to restore us to where we were in happier times.  No man can deny that, in order to cope with the extent of organised crime and educated criminals, we must have legislation to give somebody the authority to cope with the activities of those people in their undesirable acts against others.</P>
    <P>Our jury trials left a lot to be desired and I am glad to see in this Bill there will be an improvement because of the majority decisions.  I hope a new look will be taken at the whole administration of law in our courts.  The long delay in disposing of court lists has caused great concern. While those charged with responsibility on the bench are doing what they can to clear the variety of cases before them, frequent conferences should be held either at the command of the President of the District Court or the Chief Justice to ensure that cases are not allowed to hang over for months and even for years. If a reorganisation is necessary for that purpose, let it take place.  If there are not enough judges and justices to deal with this, let us appoint more.  What is wrong with doing that?  The work must go on.  It is a very serious situation to have court cases hanging over for a very undesirable length of time.  In recent times there has been great uneasiness felt by citizens who fear house-breaking and robbery.  We are not free people if we cannot defend the helpless; and is there a meaner offence than entering the homes of aged people, beating them up and stealing their meagre savings?</P>
    <P>People in rural areas are living in dread.  House-breaking and robberies must be stopped.  However, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that we played our part in encouraging the city criminal to go down the country because we closed a vast number of Garda stations in rural areas.  When are they going to be reopened? Perhaps officials in the Department <Col N="1196" /> of Justice and the Garda Síochána think there is no need for Garda stations in rural areas.  The very presence of a garda in an area is a deterrent to crime. A number of Garda stations in my own constituency have been closed down and, if they were open, the crime rate would not be so high.</P>
    <P>Some time ago the Minister for Justice said he was having a complete review of the structures of the Garda Síochána. The existing structures have existed since 1923 and one cannot compare the type of crime then with what is facing us today. I have the greatest respect and admiration for the founder members of the Garda Síochána, who are now very thin in numbers because most of them are dead.  However, they set a great example. They worked for very little and many were on duty for 24 hours a day.  There were no squad cars then; they had to patrol the length and breadth of the country on foot.  I salute them by saying they made a good job of it.  We must ask ourselves whether the techniques of a modern police force have improved the situation.  I do not think so.  Because the crime rate is so bad the gardaí should be back on the streets in pairs or in groups and there must be no place described as a no go area for members of the Garda.</P>
    <P>People should know members of the Garda and, more importantly, the gardaí should know them.  How many of us would be able to name the gardaí in our own stations?  There is a great gap between the police force and the community. The founder members of the force were everywhere.  They knew everybody and participated in community activities.  With the introduction of the Noxious Weeds Act and the School Attendance Act they were dealing with almost every member of the community. There were daily dealings in every shop and they were a part of our lives.  What has caused the great separation between the Garda and the people, a separation which has contributed to robberies and beatings?  Old people live in fear, cars are being stolen, burned and broken up.</P>
    <P>Rape has become very common.  It is not safe for young girls to be out alone at night.  God be with the days when any <Col N="1197" /> girl could walk home from a dance at any hour unaccompanied.  Those days are now only a memory.  Long ago doors were not locked in rural areas; indeed, the key was often left in the door day and night.  But people cannot do that today. This was characteristic of life in rural Ireland and it has changed to this extraordinary extent.  There is a huge increase in the incidence of burglaries.  In this respect I welcome the inclusion of a provision for a full investigation and examination in relation to stolen property found in the possession of a person other than the thief.  Perhaps this kind of crime would not be so prevalent if there was not a market for the stolen goods, if people were not prepared to buy and sell at a profit goods they know to have been stolen. Undoubtedly, the root cause of this whole situation is the ignoring of the Seventh Commandment.  It is as if there were no such commandment.  The thieves will say that it is for others or that because the people from whom they steal have so much they will not miss what is stolen, but the Seventh Commandment is as relevant and as binding today as it was when it was given, with the other Commandments, to Moses.</P>
    <P>People have lost their entire sense of values, public, social and moral.  They have lost their sense of value not only in regard to themselves but in regard to society.  I hold the large incidence of breakdown in family life to be responsible for a good deal of the crime that is committed.  Why do we not hear more from men in public life, from both Church and State, about taking what belongs to others?  What are we in public life doing to help restore the social and moral values that meant so much to our people in the past?  But, if we cannot be successful in this respect, we must have laws which will enforce the protection of people's property, laws which will allow our people to live without the interference of the thief or of organised criminals. Therefore, I am glad that the Bill includes a section to deal with the car thief.  Those who are the victims of this type of crime endure a great deal of distress and inconvenience.  That is why we are justified in including in our legislation <Col N="1198" /> a provision to ensure that the car thief is dealt with as harshly as is the person convicted of drunken driving &mdash; in other words, that the car thief will not be dealt with merely by way of a fine or suspended sentence but by way of a long term of imprisonment.  To steal a car belonging to a man who is dependent on that car for transport to and from his work is to attack that man's entire family.  Anyone who goes to the expense of buying a car is entitled to have the use of it.  We must do everything possible to ensure that car thieving is eliminated.  If we fail in this regard we may expect the situation to become worse by the month.</P>
    <P>To enable them to enforce the proposed changes in the law the Garda will need every help and co-operation.  We need to have gardaí on foot patrol day and night.  In addition, every Garda station in rural Ireland should remain open all through the night.  In the past it was common in rural Ireland in the dead of night to see the gardaí walking for miles out into the country.  There were patrols by gardaí on foot in every town and village. My advice to the Minister is to realise that mistakes have been made in closing some country Garda stations. These should be reopened.  Also, the gardaí should be put on foot patrol in the towns, using the cars only in emergencies. Garda manpower should be organised in such a way as to provide for a Garda station being manned at all times. Very often we see notices at Garda stations in rural Ireland indicating that the stations are closed.  This should not happen. If we are to bring about a situation in which respect for the law and respect for the property of others is to be restored and if we are to ensure the safeguarding of the lives of our citizens we must embark on new conditions and circumstances.</P>
    <P>I am not saying the Garda force of today have not the standard of dedication of the Garda force of yesterday. Everything has changed.  With the years there has been a decline in the presence of gardaí in many parts of rural Ireland. I have suggested previously what I suggest now to the Minister for Justice, that <Col N="1199" /> the Garda force be divided into two parts. City crime needs city methods and city organisation, while rural Ireland crime needs the organisation to cope with the circumstances and the conditions in rural Ireland.  The Garda force should be divided into a metropolitan division for Dublin Cork, and Limerick with its own commissioner and specialised people to deal with city crime.  That metropolitan force should be completely separate from the force dealing with rural Ireland.  A Garda officer who is sent from the heart of Dublin or the city of Cork to rural Ireland finds himself in completely new surroundings where everything is different from what he has known, and this refers not only to the people but to customs and conditions and even the type of criminal with whom he has to deal.  Many years ago we had a metropolitan police force and why they were ever disbanded I cannot say.  Perhaps it was for economic reasons.  We should have a metropolitan police force to deal with Dublin, Cork and Limerick cities and this force should have its own commissioner, chief superintendents and sergeants, and the Garda force dealing with the remainder of Ireland should also have its own commissioner, chief superintendents, superintendents and so on to deal with the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>Serious steps should be taken by the Commissioner.  Let me say in relation to the Commissioner of the Garda, a man of wide experience, one of the most outstanding police officers in Europe, who has had experience in the police force all the way up&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister for Justice should consider, if we cannot ask the Commissioner to do so, the question of the division of the force into metropolitan and rural sections.  In addition steps should be taken to ensure the restoration of foot duty to gardaí in rural Ireland, and also sub-districts should be smaller.  As the Garda force are now organised the sub-districts are too great and wide and numbers of young gardaí do not know the people in their sub-districts. That was not the case with the founder members of the force.  They knew everyone in their sub-districts.  I have told the House how that was the case.  Speak to any of the older gardaí about any farmer, big or small, that garda had dealings with him in connection with the noxious weeds Act.  That garda knew every member of the large families in his area by name because he was dealing with school attendance.  He knew everyone in the area who had a dog and <Col N="1201" /> whether that dog was licensed.  These things cannot be said today.  The gap between the individual garda and the community is too great.  A few moments ago I asked how many Deputies could stand up and read out the names of the gardaí in their local stations.  Very few could do so.  The contact is lost and you can have that contact only by walking around the streets and going into the houses and shops.  You can never make the contact by a salute from a car.  If you are to solve the problem of crime you must have the full support of the community behind you in order to do so. Closer co-operation between the public and the Garda should be sponsored and fostered by the Minister for Justice, if not the Commissioner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope that with the passage of this Bill steps will be taken to deal fully with other aspects in relation to criminals, crime, law and order.  There are many problems with which the Garda cannot cope.  Are we blaming them for too much?  Are we blaming them for unsolved crime?  We should not do so because they do not seem to be gaining the co-operation that they deserve from the people.  Why do we not use the Army to a greater extent to help the Garda?  We are told that in many areas the number of gardaí is insufficient. We see the Army help the Garda on the transfer of moneys from banks, and what is wrong in having the Army there?  In many areas on traffic duty the military police, excellent men, well disciplined, well trained, show great courtesy to the public.  Why do we not use the Army more frequently?  If we want to deal with unemployment and the security of the State there is no reason why we do not take 10,000 more people into our Army and 5,000 into the FCA.  The FCA should be used, in co-operation with local gardaí, in the detection of crime.  In this connection, there seems to be a gap in the co-operation of the Army and the Garda Síochána.  Both bodies are there basically for the same purpose, namely, to safeguard the State, to protect lives and property and to ensure that people can lead their lives without hindrance from thieves, thugs and organised criminals. The Army is there to help the Garda <Col N="1202" /> Síochána in any emergency and in Ireland we have an Army that is well geared to help in that way.  The majority of the members of the force have a rural background and there is no reason why there should not be closer co-operation with the Garda Síochána than has been the practice in the past.</P>
    <P>There should be some form of regulations setting out a genuine code of conduct for members of the Garda Síochána. In my opinion they should not have business interests of any kind and they should work full-time in the discharge of their duties.  They are the upholders of the law and the protectors of the people.  I am not happy with regard to the strength of the plain clothes police force and I am on record as saying that.  In my opinion their number should be increased and they should always be armed.</P>
    <P>The matter of special training is most important.  In this connection, I was most impressed with the methods of training and techniques used in the Federal Republic of Germany.  The people there are trained in the detection and prevention of crime.  I have been in the police headquarters in the Federal Republic and I was impressed beyond words with what I saw and heard.  Are we falling down on our training in the prevention and detection of crime?  These matters are more important than convictions and the Minister for Justice would be well advised to address himself to this aspect.  If we can prevent crimes from being committed the question of conviction will not arise.  I am sure something can be done in this area. There is a vast difference between prevention and detection of crime in the cities and in the remote parts of rural Ireland.  That is why I say this matter must be handled by smaller sub-districts and with more gardaí on the beat.</P>
    <P>In the training of gardaí we must use up-to-date methods in the prevention and investigation of crime.  We need to keep gardaí on the streets and I often wonder if their length of training is sufficient.  Are the training establishments adequate to turn out fully-trained young gardaí who will be well trained in all aspects of investigation and the detection of crime?  I should not like to live in this country if <Col N="1203" /> the Garda Síochána did not exist.  None of us would be allowed to exist.  We have a duty to ensure that they get the public respect to which they are entitled.  They safeguard our lives and our property and they are entitled to support and co-operation. How many men in public life are silent on this point?  Many stand up and complain about robberies, rape, about people being hit on the head with iron bars, about housebreaking and car stealing but we seldom speak of the necessity to turn out well-trained people to deal with such crimes and, more important, their prevention.</P>
    <P>The Garda Drug Squad are doing an excellent job because the personnel in charge have been trained.  They know their job and they have produced results. I am rather disappointed that the Dáil has not dealt with a short Bill giving customs officers the same powers as those given to the Garda Síochána in dealing with the awful problem of drugs.  Bills can be passed quickly when it suits the House.  There is a grave problem in relation to drug-trafficking and a short Bill should be introduced giving customs officers at ports the same authority as the Garda.</P>
    <P>Proper machinery should be set up to deal with complaints against gardaí.  We are all human and none of us is perfect. We try to do our best.  Every flock has its black sheep and perhaps every family has a skeleton in the cupboard.  Now that the Minister is carrying out a review, I hope that the matter of a complaints procedure will be properly dealt with.  Many members of the public feel that we have not the right procedures to investigate these complaints.  As a Dáil Deputy I have always been slow to entertain complaints against members of the Garda but we must let the citizen see that if he has a complaint it will be thoroughly investigated in an impartial manner.  There must be no doubt in the public mind about receiving fair treatment.</P>
    <P>A complaint by a citizen against a member of the Garda should not be investigated by the Garda Síochána themselves.  Our district justices have been of the highest integrity and one of <Col N="1204" /> them should be assigned to deal with complaints of this kind.  It must be clear to the person making the complaint that the investigating authority is independent and it is best not to have such complaints investigated by members of the force at any level.  The services of a district justice would be far preferable.</P>
    <P>The Garda must be a very disciplined force.  Discipline is everything.  I was surprised some time ago when listening to a radio programme to hear that when a Garda superintendent arrived on an official visit to a Garda station in the west he greeted the gardaí by saying &ldquo;How'ya lads&rdquo; and the reply was &ldquo;You're very welcome.  We're glad to see you, John&rdquo;. Older members of the force would not allow themselves to be addressed in that fashion.  The day discipline goes from a disciplined force, the main purpose for which the force was set up goes.  Long ago when a superintendent arrived at a barracks every man would be brought to attention and the superintendent would inspect the crime and offence book to see whether it was written up.  I do not know if there is such a book kept in the barracks now &mdash; I presume there is.  If the book was not written up to the previous day, serious disciplinary action would be taken.  Is discipline breaking down in every aspect of Irish society today?  I hope there was no truth in the expressions used in the radio programme because if that type of familiarity exists between ordinary gardaí and their superiors I do not know how complaints by members of the public could be investigated.  If there is not discipline within a force the crime and offence book and the other records may not be well kept because of the personal relationship existing between the ordinary gardaí and those in authority.  I hope that is not the case and that when a superintendent or chief superintendent goes into a station he receives the respect to which he is entitled.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the matter of private security firms, something which the Minister may feel obliged to investigate during the passage of this Bill.  The duty of the Garda is to protect life and property. There have been numerous bank robberies in recent years and some of <Col N="1205" /> these cases have been solved.  There should be registration and licensing of private security firms in the interest both of the public and of the prevention of crime.  Indeed a special section of the Department should be charged with such registration and licensing and the recruitment of the necessary personnel so that there would be some liaison with regard to supervision of private security firms.  I would appeal to the Minister and his Department to consider seriously all aspects of this problem.  I have always felt that, as far as possible, banks should be capable of providing and paying for their own security and I am sure the Minister has had lengthy discussions with the banking authorities in this respect from time to time.  We must give them our support and co-operation but the ordinary citizen is entitled to have his or her home, furnishings &mdash; even items such as glass, chandeliers and the like &mdash; life savings and so on, protected.  I trust these matters will be given full consideration in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>In the event of greater detection and, therefore, conviction of criminals I might ask the Minister where he intends placing such convicted criminals because certainly our prisons at present cannot possibly accommodate them.  Many of them are out of date and in dire need of modernisation.  Even if it were proposed to imprison such people what measures are being taken for their rehabilitation or education whilst in prison?  Such matters are important also because it should be remembered that, to sentence somebody to imprisonment for a year or two, particularly somebody of a reasonably young age, may well tend to destroy his life for the next 30 or 40 years.  Perhaps rather than a prison sentence we should compel a defendant, once found guilty &mdash; though I do not mean guilty of a major crime &mdash; to work for the community.  In the case of the drunken driver sent to jail, that will be punishment enough in itself.  Some steps should be taken to rehabilitate him. I have great sympathy with the wives and families of such people, who suffer a lot. For that reason I had been hoping that some time in the near future we might test the system of prisoners being permitted <Col N="1206" /> to perform certain work in a locality for which they would be paid so that their wives and children would not suffer as they do at present.  That cannot be beyond the bounds of possibility.</P>
    <P>There remain in this country quite a number of unsolved murders.  I had been hoping also that steps would have been taken to ensure a greater degree of public co-operation in the resolution of such very serious crimes.  If a person is sentenced to life imprisonment it should mean just that, because murder is a most serious crime.  I do not think a person could be guilty of any greater crime than to take away human life, to deprive a family of a father, mother, son or daughter. I want to express appreciation of the number of district justices who make people work for petty crimes.  In their case it would be advisable that they work under supervision and, if they did not perform or respond satisfactorily, then the same district justice could review their position at the next court sitting.</P>
    <P>We notice that under the provisions of the Bill the Garda are being empowered to detain a person they have arrested, without warrant, on suspicion, with reasonable cause of having committed and offence punishable by a term of imprisonment of five years and that such detention will be for a period not exceeding six hours, that this may be extended for a further period not exceeding six hours on the authority of a chief superintendent who, if absent, will be replaced by a superintendent acting for him.  This matter has been the subject of quite an amount of criticism.  But it should be remembered that generally speaking the Garda are responsible people.  Once a person is arrested on suspicion, and with reasonable cause, I do not think any Member of this House would have any serious objection &mdash; since the Garda are charged with solving crime &mdash; to their taking in suspects and questioning them. That provision presents me with no problems anyhow.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that a suspect may demand the presence of a solicitor during questioning.  I cannot understand why so many people have fears in relation to this because I cannot think of anything fairer <Col N="1207" /> than to have a solicitor notified without delay who will be present during the course of any questioning of a suspect. Solicitors in Ireland are extremely conscientious, dedicated to the defence of the rights of their clients.  Therefore, there is no danger that a suspect would have anything to fear from the Garda if he avails of the right to have his solicitor present.  That is a real safeguard against an accused person being the victim of hardship at the hands of the Garda.</P>
    <P>The Bill provides that detained persons may be searched, photographed and fingerprinted, and there is provision for the destruction of such photographs and fingerprints in the case of non-prosecution. What could be fairer?  Indeed, in the effort to solve crimes it may be necessary to have photographs and fingerprints for identification purpose.  Fingerprints may be found on an object and for that reason it is necessary to have the fingerprints of suspects because no two sets of fingerprints are identical.  Searching of suspects should be a normal practice and it should be also usual to ask a suspect to account for his movements at a certain time.</P>
    <P>The Minister is empowered to make regulations for the tape-recording of the questioning of persons in Garda custody. I urge on the Minister to restrict the use of tape-recorders as far as possible.  I suggest that it would be preferable to have a shorthand record of what has been said, in the presence of a witness.  I agree it may be necessary to have tape-recordings on certain occasions and to have these played back in court, but I suggest it should not be resorted to frequently.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see strict provisions in the Bill in the case of offences committed while persons are on bail.  There is no doubt that there should be strict penalties for people who apply for and get bail after sympathetic consideration by courts and then go out and commit other crimes. I am also pleased that the penalties for firearms offences are being increased. Such penalties have been next to nothing heretofore and this inclusion in the Bill meets with my complete approval.  I am particularly pleased with the provision for majority jury verdicts in criminal <Col N="1208" /> trials.  I have always thought it should be sufficient to obtain a simple majority verdict in such cases.</P>
    <P>There is a provision for the Minister for Defence to apply for permission in relation to courts-martial.  I will not dwell on this because we are not dealing with it now.  However, I think it is time we dealt with all matters in relation to trials of Army personnel and military matters in general.  When I was Minister for Defence it crossed my mind, but I was not long enough there to do anything about it.  Had I been there longer I would have had a serious look at the entire question of military law.  I felt very strongly about it at the time.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies referred to sections 16, 17 and 18 which require a person found in possession of property believed to be stolen to give to gardaí on request an account of how he came by the property. I cannot understand the mentality of people who will find objection to that.  It is not only right and proper that if a person has property which is known or believed to be stolen, he should give an account to the authorities of how he came to be in possession of that property.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, many responsible people, legal and otherwise, lay and religious, have qualms of conscience about certain sections of this Bill.  I have read it from start to finish and as far as I can see if a person has not done anything wrong he has nothing to fear; any person who does not wish to protect criminals does not have anything to worry about nor has any person who wishes to see crime stamped out.  This Bill will help to stamp out crime.  It should not be necessary to have the provisions of section 15 written into Irish legislation because if people know or believe property is stolen, they should not conceal from the authorities how that property came into their possession.</P>
    <P>I have read very carefully the correspondence sent to all public representatives by the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and noted the contents, particularly the reference to the Garda force.  I want to praise the paragraph in their letter of 19 November 1983 in which they say good community Garda relations <Col N="1209" /> play a vital role in the task of combating crime.  The Irish Council of Civil Liberties in their letter of 27 October deal very effectively and in great detail with detention without charge, the right to silence and lack of protections.  On page 3 of their letter they deal with the provision for electronic recording of questioning and say this paragraph is phrased in such a way that it does not necessarily require implementation.  They say the provision for the notification of a solicitor goes no further than existing rules and is worded to allow broad discretion to the police as to how quickly or effectively it is carried out.  They say this Bill does not guarantee access to a solicitor or immediate access to a parent in the case of a young person arrested.  I do not know if that is so, because the Bill clearly deals with questioning and sending for a solicitor and having a solicitor present.  I am sure on Committee Stage we can tease out these problems.  These written representations from interested organisations have been a great help to all.</P>
    <P>Everybody should realise, and we should place it on record, that the police not only in this country but in every country, play a vital role.  They are frequently called on to tackle dangerous situations. Every member of a police force is a man of great courage.  In recent years a number of them, regretfully, have lost their lives doing their duty.  Their duty is made yet more difficult if their rules of conduct are not precisely defined.  I hope the Minister and the Garda Commissioner will get together and let the public know what the rules of conduct are in relation to police activity.  This can and should be done.</P>
    <P>The system for the protection of human rights should be improved.  Every Member of this House must ensure that the human rights of our citizens are recognised and that no citizen should be deprived of his liberty or of his rights. There are generally accepted rules concerning the professional ethics of the police which take into account the principles of human rights and fundamental freedoms.  Fundamental freedoms and human rights are very relevant to every <Col N="1210" /> free citizen.  As a democracy we must protect the freedom of our citizens.</P>
    <P>Police officers should have the active, moral and physical support of the community they are serving because unless they have this support they will be at a loss, and I hope that will not be so.  Police officers should enjoy a proper status in the community.  They should enjoy the same rights as every other citizen in the community.  Police officers must fulfil the duties imposed on them, particularly the duty to protect citizens against violence. In the course of training the men should be inculcated with a sense of dignity, of impartiality and of integrity.  At all times it should be impressed on them that they must act with dignity and courtesy in the discharge of their duties.  I am sure a code of conduct exists.  I am sure it is laid down that no police officer shall carry out any order he knows to be unlawful or contrary to the laws of the land.  Police officers should be fully cognisant of the code in regard to international human rights, particularly the European code on human rights.  Police officers are the custodians of law and order.  They are the protectors of the rights of citizens.  When one thinks of it one appreciates what an important function police officers have.</P>
    <P>I would hope that guidelines for members of the Garda Síochána would be published so that we might familiarise ourselves with them.  If a police officer is aware of a violation of the law he must take immediate remedial action to the best of his ability.  A police officer must at all times resist acts which are not in accordance with a dignified approach.  On the whole gardaí have behaved in a most dignified manner at all times and we all hope this will continue to be the pattern. One thing that is vitally essential is that the Garda be given the full co-operation of the public generally.  We depend on our gardaí and, depending on them as we do, it is incumbent on each and every one of us to give the Garda our full support.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are in a state of crisis. Lawlessness has got out of hand.  If a disease is serious then the remedy in treating that disease must be equally serious.  To my way of thinking, there is <Col N="1211" /> nothing in this Bill in any degree harmful to those prepared to keep the law.  Our society is not alone breaking down, it has actually broken down and there is an obligation on all of us to restore it as quickly as possible.  This Bill, when enacted, should contribute towards that ambition.  I hope to be present for Committee Stage to discuss proposed amendments to tidy up the Bill, amendments designed to give the necessary powers to the authorities to stamp out violence. Violence breeds an end to democracy.  It means an end to Parliament.  We have a solemn duty to preserve our democracy.</P>
    <P>I have read this Bill very carefully and to my way of thinking it does not go far enough.  The disease of lawlessness is eating into our society.  I trust the provisions of this Bill will act as some deterrent to those tempted to commit crime.  There is need for some overhaul in the courts and the speeding up of decisions.  There is a need to review our prisons.  At the moment they leave something to be desired.  Those who administer our prisons deserve great credit in my opinion. They are highly efficient.  They are men of great integrity.  They are devoted to their work.  Above all, they are interested in those with whom they come in contact and are anxious to rehabilitate them so that they can return to society and take their proper places there.  I know a large number of prison officers and I have a high regard for them.  I trust this Bill will be just one of many Bills designed to rehabilitate the criminal and based not only on conviction but on prevention.  To me, prevention and detection of crime are far more important than conviction for crime.  Many criminals today are the sons and daughters of people who never thought they would have to face such difficulty.</P>
    <P>Social and economic conditions and political rights have close connections with the question of violence, lawlessness and crime in general.  I hope this is the first of a number of Bills which will put Irish society back on the rails and reconstruct and help Irish society.  I am afraid this Bill is too little too late.  While Parliament is here, let us do something to <Col N="1212" /> maintain our rights as the supreme authority.  We must have the laws to protect, safeguard and defend our citizens against crime of any kind.  All crime is serious.  All crime leads to lawlessness. Lawlessness leads to disrespect for authority and eventually to disrespect for Parliament and the complete breakdown of democracy.</P>
    <P>We will have other opportunities to deal with matters of this kind in this House.  I welcome the Bill.  I am glad it is getting such universal support in the House.  To those outside the House I say there is nothing in the Bill to be afraid of if they abide by the law and avoid crime. If they shun violence there is nothing in this Bill to be afraid of.  We have reached the stage where action must be taken. We must support the police authorities. We must support the Garda in their very difficult task of saving life and property. We must respect their dignity.  We must enact the laws to enable them to carry out their duties with honour and with dignity, and full and due regard for the human rights of every citizen.</P>

      <P>Some time ago I intended to intervene briefly on this Bill. As, obviously, it does not come within my area of responsibility as a Front Bench spokesman, I should like to make two introductory comments.  I first listened to Deputy Flanagan for a very considerable time.  He raised some fundamental issues on which I will touch.  Secondly, I hope we will be able to clear the smog around the House which I hope has not been generated by anything said.  If we can dissipate the physical smog conditions as soon as possible &mdash; and it is extraordinary to see this kind of atmosphere in the House &mdash; we will add to the comfort and health of Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before this Bill was published there was a universal sense of concern on the part of the public at large that we needed to correct the balance between the law makers and the law breakers.  There was concern that the weaker members of society, the old and people living alone, should be protected against criminals. Many of us were visibly shocked during the course of the Dublin Central by-election <Col N="1213" /> campaign when we were introduced to conditions with which perhaps we are not very familiar in our normal experience.  We found that old people living alone did not wish to answer the door after 6 o'clock in the evening.  They peeped out to inquire who was at the door.  This was visible evidence of the fear which permeates our society.  This has developed in recent years.  Innocuous, innocent and inoffensive people are afraid in their own homes.  No stable society can tolerate that.</P>
    <P>It is our obligation as legislators to create conditions where that kind of fear will not be the order of the day, and where crime which gives rise to that kind of fear is eradicated.  Those were the conditions in which this Bill was introduced and, for that reason, understandably and properly this party gave their support in principle to the Bill when introduced, and that remains the position.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with some of the issues of principle in the Bill I should like to make some preliminary comments. Whatever we do or require the Garda or the courts to do, we are dealing after the event with the symptoms of a certain malaise in our society.  We must recognise that we have seen a decline in standards over the past five to ten years in particular. Some of this may be due to the lack of a central thrust or direction in every aspect of Irish life for which we in this House, among others, must acknowledge our responsibility.</P>
    <P>If there is a growth of unemployment in deprived areas there are two ways of looking at it.  We can look at the reactions and the frustrations of young people in a deprived environment and say: &ldquo;We will deal with the problem by way of penalties and punishment.&rdquo;  On the other hand, until we create the conditions in which people will respect the norms of society, even extra powers, no matter how effectively applied will not restore the standards we have inherited.  We should not get a disproportionate impression of what a Bill of this kind can do to bring about the kind of stability and respect about which Deputy Flanagan talked for a very considerable time.  I do not want to go back over that ground.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> The real wealth of our community life does not exist only in rural Ireland.  It is a real characteristic of the inner parts of this city &mdash; the street culture, the place where a person was born and belongs, the things we talk about in song and story. This has been undermined.  It is not enough for those of us who live in more comfortable middle-class circumstances to notice suddenly that we have a problem of urban vandalism &mdash; a problem we identify as urban vandalism when it breaks out of what we might have regarded as the ghettoes where it belongs.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago did anybody talk about vandalism when perhaps it was happening constantly in deprived areas?  We are talking about it now because it has broken out and is hitting comfortable suburbia to a considerable extent.  Many of us &mdash; and particularly those working in the social areas &mdash; are conscious of the deprivation which exists inside those areas.  We have to adjust our standards and recognise that our economic, social and educational policies must have a central thrust which everybody can acknowledge and respect.  Everything we say and do here must have a central thrust which everybody can acknowledge and respect.</P>
    <P>People may laugh at Eamon de Valera's notion years ago.  Many people who might laugh at that notion would also like to think we could say that kind of thing with relevance today without being accused of being total hypocrites.  It was a time when you could say those things and people respected the fact that they were said, even if the ideal was not achieved immediately.  Whatever we ask the Garda to do, whatever powers we give them here only deal with the symptoms. As the old Irish proverb has it &ldquo;Is i scath a chéile a mhaireann daoine&rdquo;&mdash; we all live in each other's shadow.  If some of us show little concern for those who are deprived, we will have to live with the consequences.  That is why we cannot look at policies in any one area.  I am not going to go into a Finance Bill type debate &mdash; I will deal with that in another time and place &mdash; in terms of strict fiscal policies and not have regard for the consequences on the social environment and <Col N="1215" /> for people who are unemployed at present or who will be unemployed in the future.  If people, especially young people, think that we do not care they will not care either, and that is the problem to which we must address ourselves.</P>
    <P>Problems obviously arise where communities have broken down and where people live in housing sprawls where there is no community spirit or purpose. It is often said that until the second or third generation is established you will not have a secure, stable community.  We have seen evidence of this, I am glad to say, in Ballyfermot which is now very different from what it was 20 years ago, because we have the grannies, the first and second generations and a community cohesion which is an example to many of us who live in rural Ireland.  Housing planners cannot uproot people from where they belong and put them into a cold, detached environment which does not reflect their upbringing.  If we are not to get a reaction we must look at our housing programmes and plan for an environment in which people can feel at home and have good, normal contact with their neighbours.  A home is not just a place where you cook, eat and sleep; it is where you relate to people who live near you and build a community together.  Most of our problems arise from inadequate housing conditions.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána are the guardians of the peace.  It is a terrible reflection that there are people who have undermined the stability of the State parading themselves as the protectors of the people against drug pushers, etc.  If the Garda are not able or equipped to go into an area to deal with the growing threat of drugs particularly, we could have a situation where others will take it on themselves to go in an administer their form of punishment and authority.  In this instance the media have a great responsibility. If they glorify that sort of thing, even in a way which may presume to give the facts, the impact which that can have could be devastating.  I am not in a position to know whether all the facts are disclosed in programmes.  I saw only the end of a programme, so my judgment <Col N="1216" /> could be distorted, but others who saw it were very concerned that we seem to be dependent on people who have undermined our society to restore, on their terms, stability in parts of our city.  If we have got to that stage we are treading a minefield.  We must ensure that there are no double standards in relation to this and that no one is beholden to people like that.  We must also ensure that our police have the confidence, authority and the kind of contact with the public to which Deputy Flanagan referred.  It may mean a certain re-organisation of the training of the police force so that they will be accepted as the protectors of the public.  It is a bad day when people offer themselves as political candidates in elections and that their main claim to fame is that they control a place.  We should all be very concerned about their kind of control.</P>
    <P>The Garda Síochána deserve our trust and respect, but to ensure that we must see that the conditions under which they operate and the powers given to them are subject to the scrutiny of the courts, whose role is as important as ours.  That has been part of the order of society for as long as one wishes to remember.  The three arms of our Constitution are the Legislature, the Executive and the Judiciary. We are being tested today with regard to the property tax.  I say &ldquo;we&rdquo;, although I opposed it.  That is the way the Judiciary should operate.  We will be tested if we infringe certain powers.  A citizen will be penalised if he does certain things and, equally, the arms of the law cannot operate in isolation or independently of the protection of the courts &mdash; in their interests as much as in the interests of the citizen.</P>
    <P>I have some comments to offer in relation to some of the developments in this Bill on which the Minister and officials in the Department would do well to reflect. I am speaking as a member of the legal profession but also as a citizen.  I am appalled that a Bill as important and far reaching as this was introduced without any consultation with the legal profession, representatives of the Benchers of the King's Inn or the Incorporated Law Society.  Is it assumed that the professions <Col N="1217" /> who are in many ways looked on as officers of the courts have nothing relevant to say?  Is it assumed that their accumulations of legal knowledge and experience is not to be listened to?  Is it assumed that lawyers are always there simply to act against the establishment? If so, they are dangerous assumptions. As a consequence of not consulting lawyers, we have groups representing lawyers &mdash; and it must be a matter of concern to them &mdash; going public on radio and television and saying that they have reasons for concern.  Suddenly the support there was for the legislation all along is not as universal as it was because people believe that there may be some grounds for apprehension.</P>
    <P>I should like to point to one or two matters that should have been dealt with before the Bill was introduced.  Would it not have been much better to have had a situation in which the professional representatives would be in a position to say that they had consultations on the measures, that while they may have some reservations about it, by and large they agree with the thrust of the Bill because there has been omitted from it some of the proposals about which they expressed reservation?</P>
    <P>The Minister should not rely merely on the advice of the Garda or of his officials. I have represented the Garda in the past and I have a high respect for them, but the Minister should have sought advice on a wider basis.  Because the Minister failed to do that there may now be an implication that will not be helpful to the Garda, that is, that much of the power being introduced is very questionable.  It would be much better for the Garda if that were not the case and that individuals who over-step themselves would be seen to be subject to the scrutiny of the courts.</P>
    <P>We are being told by way of this other explanatory memorandum that until a complaints procedure involving assessment by an independent tribunal has been established some of the provisions of the Bill will not come into effect.  That kind of suggestion is a consequence of the lack of awareness in the Department of Justice of what is the function of the <Col N="1218" /> Judiciary.  The very notion of bringing a complaints procedure into this implies that we expect complaints to arise.  Perhaps they will, but if we wish to ensure the protection of the citizen why do we need an administrative procedure of this kind when under our Constitution we have the courts?  Many of the rules under which the courts operate are being changed by this Bill.  In some areas we are telling the courts to move aside.  This will not help the Garda.  Is this complaints tribunal to be another administrative growth without our having a proper definition of what its role is?  Certainly the tribunal will not have a constitutional function.  If we are to have checks and balances in relation to the introduction of this Bill, they should be the checks and balances that have been applied for many years by the courts and not an administrative tribunal, which, incidentally, may or may not be introduced by an administrative order.  Does that mean that the tribunal may be established on the advice of officials or of the Garda?  I have much respect for both groups, but they are not the only ones concerned in this matter. Are we not to have the opportunity of debating the question in the House?</P>
    <P>One of my main reservations relates to section 3, which proposes to change much of the established rules of the criminal law procedure that we have been operating for a long time.  We are introducing the concept of detention for the purpose of investigation or interrogation.  That is a concept unknown in our law and one that has been firmly rejected by our courts.  I could quote any of a variety of legal authorities to underline that but I shall quote only the Chief Justice, as reported in the 1980 <i>Irish Reports</i>.  He was quoting the precedent that had been followed down through the years and he said that it had been stated many times in our courts that there is no such procedure permitted by law as holding for questioning or detaining on any pretext except pursuant to a court order or for the purpose of charging and bringing the persons detained before a court.  He said that any other purpose is unknown to the law and constitutes a flagrant and unwarranted <Col N="1219" /> interference with the liberty of the citizen.</P>
    <P>If the legal professional representatives had been consulted I wonder whether that kind of power would be introduced here.  It is a power that exists in the Offences Against the State Act and under the Emergency Powers legislation, but both of these measures are exceptional in that they allow for a period of detention and questioning of people suspected of involvement in subversive crime.  We might as well know now that what we are doing here, without the checks of court intervention, is introducing the same kind of provisions.  This is a very big change.  I would have thought that before introducing a change of that kind into the ordinary law of the land we would have had much more detailed consultation. The guarantee that the court may protect the citizen is a protection for the Garda also; but if as a consequence of section 3 we are to deny the protection afforded the citizen under the present law whereby he must be charged on arrest and brought before an impartial court as soon as is reasonably practicable, we are doing a bad day's work.  The basic requirement of the law of arrest is that it must be subject to speedy, judicial scrutiny. If that is to be weakened, no administrative complaints procedure will replace what we are taking away.  I trust that the Minister and his advisers will give serious consideration to that aspect in the interest not only of the ordinary citizen but of the Garda so as to ensure that they will not leave themselves open to charges which in respect of perhaps up to 99 per cent of the force would not be fair or warranted.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan kept returning to the need to improve the rate of detection. The figures from the Commissioner will show that that is where the gap has been down through the years.  The evidence has been that once people are brought before court, the rate of conviction is very much more satisfactory than is the rate of detection.  Therefore, our aim must be to improve the effectiveness of the Garda in detecting crime.  I support <Col N="1220" /> Deputy Flanagan in what he has to say on this matter.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that, for instance, one in nine of those detained under section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act is charged subsequently with an offence.  I am not saying that is right or wrong but if the proportion we are going to find under this Bill in respect of normal citizens is that one in nine of those detained for questioning will be charged with an offence, we will have something to answer for.  The normal citizen brought into a police station is in a very alien environment.  Such people have gone through the process of lengthy questioning which may be extended in this Bill.  If many people suffer the traumatic experience of being detained for questioning where they never had any place at all and where there is no reason for them to be, we must have some query. I would like the Minister to reflect on this and perhaps deal with it later.  If eight out of nine are brought in and not charged then it is a matter of concern.  Some of them might be told that they can take a rest for a period, but in what circumstances? Many gardaí are working under conditions which are not what they should be.  A person whose normal place is his own home &mdash; as distinct from the hardened criminal who will not care about this, he is used to it, it is easy and may be comfortable for him &mdash; without being in any way involved who is told he can rest for eight hours in a police station will not find very much rest there with doors banging, people being brought in during the night for questioning, drunks and so on.  We ignore the impact that will have. The benefit of the advice that the Minister might have got had he consulted more widely would have been helpful to him in bringing in this Bill.</P>
    <P>In this connection the O'Briain Committee said that questioning within the confines of a Garda station can be a traumatic experience for all but the hardened criminal.  For people to appear in civil cases in court in the presence of such as us public representatives is a traumatic experience for them but questioning in a Garda station for a normal citizen must be traumatic no matter how reasonable, <Col N="1221" /> well-behaved or courteous the officer may be.  The text that I have been talking about should be looked into very carefully because all of this generally has been subjected to judicial review.  There is no point in saying &mdash; as Deputy Flanagan seems to be satisfied and I have no intention of undermining the Garda, I want to see them respected and strengthened as due officers of the law &mdash; that a person can get his solicitor.  If it is night and the solicitor's office is closed, what do you tell the person then?  He is entitled to call a friend.  He does not know his legal rights.</P>
    <P>The imbalance between the person questioned &mdash; we must always think of the innocent person &mdash; and the person questioning is there also.  It may well be that the person being questioned will remain silent.  In relation to the question of silence, I support the view that certainly it may be mentioned to the court, but we should be clear that the court would not be asked to put aside the Judges' Rules which have always been there to protect a person who has not made a statement.  I would like to refer to them in some detail.  If we are putting all these aside we are entering a very dangerous area.  The Judges' Rules have been established for years.  One of them states that under the present law a person questioned is under no obligation to answer and he cannot be charged with obstructing a police officer if he refuses to answer.  Under the new regulation there is a writ that this will be abolished in so far as under section 16 an adverse inference may be drawn if the person questioned remains silent.  The law is changed further by the provisions of section 14 and 15 in so far as failure or refusal to give information may expose the person questioned to the sanction of imprisonment.  This is changing a fundamental rule which has been there for a long time.  Another of the Judges' Rules provides that when a police officer has made up his mind to charge a person with a crime he should administer a caution before he questions him.  That has been there for generations and the substance and form of this caution will not be continued under this Bill.  The third rule says <Col N="1222" /> that a person in custody should not be questioned without a caution.  It seems that under section 14 and the core of section 16 of the Bill the inference is from the failure of the accused to mention certain facts.  This seems to run counter to the Judges' Rules.  I would like the Minister's assurance on this.</P>
    <P>I am anxious that we in this House before we pass certain things into law will know what we are changing and why.  I would like the Minister in replying to this Bill to say if he is abolishing the Judges' Rules that have been there for generations and, if so, why he is doing so and why he thinks the Judges' Rules are not appropriate protection for the citizen or for the custodians of the law, namely the Garda Síochána in our case, to guarantee that they operate within a proper judicial framework.</P>
    <P>A terrible anomaly in this is the immunity conferred and the consequences that can arise from this immunity.  Section 15 (2) provides that:</P>
    <P>If that person fails or refuses, without reasonable excuse, to give such account or gives information that he knows to be false or misleading, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £800 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both,</P>
    <P>This is for failure to do these things.  OK, we are creating an offence.  At least it is clear, it is specific and it creates an offence. It is very new and we should not do it too easily.  I would like to have it scrutinised having regard to what I have said in relation to the Judges' Rules.</P>
    <P>I find it extraordinary that section 15 (4) provides:</P>
    <P>Any information given by a person in compliance with a requirement under subsection (1) shall not be admissible in evidence against that person or his spouse in any proceedings, civil or criminal, other than proceedings for an offence under subsection (2).</P>
    <P>It shall not be admissible against him in any other area.  I think I know the intention <Col N="1223" /> here, but we must look at what can happen in practice.  That means, in effect, that he is being granted in respect of that evidence an immunity against prosecution, except the prosecution for failure to talk.  In respect of other matters in which he might have been involved he is granted immunity in respect of that evidence. This Bill states clearly that it cannot be introduced as evidence against him. Surely if we are trying to strengthen the powers of the Garda we must look at that.  Introducing evidence as to fact or another person rather than remaining silent surely is an invitation or a risk of an invitation to an accomplice to involve somebody else who might be innocent.</P>
    <P>If a person is hauled into a Garda station is the option given to him that if he stays silent he will be liable to an offence but if he tells the Garda about a fact or a person he will be given immunity?  Is there not a risk that the hardened criminal who wants to escape the consequences of his own actions may decide to sing sweetly in regard to someone who has no opportunity at that point of correcting what has been said about him?  As far as I know &mdash; I should like to have this checked &mdash; the Director of Public Prosecutions is the only person who may decide whether immunity is conferred. If, as a consequence of this Bill, a Garda officer in the course of questioning can confer immunity in respect of other offences, we must realise there are grave risks attached to this.  We have all been concerned about the whole business of the supergrass and what has happened in the North of Ireland.  We must take a close look at a provision like this because the end result may be quite opposite to what was intended.  We are taking a grave risk if immunity will be conferred on people who decide to give evidence, people who may be accomplices in the matter of crime.  There are many rules of procedure in criminal law that oblige a judge to remind people that there is a grave risk in considering conviction in the case of the uncorroborated evidence of an accomplice.  I know that is the last thing the officials who advise the Minister would want to happen, and the same <Col N="1224" /> applies to the Garda Síochána.  If, because of lack of consultation with people who know about the checks and balances of the system, we introduce such a provision there is a grave risk that it will achieve the opposite effect we intended to achieve.</P>
    <P>It may be said that judges live in a privileged section of society.  I accept that there are individual judges who should be more consistent.  A person may remain silent for a variety of reasons, and one such reason is fear.  In the case of the person who does not know his legal situation, his natural reaction will be to say nothing and if that is sufficient to draw an inference we are on very delicate ground.  To be questioned in a Garda station may also cause a reaction.  If a person is confused, even though he may be entirely innocent his reaction may be to say nothing.  Some people may make a rational decision to say nothing and others may decide to remain silent until they know what exactly is their situation. However, the hardened criminal will not be too concerned about this.  We will have an opportunity on Committee Stage to discuss this aspect more thoroughly, but I take the opportunity to mention the matter now in the presence of the Minister of State.  A person may wish to reserve his right to speak until he is in a position to put his defence before the court with full legal advice.</P>
    <P>I support totally the role of the Judiciary and this has been clear in what I have said.  However, they have a function to operate in a way that is not totally out of line with the rest of society, the legislators and the Government.  Some examples recently have caused serious concern. There should be consistency in sentencing.  Only the judge in court, aware of all the circumstances, can come to the appropriate conclusion.  Those of us who read newspaper reports of cases are not in a position to decide what sentence should be imposed.  However, there have been such discrepancies recently that it is a matter of obligation on the Judiciary to consult among themselves in order to ensure consistency in their sentencing policy.  The Judiciary are independent of us but there is need for <Col N="1225" /> consultation among themselves.  It is a point that must be stressed but, when said, it does not need to be repeated.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in cases and have often introduced witnesses to give evidence of good character.  Who is more guilty, the young man or woman from a deprived environment where he or she has been introduced to crime from the very beginning or the young person from a secure environment, with all the privileges of education, stability and security in their home?  In the case of the person from the privileged environment, it will be said that he comes from a good background, that his family are respectable and that he has not been involved in crime before that point.  This character evidence will be introduced in his favour. However, the poor orphan from the deprived environment does not have anybody to say he is respectable and deserves a second chance.  It is our duty to say loud and clear that the really guilty person is the one with all the privileges. He has repudiated his obligation to society and has made a deliberate decision. The person who needs assistance is the one born deprived and disadvantaged and we have to help such a person in terms of bringing about the necessary social and economic changes.</P>
    <P>We support the Bill.  We want to be seen to support the custodians of the law, the Garda Síochána.  There is no trouble in giving them extra powers but they should be subject to established judicial scrutiny because this will protect them as much as it will protect the citizens.  I hope this will be provided for in the Bill so that the Garda Síochána will, in the end, come out stronger than they have been prior to the introduction of this Bill.</P>

      <P>That, in view of its importance to the national forestry programme and to the saw mill industry and its employment implications for the nation, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to implement the development plan for Chipboard Products Ltd., Scarriff, already prepared by the company and meanwhile, to ensure that the commercial operation of the company is no longer prevented.</P>
      <P>The decision taken after consultations between the Bank of Ireland, the Minister and the Government that a receiver be appointed to Chipboard Products Limited, Scarriff, will go down in history as one of the most treacherous acts of desertion in relation to our own raw material resources and our people that has ever been perpetrated by an Irish Government.  It will rank as one of the most short-sighted, retrograde and irresponsible decisions ever taken by an Irish administration.  The Government have sold out on Scarriff and on the people of east Clare.  They have turned their backs on the timber industry and abandoned the hopes and ambitions of hundreds of people who saw their future in the development of Irish forestry resources and products.  It may put a temporary end to Chipboard Limited in Scarriff but it will not be forgotten in County Clare and elsewhere that a Government in such a callous, uncaring and deliberate way, in the name of financial rectitude, left a ghost in Scarriff which will haunt the timber industry for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Marine Port and General Workers <Col N="1227" /> Union issued a statement on the matter on 24 November as follows:</P>
    <P>On behalf of the executive committee of the Marine Port and General Workers Union we wish to state publicly our utter condemnation and rejection of the action of the Government in removing its financial support from the only chipboard factory in the State, thereby jeopardising the livelihood of almost 200 members of the union with its inevitable effect on their families and indeed on the whole community at Scarriff and the surrounding district. This callous and unfeeling decision is all the more incomprehensible when it is realised that in recent months due to the efforts of the reconstituted management and particularly due to the responsible attitude of the workers in accepting a lengthy pay pause and minimal wage increases the factory has achieved a substantial increase in productivity and viability.  Even more incomprehensible to us is the fact that such a decision should be made by a Government which is composed by members of the Labour Party who by their very constitution one would expect to firmly reject and oppose a policy based on cold expediency at the expense of the dignity and human rights of the workers.  This union will never cease to fight with every means in their power to safeguard the rights of their members in Scarriff and it calls on every member of the trade union movement to give them their unqualified support in achieving this aim.</P>
    <P>Those words of Séamus Redmond, the general secretary of the union, describe in a fitting way the anger, frustration and annoyance not only of the workers in Scarriff but of people throughout County Clare.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to understand the reasoning behind this incredible decision.  The scant statement of six or seven sentences issued by the Government Information Services is poor compensation for the many people employed in the industry in Scarriff and the surrounding forests.  It is <Col N="1228" /> poor compensation for the effort, endeavour and financial commitment made by workers, management and others in the area to ensure that with Government assistance the company would be established. It is apparent to anyone that the Government did not consider the matter fully.  It is equally obvious that the decision to cut off support was taken in the context of the Estimates.  We must ask the Government to reconsider and look again at the Forestry Estimate and ask whether the small saving of about £600,000 which will ensue as a result of this decision justifies the misery, hardship, frustration and anger which will be caused for so many people, as well as the knock-on effect in the region and throughout the saw milling industry.</P>
    <P>Almost 50 per cent of the timber which goes to a sawmill is disposed of by way of waste or residue.  An outlet must be available in order to make viable the operations of both large and small sawmills.  In Mountshannon there is a small sawmill employing 25 people where the income from waste disposal through chipboard is valued at about £100,000 a year.  The loss of that income to this small industry will put at risk the jobs of those working there and cause financial problems for the company. This affects not only the Mountshannon plant but a series of plants who were supplying their residues to Chipboard Limited.  These sawmills are scattered not only throughout County Clare at Mountshannon and Kilrush but as far away as Bunclody, Longford, Mullingar, Banagher, Mountrath, Tuam, Woodford, Loughrea and Ballinrobe.  Already concern has been voiced by the sawmillers' association who recognise that there is no longer an outlet for their waste.</P>
    <P>If the necessary equipment is to be installed in those plants, the de-barking machinery which is essential, investments of £100,000 will have to be made in each plant.  Such investment will be necessary if those plants are to be made viable. Since the closure of the Scarriff factory there has been a knock-on effect throughout the saw-milling industry which will send other concerns rushing to the IDA, and other agencies, seeking financial aid to instal the machinery which is essential <Col N="1229" /> if those concerns are to have any outlet for their waste material.</P>
    <P>It is likely that in the event of that machinery being installed the high quality chip which will then be available will be exported by the companies concerned because there is not, and will not be, an outlet for it.  That material will be manufactured into chipboard abroad and imported by us at a cost of between £20 million and £30 million.  Does any Member know of anything so daft or outrageous?</P>
    <P>I should like to give some of the history of the Scarriff factory, why it was established by Fianna Fáil, why it was considered desirable to support it and why it is essential that the chipboard industry is supported in the future.  The Forest and Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the IDA, have consistently followed a policy of orderly development of the wood processing and wood using industry bearing in mind the availability of supplies and resources.  Since the fifties a series of forecasts have been circulated indicating, nationally and regionally, the returns which will be available by way of timber resources in future years.  It has been estimated that timber output will double in this decade and increase by four times in the nineties.  It is expected that we will reach a total timber output of 3 million cubic metres by the year 2,000.  Those forecasts are available for inspection.</P>
    <P>A factor which emerged in the late seventies was that the growth rate of forests planted in the late fifties was significantly higher than earlier forecasts indicated. A policy decision had been arrived at that by reducing the age of clear felling in rotation in the bulk of forest crops there would be a remarkable increase in the timber resources which would become available, particularly for the saw-log industry.  While it was expected that substantial amounts of saw-log and pulp wood would become available those two factors meant that there would be a significant increase in the availability of pulp wood in this decade and in the nineties. In the light of those changing circumstances the Forestry Division, and the IDA, embarked on an intensive study to identify the measures required to use the <Col N="1230" /> available resources to the maximum capacity so that the return to the economy by way of finance and job opportunities could be maximised.  The study on developing the Irish timber industry for the eighties, carried out in consultation with the Forest and Wildlife Service was published by the IDA in July 1981 and it was on the basis of that study that the plans to develop the chipboard industry in Scarriff were undertaken.</P>
    <P>The development plans for Scarriff were undertaken on the detailed forecasts and information contained in the 1981 study.  That report indicated the projections for future output from State plantations, the best method of exploiting them in terms of financial return and job potential.  It has been estimated that up to £400 million has been invested in the last 50 years by far-sighted planners and politicians who recognised the need to buy and plant land so that we would have sufficient raw material to meet the ever-increasing demand for wood and wood products.  It is an indication of confidence and commitment that successive Fianna Fáil Governments, and other Governments, had in the timber industry that this investment was undertaken.  The forest development plan was carefully executed and it is a scandal that the work carried on in those years is being replaced by cowardice and defeatism by the Government who have knocked at every opportunity any proposals to develop our own resources.  The Government are running away from the challenge identified in the IDA study and are not prepared to make the necessary financial commitment so that we can exploit the investments made by successive Governments in the last 50 years.</P>
    <P>There were certain problems in the saw-milling industry and they were identified in the late seventies.  Many of the factories had serious problems.  The IDA, in co-operation with Fóir Teoranta, commissioned A.D. Little of London in the late seventies to study the board and chipboard industries, to look at all aspects such as production facilities, operating costs, markets, product quality, financial viability, competitiveness and advise on future development and <Col N="1231" /> the formulation of strategy.  A detailed study was carried out of the Scarriff plant. The IDA report on the study of the internationally recognised consultants, A. D. Little, stated:</P>
    <P>As a result of these studies A. D. Little concluded that: Particleboard was an eminently suitable product for manufacture in Ireland.  Chipboard Limited Scarriff had the plant and product range to form the nucleus of a healthy Irish particleboard industry. New investment would be required.  A strong new parent company would bring definite benefits.</P>
    <P>The London consultants also examined a plant similar to the Scarriff concern, Munster Chipboard.  The various proposals put forward were examined including one to run the two plants together in order to cut down expenses.  Those plans fell through.  However, it was recognised that the Scarriff plant had the product range and their manpower levels seemed adequate.  The marketing strategy was also adequate.  The financial performance was examined and comparisons were made in relation to the manufacture of chipboard and distribution costs of companies in the UK, Sweden, Finland, Austria, and Germany.  Not alone did they examine the whole structure of the industries at that time, management, manpower levels and so on, but they also examined the availability of timber and concluded that the plant did have the potential of a sound chipboard industry. It was on that basis alone &mdash; at the time when Chipboard were in financial difficulties &mdash; recognising the potential of Scarriff, recognising its importance from the point of view of forestry development, the Government decided to invest in Scarriff, to form a partnership with local communities there.  They so decided in the best interests not alone of the timber industry but in the whole development of afforestation in the future that they should embark upon a project in Chipboard Products Limited in Scarriff. That was the reasoning behind and the background to the establishment of the chipboard factory at Scarriff.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1232" /> The Minister seems to base strongly part of his argument for his decision not to support the chipboard industry on the recommendations of another consultancy undertaken at a later stage.  I think the Minister will agree with me that the study later undertaken &mdash; and which now forms the basis for his argument that Scarriff is not a viable proposition &mdash; examined Scarriff on the basis of whether it was a commercially viable operation and on no other basis whatsoever.  For example, such study did not take into account the problems which arose through lack of outlets for forestry products, the importance of having an outlet for forestry thinnings, the social impact of the closure of a plant such as that at Scarriff, with its repercussions throughout the entire region, of east Clare in particular and its effect on saw-mills there.</P>
    <P>I deplore in the strongest possible way here this evening the selected leakage of passages from that document, done deliberately by somebody, to undermine the efforts being made and at present engaged in by the action committee at Scarriff to find an alternative solution to the problem obtaining there.  The most damaging sections of that report, which should be the direct responsibility of the Minister for Forestry, were leaked by a journalist in a Sunday newspaper.  I challenge the Minister to state clearly in this debate from what section of his Department that information was supplied, how it came to be available to a newspaper journalist and why it was that selective and damaging statements only were taken from it and published rather than the whole report which the journalist claimed to have in his possession.  It was obvious that the report was leaked with the intention of effecting the maximum amount of damage to any prospect of a reopening of the Scarriff plant.  I want the Minister to explain now to the House how that report came into the hands of a newspaper journalist and why it was that those damaging sections only were published.  It is obvious that they were selectively given in order to do maximum damage to the plant.</P>
    <P>I want to revert to the establishment of the chipboard factory, to get the facts <Col N="1233" /> right behind the reasoning for its establishment. When the company went into receivership in 1980 efforts were made to attract overseas investors and developers who might be interested in taking over the plant.  A number of groups visited the plant at that time.  But, as is now known, there were enormous problems being encountered in the industry not alone here but throughout Europe generally. There was the problem of reduced demand, over capacity in the industry, reduced profitability and other problems affecting the European scene as well. Mergers were taking place, sawmills were going out of business, new technology and restructuring were on the way.  At that time it was not possible to attract new investment from abroad.  Recognising that it was not possible to attract new investment from abroad the Government rightly at that time set up this company with the support, help, assistance and indeed the financial backing of some local people.  It is important to note here that many people in Scarriff, within the community itself &mdash; small shopkeepers and so on &mdash; and indeed many of the work force employed at that time &mdash; invested their money and savings.  They did so knowing that they were going into a venture 64 per cent Government-owned.  Many people would not have invested at that time were it not for the fact that they understood they were going into a company which was 64 per cent Government-owned and in which there was some security for them.  They were prepared to place the whole of their life savings in this venture at a time when there were difficulties being encountered in the timber industry generally, mainly because they recognised the need to maintain the plant there, that they were secure in their investment in the knowledge that the Government was with them in support of that project.  They are now being shamefully treated by the Government, who pull the plug, leaving them high and dry without any prospect of any return on their investment in the company since its formation.</P>
    <P>I want to speak for a few moments about the importance of the thinning operation.  If there is to be properly <Col N="1234" /> developed afforestation here it is vital that we have constructive and forward planning in regard to the thinnings programme. Equally it is recognised that there will be created major forestry problems unless such thinnings process is proceeded with.  This is especially important here because so many of our plantations are young and in need of the thinning process if afforestation is to be developed to its maximum potential.  I do not disagree with the Minister when he contends that the national forestry programme permits some flexibility of the thinnings programme.  When replying to the Private Notice Question I had down here on the eve of the closure of the plant the Minister did not seem to be unduly perturbed about the fact that the thinnings process would not be undertaken, or that it might be delayed or postponed.  I feel the Minister is under-estimating its importance.  He must be aware that failure to thin our forests over a protracted period will have a detrimental effect on the whole of the timber industry.</P>
    <P>Now that this Government have closed the Scarriff plant there is the grave possibility that the whole of our forestry development will be damaged by the delaying of the thinnings process, or of the failure to thin adequately.  Are we to see a reversion to the days when Irish timber was exported £1 a ton from Water-ford and other ports with all the scandal and annoyance that fact created, with all the confusion there was then nationally throughout the industry?  Then we had questions here day after day as to why it was, at a time when we were importing timber to the tune of £400 million to £500 million a year, which we could successfully grow at home, we were exporting ours at £1 a ton to be processed abroad, thereby creating jobs abroad.  Yet timber was being imported here at enormous cost to this State, with people recognising that this was a lunatic policy being pursued. If we are to revert to that kind of situation I do not share the complacency of the Minister in regard to the thinning process.  If for this one reason alone, in order to provide an outlet for forestry thinnings and ensure the properly planned development of afforestation the <Col N="1235" /> expenditure involved in keeping the Scarriff plant open for our thinnings is justified. But they have been slowed down for various reasons, above all, because of cutbacks being effected in the Minister's Department.  This thinnings process must be undertaken more rapidly, particularly because there is not now any outlet for them.  By being kept open Scarriff would provide such outlet.  For this reason the expenditure about which we talk would be justified.</P>
    <P>It was also anticipated that when the plant was planned for Clonmel, when the Medford Corporation came there, that the western European market for the medium-density board which they would produce there, when in full operation, would increase substantially to something like 1 million cubic metres by 1985.</P>
    <P>Can anyone say if the markets for medite have expanded to that extent?  Is it not a fact that the markets throughout Europe are suffering from the special effects of the recession and that the planned output to meet the anticipated need for medite products otherwise would be enormous and would take up to 400,000 cubic feet of timber for a year's supply?  Will that type of development take place?  Is it not a fact that already similar plants have been established throughout Europe to cater for the anticipated demand there, and that it is likely the output from medite would not be to the extent anticipated?  It had been anticipated that 400,000 cubic feet of timber would be required per year to supply the demands for medite.  Is it not likely this will be needed in the future?</P>
    <P>We must bear in mind that when medite was planned there were pulpwood outputs in Munster, Clondalkin, Scarriff and Athy which were using in the region of 250,000 cubic feet of timber every year and that when the decision was made to support medite an assurance was given that the operation in Clonmel would not affect the wood supply that would be available to the existing plants?  It must now be questioned whether there is need not only for one but for two chipboard plants here, thus processing the amount of pulpwood available, thus creating significant <Col N="1236" /> job opportunities if we were to use the residue available from small sawmills throughout the country and thus producing the financial turnover available.</P>
    <P>I will deal briefly with the financial position in the Scarriff plant.  It would be fair to say that the claims and counterclaims of the past few days have genuinely confused people about the real situation in regard to CPL.  One thing is undeniable, that the financial injection which was part of the plan for the Scarriff plant was never made.  The energy saving machinery, the investment needed to improve quality, the other essential plant equipment necessary in order to make the plant profitable and to enable the business to secure the markets that were available were not provided.  The financial investment which was part of the original recommendation for the establishment of the plant was never made. There were reasons for that.</P>
    <P>The company were established in 1981. As a young company they experienced financial difficulties at the outset and were endeavouring to tighten up their managerial structure and their work force in other areas in order to make their chances of viability greater and the undertaking more economic.  The workers made a determined effort to help, through working substantially longer hours and by working harder. However, they were left without financial resources and could not themselves raise the money needed to buy the machinery which they wanted.  Over a year attempts were made by the Government to find people to build up the company with them, who would strengthen their marketing strategy, who would reinforce their technology and find new financial support for them.  Various attempts were made to bring in international companies involved in similar operations &mdash; a joint venture operation to realise the potential of the Scarriff plant.</P>
    <P>After some discussion with them the Minister decided that he could not see any further benefit in continuing the discussions and, after talks with the bank he decided to appoint a receiver and close the plant.  I find it strange now that the <Col N="1237" /> Minister can say to us that he is looking at the possibility of getting some alternative foreign investment to restructure the plant and establish a viable chipboard industry in Ireland.  In the circumstances, how can the Minister expect any international company to come in to build up a chipboard industry when the Government, a 64 per cent owner in the industry, opt out?  In these circumstances can anyone expect an international company to come here to establish a chipboard industry when the Government opt out?  Is it not strange to find an Irish Government calling for help from firms in Germany or Spain when they do not have the courage or the initiative or the commitment to do something themselves?</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the board of management of this company and in particular to the chairman, Ambrose McInerney, who deserves our gratitude. His commitment to Scarriff has never failed: he stood by Scarriff no matter how difficult the circumstances were.  He acted honourably and courageously.  The other board members put their energy and efforts into CPL in the national interest at a time when they could have been engaged more profitably in other directions. We owe them a great debt of gratitude.</P>
    <P>In making their announcement through the GIS, the Government showed indecent haste and it was an indication of the way in which the Government have been treating many Irish businesses.  It showed their lack of interest in getting Irish business to invest in Irish companies and to build up Irish industry so that we can utilise our own resources.  If this is the way they will continue to operate I can see little hope of getting anyone to support Irish industry in the future.</P>
    <P>Finally, I appeal to Fine Gael Deputies from my constituency who will be voting on this issue tomorrow night to realise that they cannot sit on the fence any longer in regard to this matter.  They cannot sign resolutions calling for special meetings of the county council to discuss the issue and at the same time refuse to vote with us on this motion.  I ask the Government to reconsider their foolishness <Col N="1238" /> and to support the Scarriff industry, to re-open the chipboard plant, to provide the timber for it, put back the electricity and the telephones and to get the plant into production to provide jobs and a financial return to our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann urges the Government to support the development of a viable chipboard industry.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>My amendment is much more positive in that I am seeking to ensure that the scarce financial and physical resources of the State are used only on identifiably viable projects.  The Opposition Deputies are calling on the Government to support a mill which has a track record of losses amounting to over £3.5 million over the last seven years and which has no chance of viability unless it receives massive and continuing State assistance in the years ahead.  I would have preferred not to have brought the unhappy details of this mill's performance before the House but the motion put down by Deputies on the Opposition benches has left me no option.  I would have hoped that Deputies might have seen that the interests of CPL would be best served by allowing the receiver to proceed with his job.  A receiver always prefers to dispose of a company as a going concern.  Unfortunately, by opening the company's affairs in this public forum I fear that the Opposition Deputies may only be hindering the receiver and thus putting the jobs of the work force in CPL in greater jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this point some background information on the pulpwood processing industries in Ireland would be useful.  The seventies and eighties have not been a happy period for the Irish pulpwood processing industry.  The 1974 recession had a serious impact on the western European timber industry in general and on the pulpwood processing industries in particular.  The recession was particularly <Col N="1239" /> severe on the older, smaller scale pulpwood industries.  These plants, lacking new technology and economies of scale, found it very difficult to compete in over-supplied markets.</P>
    <P>In the seventies there were four pulpwood using industries in Ireland: two produced chipboard, one made hardboard and one produced thermo-mechanical pulp.  By 1980 three of these four pulpwood using industries had closed.  The only surviving mill was Chipboard Limited, Scarriff, and it too ended up in receivership in 1980.  As far back as 1977 the company had experienced severe financial problems and Fóir Teoranta, which were owed £1.5 million, put in an executive to run the company.  Efforts were made by the IDA and the receiver to find someone to take over the plant. A number of groups expressed some interest and visited Scarriff to assess the situation.  For various reasons it did not prove possible to secure a take-over by any of them.  Eventually, in 1981 &mdash; no doubt in the shadow of a general election &mdash; the Government of the day approved a unusually generous rescue package negotiated with private interest in order to maintain the jobs and the production of particleboard at Scarriff.  This involved the State providing 92½ per cent of the funding in return for a 64 per cent stake in a new private company &mdash; Chipboard Products Limited.</P>
    <P>The following is a summary of the financial arrangements for the establishment of CPL in May 1981: £1 &lsquo;A&rsquo; ordinary shares held by Mr. A. McInerney and local interests, £193,000; £1 &lsquo;B&rsquo; ordinary shares held by Minister for Finance, £334,000; £115 per cent cumulative preference shares held by Minister for Finance, £200,000; debenture loan provided by Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, £466,000; bank loan guaranteed by Minister for Finance, £400,000; private loan, £57,000; bank overdraft facility secured by assignment of debtors, £350,000.  In addition the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry agreed to provide capital equipment grants of £1.012 million over a three year period on terms similar to those for IDA grants.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1240" /> The Minister also entered into a timber supply agreement with the company for a three year period.  This provided for the supply of (a) up to 64,000 cubic metres of pulpwood-size timber to the company in the first year and payment of £7 per cubic metre towards its harvesting costs, and (b) up to 85,000 cubic metres of pulpwood in each of the second and third years.  The rate of payment was subject to review at the end of year one but has remained at £7 per cubic metre.  The company are allowed to remove the timber free of charge.  No other firm in the timber trade has ever got such a favourable deal.</P>
    <P>I must point out that already £3.3 million has been provided by the State to the company in the form of shares and direct loan, £1 million; grant assistance, £200,000; free timber and harvesting subvention £1 million; loan guarantees which have to be honoured by the State, £1 million; total £3.3 million.  Against this level of State aid the private sector has only put in £254,000 &mdash; 7½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Some Opposition Deputies may be in a better position than I am to illuminate the House on the background to the establishment of CPL in 1981.  It seems most strange to me that the IDA refused to become involved in this rescue package and that it was left to the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to arrange the restructuring.  For my part, I can deal only with the situation as I found it since taking up office.  In order to protect the taxpayers' interest in the company, I have had its performance monitored carefully. While it may be idle at this stage to speculate why the 1981 package did not achieve the desired effect, I have been most concerned to ensure that the proposals for further State assistance were critically examined.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the company showed unhealthy signs from early on and was the subject of several memoranda to the Government over the past two-and-a-half years.  In June 1982, within a year of its setting up, CPL sought additional State investment and the then Government decided: (i) that a consultancy report on the company should be commissioned; and (ii) that working capital <Col N="1241" /> of £200,000 should be sought for the company by way of bank loan, subject to State guarantee, if necessary.</P>
    <P>The additional working capital of £200,000 was obtained from the company's bankers and a leading firm of accountants was appointed to carry out a consultancy study.  The consultants reported at the end of August 1982 and the report can be summarised as follows.</P>
    <P>First, on the basis of the company's own projections, which the consultants consider to be optimistic: (a) CPL can continue as a going concern over the next three years only if it receives State aid of at least £4.2 million &mdash; in the form of equipment grants, £1.4 million, a timber harvesting subsidy, £2.5 million and free timber £0.3 million &mdash; and also a State guarantee of bank borrowing rising to £2.6 million by the end of 1985; (b) continued substantial annual assistance from the State will be required after 1985, particularly if the present imbalance between the level of inflation in Ireland compared to competitor countries continues.</P>
    <P>Second, a technical agency, namely Fahrni Engineering AG of Zurich, employed by the consultants to assess CPL's capital expenditure proposals are highly critical of the poor standards of existing plant maintenance, waste of raw materials and damage to finished stock. They also highlight the risk of serious fire or explosion.  The report stated that as failure to eliminate this hazard could lead to loss of life, with consequential embarrassment to the Government, this matter had been taken up with CPL and it was understood that remedial measures were in train.</P>
    <P>My predecessor is on record as being most concerned at the findings and on the matter of risk to life and property he immediately sought a report from the local fire service authority.  He also reported to the Government on the general findings of the consultants' report.</P>
    <P>The Government, having considered the consultants' report, decided in November 1982, to underwrite additional working capital of £0.5 million for CPL while negotiations took place with prospective clients interested in a take-over <Col N="1242" /> of the company.  A German chipboard manufacturer had expressed an interest in CPL but would not participate without a strong Irish partner.  After much difficulty the Germans' advisers &mdash; The Investment Bank of Ireland &mdash; located an interested partner.  While preliminary negotiations with the group were under way a Spanish chipboard manufacturer also expressed an interest in CPL and were invited to enter negotiations.  Both the German and Spanish were requested to submit proposals for the purchase of the State's shareholding in CPL and it was not until October 1983 that discussions with both interested parties were concluded.</P>
    <P>The level of State assistance sought by the German-led consortium was totally disproportionate to the benefits that might be derived.  Apart from the State's ability or otherwise to even contemplate the magnitude of the assistance sought the Germans' raw material requirements far exceeded what was envisaged for a plant located at Scarriff.  CPL's existing usage of pulpwood is 60,000 cubic metres approximately per annum.  The Forest and Wildlife Service have guaranteed to supply 85,000 cubic metres per annum to CPL.  The German-led group proposed a plant using 160,000 cubic metres per annum to be supplied within a very short distance.  In view of the Forest and Wildlife Service commitments to existing pulpwood users the level of supply sought by the Germans could not be guaranteed. The group advised that they saw &ldquo;no future in pursuing discussions with a view to taking over the Scarriff company and establishing a virtually new plant at that location&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Spanish proposal likewise involved substantial State assistance. Funding of a capital and non-capital nature in fact exceeded that sought by the German group.  Moreover, their raw material requirements were similar to the Germans'.  The package presented by the Spaniards was, therefore, deemed unacceptable.</P>
    <P>In passing, I would like to refer to an eleventh hour approach which was made by the Irish Timber Council (ITC) &mdash; which represents the sawmilling industry <Col N="1243" />&mdash; indicating the possibility of an interest on the part of its members in an involvement in CPL.  It emerged from discussions that the ITC was not in a position to provide any financial investment in a restructuring of CPL.  Its primary interest was to seek limited participation, with the State, as a shareholder in CPL to secure a continuing outlet for some small part of sawmill residues: in that situation the ITC would have to be prepared to offer such residues to CPL at a preferential price.</P>
    <P>Against the possibility that negotiations with both the Germans and Spaniards breaking down, I asked CPL to submit the company's own proposals. These were received and explored in detail with the company and given a thorough evaluation.  The total amount of State assistance sought would involve the provision by the Exchequer of about £3.5 million to the company in 1984; thereafter, further State assistance of the order of £3 million including the continuation of a timber harvesting subvention and the continued supply of free timber would be required.</P>
    <P>The Government, after serious consideration, decided that this level of further assistance to CPL was entirely disproportionate to the benefits likely to accrue.  The £6 to £7 million, which the company's proposals would have cost the State, must be judged in the light of the <Col N="1244" /> assistance which the State has already provided to CPL.</P>
    <P>Let me repeat.  Since 1981 the State has provided funds by way of ordinary and preference share capital, loans and guaranteed borrowings, capital grants, timber harvesting subsidies and free timber, amounting in all to some total £3 million.</P>
    <P>Despite the level of State assistance the company has accumulated losses of £887,000 since May 1981.  If we take the free timber and harvesting subsidy into account then the losses can be said to be of the order of £1.9 million.</P>
    <P>The following is a breakdown of the company's losses over the past three years: May-December 1981, £256,000; January-December 1982, £292,000; January-October 1983, £339,000; total, £887,000.</P>
    <P>The question of profitability over the past five months has been raised.  Let me say categorically that on the basis of the latest information provided to me by the company itself the record shows that £9,000 was lost in the last five months.  In the comparable period of 1982 the company showed losses of £21,000.  A minor reduction in losses, which could be attributable to a small adjustment arising within any accounting period, is not evidence of a turnaround.</P>
    <P>The pattern of profit and loss in recent months against the comparable periods in 1982 is as follows:</P>

    <P>These data do not suggest any real turnaround in the company's trading position in recent months.  It should be borne in mind that from month to month <Col N="1245" /> there are always adjustments in accounts. Therefore, no particular inference can be taken from minor changes in the results shown in monthly management accounts. It is patently obvious that the company's recent results are following the same pattern as those of 1982.  I never heard mention of profits of £1,000 a day until after the receiver had been appointed and I have no evidence to support it.</P>
    <P>CPL is in arrears with its payments to the Revenue Commissioners and has been using approximately £600,000 of money deducted from the employees' pay for tax and PRSI and in amounts due for VAT.</P>
    <P>I would remind the House that the present mill in Scarriff is the very same one that was managed by a previous receiver between April 1980-April 1981. During that year its trading loss was over £400,000 plus free timber and harvesting subsidy.  That first receivership followed several previous years of loss making as follows: 1979, £300,000; 1978, £400,000; 1977, £1,100,000.</P>
    <P>That receivership followed a consultant's report on the chipboard industry in Ireland which led the IDA and Fóir Teoranta to refuse to put in more money into a mill for which they could see no viable future.  In short this mill has been a consistent loss maker and a drain on public funds for nearly a decade.  In the light of such a history can the State be reasonably expected to pour in another £6 to £7 million?</P>
    <P>With CPL fast approaching yet another cash crisis the company's bank was seeking intimation of the Government's intentions on the provision of further funding for the company from public funds.  In view of this and with the company itself pressing for a decision on its proposals the position was considered in the greatest detail by the Government.</P>
    <P>On 15 November 1983 the Government decided that, without prejudice to existing agreements, no additional State assistance would be provided for CPL. On 17 November 1983 I informed the board of CPL of the Government's decision not to provide additional State assistance to the company.  I further informed <Col N="1246" /> the board that the inevitable consequence of this decision would likely result in the appointment of a receiver by the Bank of Ireland.  On 18 November 1983 Mr. William M. McCann of Craig Gardner and Co. was appointed by the Bank of Ireland as receiver and manager to CPL.</P>
    <P>On 22 November 1983 I received a deputation on behalf of CPL who requested, <i>inter alia,</i> that I would agree to fund the receiver until a solution to CPL's problems could be found.  I informed the deputation that a request for a meeting had been received from the receiver.  Until this meeting took place I could not respond to the deputation's request.</P>
    <P>A meeting between Departmental officials and the receiver took place on 22 November 1983.  The receiver sought <i>inter alia,</i> an unconditional guarantee of funds from the State to allow him to continue production and employment at CPL.  The receiver estimated that he would require £188,000 per week and an immediate sum of £97,000 to pay the ESB.  I raised the receiver's request at a Government meeting on 22 November 1983 and the Government decided that the terms of the receiver's proposals should not be accepted.  On 23 November 1983 I met the chairman, chief executive and a director of CPL and informed them that the Government's decision not to provide additional State assistance still stood and furthermore that the Government was not prepared to fund the receiver.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of the implementation of CPL's Capital Programme and the question of the dust-burner.  Of the total of £1.012 million allocated by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to CPL in the original restructuring of May 1981, only £200,000 was taken up by the company.  This was due to the cash flow problems and difficulties in relation to commercial credit facilities which the company encountered in 1981 and 1982.  In undertaking the expenditure against which the Department of Fisheries and Forestry provided £200,000 CPL required and obtained an <Col N="1247" /> unusual degree of flexibility in the administration of the grant agreement from my Department.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made to the company's need for a dust-burner which would use timber waste rather than oil as a fuel.  The original development plan for CPL included provision for a dust-burner-cum-dryer which was valued in 1981 at over £1 million.  CPL was unable to generate the resources to purchase this, even against a grant commitment of 60 per cent from my Department.  It would appear that the company was not then aware that the dust-burner could be purchased separately from the dryer for about £100,000.  It could in fact have purchased the dust-burner in May 1981 following the provision in cash by the Exchequer of £1 million of start-up finance.  However, it seems that the company did not become aware of the existence of the dust-burner, as a separate purchasable item of equipment, until June 1983.  Thereafter funds for the purchase of this item of equipment were sought from my Department in the form of a 100 per cent grant.  Given that negotiations were in train with two separate foreign interests in respect of participation in CPL and that CPL itself was preparing a comprehensive development programme of its own, it would have been quite unwise at that stage to allow CPL to proceed with the acquisition of the dust-burner on the basis of a 100 per cent grant.</P>
    <P>I would like to comment on the supply of pulpwood to CPL from State forests concerning which a lot of play has been made in recent weeks.  Let me now set the record straight on this issue.  The timber supply arrangement entered into between CPL and the Forest and Wildlife Service in 1981 provided for the supply of up to 90 per cent of the company puplwood requirements free of charge. In addition, the Forest and Wildlife Service gave the company a contribution of £7 per cubic metre towards the cost of harvesting this pulpwood.  The agreement was for a three-year period from May 1981 and the company was guaranteed <Col N="1248" /> a total free supply of 235,000 cubic metres in that period.</P>
    <P>In the current year of the agreement the company had on offer from the Forest and Wildlife Service 106,000 cubic metres from which to select its requirements. The agreement only requires a guarantee to provide 85,000 cubic metres of timber in the current year.  May I repeat &mdash; free of charge.  In any one year to date the company has at best only managed to take-up about 50,000 cubic metres.  Much publicity has been made of the distance which CPL had to travel for its free timber. Let me spell out the facts.  Since May 1983, that is, the current operational year of the timber supply agreement, the company has the following on offer: Within 0-10 miles radius of Scarriff, 12,000m³; within 10-20 miles radius of Scarriff, 43,000m³; within 20-30 miles radius of Scarriff, 11,000m³; within 30-40 miles radius of Scarriff, 9,000m³; within 40-50 miles radius of Scarriff, 6,000m³; within 50-60 miles radius of Scarriff, 25,000m³. Total, 106,000m³.  It will be noted that 58 per cent or 55,000 cubic metres of what was offered in the current year of the agreement was within 20 miles of Scarriff; 76 per cent or 81,000 cubic metres within 50 miles and the balance outside 50 miles.</P>
    <P>Since January 1983 CPL has removed only 50,000 cubic metres of pulpwood from State forests; 64 per cent or 32,000 cubic metres was offered since January 1983 within 20 miles of Scarriff; 94 per cent or 47,000 cubic metres within 50 miles.  Specific mention has been made of supplies from Mayo and Kerry.  Since 1981 CPL has taken only 1,000 cubic metres from Mayo and Kerry or less than 1 per cent of the total supply taken from State forests since 1981.</P>
    <P>Needless to say the Government are most concerned about the employment in Scarriff and share the concern expressed by Deputies.  The IDA have been fully briefed on the situation and have already sent out inquiries to several chipboard manufacturers with a view to interesting them in taking over the plant. The receiver, I understand, has done likewise.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly told everybody who has come to me about the receivership <Col N="1249" /> that they should put proposals in mind direct to the receiver.  The receiver is the legal holder of the assets of the company and will be only too willing to consider any worthwhile proposal.  I can quote the IDA and say that they too will consider any proposal which can be shown to be viable.</P>
    <P>If the receiver can identify an interest in this mill as a viable project &mdash; at an acceptable cost to the State &mdash; then there can still be a future for this company, but the Government are no longer prepared to underwrite with an open cheque projects which cannot be justified on sound economic criteria.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer briefly to some of the statements made by my predecessor, Deputy Daly.  He used emotive language more fitting to the theatre stage.  I share his concern for the people in his constituency. As a rural Deputy I recognise the social problems which result from this type of closure with no alternative in sight to take up the slack.  The Government are aware of those problems.  Having regard to what I have said, on the basis of the information available to us from independent sources is it reasonable to suggest that the Government should be asked to pursue the line they were pursuing with no light at the end of the tunnel so far as financial assistance is concerned?</P>
    <P>We have pulpwood available to us.  The thinnings must be taken out of the forests. I hope they will be used here, and that we will not revert to the position of exporting thinnings for £1 per tonne.  I hope the receiver will find it possible to dispose of Scarriff as a going concern to sustain employment in the area.  That is my wish for this industry.  There are people there with experience of the timber industry.  I hope Members of the House who have influence in the area will impress on the people who are now precluding the receiver from carrying out his functions that they should desist from that line of action.</P>
    <P>I will be involved in any proposed take-over and in the supply of raw materials. The House can be assured that my Department and I will look sympathetically with any potential manufacturer at the supply situation.  We will not be found <Col N="1250" /> wanting.  If any interest is shown by outsiders or anybody within the State, I will direct them to the place where this facility is needed most, that is, in Scarriff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Tomorrow night at 8.30 p.m. we will have a vote in this House which will ask the House to decide whether it wants this plant kept open and developed or closed down.  Those who vote to have it closed down are those who will support this meaningless amendment which was just moved by the Minister. They need not cod themselves, or their constituents, or the public at large, into thinking it is anything else.  If they vote in support of this meaningless milk and water amendment they are voting to close the plant down.</P>
      <P>I want to address my remarks in particular to the members of the Labour Party who are not thick on the ground here tonight as, indeed, they rarely are when these kind of matters are at hand in the House, or when a State company is being closed down by the action of a Minister, as in this case.  No doubt we will get the Pontius Pilate act again.  They will wash their hands, and their hearts will bleed.  These keepers of the spirit of 1913 will march into the lobby tomorrow night like 16 little pigmy William Martin Murphys to ensure that their masters, the Fine Gael Party, will achieve another of their objectives in closing another company and in taking on a State company particularly, because the fault of the private shareholders who put up £25,000 that was collected in sums of £50 and £100 from the people of Scarriff &mdash; I have a list of their names &mdash; is that they are Irish.  If they were not they might be treated in a somewhat different fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not propose to go into all the facts and figures that the Minister quoted because I regard them as meaningless and his efforts to defend his decision were pathetic.  In the short time at my disposal I should like to go into some of the legal and commercial ethics of what is being done in relation to this company within the past month.  On page 1 of the shareholders' agreement of 13 May 1981, entered into between the private shareholders and the Minister for Fisheries <Col N="1251" /> and Forestry, it says that these presents are entered into for the purpose of regulating certain aspects of their future relationship as shareholders in the company and otherwise and to govern the future conduct of the proposed business and affairs of the company which shall be governed by normal commercial principles and practices.</P>
    <P>I should like to lay some emphasis on the words &ldquo;which shall be governed by normal commercial principles and practices&rdquo;. At 8.15 p.m. on Wednesday, 11 November 1983 the chief executive of this company got a telephone call from the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry telling him to be in Leinster House with his chairman at 11.30 a.m. the following morning as the Minister wanted to talk to him.  He explained that his chairman was abroad, could not be contacted and that he could not have him there at 11.30 a.m. the following morning.  He was told that that did not matter, that he could bring the other private director if he could locate him.  The chief executive turned up at 11.30 a.m. and he was told that the Minister was engaged in talking to three State directors of this company because one of them was also abroad.  At 12 o'clock he was ushered into the Minister, who had three or four civil servants with him, and was told for the first time that the Government were withdrawing support from the factory and that he could presumably expect a receiver to be appointed by a bank shortly.  This came from the same Minister who, only a couple of months beforehand, had assured the chief executive and the other directors of his full support for the company and all that they were going to do.</P>
    <P>Five of the seven directors who were available had an informal chat in the corridor when these two separate sessions were over and they all expressed their anger and opposition to what had happened. They made contact with the other two directors, each of whom individually expressed his great anger.  Here we have a situation of a company of seven directors, four of them appointed by the State for the purpose of looking after its interests and all seven are unanimously <Col N="1252" /> furious at what the Minister has done.  It has been the practice for a number of years in this country that a receiver is not put in by a bank unless the board meet and request a bank to do so.  This was not done in this case.  There was no board meeting and no member of the board was given any indication that anything like this could happen.  Indeed, the discussions between the chief executive and other directors with that bank only a matter of days before this happened led them to believe that the bank were extremely happy at the way things were going.  The bank congratulated them on the great improvement that had been shown and yet the Bank of Ireland, at the behest of the Minister without notice to anybody, appointed a receiver.  The Bank of Ireland were not owed any interest. Interest was paid monthly by the company. The ESB were not owed anything by the company who paid their bill every month and the figure the Minister is talking about is what would have been paid two days later in the normal course of business which they could have done without any difficulty.  Similarly, their oil suppliers who were quoted as being owed a large sum of money were paid every month.  The company did not owe any money, other than in the normal course of business.  They paid their debts every month.</P>
    <P>The amount that is alleged to be due to the Revenue Commissioners for PAYE and VAT is in respect of two months.  What company does not owe VAT and PAYE for two months and how many companies are trading profitably and gaily owing six, nine and 12 months' arrears to the Revenue Commissioners? We all know there are thousands in that position but this company, which owed only two months' PRSI and VAT is picked out and pilloried by the Minister and his advisers as being reprehensible in some way.  In connection with the activities that happened a week or so before the public announcement of the appointment of the receiver, certain things happened which entitle us to express great concern about the ethics of how they came about.</P>
    <P>Some weeks before this, a debenture <Col N="1253" /> was sent to the company by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry for £700,000 for execution by the company. The chief executive informed the Department that, in the normal way, it would be put before the board at their next meeting and nobody objected to that. However, a few days before 9 November and while the chief executive was in England selling chipboard, there were frantic efforts on the part of the Department for Fisheries and Forestry to have this debenture executed by the company. There were telephone calls to the chief executive to come home and sign it.  He was told it was part of the package which had been put up and which was under consideration by the Department.  He was led to believe that if he did not sign the debenture his package, which would otherwise be approved, might well be turned down.  He came back; he did not know very much about signing debentures and thought he could not do it except at a board meeting.  He was told that he and another director should sign it, which they did without consulting the board and without the knowledge and the chairman or any of the other directors.</P>
    <P>Two directors signed the debenture and sealed it other than when they were at a board meeting and I suggest its execution is invalid.  That is borne out by Article 14 of the company which says that the quorum necessary for the transaction of business of the directors shall be one A director and one B director.  The two who were present in this instance were A directors.  They were Mr. Wilmot and Mr. McNamara.  It is very doubtful that that debenture is valid.  In any event it was signed and sent in but we know now why this was done.  It was done after the Minister had made up his mind to pull the plug on this company and to put in a receiver.  It was done so that the Minister for Finance would obtain payment of the moneys he had guaranteed to the Bank of Ireland, so that he would become a secured creditor and that he would be in that position to the detriment of the unsecured creditors and of the other shareholders.  That is a scandal in commercial operation.  It is a gross abuse of <Col N="1254" /> the Companies Act.  It is the very kind of action that the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism has condemned in this House and at various functions on up to six occasions in the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>Acting to the detriment of unsecured creditors is not some vague activity that only lawyers, accountants or some other people understand.  It means that the Government ensure they are paid while the ordinary tradesman who does a job, the shopkeeper who supplies goods or the trader who supplies goods in order to keep this factory going, who supplies those goods on credit in the belief that he is dealing with an Irish State company and that an Irish State company have never reneged on their commercial obligations, are left without money with the preference being given to the State in paying on foot of a guarantee in respect of which the bank is covered anyway by its own debentures, mortgages and floating charge on assets of £3 million including collectible debts of £2.2 million and saleable stock to the extent of £1 million. Except in the most formal fashion the bank never demanded repayment.  Have we ever had a situation before where a bank put in a receiver without having seriously demanded repayment, where a bank is paid in full in respect of interest due up to the day of the receivership? How many companies in this country are able to do that?  I would say very few but none of them expect the plug to be pulled from under them.  This company had no reason to expect to be treated in this way either and the bank would not have so acted if the Minister had not taken the action he took.</P>

      <P>It is a shameful exercise. It is not just.  Politically and socially it is callous.  It is commercially unethical and it is bordering on the whole question of fraud and of fraudulent preference under the Companies Act.  The Minister and his senior officials will one day have to answer to a tribunal other than this House.  They will have to answer to some tribunal in the Four Courts for the action <Col N="1255" /> they have taken and they will find it very difficult to produce satisfactory answers.</P>
      <P>It is noteworthy that, apart from the small unsecured Irish creditors who have been fraudulently done out of their money by this surreptitious effort at the last minute in order to have a debenture registered against this company, there are the large foreign creditors who are tougher and stronger people and who will not take this lying down.  It is interesting to read the articles that have appeared about them in newspapers in the past week or so.  Does the Minister realise what will be the consequences of his action in terms of the credibility of this State?  These foreign suppliers got export credit insurance in their own country at cheap rates.  They got export finance at cheap rates because they were supplying an Irish State company and because no Irish State company during our 62 years of independence have up to now reneged on their commercial obligations.  What will be the consequences for every Irish importer if the word of the State cannot be accepted in commercial matters?  We have a situation in which accepted bills of exchange have been dishonoured by an Irish State company.  There are considerable repercussions in that.  Why is it that a company like CIE, for example, who are expected to lose £100 million or more next year will have their obligations met by the State while this company who are borderline in so far as profitability is concerned, who were apparently coming into profitability in recent times, have the plug pulled on them in this extraordinary fashion?  Will any foreign supplier be prepared to accept the word of Irish State companies again in this kind of situation? Can any foreign Government place reliance in the future on an Irish Government's commercial commitment? I do not think so but if they choose to deal with us they will do so on terms that will be a great deal more expensive both for the State here and for individual Irish importers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have dealt mainly with the legal and commercial consequences of what is being done and with the dishonest fashion in which it is being done, that is, to <Col N="1256" /> the detriment of innocent and trusting people.  I wish to deal briefly with some more general aspects of the situation.  We are talking about the first experiment of this kind between an Irish public agency and private enterprise but the result is that in the treatment of the minority of shareholders by the majority shareholders, not only have the minority shareholders no rights whatever but not even the majority and minority directors have any rights.</P>
    <P>All seven of them were ignored with the plug being pulled from under them just as much as it was pulled from under the unfortunate people who thought the Irish State behaved honestly in commercial transactions and just as much as the plug was pulled from under the small people around Scarriff and elsewhere who put £250,000 into the company in the belief that the Irish State was an honourable partner to have in a commercial transaction.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the Minister's action will spread far beyond the confines of Scarriff and beyond the unfortunate and tragic social and economic results for so many hundreds of people in that region and in other parts of the country. I am sure there are people who would willingly engage in the business of making chipboard in this country but who would not wish to do so in the light of this experience in partnership with the dead bureaucratic hand of the State.  We must realise and accept now that the Department of Fisheries and Forestry is no longer a non-commercial activity simply buying land and planting young trees on it.  The Department must become a commercial operation.  It has a lot of mature timber and a lot of thinnings and waste available to it.  By reason of the very nature of the Department, they will not become a commercial operation but will stultify the development of the timber trade for a long time if allowed to continue in the present way.</P>
    <P>It is obvious in this debate that we must recognise the necessity for the establishment of a commercial timber board on which people who know about timber from a commercial point of view will be represented and will be in a position to <Col N="1257" /> have their voices heard.  I have seen within recent weeks the map provided to this chipboard company by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry indicating the forests from which they may now take timber.</P>

      <P>Certainly, I will be glad to oblige.  The Minister is very welcome. The matter I am raising is the exorbitant overcharging by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs of telephone subscribers. In recent months the Department have gone berserk with their charges.  A normal household telephone bill on average over a period of years has been £70, yet the subscriber receives a bill for £150, £220 and even £2,000.  That subscriber will then complain to the Department that his telephone bill is completely out of all proportion and is told: &ldquo;No, the Department are never wrong.  The meter related to the subscriber's number has been checked and found to be in order.&rdquo; Then, to add insult to injury, they say: &ldquo;You pay up in seven days or you will be <Col N="1258" /> cut off.  Do not bother us with your complaints. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are above making mistakes. Our equipment, unlike any other equipment anywhere in the world, is not capable of making mistakes, can never break down, can never over-meter.  All you people who complain must be cranks. You have a cheek in suggesting to us that our Department would do anything so unseemly or so unthinkable as to over-charge. If your account has risen from the normal £70 to £2,000 you made the calls, and that is final.  We do not care whether it was not physically possible to make the calls.  You made them and that is it.  Pay up in seven days or else.  Our staff, engineers, technologists and the Minister, everybody, we are all infallible&rdquo;.  That sums up the attitude of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to a problem that is widespread throughout this country.</P>
      <P>Subscribers everywhere are complaining of overcharging.  A special committee has been set up in Naas, County Kildare, to deal with that problem in their area and to bring pressure to bear to clear up this terrible mess.  Public meetings are being held in different parts of the country to discuss and allay the fears of many who have been overcharged and who are told to shut up, pay up or be cut off.</P>
      <P>Since I have indicated my intention to raise this item many Members of this House have told me that this problem is the one they hear most about in their clinics.  Several Members themselves have complained that they have found difficulties with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and representations on their own behalf proved fruitless.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of this staff, members of the press and every area of the community are affected, including the industrial sector.  They have all complained to me, and I am sure to the Minister, from time to time.  Worst of all is the case of the old age pensioner living alone in a remote area whose average telephone bill is £30 and whose every call <Col N="1259" /> is logged meticulously.  His bill on this occasion is £140.  He has not the money to pay his bill, his health is not good. Now his telephone is cut off.  His last remaining line of communication is broken and his insistence that he is overcharged is met with hard-heartedness.  Is he really expected under threat of being cut off, to pay £110 for a service he did not receive?  Think of the consequent hardship, worry and possibly worse.  Is this type of skullduggery extortion under another name?</P>
      <P>Very recently a meeting was held at Rosslare Strand to discuss this issue. Every telephone subscriber in the area was notified and 40 subscribers attended, all 40 having had difficulty with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In each case their new bill was far beyond the average.  I suppose we were fortunate in that two officials of the Department turned up, but their attitude to us was that subscribers misunderstand the telephone charges.  The following is what they told us.  In regard to duration, subscribers are rarely aware of exactly how long they are on a call.  Research shows that most people when timed on short duration calls claim they have spent only three minutes on the telephone when in fact they have spent ten minutes.  They went on to give the impression that subscribers' misunderstandings caused all the problems and caused this vast over-metering and it is only of late that these vast overcharges have been imposed.</P>
      <P>We have lived with overcharging for quite a while but only within the past year has it gone out of all proportion.  This was told to the Department officials in no uncertain terms.  They heard that it is not only now that people stay on the telephone for more than three minutes. This has been happening through the years, but only now the overcharging has come to a head.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to a Dáil question on Rosslare Strand which I put down I was told that there was no increase overall.  In other words, the 40 subscribers who turned up and complained must have been telling lies or at least untruths but certainly what they said was not right. <Col N="1260" /> Nobody in the hall that night having heard that answer would agree and they can hardly all be wrong.  In answer to a Dáil question on the Rosslare harbour area I was told that the equipment in the exchange failed and this caused some over-metering.  Lo and behold, the equipment owned by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs can go wrong.  It can malfunction. If it could malfunction in that instance, then it can malfunction in several other areas and my contention is that that has been happening and that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have been leading people a merry dance and almost stealing money from them. This is not good enough.  In another instance in Rosslare Strand a person had two lines one of which he was disputing. He paid the account on the other up to date, yet both lines were cut off without notice.  Is that type of activity acceptable in this day and age?  Very recently in answer to a question here in the House the Minister said that meters for individual subscribers will be placed at the subscriber's discretion in residence or office.  This should be an advantage but it will not solve the problem.  The problem is at the source, and that is where the Minister has to tackle it.</P>
    <P>Next January An Bord Telecom will take over.  Will they behave in the same way as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs? I ask the Minister to ensure that does not happen.  The board should make sure that charges to the subscribers are at least accurate.  To be asked for money in any instance is not welcome, but to be asked to pay in excess for a telephone service is not on.  When one considers the service being offered by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs the whole business of over-charging is quite ridiculous. In some areas in County Wexford it is virtually impossible for a telephone subscriber to get in contact with a neighbouring area.  It is now said that it is quicker to travel by car than to make a telephone call in parts of County Wexford. I should like to know if it is true that the Minister has asked AnCO to train people in smoke signals.  At least that would be more effective than the present system.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1261" /> When the Shannon Marine Rescue Service tried to contact five people in Rosslare recently &mdash; all of the phones were manned at the time &mdash; it took 32 minutes to contact them.  In that instance a plane had been lost between Birmingham and Kilkenny.  There was a possibility that it was lost at sea and the lifeboat might have had to be called.  It took 32 minutes to contact the people, and that is a long time to wait for a lifeboat.  I wonder what the Minister intends to do about that matter?</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to over-charge in respect of telephone bills, and neither is the attitude of the Minister with regard to this matter.  I should like an assurance from him that under the new system the service and public relations will be improved.  The Minister should make sure that there is an office available in the main telephone exchange where people can talk with officials about the various queries that may arise.  In respect of over-charging, in my opinion extortion is not half strong enough a word to use for the type of activities engaged in by the Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to share my time with Deputy Leyden.  I support Deputy Byrne in his condemnation of over-charging in respect of telephone bills.  In Wexford the problem has become so serious that public meetings are being arranged to take corrective action.  Telephone subscribers are suffering grave hardship because of the present lunatic charges imposed by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Old age pensioners, working-class people and business people are receiving accounts two and three times greater than their normal bills.  I know of old age pensioners who normally have bills in the region of £30 and who are now being charged between £90 and £120.  The pensioners are not in a position to pay such amounts and they have no alternative but to get rid of their telephones.  As a result, they will suffer hardship and loneliness.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs are adopting a high-handed and callous attitude to the people who query their accounts.  Despite the fact that an account <Col N="1262" /> is being queried they insist that the telephone be cut off regardless of the consequences.  Every query to the Department is answered by the Department with a standard letter on the lines of &ldquo;we have investigated your account and have found it to be correct&rdquo;.  I wonder how much investigation is carried out by the Department?  I venture to say none.  Subscribers in Rosslare who questioned their accounts received the usual standard letter but on further investigation it was found there was a fault in the line which resulted in 50 per cent over-charging. I should like the Minister to explain why the subscribers were told by the Department that there was no problem.</P>
      <P>Telephone subscribers are getting a raw deal.  They are being fraudulently done out of money by the Department. I ask the Minister to take immediate action to ensure the matter is resolved. Practically every subscriber is complaining about the large amounts they are being charged.  The Minister should carry out an investigation as quickly as possible to ensure subscribers get a fair deal.  If they are not given this they will have no alternative but to get rid of their telephones.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputy for allowing me to speak in this debate.  I wish to voice my concern in relation to the number of telephone accounts being disputed.  On 15 November last in reply to a question put by me the Minister said that a sum of £23.5 million was due to the Department because of disputed accounts.  I estimate that would amount to 100,000 consumers who are dissatisfied with the accounting system.  That has been confirmed in a case before the courts.  A person was charged in the region of £1,000 which he queried and in his wisdom the judge decided that the case put forward by the Department was not justified.  I wish to know from the Minister if he proposes to appeal that case or is he admitting at this stage that something is rotten in the state of Denmark as far as accounts are concerned.  In view of the number of representations I receive regularly from all parts of the <Col N="1263" /> country, I must accept that there is something radically wrong in the Department's accounting system.</P>
      <P>The only solution I can see is that meters be provided by the Department in consumers' homes.  When a dispute arises the Department should offer to give a meter to the consumer without charge.  The meters in the exchanges are not above reproach.  They are mechanical machines that will and can go wrong. They have been wrong on some occasions and, as a result, people have been charged excessive amounts.  In the dying days of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, I ask the Minister to intervene in relation to the accounts system and to bring about a radical overhaul there.  At this stage I think it right to call for a public inquiry into the accounts system of the Department.  Nothing less will satisfy the consumers.</P>
      <P>The Minister refused to tell me the number of consumers involved when I put a question to him on 15 November. However, if £23.5 million was due to the Department at that time and if the subscribers were in dispute to the tune of a few hundred pounds, I estimate the number of consumers to be in the region on 100,000.  Nothing less than a public inquiry will satisfy the consumer organisation started by Walter Figgis and his wife, an organisation that is highlighting many of the injustices in the Department. A judicial inquiry should be set up into the accounts system of the Department. All of the 100,000 consumers cannot be wrong.  The points raised by my colleagues, Deputy Byrne and Deputy Browne, are justified.  There was a special problem in the Wexford area but it is countrywide at this stage.  The number of complaints is increasing every day and I do not believe Bord Telecom will solve the problem.  I call on the Minister to hold a public inquiry into the inadequate accounting system in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred previously in the House to the fairly widespread perception that there is something wrong with our telephone billing system.  The repeated criticism of the system in this House and elsewhere is a cause for serious concern. Confidence in the system is being eroded and subscribers are being led to believe that the system is generally inaccurate and unreliable.  The damage to the telephone system would be incalculable if this persisted.</P>
      <P>I reiterate what I have said before.  The metering equipment used by my Department is of international design similar to that used in many of the most efficient telecommunications administrations elsewhere.  It is highly reliable.  Incorrect metering due to faulty equipment is extremely rare.  There are standard procedures in operation in the Department which are designed to ensure that on the rare occasions when a fault occurs it comes under notice promptly.</P>
      <P>Any general analysis of the bills issued by my Department indicates that there is no question of inflated bills being issued this year as compared with previous years.  In fact the average amount charged per subscriber for telephone calls in 1983 was less than the amount charged in 1982 when increases in charges are discounted.  I remind Deputy Leyden that he was the Minister of State at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why then is there so much concern with the billing system?  There are a number of reasons worth mentioning.  The first is that after two prolonged strikes by members of the Irish Post Office Engineering Union and the Post Office Workers' Union at the end of the seventies, there were huge arrears of telephone revenue to be collected.  People got bills for six months instead of the usual three months and bills were sent out in quick succession.  This gave rise to an enormous volume of queries, the treatment of which was inevitably delayed because of the numbers of cases involved and the <Col N="1265" /> arrears of revenue that had to be collected.</P>
    <P>When they came to be dealt with, many of them in 1981 and 1982, subscribers were given the benefit of the doubt and rebates were allowed where records were not available, ever though in most cases the bills were in fact correct.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>However, ironically, people assumed that because they got rebates mistakes had been made and this generated a lack of confidence in the system.</P>
      <P>Secondly, charges for telephone services were increased very substantially during the last few years and subscribers do not always advert to the fact that increased bills do not necessarily reflect an increase in the number of units being charged for.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, a sustained campaign of criticism of the billing system was mounted by a small group.  Most of this criticism was inaccurate and irresponsible but unfortunately many people were influenced by it &mdash; even possibly some Dáil Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Fourthly, some incorrect bills are issued, far fewer now than in the past, but where there is a lack of confidence in a system and such errors are publicised, the significance of a relatively small number of mistakes, which is an inevitable feature of any system involving human beings, is exaggerated out of all proportions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The billing system has been and will continue to be kept under regular review to refine and improve it still further.  One area of serious concern at present is the undue delay which occurs in too many cases in responding promptly to compaints or inquiries by customers.  While the number of complaints nationwide is decreasing, the volume is still large and <Col N="1266" /> every effort is being made to deal with them promptly within the resources available.</P>

      <P>I am sure that Bord Telecom Éireann who will take over responsibility for the service from 1 January 1984 will pay particular attention to this aspect of the billing system.</P>
      <P>A second concern has been that subscribers have no visual means of checking their use and the telephone bill merely indicates the number of metered units. In order to enable subscribers to check their own use where they are not happy with their bills, my Department have ordered private meters which can be installed in subscribers' premises.  They are now available for rental at £6 per quarter and the installation charge is £12.</P>

      <P>Another possible solution to allay subscriber doubts is detailed billing which provides details of subscriber-dialled trunk calls.  A small pilot scheme on these lines is being carried out this quarter in the Naas exchange area.  I am advised that Bord Telecom Éireann are considering providing this facility for subscribers who want it but this service would, of course, have to be paid for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to mention one other point.  Subscriber dialling to Northern Ireland was introduced at the end of last year and was extended to all of Britain in the early summer.  It is the general experience, not only here but in other administrations, that in the initial stages of a facility to dial long distance calls, subscribers do not advert to the length of their calls and can incur quite <Col N="1268" /> heavy charges on such calls.  They get a very unpleasant surprise when they get their telephone bills subsequently.  This probably explains increases in metered units in recent telephone accounts received by some subscribers.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by repeating that the telephone billing system is generally reliable, that complaints or queries by subscribers are examined carefully, that in the small percentage of cases in which a mistake has been made it is corrected and an amended bill issued.  The system is reviewed regularly and such a review is underway at present.</P>
    <P>I am aware also that Bord Telecom Éireann are very conscious of the need to improve the system further and I understand that they have some plans drawn up to achieve this.</P>
    <P>On 1 January Bord Telecom Éireann will take over from the Department.  I have quite a number of headaches over the telephone billing system and I hope that Bord Telecom Éireann will be half as tolerant in dealing with complaints as I have been.</P>

      <P>The Preliminary Report of the 1981 Census of Population was published in October 1981.  Volume I (Population of District Electoral Divisions, Towns and Larger Units of Area) was published in September 1982.</P>
      <P>These were followed in April 1983 by the first of two reports giving results for a number of topics and based on an analysis of a 5 per cent sample of completed census returns.  The first report covered age, marital status, principal economic status, industries and occupations. The second such report will be published later this month.  It will cover aspects of household accommodation, period in which built, size, heating, water and sanitary facilities, nature of occupancy and rent of rented dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In September 1983 a County Bulletin series was introduced.  Each bulletin gives provisional results for a particular county <Col N="1066" /> or county borough for (a) populations classified by age-group, marital status, economic activity, religion, mode of travel and distance to work and (b) dwellings classified by size and type and showing particulars of heating, water and sanitary facilities.  The last of the County Bulletins was completed on 24 November, 1983.  Bulletins for four of the Planning Regions were published on 1 December, 1983 and those for the remaining regions will be issued next week.</P>
    <P>A bulletin containing the corresponding results for the State will also be issued this month.  The series of bulletins will be completed with one further State Bulletin covering some additional topics. It is expected that this will be issued early in January 1984.</P>
    <P>The publication dates of the remaining volumes of the 1981 Census Report dealing with final detailed results on a subject matter basis cannot be definitively specified. It is hoped that Volume II (age and marital status) and Volume III (composition of households and family units) will be issued during the first quarter of 1984. The remaining volumes (probably ten in number) will follow at regular intervals and it is hoped to have all detailed results printed and published by the end of 1985.</P>
    <P>The publication schedule for a census is quite extensive and has to span a number of years.  To provide earlier indications of overall results on a large number of topics the sample analysis referred to above was undertaken.  Likewise the bulletin series containing provisional results had been a means of making further results available as quickly as possible at the county and county borough level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Acidity in rainfall is monitored on a monthly basis at eight Irish meteorological stations and on a daily basis at one further station.  The monitoring suggests that there has been a gradual but irregular increase in acidity due to increased atmospheric pollution from sources in this country and abroad.  The levels revealed are, however, still very satisfactory when compared with more industrialised countries and do not give cause for serious concern about the matters referred to in the question.  However, the environmental damage caused in other countries to lakes, forests, monuments and buildings has been well publicised and this country is participating in the action being taken on an international basis to combat the causes of such damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Together with the other EEC member states, Ireland is a party to the Geneva Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution under which contracting states have undertaken to limit and, as far as possible, gradually reduce emissions of polluting substances such as sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide which cause acid rain and to engage in research and the collection of data of the causes and levels of acidity in rainfall. The meteorological station at Valentia Island is the most westerly in Europe and the returns from the monitoring carried on there form part of the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme.  My <Col N="1068" /> Department, in consultation with other interested agencies, are examining the feasibility of extending the scope of this country's participation in that programme.</P>
    <P>An Foras Forbartha was recently awarded an EEC research contract to evaluate the effects of acid rain on surface waters in Ireland and, as part of this contract, it is intended to establish further precipitation samplers in the West and East of Ireland.</P>
    <P>At EEC level, a draft directive on air emissions from industrial plant is at present under consideration by the Council and we have adopted a positive attitude towards this.  In addition, preliminary work on the preparation of comprehensive new air pollution legislation has been carried out in my Department and this will be brought to completion as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The control and regulation of parking on public roads in Dublin city is primarily a matter for the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána and Dublin Corporation.  Such parking prohibitions, restrictions and other requirements as are applicable to the specific area defined by the Deputy are provided for in the Dublin Traffic and Parking Temporary Rules, 1983, made by the Commissioner with my consent.  In so far as the parking problems referred to by the Deputy involve violations of these rules, it would be a matter for the Garda to take appropriate enforcement action.  With regard to the Deputy's suggestion that a parking permit system be introduced for residents of the Portobello district, it would be a matter for the Garda Commissioner to consider in consultation with Dublin Corporation if provision might be made for such a system in bye-laws or rules under the Road Traffic Acts.</P>

    <P>2.  It is estimated that the Commission proposals on the CAP of 29 July 1983 would result in a direct loss to the Irish economy of about 1 per cent of GNP (approximately 130 million pounds in 1983 prices).  The additional loss in the future would be even more significant by preventing the Irish dairy industry from realising its full potential.</P>
    <P>3.  The milk equivalent of butter imported into the Community (at 80 per cent butter fat content) was 256 million gallons in 1982.</P>

      <P>Due to substantial losses incurred as a result of depressed market conditions, a receiver was appointed to the company in question in January 1981 and it closed in February 1981.  The Industrial Development Authority has a fixed charge on the factory site and buildings and any proceeds from the sale of these will be set off against the company's outstanding liabilities to the IDA, which now amount to approximately £2.1 million.</P>
      <P>Since the closure of the factory, the receiver has been making every effort to find a purchaser.  In addition, the IDA have been promoting the factory through its network of overseas offices with a view to locating a suitable alternative industry. These efforts are continuing, though no definite proposal for a takeover or replacement industry has so far emerged.</P>

      <P>When AnCO decided to establish a training centre in Letterkenny, Údarás na Gaeltachta agreed to improve the Gweedore Training Centre facilities to cater specifically for Gaeltacht needs.  In advance of the start-up of the Letterkenny Centre, activity at the Gweedore Centre was increased to facilitate a more efficient build up of training at the new Letterkenny Centre when it became <Col N="1083" /> available.  AnCO now plan to provide 64 places at the Gweedore Centre with an annual throughput of 116 trainees. AnCO have reorganised their provision of courses at Gweedore to meet the needs of all Gaeltacht areas on a national basis.</P>
      <P>The Gweedore Centre will be maintained on a permanent basis as long as local industry and Údarás na Gaeltachta can make use of the existing level of trainees.  AnCO have no plans to downgrade this centre.</P>

      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind early thinnings (pulpwood) for processing.  The harvesting and transport of such thinnings from State forests are largely carried out by the purchasers of the standing timber on their sub-contractors. Inquiries made of some of the principal purchasers indicate that, in 1982, harvesting costs ranged on average from £8 to £10 per tonne and transport costs were of the order of £4 to £6 per tonne, depending on site conditions and haulage distance, respectively.  Because <Col N="1085" /> of the variety of sales involved a precise price per tonne for thinnings sold standing is not readily available but it would range from £1 to £3.50, with an estimated average of £1.50 per tonne overall.</P>

    <P>It is not possible to isolate the cost of collecting tax on farming profits from the overall cost of the administration of taxation as a whole.  For the year 1981, the latest year for which statistics are available, the cost of administering inland revenue duties is estimated at 1.9 per cent of the net receipts of those duties (£2,150.0 million) in that year.</P>
    <P>The increase in the estimated receipt for 1983 (as compared with 1982) is largely due to:</P>
    <P>(a)  a change in the payment dates for income tax on farming profits so that the 1983 figure represents 1½ years' tax;</P>
    <P>(b)  the removal of the income tax credit for rates on farm land as announced in the budget, 1983, in line with the phasing-out of agricultural rates, now completed.</P>

There are many factors which have a bearing on the incidence of human tuberculosis.  Bovine tuberculosis is, of course, of special importance and I am in touch with the Minister for Agriculture in relation to the review of measures for dealing with this problem.  These measures includes liaison between medical officers of health of the health boards and local veterinary officers.</P>

      <P>Health boards provide dental treatment for eligible persons through their own full-time salaried dental officers and by way of the <i>ad hoc</i> dental scheme under which adult patients may be authorised to receive treatment from private dentists who enter into agreements with the boards to treat eligible patients on a fee per item of service basis.  It is a matter for each board to decide the extent of the funds to be devoted to the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme from its overall financial allocation for each year.</P>
      <P>The Southern Health Board decided that because of limited resources it would allocate no funds to the <i>ad hoc</i> scheme this year.  As a result, treatment for eligible persons is available only from the board's own dental staff.  Because of pressure on this service the board have found it necessary to provide treatment on a priority basis.  The priority groups consist of pre-school and national school children, the aged, the handicapped and expectant and nursing mothers.  These arrangements mean that eligible persons who are not in the priority groups may experience delays in obtaining treatment, but the board does provide an emergency service for persons who are experiencing pain.</P>
      <P>The board have advised that the name of the person to whom this question refers was placed on the waiting list for dental treatment in September 1983, but due to the extent of the list it is unable to say when treatment will commence.</P>

      <P>The person concerned made a claim to unemployment benefit on 9 September 1983 and was receiving weekly payments of £92.53 weekly, made up of £74.85 together with pay-related benefit of £17.68 to 3 November 1983. All arrears of pay-related benefit were paid on 14 October 1983.  Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the sum of weekly flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit <Col N="1122" /> and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of an applicant's net average weekly earnings.  The 85 per cent limit applicable to the person concerned was £96.75 and as the total of the flat-rate benefit and pay-related benefit entitlement of £92.55 was less than this amount his weekly payments were not affected initially.  However, he is in receipt of income tax refunds of £19.30 weekly since 4 November 1983 and his rate of pay-related benefit has to be adjusted to take account of these refunds.  He is accordingly entitled to a combined weekly payment of £77.45 from 4 November 1983 made up of £74.85 flat-rate benefit and £2.60 pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of non-contributory widow's pension by a widow under 66 years of age with no dependants is that her means do not exceed £40 per week.  The means of the person concerned from 21 November 1983, derived from a British retirement pension of Stg. £34.05 per week, amount to Irl. £42.65 per week.  Prior to 21 November 1983 her British pension was at the rate of Stg. £32.85 per week which amounted to Irl. £40.81 per week. Because of her means she does not therefore, satisfy the statutory condition for receipt of an Irish non-contributory pension.</P>
      <P>Up to September 1981 the person concerned had been receiving an Irish non-contributory pension at a reduced rate. When she reached 60 years of age, however, she qualified for British retirement pension at a higher rate and she no longer satisfied the statutory condition as to means for receipt of an Irish pension. The latter pension was accordingly terminated.</P>

      <P>A claim for contributory old age pension was received from the person concerned on 25 July 1983.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from the beginning of the year in which he entered into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.  The person concerned does not satisfy the condition as the Department's records show that he entered into insurance in 1954 and that he had a total of 467 such contributions in the required period from 4 January 1954 to 5 April 1983.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 16.</P>
      <P>He also has a record of British employment and in accordance with EEC Regulations on Social Security his entitlement to a <i>pro-rata</i> pension under EEC Regulations was also examined.  However, he had only 65 British contributions in the 1953 and 1954 contribution years, giving him a combined total of 532 from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1983.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 17 and therefore he does not qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension from this Department under EEC Regulations.</P>
      <P>The relevant details have been forwarded to the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, for examination of his entitlement to a British retirement pension.  That Department will reply direct to him.</P>
      <P>He applied for a non-contributory old age pension on 2 March 1983 and this was awarded from 17 April 1983 at a rate appropriate to his means which were assessed at £34.24 per week.  The rate at present being paid to him is £8.60 per week.</P>

      <P>It is part of the programme for Government to initiate a national income-related pension scheme and proposals in this regard will be published in the form of a White Paper.  It is intended that the proposals will include the establishment of a pensions board representative of all the interests involved, including trade union organisations, which would advise on the standards and conditions which should apply in occupational pension schemes and have the subsequent task of overseeing the development of these schemes in line with whatever standards might be adopted.  It is envisaged that the overall question of the security of occupational pension schemes and the protection of benefits against inflation would be among the matters to be examined.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for the receipt of dental benefit requires persons over 23 years of age to have had not less than 156 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions were paid before the date of commencement of the treatment. The person concerned claimed dental benefit on 4 May 1983.  According to the records of the Department she had a total of 126 weeks of insurable employment up to 5 April 1983.  Her claim could not, therefore, be approved.  Both the claimant and her dentist were notified of the position on 13 July 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position now is that on completion of 30 weeks of insurable employment <Col N="1143" /> after 5 April 1983, i.e. giving a total of 156 contributions paid, she will qualify for benefit in respect of any treatment carried out after the date the necessary 156 contributions have been paid.  She was informed of this on 10 October 1983 following receipt of representations from the Deputy.</P>

His means accordingly exceeded the maximum rate of unemployment assistance payable to him and his claim was disallowed in respect of the period 24 June 1983 to 2 August 1983 when he ceased to sign as unemployed.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance of his unemployment assistance claim and indicated that he was no longer residing with his parents.

He was not available when the social welfare officer called to see him in connection with the assessment of his means.  He made a further claim on 14 June 1983 and his case was again referred to the social welfare officer for investigation.  Following receipt of the social welfare officer's report, a deciding officer recently assessed him with weekly means of £2.40 derived from the value of board and lodgings on his mother's holding.  He is accordingly entitled to payment at the weekly rate of £23.05 from 13 January 1983, £25.60 from 29 June 1983 and £27.00 from 5 October 1983 being the maximum weekly amounts appropriate in his case from those dates less weekly means of £2.40.  Arrangements have been made to pay all arrears due to him this week.  Further payments will continue to be made as they fall due.</P>

He appealed against the disallowance and following an oral hearing of his case the appeals officer upheld the decision.  He reapplied for unemployment assistance on 23 June 1983 and following a review of his means he was assessed with weekly means of £32.70.  His application was refused as his means exceeded the maximum weekly rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case.

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of unemployment assistance at the rate of £30.35 a week and this is the maximum amount payable under the legislation to a single man resident in an urban area.  Because the plight of the <Col N="1157" /> unemployed is recognised arrangements were made this year for the first time to make a special payment to the long-term unemployed.  Accordingly, from the beginning of October their rates of unemployment assistance were increased by 5 per cent.  This increase was in addition to the increase of 10 per cent which was awarded generally from the end of June last.  The person referred to by the Deputy benefited from the increase.</P>

      <P>There is provision under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme whereby a health board may, in any case which it considers reasonable, pay an allowance by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need. Claims for help with exceptional needs can arise in a wide variety of situations and each claim is considered on its merits in the light of individual circumstances. Guidelines were drawn up at the inception of the scheme in order as far as possible to ensure uniform application of the legislation dealing with supplementary welfare allowance.

The authorities state, however, that when the householder subsequently sought to confirm from the office of the drugs squad that it was their members that were involved, she was informed in error that this was not so.  The explanation for this was that the member in charge of the search party was immediately afterwards called away and engaged overnight on other duties in consequence of which he overlooked entering a note of the visit in the relevant official records.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The strength of the Garda Síochána on 1 January 1983 and 30 November 1983 was 10,831 and 11,247, respectively.  The actual strength on 31 December 1983 will depend on whether a particular group of recruits will be appointed to the force in the last few days of December or early next month, but it is estimated that, one way or the other, the strength by mid-January will be approximately 11,320.</P>
