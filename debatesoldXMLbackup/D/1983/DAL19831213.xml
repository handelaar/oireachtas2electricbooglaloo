      <P>The decision was not a decision of officials but my decision and I take responsibility for it.  I regret the necessity for it as I have strong views on the desirability of spouses being present whenever possible.  However, in view of the accommodation situation in St. Patrick's Hall, as those present will know, it would not have been possible to accommodate the additional numbers that would have been involved if the spouses of those present had been invited.  Therefore, there was no alternative to the course of action adopted, much though I personally regretted it.</P>

        <i>Dún Laoghaire</i>): On 25 November 1983, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 199,567 persons on the live-register of whom 61,531 &mdash; 38,515 males and 23,016 females &mdash; were under 25 years of age.</P>
      <P>A special analysis of the live register by age and duration of continuous registration is carried out twice a year in April and October.  The latest date for which figures are available is 22 April 1983.  On this date, there were 188,807 persons on the live register of whom 55,732 &mdash; 36,333 males and 19,399 females &mdash; were under 25 years of age.  The analysis shows that 10,242 persons &mdash; 7,399 males and 2,843 females &mdash; under 25 years of age had been continuously registered for 53 weeks or longer.</P>

      <P>The Minister of <Col N="1628" /> State at the Department of the Taoiseach answers statistical questions.  He does not answer questions on policy which would be much more appropriate to other Ministers, perhaps arising out of the information the Deputy has just got.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants under the farm modernisation scheme for buildings and fixed assets, which were suspended with effect from 10 February 1983 will be reintroduced at the earliest possible date having regard to the Exchequer funds that can be made available for capital development in agriculture.  In the revised scheme it is intended to concentrate on the most essential forms of investment, with special emphasis on basic livestock housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of broadening the development category to include farmers below the development level will be considered in the light of the eventual decision by the Council of Ministers on the <Col N="1632" /> Commission's recent proposals on structural reform, which pay particular attention to this group of farmers.</P>
    <P>Up to 31 December 1982, 105,162 applicants were accepted for participation in the scheme and a total of £234 million was paid out in grant aid.  Also up to that date 2,507 applicants were refused participation, the principal reason being failure to meet the requirements relating to time spent in farming and income earned from farming.  In the first six months of 1983, 26 applicants were refused admission to the scheme.  Information is not available as to the number of persons who were admitted to the scheme over the years but whose applications for aid for specific items of investment were rejected.</P>
    <P>Recoupment is available from EEC funds in respect of grant aid paid to development farmers only.  The rate of recoupment is 50 per cent of eligible expenditure in the western region and 25 per cent outside the west.</P>
    <P>The number of applications on hands on 9 February 1983 for grant aid for buildings, fixed assets and mobile equipment, which could not be dealt with due to the modifications to the scheme introduced on that date was 4,644.  On the reintroduction of the revised scheme, fresh applications from these participants will be considered, provided that the proposed works are still eligible for grant aid. Where building work was carried out without the prior written approval of the farm development service, grant aid will not be paid.</P>
    <P>The saving in 1983 resulting from the suspension of grant aid for farm buildings and fixed equipment is estimated at £10.3 million.</P>

      <P>We were told before the summer recess that grants would be available under the farm modernisation scheme and that similar grant type works would be grant-aided under the western package.  Since then we have discovered that only £70,000 has been expended in this way.  Would the Minister agree with the points we put to him at that time regarding the scheme being so restrictive as to render it very difficult for farmers to qualify?  Is this not borne out by the fact that in the entire 12 western counties only a couple of dozen applicants have qualified?  Would the Minister not agree also that by withdrawing the farm modernisation scheme, the Government left themselves in a very weak bargaining <Col N="1635" /> position in relation to discussion in Brussels on the super-levy?</P>

      <P>I would agree that because of the way in which the western package was negotiated in the first instance some years ago, it is not tailor made for the type of small farmer for whom it was intended.  I have taken very real steps in the past few months to have this whole question of the western package re-negotiated in Brussels.  However, because of our preoccupation with the super-levy, this re-negotiation has been delayed but despite my having made certain adjustments early in the spring of this year, I am still disappointed with the uptake under the western package.  The scheme was extremely restrictive at that stage because it excluded any farmer over 55 who was without successors.  I directed all the area officers that this was to be switched around so that the same discipline that was there under the farm modernisation scheme would be available under the western package.  This change has had some beneficial effect. The great problem with the western package is the way in which it was negotiated in the sense of there being an orientation away from milk.  The problem was that those who were most likely to avail of the benefits under the grant scheme in the western package were people who were expanding their dairying enterprise. Therefore, a number of anomalies have been created but these will have to be ironed out.  I must accept that the scheme has not been as useful as we would have wished.</P>

      <P>I have never denied that the withdrawal of the scheme was the result of a budgetary measure in the spring of this year which in turn resulted from the financial situation in which we found ourselves.  However, it is not as simple as that because, as the Deputies are aware, the farm modernisation scheme embraced a variety of grants and a considerable length of time is required in which to get a package together.  We hope that this package, when it is available, will be seen to be beneficial to Irish agriculture.  In further reply to Deputy Byrne, though I have answered this question twice or three times today, following the announcement of the farm modernisation scheme I will have a sympathetic look at the cases of a number of those applicants who were caught by the decision in February.</P>

If the scheme is to be announced in a few days the Minister must know the terms of it now.  The agricultural grapevine has it that the terms of the scheme will relate mainly to farm buildings.</P>

To say that the scheme will be re-introduced in a couple of days sounds a little suspect because this may be an effort to get the Minister off the hook.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am glad the Minister stated that there will be included in the new scheme of grants a scheme for the housing of livestock.  Is the Minister aware there is urgent need for a simple type of housing for the wintering of cattle?  Would he include this in his new scheme of grants?  Is the Minister also aware that the costings of the work should now be updated to the present day?  Will he say if these will be included at a realistic cost in the proposed scheme he will introduce?  Furthermore, is he aware that there is also need under the proposed scheme for increased grants to make up farmers' losses over the past nine months both from EEC and Exchequer funds?</P>

      <P>The reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty is wholly administered by the associated banks and the ACC and they have informed me that some 4,400 applicants have so far received interest relief of approximately £9 million under the scheme.  The amount of benefit conferred on each individual is, of course, confidential.  The lending institutions are not aware of any applications being lost or mislaid.</P>
      <P>The scheme requires a financial reconstruction programme to be drawn up for each participant.  This programme may involve restructuring of loans and modification of farm plans.  This is arranged by the lending institutions.  I have no information in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The closing date for receipt of completed application forms by the lending institutions was originally fixed at 15 June <Col N="1648" /> 1982 but this was later extended to 30 June 1982.  I do not propose to re-open the scheme to applicants who did not make application in time.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see the processing of applications completed as soon as possible.  But, in view of the nature and complexity of the scheme, progress is as good as could be expected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to his previous Private Notice Question on 22 November 1983.</P>
      <P>I am aware and understand the disquiet among domestic water consumers in North Dublin city and county about the recurrence of phenol contamination of their water supplies.  I am again assured by Dublin County Council that the levels of contamination do not constitute a public health hazard.  Tests carried out by the council following the most recent complaints from consumers on Saturday 10 December 1983 indicated that the phenol levels were below the limits of detectability on analytical equipment.  However, complaints regarding the taste and odour of the water supply indicated phenol contamination and the council initiated the activated carbon treatment process to eliminate these side effects of contamination. I am advised that any water containing phenol in the supply system should be fully used up by now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department have been in contact with officials of Dublin County Council since the phenol contamination incident of last month to discuss the tracing of the source of contamination with a view to prevention of a recurrence and ways of effectively dealing with this problem if and when it arises.  My Department will be seeking a full report on all aspects of this important issue when the investigations are complete.  I understand that Kildare County Council have made some headway in their investigations and have narrowed down the likely sources of <Col N="1655" /> phenol contamination.  This, in turn, should allow the council to take action to prevent further contamination of the water supplies.</P>

      <P>I understand that Kildare County Council are drawing the attention of users of chemicals containing phenol to the penalties for water pollution under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977.  On summary conviction for an offence under the 1977 Act, a person is liable to a fine of up to £250 with a fine of up to £100 every day for a continuing offence; and or a prison term of up to six months.  A person convicted, on indictment, for water pollution is liable to heavier penalties.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the question of any possible legal proceedings which may be instituted by Kildare County Council arising from the phenol contamination of the River Liffey source of the North Dublin Water Supply System.</P>

      <P>Tairgim:</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approve the nomination by the Taoiseach of Deputy Ruairí Quinn for appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.</P>
      <P>Before announcing the Department which will be assigned to Deputy Ruairí Quinn, subject to the motion being approved, I would like to take this opportunity to place on the record of the House my appreciation and that of my colleagues in the Government of the valuable contribution which Deputy Cluskey has made as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism to this administration. Members will recall in particular his prompt and effective action in relation to the PMPA.  We respect the reasons and sense of integrity which led him to take his decision and wish him well in the future.</P>
      <P>Experience in Government over the past year and in particular of the problems facing it and the country have led me to certain conclusions as to the way in which functions should be redistributed among the Departments of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I intend to merge the functions of the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism with the industry functions <Col N="1803" /> at present in the Department of Industry and Energy.  The new Department will then be retitled the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  This will bring together again within the sphere of responsibility of one Minister and one Department functions relating not only to manufacturing and a wide range of commercial semi-State bodies but also to prices and distribution, which must form an integral part of any industrial policy.  The change will reduce certain problems as regards the definition of responsibility particularly for foreign trade and will facilitate action in relation to tourism and other services which will also be within the ambit of the new Department.</P>
    <P>The new Department of Energy will retain the functions in relation to energy matters at present undertaken in the Department of Industry and Energy.  The Minister in charge of the new Department will oversee and co-ordinate Government policy in this area which has become increasingly vital to our economic success.  Deputies will recall that imports of oil alone over the past decade have risen from about 2 to 3 per cent of GNP to about 8 per cent &mdash; or almost £900 million in 1982.  The Minister will pay particular attention to questions like the efficiency of energy generation and distribution and the effects on employment of present investment and other policies.  Offshore developments earlier this year increased exploration prospects and the consequent possibility of yet more finds of oil or gas now demand the exclusive attention of a Minister.  The necessary Government orders relating to these two Departments will be made at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>As to the Ministerial appointments involved, I propose as soon as the Government orders are made, and subject, where necessary, to the terms of the present motion, to terminate the assignment of the Department of the Environment to the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, and to assign to him the new Department of Energy.  I propose to terminate the assignment of the Department of Trade. <Col N="1804" /> Commerce and Tourism to myself and assign the new Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to Deputy John Bruton.  I will terminate the assignment of the Department of Labour to Deputy Kavanagh and assign to him the Department of the Environment.  I propose to assign the Department of Labour to Deputy Ruairí Quinn as soon as possible after his approval by this House and appointment by the President to be a member of the Government.  The Deputy will, of course cease to be a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment on his appointment as a member of the Government.</P>
    <P>I also propose to recommend to the Government to appoint Deputy Séamus Pattison to be a Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that when making the appointments of Ministers of State I indicated that I intended to recommend a policy of rotating them as between Departments, so that they could acquire a wide and as varied an experience as possible of the working of the Government and the various Departments of State.  In line with that policy, I propose to recommend to the Government that they should appoint Deputy Edward Collins to be a Minister of State at both the restructured Departments of Energy and of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism; Deputy John Donnellan to be a Minister of State at the Departments of Health and Social Welfare; Deputy George Birmingham to be a Minister of State at the Department of Education in addition to his post as Minister of State at the Department of Labour; and Deputy Fergus O'Brien to be a Minister of State at the Department of the Environment. The areas of special responsibility of these Ministers of State will be indicated shortly.</P>
    <P>As well as the proposals I have just announced the House has before it a Bill for the establishment of a new Department of Communications in place of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the Department of Transport.</P>
    <P>Subject to the enactment of this legislation, it is my intention to assign the new Department to Deputy Jim Mitchell and <Col N="1805" /> to recommend to the Government to appoint Deputy Nealon to be Minister of State at that Department.  The Minister for the Public Service will be dealing in this House with the changes proposed in this Bill &mdash; which arise from the setting up of An Post and An Bord Telecom &mdash; and the transfer to them of large numbers of serving personnel.</P>
    <P>All of these changes have the objective of achieving what I am sure every Deputy in the House will regard as a worthwhile end &mdash; greater efficiency and effectiveness in public administration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that many people in the political arena would expect that we in Opposition would be very happy to see the discomfiture of the Government at this time, but I want to assure the House that we are not because we are deeply and seriously perturbed at the developments which are taking place, developments of which I believe we have not yet heard the end.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this Government was being formed and negotiations were going on which led to its formation, I gave a clear warning to the country &mdash; indeed, I have repeated that warning on a number of occasions since &mdash; that this Government was in herently unstable.  That instability is not related solely to disagreements on aspects of particular policies but derives from a fundamental disagreements on political philosophy and ideology on the way in which our economy should be run and managed and on the whole basis of economic and social policy.  The resignation of Deputy Cluskey from the Government underlines and re-emphasises that warning.  This Government consists of two deeply divided factions and their arguments and disagreements have now reached the stage which renders them totally incapable of dealing with the many difficult economic and social problems that confront the country at present. It is no secret that Cabinet disagreements culminating in the resignation of Deputy Cluskey have gone on for several months and relate to many other policy issues as well.  The fact is that this Government is now torn apart with internal wranglings and dissensions and there is no coherent <Col N="1806" /> policy approach by the Government to the issues of the day.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the most important aspects of the changes which the Taoiseach has announced is the decision by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, to leave the Department of the Environment and take over the new Department of Energy.  The Tánaiste has been exactly one year at the Department of the Environment and the most charitable thing that can be said about his brief tenure of office is that he failed to make his mark. He has left the construction industry in a disastrous state through a complete failure to keep to the commitment by Fine Gael and Labour to maintain capital spending and provide an extra £100 million for urgent infrastructural projects. Unemployment is 12,000 higher this year in the construction industry when according to the best economic forecasts in November 1982 it should actually have fallen.  We must acknowledge that under Deputy Dick Spring as Minister for the Environment the building and construction industry has fallen into one of the most disastrous situations ever in modern times.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste's handling of local authority finances has also been a disaster. All in all, the Tánaiste's first experience of an important Government Department, which I understand he almost certainly chose himself, has been less than successful.  It is now said that he has sought less onerous duties so that he can devote himself more to the Labour Party.  There are two observations that can be made about that.  It is my experience that all Departments carry onerous responsibilities and that Ministers are expected by our citizens to give a full commitment to their particular Department.  Ministers are not paid by the public to look after their parties; they are paid to do a job of work in a particular Department on behalf of the country and if the Tánaiste finds it difficult to continue leading a relatively small party with serious Departmental responsibilities, then perhaps he too should consider withdrawing altogether from the Government or, alternatively, handling over the leadership of the party to someone else.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> The resignation of a former leader of the Labour Party, perhaps their most experienced Minister and someone who represents a centre of gravity in the Labour movement, must have implications for the Labour Party's continuation in Coalition.  I will put it no stronger than that.  It is very hard, despite the best efforts of Deputy Cluskey to convince us otherwise, to see his resignation as simply a personal matter or a result of strong personal views.  On the contrary, it is Deputy Cluskey's contention that he resigned on a decision which was repugnant to the Labour Party.  If Deputy Cluskey has resigned from the Government on a matter of principle, how then can his colleagues who support, or allegedly support, the same principles remain in that Government and continue to support the particular policy over which Deputy Cluskey thought it necessary to resign?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect.  It is generally recognised that Deputy Cluskey had a key role in persuading the Labour Party Conference to agree to Labour participation in this Government.  Deputy Cluskey now finds it impossible to continue in this Government because of the policies which they are pursuing and on principle. In what position does that leave the decision of the conference to participate in Government?  The key person who persuaded the conference has now decided that he cannot continue and, presumably, the decision of the conference to participate in the Coalition is no longer a valid one.  How are we to interpret these different moves in ministerial responsibility which the Taoiseach has just outlined to us?  Are they dictated solely by party political needs, simply party political manoeuvring, or are there more serious policy implications?  The key question is &mdash; why has Deputy Bruton been kicked out of the Energy portfolio? This is the second time that the present Taoiseach has seen it necessary to move Deputy Bruton sideways.  How are we to interpret this latest move?  That is the important thing.  What policy implications has it?</P>
    <P>The Department of Energy will become increasingly significant and <Col N="1808" /> important, but not for the reasons which the Taoiseach has given us, because we are now importing more oil than we used to.  Does everybody not know that crucial issues will arise in the whole field of energy of which Dublin Gas and Kinsale Gas are perhaps relatively minor?  What implications has this for the future of our oil and our other natural resources? These are questions to which the public are entitled to an answer.  There is, somehow, a great air of mystery surrounding this whole question of the handling of our natural resources.  There are aspects of it which require explanation.  There are people in the area which will be affected who are very close to the Fine Gael party. We will have to be very vigilant as to how this situation develops.  I warn the Taoiseach and the Government that we will watch very carefully indeed every single move made.</P>
    <P>One aspect which greatly disturbs people right across the political spectrum is the startling revelation that on a crucial, major issue of policy the Taoiseach did not vote in Cabinet.  I find it disturbing, in any event, that an issue of this sort would actually be put to a vote in Cabinet &mdash; an issue which affects the basic approach to economic management and the philosophy which inspires that economic management.  What sort of Government have we that on a central, crucial issue, which the Government spent apparently all summer and autumn debating, when the crunch came the Taoiseach did not vote?  Was this because he had no views, or because he did not want to vote against some of his colleagues in favour of others?  He used to lecture us, when he was in Opposition, about courageous and inspired leadership. Some leadership &mdash; a Taoiseach who dodges a major issue in front of his own Government.  I have spoken about confused Government but I did not, up to these current events, have any concept of how confused this Government really are, or the manner or type of leadership which this Government are getting on a crucial issue.  The Taoiseach not alone cannot give leadership to his Government, but cannot commit himself to either one side or the other by voting.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1809" /> There is an important side issue to all this which is that Deputy Pattison will now, presumably, vacate the seat in the European Parliament.  Everybody acknowledges and recognises that up to now the behaviour of the Labour Party with regard to the European Parliament has been a national disgrace.  I only hope that the record will not be sullied further. I hope that somebody during today will deny that there is any truth in the rumour that the seat which Deputy Pattison will now vacate will be handed over as a little donation or present to former Deputy Justin Keating.</P>

      <P>They are buoying themselves up with a certain false enthusiasm, but everybody knows that only a general election can bring the present disarray which prevails in this Government to an end.  The situation has deteriorated beyond redemption.  The Government are deeply and fundamentally divided. They are incapable of dealing with the major economic and social problems which confront us.  This latest revelation of their inherent and basic incompetence proves what we have always said &mdash; that they have not the political capacity to deal with the problems of our country at this time.  Everybody know that they are refusing to face up to the issues.  Everybody in this House and the general public know that.  The sooner the Government acknowledges that the only solution and the only way out of our present difficulties <Col N="1811" /> is a general election, the more we will respect them for their honesty.</P>

      <P>I would like to commend Deputy Cluskey for his stand on an issue of principle which may feature again with the Government, that is the use of Government funds for private companies when funds are withheld from State companies who are being brought to their knees.  I remind the Leader of the Labour Party of a meeting I had with him on 8 December 1982.  I am sure he will recall that we discussed the options open to the Government following the election which had taken place and the emphasis I placed on the fact that there was very little difference between the policies which the Fine Gael party would be pursuing and those which had been pursued by the Fianna Fáil Government.  I said that while the Labour Party might get some concessions in a Coalition Government, in fact there would not be any basic change in the manner in which the economy would be run.</P>
      <P>My hope at that time was that the Labour Party would stay out of Coalition and that by an alliance with The Workers' Party we could build a strong left Opposition in this Dáil, which could be quite effective in changing policies and in building a strong leadership for the working class people.  The remarks I made at the time have proved to be true.  Fine Gael have dominated the Coalition and their policies are paramount.  It is still my hope that in the future The Workers' Party and the Labour Party can co-operate in building such an alliance.  I will not waste any time or tears over the Labour Party's decline while they still fail to face up to the realisition of their true role and what their purpose should be until they do, as Deputy Cluskey did, get out from the clutches of the Fine Gael Government. With regard to the Labour Party's plea that they are giving stability of Government, I can only say that stability for conservatives can only mean harder times for workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the new face in Government which the Taoiseach <Col N="1812" /> has announced, that of Deputy Séamus Pattison, MEP.  Is he an MEP?  It is very difficult to recall at the moment who the Labour Party MEPs are.  We had two elected in Dublin, Deputy O'Connell and Deputy M. O'Leary who were replaced by Deputy Frank Cluskey and Mr. John Horgan.  They resigned and were replaced by Senator Flor O'Mahony and Mr. Brendan Halligan.  I presume that Deputy Pattison will be resigning.  This whole procedure of elected members resigning, being replaced, the new people resigning and being replaced besmirches the whole concept of democracy, which was supposed to apply to the European Parliament.  An election is due in six months.  Very little credibility in relation to them is given to the general public if the people they elect are gone in six months and people they never heard of can be appointed in their places.  It will be interesting to see if any new procedures have been decided upon by the Government or the European Parliament to avoid this sort of charade which has been going on for so long.  It seems to be an indication of the shortage of talent within the Coalition or possibly within the Labour Party that they had to pick Deputy Séamus Pattison for this job. Maybe it is not on talent those decisions are made but on electoral success or something else.  It is bad judgment by the Taoiseach or the Tánaiste on behalf of the Labour Party to nominate Deputy Séamus Pattison.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the move of Deputy Ruairi Quinn from the Department of the Environment.  It seems that an architect in the Department of the Environment would be of great benefit.  He would know his job and would be able to talk back to the civil servants.  Deputy Kavanagh had similar knowledge and experience so that he would be able to deal with the civil servants in the Department of Labour.  Is the switch more a sop to the civil servants than a decision by the Government?  It does not seem to be putting the right talent in the right place to, as the Taoiseach said at the end of his statement, create more efficiency.  I do not believe this switch makes for that efficiency.</P>

      <P>I would like to pay tribute on behalf of the Labour Party to my colleague, Deputy Frank Cluskey, former leader of the Labour Party, a man of very high ability.  I admire his decision to come out of the Cabinet on principle. I am amazed, 12 months after we win an election, to hear Deputy Haughey come in here and make an attack on the Leader of the Labour Party.  The Deputy leader of our party has not been offered any bribes to step down and change the decision to elect a leader.  We had no Ministers coming out of Cabinet because there were phone taps on one Cabinet Minister by another one, checking what was going on on the internal affairs of that Department.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey said that Ministers were elected to run the Departments. What happened his two Ministers who came out of the previous Government? Were the phone taps, which were put on them, to watch what was happening within their Departments or to watch what was going on in the leadership crisis? I can tell the Deputies opposite, as a backbencher of the Labour Party, that Deputy Dick Spring has the full support of this party and none of us would stand idly by and see a man like Deputy Charles Haughey, attack the Leader of our party. If Deputy Haughey was honourable and if there was any other Leader in the Fianna Fáil Party he would be gone long ago.  They cannot get rid of him.  That is what is wrong with the Fianna Fáil Party. The longer Fianna Fáil hold on to him the better it is for us because he is a liability to that party.  The sooner the Fianna Fáil Party realise that the better. Words from Deputy Haughey's mouth in an attack on a man of the calibre of Deputy Dick Spring fall on deaf ears.</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil and The Workers' Party have attacked the Labour Party.  The people decided at the last <Col N="1814" /> general election the number of people who were returned to this Dáil.  The Labour Party have only 9 per cent of the votes of the country.  Our Party was not and is not responsible for the deplorable financial position in which we found this State when we took over Government.  I call now on the press and those who criticise the Labour Party to go back and look at the figures they were given by the previous Coalition and the way money was subsequently transferred from one Department to another without any Cabinet decision.  What this country wants is leadership and that is what the country has now.  We are not responsible for the financial state of the country because when this Coalition came into office the finances of the country were in an appalling mess.  The Labour Party know that a job has to be done and we are prepared to support tough decisions provided those decisions are equitable and provided the workers get a fair crack of the whip.</P>
      <P>I was annoyed listening to the Leader of the Opposition here this afternoon accusing the leader of our party of responsibility for the state of the country's finances at the moment.  Now the Leader of the Opposition went on television and he identified the problems. Those listening to him thought that here was a man who would take the necessary decisions.  What did they find?  They found he had not the courage of his convictions and was not prepared to take the requisite decisions.  He identified the ills but he was not prepared to administer the cure.  A Front Bench Opposition spokesman comes along during the recent by-election and advises the people not to pay the water rates.  Is that constructive opposition?  To me it is the essence of hypocrisy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those who may attack the appointment of Deputy Séamus Pattison as a Junior Minister.  Deputy Pattison has been in this House since 1961.  He has represented the constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny for 22 years.  He has been a hard-working Deputy and a Front Bench spokesman of the Labour Party.  His promotion is long overdue and I take this opportunity to congratulate him on his <Col N="1815" /> appointment and to wish him well.  I would say to those who mistakenly think there may be a quick general election and to the Deputies over there on the Opposition benches who are hoping for such an election and, in particular, to the one man who would like to see an opportunity given to grab on to power again, hoping to keep himself there for the rest of his life: &ldquo;Hold on a second, Charlie.  Things are not going to go your way.  This Government is here to last and we will serve the people until 1986&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>The last contribution does not help in what should be a constructive debate about the sorry collapse which is now imminent for the Government as a result of the hasty departure of Deputy Cluskey in the last few days. What is the essence and the heart of this whole matter is the principle of collective responsibility.  That principle appears to have been forgotten.  Fundamentally parliamentary democracy cannot function without collective responsibility.  What we have here is a situation in which Deputy Cluskey departs from Government on the basis of what he calls &ldquo;principle&rdquo;. He will now occupy the back benches and there exercise political blackmail on the Government while leaving inside the Government four Labour Party Ministers and the Tánaiste who do not appear to share that principle.  There lies the recipe for chaos in Government. There lies instability in the loss of investment, instability because of a loss of confidence, instability that can only lead to a further threat to the institutions of the State, institutions so dearly built up over the years, including even this institution here.  The fundamental test of parliamentary democracy is to produce a Government representative of the majority which can govern the country with a sense of collective responsibility and any breakdown in that means an end to parliamentary democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the first real erosion of the principle of parliamentary democracy in the undignified departure of Deputy Cluskey and subsequent newspaper comment where what now emerges is who <Col N="1816" /> voted for what issue in regard to Dublin Gas.  For the first time in the history of the State we have got the figures to show how people voted within the Government, a Government which was supposed to have collective responsibility.  We are told that four Labour Party Ministers supported Deputy Cluskey.  We are told Deputy Jim Mitchell supported him.  We are told the Taoiseach abstained.  We have been given the complete scenario to show how people voted.  The essence of collective responsibility, as the Taoiseach well knows, is to seek to achieve a consensus. Only in very few cases has there ever been such a thing as a vote.  A Taoiseach, if he is a proper Taoiseach, tries to achieve a consensus after discussion. But a consensus is impossible in a situation where you have two ideologically opposed parties.  Not only are they ideologically opposed to each other but they are ideologically opposed within themselves because, if principle means anything, you have the deep ideological cleavage within the Labour Party between those who support Deputy Cluskey leaving on a point of principle and those who remain in Government on the basis that they support the deal with Dublin Gas and disagree with Deputy Cluskey's principle in regard to it.  There is a clear cleavage within the Labour Party, small as it is, and there is then the constant on-going cleavage that exists between the Taoiseach and his particular liberal Donnybrook set and the real rock hard old traditional Fine Gael represented by Deputy Cooney, Deputy Barry and Deputy Bruton.</P>
    <P>Here we have the situation clearly identified for everyone to see, not just a Labour versus Fine Gael cleavage but a cleavage within the Labour Party and again a cleavage in the Fine Gael Party. The latter has now been dealt with on a temporary, transitory basis by simply stripping Deputy Bruton of the portfolio of Energy.  For the second time he has had to eat humble pie at the behest of the Taoiseach.  On an earlier occasion he was stripped of the portfolio of Minister for Finance.  He is stripped now of Energy just when Energy is becoming so very, very important.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> I would like to challenge Deputy Spring&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as to where he stands in regard to our natural resources. Where does he stand on the principle which prompted Deputy Cluskey to leave the Government?  This is something to which he will have to face up because he now has no other pretensions to be in Government except to look after his Energy portfolio.  I am very glad they have stripped him down to a single subject because as Minister for the Environment he was undoubtedly a ghastly failure. We now have the building and construction industry at a standstill, an industry in regard to which no effort whatever was made to ensure that in difficult times it would be supported by central Government and local authority expenditure, an industry for which the Minister for the Environment had direct responsibility, an industry he should have supported in a difficult period.  In fact, he did the direct opposite; he presided over its demise.</P>
      <P>That industry was never in the sort of situation that it is at the moment since the bad days of the recession in the thirties. In the post-war period other Coalition Governments, bad as they were as the ideological cleavages were, managed to give some semblance of government in regard to collective responsibility and personal behaviour between Ministers. While Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Corish were in charge of a previous Coalition I know of no occasion where a Labour Party Minister departed from the Government or ex-Minister went on radio, as Deputy Cluskey did last Sunday, and proceeded to tell the nation how certain people voted on an issue.  That sort of disunity, total absence of a sense of responsibility, lack of regard for collective responsibility was not there in the Coalition Government headed by Deputy Liam Cosgrave and Deputy Corish. This Government have plumbed the depths of disgrace in regard to behaviour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I recognise the basic inherent instability in coalition Governments.  Our opposition <Col N="1818" /> to that type of Government was that this fundamental ideological disparity prevented the proper functioning of these Governments.  In due course previous Governments of the Coalition kind found that for that reason they lost the confidence of the people and not one such Government survived for a second time.  Compounding that instability and making the situation worse than ever, an element of blackmail is introduced into this matter by the present Labour Party within the Government, the petulant blackmail that says, &ldquo;If I do not get my way I will walk out.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The people know well that Deputy Cluskey did not walk out on the basis of the issue of Dublin Gas.  That issue has been there since the present Coalition was formed.  That long-standing matter had been under discussion before we left Government.  It is well known that we were in the process of negotiating an arrangement in regard to Dublin Gas and Bord Gáis Éireann and Deputy Albert Reynolds was the Minister responsible for that.  Therefore, when the infamous arrangements was made between Fine Gael and Labour to come together, that issue was on the table.  There is no point in Deputy Cluskey at this stage resurrecting that as a matter of principle.  That, as a matter of principle, should have prevented him going into the first Coalition Government.  We would like to hear shortly whether Deputy Spring, now the holder of that portfolio, sees it as Deputy Bruton or Deputy Cluskey in his departure from Government saw it.  Deputy Spring as Tánaiste and relevent Minister must face up to that issue within Government very quickly and though this House he must make a presentation to the people as to where precisely he stands. As Minister for Industry and Energy does he intend to continue to promote the arrangements that have been concluded by Deputy Bruton and the majority in Government or does he agree with his departed colleague who says that he disagrees and retires from Government on that basis?  The lack of credibility of that issue of principle is underlined by the fact that Deputy Cluskey, Deputy Spring and other members of the Labour Party who <Col N="1819" /> took the shilling and joined the band were aware of it this time last year.  That issue has been considered by the Government regularly over the past 12 months and is now paraded as a principle by Deputy Cluskey as an excuse to justify his situation and his apprehension in regard to the Estimates and the coming budget decisions that must be made.  The first animal had left the sinking ship. Where are the other animals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably he has left the sinking ship because he is wise in his animal-like scuttling from the ship and in the milieu of the animal that scuttles from sinking ships.  He sees the writing on the wall.  He sees that he represents a constituency, Dublin South-Central, which is a duplication of the constituency of Dublin Central from which the Labour Party were practically eliminated in the past few weeks.  It is not unkind to describe their performance as bringing about a complete elimination and disregard by the working people of Dublin of any pretensions that the Labour Party have to represent them.  Deputy Cluskey, seeing that situation, decided to use the first issue at hand, clothe it in principle, announce it as principle and make his departure as fast as possible from the sinking ship.  He was careful in his radio broadcast last Sunday to draw a distinction between the Estimates to which he had agreed and those Estimates as they will appear in budgetary form.  I hope the Taoiseach and the Fine Gael Tánaiste &mdash; we must refer to him thus from now on &mdash; see the writing on the wall in regard to these Estimates and how they will survive in a budgetary context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to this lack of collective responsibility is not adhering to majority decisions, or consensus decisions which are the main ones taken by Government, is the other element essential to collective responsibility, which is confidentiality. Deputy Cluskey has breached the confidentiality already in his announcement of how Government personnel voted.  We have seen Deputy Hussey distancing herself <Col N="1820" /> from the Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach and the Government recently in announcing from the Department of Education a confidential educational plan for the future.  It was leaked and announced as a confidential plan which shows up Deputy Hussey &mdash; provided she gets the money &mdash; as promoting a marvellously progressive approach in education. That is lack of confidentiality.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a further lack of confidentiality on the part of Deputy Fennell, the Taoiseach's Minister of State, who apparently is announcing expensive reforms in regard to women's rights within the public service and the appointment of officers to supervise the implementation of the equality of employment of women in the public service.  These are excellent schemes, but apparently they can be announced by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach without any Government agreement or any overall Cabinet responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On top of the lack of Cabinet responsibility that fails to accept Government decisions is this additional lack of Cabinet responsibility where individual members of the Government feel free to announce policies costing enormous amounts of money, parade them before the public and portray themselves as magnificent people, all without any approval by the Government or the Minister for Finance. Indeed, the example comes from the Taoiseach himself whom I heard one Sunday morning some months ago in the most cavalier fashion I have ever heard on radio announce off the top of his head that he was proposing to introduce cuts of £500 million in the administration of the public service in the coming year. That was gaily thrown into the ring as the sort of cuts in expenditure that were quite <Col N="1821" /> feasible.  It was evident that the Taoiseach then was talking off the top of his head without any sense of Cabinet or collective responsibility.  He was, in effect, leaking in regard to himself apart from leaking in regard to his Government colleagues &mdash; and he had no realisation that he was leaking in regard to himself. We saw the result of that in the week that followed when Deputy Cluskey proceeded to sulk at the Government meeting. On the Tuesday after that Sunday radio performance Deputy Cluskey refused to attend the Government meeting because after the disastrous effort by the Taoiseach in announcing his cut a row-back situation followed at the request of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes.  The Minister for Finance started to row back on the Taoiseach who promptly issued a statement, through one of the press handlers in whom they specialise, that he did not really mean that. On witnessing the tension and the tug-of-war between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cluskey in a state of sulks refused to attend a Government meeting.  He had to be sent for by Deputy Spring and he was hauled reluctantly from Kildare Street to the Government meeting where something was patched up.  As we can see now, it was patched up for only a very short period.</P>
    <P>We have seen the Taoiseach denigrate and almost destroy the whole principle of responsibility.  I am not referring to responsibility in the collective sense but to the genuine responsibility of the Taoiseach to the nation and to voluntary groups to whom he made commitments. I am referring to his U-turn on the referendum. In that case the Taoiseach managed to turn himself upside down several times but in the end the one thing that emerged was that he had diminished considerably the office of Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of situation we have now.  Members of the Government are leaking information all over the place. They do not understand the principle of collective Cabinet responsibility.  The Government are composed of individuals who are primarily concerned about themselves rather than the objectives of <Col N="1822" /> government.  They are divided not just between the two parties but are divided within themselves and the situation was epitomised by the departure of Deputy Cluskey.  Although I have been very hard on him, perhaps he was right.  Perhaps the ship is sinking irretrievably, perhaps the Deputy is a very sensible man who can swim while the ship goes down. Down the ship is going and the public see it that way.  What we are witnessing now is the gradual deterioration of standards in government which is leading to a total lack of confidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

That is bad for the nation because it leads to a lack of confidence in the institutions of State and of the Government and that will be reflected in a lack of investment in the country.  In that unfortunate downward development which I fear will occur there is only one decent thing for the Government to do and that is to get out.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government for the kind remarks he saw fit to make in his initial announcement with regard to my period of a member of the Cabinet.  I should like to congratulate Deputy Quinn and Deputy Pattison on their new posts and to wish them well.  I should also like to take this opportunity to thank Deputy Flynn, who was the main Opposition spokesman dealing with Trade, Commerce and Tourism, for his courtesy and consideration and the constructive way he approached matters that came before the House.  Last but not least, because they seem to be the national whipping boy, I should like to thank the civil servants in my former Department for their dedication and hard work during the time I was political head of that Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have heard a lot about Cabinet confidentiality and collective responsibility.  Since I announced my resignation from the Government I made it quite clear on every occasion I have spoken since that I accept totally, absolutely and without reservation collective responsibility for every issue that was decided up to the one on which I resigned.  Deputy Haughey on radio, Deputy Lenihan on television and radio and here this afternoon and other Fianna Fáil speakers have attempted to attribute all sorts of reasons as to why I saw fit to take the action I took.  This was very predictable and perhaps understandable. We had the Machiavellian statements that this was the first step of an attack on Dick Spring's leadership.  It was said that Cluskey was back-stabbing Dick Spring. Another statement was that I saw the writing on the wall and wanted to get out, that I wanted to protect myself and run for cover.  Other motives have been attributed to my resignation.  I am not surprised that Deputy Haughey, Deputy Lenihan and other members of Fianna Fáil see what I did in the light of political back-stabbing.  They have operated at <Col N="1824" /> that level of politics for so long it is difficult for them to adjust their minds to the fact that there is another level of politics.</P>
      <P>The reason I resigned was because I believe passionately that the natural resources of the country are the property of the people and should be used to the maximum for their benefit.  Apart from the Dublin Gas deal there is, as Deputy Haughey pointed out, very considerable potential for the country in the whole energy area.  I am somewhat reassured by the fact tht the Leader of my party is now going to be in charge of our energy policy. The point is that a deal has been done which gives a small number of people in the private sector the opportunity of becoming very very rich with little or no capital risk to themselves and with very substantial money provided by the taxpayer. I found that totally objectionable and if that was the criterion which was going to be used regarding our other natural resources, existing or potential, I felt it was an issue that justified my action, which I did not take lightly or with any relish.  It is of such fundamental importance to the people and to generations to come that it was necessary to take this action to give me the freedom that I could not have as a member of the Cabinet when I had to observe confidentiality and bear collective responsibility.  I believe that that purpose will be achieved because, unlike Deputy Haughey, I do not believe that the only people who are interested or concerned about the disposal of our natural resources are raving red revolutionaries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I believe that this issue and the way it is debated in this House will be a matter of concern shared by people right across the political spectrum <Col N="1825" /> and that, irrespective of what Government are in power, the people will be so alterted that no Government will be able to dispose of our national resources to small groups of people whose only interest is to make themselves wealthy at the expense of the people.</P>
      <P>Deputy Lenihan said that if this was a question of principle it was in existence when I took office.  It certainly was there, it was negotiated by the administration of which he was a member and it was a worse deal than that which I am now rejecting.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that later. I have a responsibility to be as fair to Deputy Haughey as to anybody else and I will give details.  I first came into contact with this deal in early January of this year because its pricing mechanism was the responsibility of my Department.  Having looked at the deal, which was very complex, and realising its full implications, I alerted the Government to my fears with regard to it.  As a result of discussions within the Government it was renegotiated and improved on on two occasions. Therefore, it is strange to hear Deputy Haughey saying that he is going to watch the oil situation and all our other natural resources.  He did not make such a good job of it when he was in office.</P>

      <P>As a result of that, there was a supplementary agreement which gave them even more of the people's resources and that was initialled by the Fianna Fáil administration three days before they left office.  There is no joy in <Col N="1826" /> this for Fianna Fáil.  I do not regard this as a matter of party politics but it is important that the full facts are known and that the people know what has happened to a part of their natural resources and, more importantly, what could happen to the rest.</P>

I do not even regard them as an effective Opposition.</P>
      <P>I have had to make a hard decision.  As I have stated, the only reason for my making that decision is my belief that the motivation for it is something that can be achieved.  Irrespective of which party are in Government, once the people realise what has happened to a limited extent and what could happen to the rest of our national resources, no Government will be able to hand over those resources to a small number of private individuals. That is the whole basis for my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I take this opportunity of wishing Deputy Cluskey well in the situation in which he finds himself and to wish well also to Deputy Quinn.  However, it is not the proposed appointment of Deputy Quinn to the Cabinet that is the most significant factor in today's announcements.  By far the most significant factor is the departure of Deputy Bruton from the Energy portfolio and the filling of that post by the Tánaiste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One can think of many reasons for this situation but in my contribution I wish to consider a couple of aspects of it.  Without going into detail I wish to make a couple of general observations about what has been said by Deputy Cluskey and by newspaper commentators and others in <Col N="1829" /> the past number of days in relation to Dublin Gas.  For several days I was mystified as to why the then Minister, Deputy Bruton, made no attempt to make the facts known or to seek to defend the Government's decision but on Sunday I discovered what the reason was.  It was because of there having been a most peculiar vote within the Cabinet in which, apparently, the Taoiseach decided, incredibly, to abstain.  In these circumstances it was understandable that Deputy Bruton should be reticent.  It is understandable also, I suppose, that he should now have departed from the scene in the light of that.  Obviously, the situation could not continue from either point of view.</P>
    <P>There have been references by Deputy Cluskey and by newspaper commentators to figures of between £126 million and £174 million of taxpayers' money being invested in Dublin Gas.  I understand that the actual amount in this regard is £600,000 and that the remainder relates either to contingent guarantees or to price rebates.  If a price rebate to a premium user of gas is to be described as the investment of public money, we have a situation in which each year the Irish taxpayer is investing £60 million in NET because NET are buying gas at a rebate that is so great that the rebate price to Dublin Gas is three and a half times that at which it is supplied to NET.  Is it perhaps for ideological reasons or for reasons of principle that there is no criticism of a rebate of £60 million per annum being made to NET?  Is it because they are a State company or is there any other difference?  Similarly, even the rebate price at which gas is supplied to the Dublin consumer is more than the price at which it is being supplied to the ESB but because the ESB is State-owned, this investment of millions of pounds per annum is considered to be all right while the Dublin Gas consumers, of whom there are 110,000 and of whom we hope there will be many more, do not seem to have any rights.</P>
    <P>This has been described as a hand-over of that amount of cash to a small number of shareholders in Dublin Gas.  If, as Deputy Cluskey and others would have us believe, the company are getting £126 <Col N="1830" /> million or even £174 million, why has not the share price of Dublin Gas shot up? Why has it not soared in the way that Atlantic Resources, for example, have soared?  Instead, it has remained stable at 85 to 90 pence in the past fortnight while all these figures were being talked about.  The market does not regard Dublin Gas as having got any great bonanza. In any event, the company exist for the benefit of the consumer.  Are the consumers to be done out of a reasonable price level for the gas they will consume in Dublin?  Are they wrong because they have to buy gas at three and a half times what NET have to buy it for?  The investment, as I understand it, that was described as having been put in by the State into NET was £130 million or £140 million capital which had to go into the building of the plant and so on, a tragically large sum, but nobody suggested that the enormous price rebates which are three and a half times the size of this that will go every year to NET are investments by the Irish taxpayer.  They are not, and if they are not for one certainly they are not for the other.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Cluskey made clear today, and in interviews on radio, television and with the newspapers which I heard or read, he is obviously at least as concerned about the future as he is about the past. Perhaps the truth is that he is more concerned about the future than he is about the past because hopefully &mdash; we all touch wood at the very thought of this &mdash; we may be on the verge of a worthwhile significant oil discovery.  We are entitled at this stage, when the Minister for Energy has been dismissed and is being replaced by the Tánaiste, to ask ourselves something about the way in which the preliminary aspects of the management of that find have gone.</P>
    <P>The principal Irish company involved in that block, 49.9, is a company called Atlantic Resources.  The company is of recent origin, having been formed in 1981, but already it has become the fourth largest company in Ireland.  It is set fair to become perhaps the third, second or, for all I know, even the largest company within a short time.  In 1981 the <Col N="1831" /> State got 5 per cent of that company but the State today has 2.3 per cent.  In May 1983 the State had 5 per cent of the company but today it has 2.3 per cent.  By allowing its holding in that company to reduce by more than half in the seven months since last May the Government of which Deputy Cluskey up to recently was a member have lost directly as a result of that more than £1 million for the Irish taxpayers.  They have failed within the last week to take any of the placing of shares carried out by the company in rather unusual circumstances, to say the least of it.  We are entitled to ask either the outgoing Minister for Energy or the incoming Minister of that Department why that is so.  We are entitled to ask also the incoming Minister for Energy how the Government propose to vote at the AGM of that company on 23 December and whether the Government propose to give their further approval &mdash; they have already approved the issuing of the letter in relation to the placing &mdash; at the meeting to the placing of these shares in the rather strange circumstances in which they have been placed.</P>
    <P>It is no harm to remind the House that these shares were placed privately by the directors of the company on 28 November last at £6 per share and after the placing the price of the shares still remained at £9 and the price of the shares last night was £9.35.  On the 140,000 shares which the State then held they would have been entitled <i>pro rata</i> to a placing of 140,000.  Their profit on each one of those would have been £3.35p as of today.  They chose not to take them up.</P>

About a month ago I made a speech, before I knew any of this was coming, as to the general approach we should make in relation to the development of oil if it should prove to be available in commercial quantities off Waterford.

      <P>I have already done so. It was the letter of 7 December 1983 from the chairman of Atlantic Resources Limited, page 4, last paragraph.  The speech I referred to suggested in a general way how the State should approach the exploitation and development of the oil resources off Waterford and it was responded to in a slightly curious way. Perhaps I got nearer to the bone at a time than even I thought.  One of the suggestions I made was that under no circumstances should a Government agree to any production method or system or licence which did not ensure that we took the 50 per cent of the oil to which we are entitled.  I also made the suggestion that under no circumstances should we allow any of that oil to be landed other than in Ireland and that we should insist that it should be refined in Whitegate.  My suspicions at the time of private talks that were going on at that stage between certain members of the Fine Gael party and that company tend to be borne out to some extent by what was said in the letter I have quoted.  While I have no doubt that Deputy Cluskey feels strongly about Dublin Gas, this matter is essentially much more important.  Suddenly this afternoon, with one sweep of the Taoiseach's hand, the whole ball game has changed.  We shall have to wait some days, perhaps even weeks, for the equilibrium to be found again.  Indeed it must be a worrying time in the boardrooms of certain companies at present to try to find out where the centre of gravity will be over the next few weeks.  Apparently Deputy Cluskey certainly hopes &mdash; and he gave grudging acceptance, as I understood it from what he said here &mdash; that the centre of gravity will be very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It will be of considerable significance also perhaps in relation to the Navan zinc/ore body, which is a matter that we <Col N="1834" /> had out in this House at very great length seven years ago and which possibly we may have to have out again at great length in the not too distant future.  It is worth reminding ourselves that the man who did what was perhaps the most disastrous deal of all ever in Irish natural resources &mdash; it is now accepted as such; I described it as such at the time but I do not think it was accepted but is now &mdash; was not the leader at the time but virtually Mr. Labour Party himself, the then Deputy Just in Keating, whom we are told may well hope to benefit from one of the subsidiary changes that were made today as a result of Deputy Cluskey's magnaminity of last week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On two or three occasions such as this in the House in the last three years I made a suggestion to the Taoiseach that his decision of June 1981 to divide the old Department of Industry and Commerce in two was a very wrong decision, that it would have serious consequences for our industrial development and the development of our trade.  I have been proven to be right.  The decision was taken in the first place for the wrong reasons.  It is being rectified today, albeit for the wrong reasons again, in order to place people suitably for political purposes. <Col N="1835" /> At least it bears the advantageous by-product that it gets back together again a Department that should never have been sundered, that the Department of Energy is left on its own, as was the original decision of December 1979, which proved to be a correct one and will prove to be a correct one again.  It will prove to be a correct one in principle. Whether it will prove to be a correct one because the portfolio will now be held by the Tánaiste, Deputy Spring, remains to be seen.  I do not want to criticise a man in advance of his undertaking a particular job in the Government.  I wish him well in his efforts in the national interests.  But certainly his efforts in the Department of the Environment over the past 12 months do not inspire great confidence in me as to how he will get on in the future.  I hope for the sake of the country that he will be substantially more successful in the Department of Energy than he was in the Department of the Environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to rise in this debate but I wish, if I may, to comment briefly on some of the points made by Deputy O'Malley, not in regard to Dublin Gas but in regard to the general question of oil exploration and development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that no decisions have been taken by the Government, nor were they taken by me, even in my own mind, let alone expressed to anyone else as to the approach that one would take to the development of what may be a commercial oil find off the Waterford coast.  The simple fact is that it is too early yet to know the extent of the find, the extent of its commerciality or indeed the marginality of its commerciality.  Until one has that information it simply is and was not possible for decisions to be taken of any kind one way or another.  Deputy O'Malley seemed to be inferring, from very flimsy evidence, certain attitudes on my part to this matter.  No such attitudes have been formed.  Therefore, there is no evidence for his apparent inference that some statements made by other people <Col N="1836" /> were indicative of my attitude in the matter.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by him also, I think, and significance was attempted to be attributed by him to the failure of the Government to take up certain share options in Atlantic Resources.  As the House is aware, the Government, through the Geological Office, have available to them inside information not available to outside investors about the nature of the find in question.  It was a reasonable decision on the part of the various Government Departments concerned that the Government would not get involved in what one might describe as share dealings in a company, the true extent of whose assets, or the true extent of whose worth was not yet known.  Its worth as a company is not known until obviously one knows the extent of the commerciality or otherwise of the oil find in which the Government have a share. Clearly I think it would have been misinterpreted, or open to misinterpretation, had the Government engaged in the purchase of shares in the company, even on an option basis, in that people would say: &ldquo;Aha, the Government must know something.  It must be a good idea for the Government to make these investments.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Equally I could jump to the conclusion that the Government must know something and did not go in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the normal situation for a Government in the course of their activities is not to engage in speculation in shares on the stock market.  No Government usually gets involved or engages in speculation in shares on the stock market.  It would have been a departure from normal practice if it were to so become, a particularly unwelcomed departure in view of the fact that things would be inferred from this decision on the basis that the Government had or were in a position to have information of a particulary privileged kind in regard to the matter by virtue of their control over the Geological Office and the petroleum affairs division of the Department of Energy.  Those are the factual reasons for <Col N="1837" /> the attitude taken by the Department and by me in that regard.</P>
      <P>It is important that I should reiterate, for the benefit of everybody in the House, that no decisions had been taken one way or the other in regard to the terms on which our oil resources, if commercial, would be developed because it would simply be too early to make such decisions in the absence of much more precise information as to the extent of the find. I merely intervened to put that on the record quickly before people might draw certain incorrect conclusions from some of the statements made by Deputy O'Malley.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few remarks on the motion before the House and to indicate a certain unease which has been growing for some considerable time in regard to the activities of the Government.</P>
      <P>We were told that the present crisis was provoked by the gas deal.  We were told, and to my mind this is completely without precedent, how the debate went within the Government, who voted for and who voted against.  We did think that the country had a Government at which this kind of business would be conducted as it is supposed to be on behalf of the nation.  Then we have the George Orwell <i>1984</i> element arising.  It was leaked to the press that the Taoiseach did not vote. The Leader of the Fianna Fáil Party indicated what that meant from his point of view in terms of giving leadership in Government.  I refer to the use of the media, because this piece of information was released, obviously did not go down too well with the media and then we had the people in charge of publicity for the Taoiseach and the Government coming out saying that he had a definite view and that he supported the deal that was made.</P>
      <P>We have reached an Orwellian situation already as far as the media are concerned and it might not be any harm to say that people are aware of the fact that this is going on, even if the Taoiseach is not aware himself that he may very well be manipulated by very clever public relations officers who deal with the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> Earlier, we were a little perturbed when we heard on a certain occasion that Deputy Cluskey was in Government Buildings, that he was in the Custom House, that the Tánaiste was in the Custom House, that the two of them then arrived at Government Buildings, all arising from a weekend statement about a cut of £500 million in the Estimates.  It became difficult to know what kind of game was being played, whether it was hide and seek, and it looked like that, or blind man's buff.  Deputy Cluskey said he was not leaving the Government because he saw the writing on the wall.  I do not believe it was the writing on the wall that was worrying Deputy Cluskey but the writing in the Book of Estimates.</P>
    <P>Many things worried the Opposition during the last few months about promises made by the Government and not adhered to.  First of all they were rather surprised in farming constituencies that the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach were falling down on the super-levy issue in Europe.  Now we know why.  Too much Government time and energy were taken up with this internal and very important ideological debate within the Government.  That is why we had a late but heavy impact from the Minister for Agriculture and an itinerary by the Taoiseach at the very end of the super-levy campaign.  All our constituents had been asking us what was happening, was there anyone standing up for them?  Obviously, the people who should have been standing up for them were involved in an ideological row which only surfaced when Deputy Cluskey, on a point of principle he said, left the Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am probing why certain Government action was not undertaken during a considerable period.  It did not become apparent to me until I heard the speech of Deputy Cluskey and various explanations from the Government.  I think Deputy Cluskey is going for several <Col N="1839" /> reasons, but the substantive reason is what we will be seeing in the near future &mdash; I do not know when we will see it.  We were promised it in September when Deputy Bruton in his zeal told us we would have the Book of Estimates that month; we were promised it in October, in November and we are now in December but we have not seen it.  I am convinced that Deputy Cluskey, a wily man, had a look at the book and he is running like hell so that he will not be responsible for what will happen when the Book of Estimates is published, because the areas that are under attack &mdash; we have been told they are under attack &mdash; are areas in which a Labour Minister should have special concern, particularly Education and Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>Deputy Bruton has been deprived of the very important Department of Energy.  I remember that grand old Cato of Fine Gael, Deputy Kelly, being stripped of power in order to passify the yearnings of Deputy Michael O'Leary to have important up-front portfolios in the previous Government.  Deputy O'Leary was given charge of the very important Department of Energy.  It was only a step from the Department of Energy to the Fine Gael Whip.  Deputy O'Leary took that step.  I do not want to try to be a prophet but it looks to me as if the Tánaiste is now being installed in the Department of Energy as a prelude to moving over to take the Fine Gael Whip. This also could be a reason for Deputy Cluskey removing himself as quickly as possible from the Government which, as he sees it, are compromising Labour Party policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Programme for Government, I suggest, contains some of the philosophical elements of the Labour Party, some elements from the Fine Gael centre, and from those elements Government legislation and action were to flow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently a biography of Seán Lemass, former Taoiseach, was published and a basic question was very prominent when <Col N="1840" /> he was conducting the affairs of Industry and Commerce.  It is important that a political party should have clear views on how they see the role of semi-State bodies and private enterprise in our economy. Seán Lemass had that clear vision and I maintain that the party on this side of the House still have that clear vision and will support and sustain semi-State companies when it is necessary, when private enterprise falls down in any sector in the economy.  In such circumstances we see it as the duty of the Government either to sustain the semi-State companies already there or to create new ones.  I am only making a pitch for an efficient, well run and if possible, having regard to the economic conditions prevailing, profit making companies which would help to sustain the State.</P>
    <P>In his speech, Deputy Cluskey said that the disposal of our natural resources to the private sector is not part of the Programme for Government between the two parties now in Government.  On that basis it is quite clear that what Deputy Cluskey said &mdash; its logic is overwhelming &mdash; is that his colleagues are remaining in Government and sustaining a policy which is not Labour policy or part of the agreed Programme for Government upon which the Government are acting.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste is a courteous Member of the House, a personable Member, but I am afraid that the same thing the Government, with a vast majority of Fine Gael members, have done in relation to Deputy Cluskey they also did in relation to the Tánaiste.  The carpet has been worn in the last six months by delegations &mdash; and I was on two of them &mdash; to the Minister for the Environment to try to get some money for the local authorities to run their affairs.  Did the Government see to it that that money was available to this Labour Minister who also holds the constitutional position of Tánaiste?  They certainly did not.  The Labour Minister for the Environment and Tánaiste was screwed by his colleagues in Government so far as the provision of finances for local government were concerned.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey is right to cast a sceptical eye on the activities of this Government in relation to semi-State bodies.  I <Col N="1841" /> do not have to list the various semi-State bodies which have come under the strictures of this Government since they took office.  It is not long since we debated the totally indefensible attack made on Udarás na Gaeltachta by another Fine Gael Member of the Government.  The semi-State body which runs the Tuam factory is watched with a wary eye.  If there is an ideological urge against public ownership or semi-State bodies in the Fine Gael Party and the Fine Gael Members of the Government, the Labour Party will have to resist it in the same way as Deputy Cluskey resisted it.  There is no better way than to say: &ldquo;That is not part of our policy.  That is not part of our philosophy.  We are leaving you to it.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I maintain that I am making points very relevant to this debate.  I have not time or I might argue with the Chair in a civil fashion that the basic problem is that of private enterprise and the semi-State sector of the economy.  On several occasions this has surfaced as a cnámh spáirne within the Government.</P>
      <P>In his brief contribution Deputy Mac Giolla said that stability in Government was good for the conservative element of our society but bad for the workers.  I am inclined to agree with him.</P>
      <P>The basic economic objective of this Government, as stated over and over again, has been to eliminate inflation. That is a desirable objective, provided everything else is not forgotten in the attempt to bring down inflation or eliminate it altogether.  There was a period in the history of the world when inflation was killed over a decade and we had the largest number of unemployed people ever.  I am talking about the depressed period of the thirties.  At the end of the thirties, £1 would buy more than it would at the beginning of the thirties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the 200,000 who are unemployed would not be satisfied with a passing reference.  The 11 Fine Gael and four Labour Ministers who are charged with running the country should be addressing themselves to that as of now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <P>We are talking about an appointment to the Government which arises because of a resignation from the Government on what the Deputy called a point of principle.  I am pointing out some of the illogicalities in his statement. He said there was an agreed policy for Government, and that this particular exercise was not part of that agreed policy between the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party.  Everybody knows that. Everybody heard Deputy Cluskey saying that.  Therefore the most important object of this debate must be to decide clearly in our own minds where we stand on that point.</P>
      <P>It seems to everybody that Deputy Cluskey has come to the conclusion that a balanced view with regard to semi-State bodies will not be entertained by the Government due to the predominance of the Fine Gael Party in that Government. That is a recipe for the instability, the inertia and the lack of action we have had over a wide range of Government activities. That is the point I am making.</P>
      <P>I did not wish Deputy Quinn well in his new portfolio.  I do so now.  I pointed out certain weaknesses which were apparent in that portfolio up to now.

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the cause for the resignation of the former Minister, Deputy Cluskey, has not been explained fully.  The public are not fully aware of precisely what the argument is behind Deputy Cluskey's resignation.  I accept that he resigned on very honourable, high-minded and dignified grounds, but we have a right to know precisely what caused this step to be taken.  I doubt very much that the public are aware of <Col N="1844" /> the reasons for the resignation.  They have gone completely over everybody's head.</P>
      <P>Today we heard contradictory arguments put by Deputy O'Malley who seemed to indicate that the matter is much more trivial than is being suggested. I do not know whether that is the case.  We have a right to know and I hope the issue will be cleared up.</P>
      <P>I want to congratulate the new Ministers on their appointments and the Ministers who have had different responsibilities transferred to them.  I welcome the merging of the Department of Industry with the Department of Trade Commerce and Tourism.  That is a very welcome move.  It would have been welcomed in its own right without the resignation of the political head of the Department.  I hope that only technical problems exist to prevent a change in the name of the Department from the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism to something more realistic like the Department of Trade and Tourism.  That would be helpful.</P>
      <P>In merging the Departments the Taoiseach might give some consideration to adding Fóir Teoranta to the agencies responsible to the Department.  It would be helpful if one Minister had all these agencies under his own guidance and if the Minister having responsibility for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism would give all those agencies together a mutual sense of direction and orientation. I do not want to be critical of those agencies but it is very difficult when there are different agencies working for different Ministers to get the kind of efficient response which is needed from all three agencies when occasionally they are required to intervene if companies are being attracted to invest here or if companies are in difficulty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach will consider allocating responsibility for Fóir Teoranta to the new Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and that he will charge that Minister with responsibility for bringing in an employment policy as part of an industrial policy which will preclude any inefficiencies or sluggishness on the part of the State, the Civil <Col N="1845" /> Service, legislative committees or agencies. All stops must be pulled out to ensure that the maximum is done for employment.</P>
    <P>Instead of eliminating the current budget deficit over a fixed period as the Central Bank are suggesting, there is an argument to be made that the current budget deficit should be reduced to an acceptable percentage of GNP in favour of a fuller employment policy.  I know that this is more relevant to the Adjournment Debate but I believe that the guidelines set down by the Central Bank in December 1982 were very worthy. However&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we have to take account of social costing and social accounting.  I do not believe that the division of responsibility for Trade and Commerce from Industry lends itself to the sort of accounting we should be doing.  The new Minister should be given exceptional powers to deal with the unemployment problem and if that means a change of policy in other areas, particularly in relation to the current budget deficit, the Government should not be afraid to take that step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government should govern strongly and the new Ministers should be given responsibility and made account for that responsibility so that the wishes and desires of this House and of the Government are implemented throughout the public service.  Every possible power should be used to further the cause of employment and to eliminate obstructions to the maintenance of employment and the creation of further employment. I hope the Taoiseach will charge each Minister and Minister of State with that responsibility primarily.  I hope procedures for getting ministerial recommendations before the Cabinet will be seriously overhauled and that a speedy machinery will be devised for bringing forward such recommendations, particularly when they relate to employment. I hope the Taoiseach and Ministers will <Col N="1846" /> take cognisance of the need to remove all inefficiencies and obstacles regarding employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of those concerned, I thank Deputies for the congratulations <Col N="1847" /> offered on their appointments. The reallocation of functions in the area of industry, trade, commerce, tourism and energy has been carried out on its own merits in the light of experience and in the light of developments in the energy area.  In fact, the changes involved and the reallocation of responsibilities were in contemplation for several months past and would have occurred in any event, probably in January, had they not been brought forward necessarily by the event of Deputy Cluskey's resignation.  I would add that the range and importance of the functions undertaken by Deputy Bruton are unaffected in the redistribution of functions within the overall area and leave the position unchanged, contrary to suggestions made by some speakers.</P>
      <P>On an extraneous point, the attack on the Tánaiste in relation to the building industry, while we all know that we are going through a deep recession which affects the building industry more than most, it is worth making two points.  The drop of 7 per cent in housing completions that occurred last year under Fianna Fáil was halted in the first half of this year. Secondly, in the four months to November cement sales were 13.5 per cent up on the previous four months and the index of cement sales jumped from 119 to 136 points between October and November alone.  That is not to say that the position of the building industry is satisfactory&mdash;of course it is not, inevitably in the present crisis.  A one-sided picture has been given and it is right that I should correct it to that extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allegation has been made that I abstained in the vote in Cabinet.  I do not know the source of this allegation.  There may be occasions when consensus in Government is such as scarcely to require a formal statement of his position by the Taoiseach.  Very often decisions are arrived at easily or simply and it would be absurd to put one's position on the record each time.  If any people think that an issue of this kind falls into that category, or that I would so consider it, they are totally mistaken.  I do not know the source of this allegation; it is not correct. <Col N="1848" /> It would be improper for me to say more or to say anything as to how I judged this issue or what my view or the view of anybody else in Government was, but I am entitled to repudiate that allegation, upon which the Opposition based so much of their attack, although perhaps that is too strong a word.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Did the Taoiseach instruct or authorise his press officer&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am speaking for myself alone here and I will say no more than that on the subject.  It would be improper to do so.  Deputy Cluskey has answered effectively the allegations that his resignation related to any issue other than that of which he spoke.  The House knows Deputy Cluskey long enough to realise that he is a man who says what he thinks and does not hide his thoughts.  I need say no more on that subject.  He has made his position clear.</P>
      <P>To return to the central issue which brought about his resignation, before we left office in 1982 we took a general decision. The Leader of the Opposition has tried to suggest that we had entered into a detailed agreement, by the terms of which they were then bound.  The decision we took was a general one, that Dublin Gas Company should be encouraged to implement their modernisation programme increasing gas sales in Dublin by a certain factor within a five to eight year period and that, subject to performance being satisfactory, sufficient gas should be allocated to the company accordingly and that, subject to agreement on price and other details of the contract with Bord Gáis Éireann, an assurance of a supply of gas to replace the Dublin Gas Company's approximate present requirement of naphtha feed-stock should be given.  That decision, in principle, was the only decision which we took.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The negotiations with a view to seeing whether satisfactory terms as required could be achieved was carried out by our predecessors in Government.  They negotiated an agreement which they signed and a supplemental agreement which, if I recall correctly, they initialled and five <Col N="1849" /> days before the Government changed they authorised the sending of a letter to the Dublin Gas Company of indication of intent.  We inherited this position and formed the view, on examining what had been done, that that involved an agreement onerous on the State and unduly favourable to the interests concerned. Accordingly, we set about renegotiating that agreement.  That renegotiation has involved an increase in the State's share of ordinary profits from 50 to 56 per cent and the introduction of a totally new clause to transfer to the State a larger share of any profits made in excess of the stated rate of return.</P>
    <P>The effect of these two elements of renegotiation are that in 1991 on the base case&mdash;that is assuming that things proceed in accordance with the estimates that have been made&mdash;on that hypothesis, the shareholders' proportion of profits would now be £3 million out of £30 million, as against the £6¼ million under the terms negotiated by Fianna Fáil.  The scale of the difference between the two shows the gross inadequacy of the negotiation by the previous Government which left such a share of profits in the hands of private shareholders beyond that amount necessary to secure agreement. That has been proven by the renegotiation which we undertook, despite the disadvantages under which we laboured because of the initialling of the supplemental agreement and the issue of the letter of 9 December.</P>
    <P>We also negotiated an increase in the State's voting rights, shareholding and board representation, the right to nominate the chairman of the board for the first two and a half years and the right to appoint an officer responsible to the Minister for Industry and Energy to oversee the implementation of the development and conversion programme so as to minimise the risks of the project to the State. These are substantial measures of renegotiation. They were reported to the Government at the meeting at which the decision was finally taken.  There remains one matter in respect of which some dissatisfaction&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to continue and to tell the House the circumstances in which the resignation occurred.  This renegotiation was carried out.  There remained one matter in respect of which dissatisfaction was felt &mdash; that is the hardship clause in relation to a situation where the targets were not met under which representations could be made to the Government for alleviation of the terms. It appeared to the Government that this clause, because of its wording &mdash; another deficiency of the negotiation by our predecessors &mdash; might be open to some interpretation which would leave some obligation on the Government.  That clause has now also been renegotiated following that Government meeting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cluskey took the view that, despite the improvements in the terms and despite the Government's renegotiation of the hardship clause which was under way at the time of his resignation, nonetheless the terms as finally agreed did not measure up to his criteria and he felt that they were not satisfactory, a view he was entitled to and an honourable <Col N="1851" /> view.  On that basis, he took the honourable decision to resign from the Government. I am entitled to make quite clear the extent to which we found an unsatisfactory agreement and improved upon it radically during the period in office when we had the chance to do so.  I am very glad that we had that opportunity and that the situation has not been left as it was when the Government changed a year ago.</P>
    <P>There are some in Fianna Fáil who will find it difficult to understand a decision to resign on a point of principle.  That is not true of all.  There is an honourable record there.  Deputy Smith resigned many years ago on a point of principle. More recently, Deputy O'Malley and Senator O'Donoghue did so.  Others in Fianna Fáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Indeed, the then Deputy Boland did so and I am glad to be reminded of that fact.  Others did not so resign in similar circumstances and other action had to be taken.  However, that tradition of honourable resignation on a point of principle, which is one that members of both parties at different times have taken very seriously indeed, has been pursued by Deputy Cluskey, as he was entitled to do.  I respect that tradition.</P>

I am not too sure as to what implications might be taken from what he said.  I am sorry that he is not present at the moment.  I believe that I judge Deputy O'Malley correctly in that he would not wish to imply that in a matter of the use of our natural resources, the property of the people, this Government over which I have the honour to preside would do other than act in that interest and in no other interest whatever.  I would hope that that is accepted by him and by others.  That would be the sole consideration influencing the decision.  It is open at any time to anybody to fault a decision taken, as we fault the decision taken by our predecessors with regard to Dublin Gas which we had to retrieve.  Mistakes can be made and may have to be retrieved.</P>

      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £69,900,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>

      <P>I understand that there is an agreement that the major debate will take place during the Adjournment Debate on Thursday and Friday, but in view of the magnitude of this almost £70 million I would like the Minister to give us a breakdown of what the money is needed for.  I understand that at the beginning of the year during the Social Welfare Bill the Minister told us that the Government had allocated £31 million extra to cater for the needs of those who would become unemployed during the year.  Does that figure of £70 million include moneys for a further number of people who have become unemployed during the year?  We have told the Government on many occasions that their economic policies would lead to much greater unemployment.  I will not develop that now because it will come up on the Adjournment Debate, but I would like the Minister to clarify one point.  Last Wednesday here in the House when answering questions the Minister stated that the double payment at Christmas time would be the same as in 1982.  Can we take it from that that there will be a double payment for the child dependants of those on short-term benefits such as those on unemployment assistance and those on disability benefit?</P>

      <P>The following is a breakdown of the £69.9 million.  The main amounts are the double week's payment of £17.18 million in total.  There is a shortfall in PRSI this year also of £35.5 million and there is an additional cost in terms of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit of £20 million.  There has been a higher take-up of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit against the <Col N="1857" /> amounts estimated.  I stress that these estimations were towards the end of 1982 and incorporated in the 1983 Estimates. Increases arise, therefore, in all three sections of the Vote, namely, administration, social insurance and social assistance; and there are some offsetting savings, for example the amount spent on the subsidy for private rented dwellings, and also the 5 per cent increase in unemployment assistance from October of £2.3 million.  As regards PRSI, to give a final figure the total contribution income for the year was estimated at £797.5 million. It seems that receipts at the end of December will be £762 million which would leave a shortfall of £35,500,000.</P>
      <P>These are the main issues arising.  With regard to the double week at Christmas, in my reply to the Deputy last week I think there was some confusion with regard to dependants.  We discussed the question of child dependants and I undertook to check on the matter.  I have been in touch with the Deputy about it.  In terms of social assistance and disability benefit, child dependants are not included in the double week.  They were not included in 1980 or 1981.</P>

      <P>Tá mé an-bhíoch do na Teachtaí a <Col N="1858" /> labhair ar an mBille, go mór-mhór do urlabharaí an Fhreasúra ar an ábhar seo.</P>
      <P>I am very grateful to Deputies who spoke on the Bill.  Many of the points raised were interesting and constructive. As is inevitable on a Bill of this kind, the debate ranged between great philosophical issues about transport on a national plane to more parochial matters, as Deputy Tunney pointed out.  In my reply I hope to deal with as many points as possible.</P>
      <P>The most important point is that 1983 will be the best year for CIE since 1977. In real terms the deficit this year will be lower than it has been at least since 1977. That is very good news.  Those who work in CIE have to take much criticism and it is only fair that I should record my sincere congratulations to them for their performance this year.</P>
      <P>When we discussed this Bill a few weeks ago it appeared that the deficit for 1983 would be £104 million, that is £5.2 million less than last year.  That would be the first time there was a reduction in the deficit over the preceding year.  However, the latest news is even better because the monthly figures at the end of November suggest that the deficit will be of the order of £102,500,000.  In real terms that represents a reduction in the deficit of around 15 per cent, which is an incredibly good performance in a severe recession. I am sure Members on all sides will want to join with me in congratulating CIE and those people working in that organisation. We express the hope that this trend will be continued in the future, as I believe it can be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the precise details but perhaps I will have some of them for the Deputy at the end of the debate.  I must add that there are still a few weeks to go to the end of the year.  They are still projections, but that is the way they look.  It bears out my belief, which I expressed a year ago when I took up office, that great improvements could be brought about in CIE and in the Exchequer subvention without massive <Col N="1859" /> redundancies or massive cuts in services. That happened in 1983.</P>
      <P>I believe there can be further improvements in CIE without massive redundancies or massive cuts in services, although I have to admit that some of these things may be necessary.  I have said this to the board on every occasion I met them during the year and I repeated that message to them about two months ago.  We do not necessarily have to equate reductions in the deficit with redundancies or cuts in services.  There is great scope for improved worker-management relations. Everyone will accept they are not the best.  It must be emphasised again and again that all the blame for poor industrial relations in CIE cannot be laid at the door of the workers or of management. As with many things in relation to CIE, it has to be said that Governments during the years, sometimes by deed and often by omission, have added to the difficulties of CIE.  I will give one example. During 1982 CIE applied for a fare increase.  All of us want lower fares and we wish to avoid fare increases.  A decision was taken at that time that a fare increase from 1 July would not be allowed.  During the preparation of the Estimates, which were published during the election campaign, my predecessor, Deputy Wilson, courageously and honestly admitted that the Estimates implied an increase in fares from 1 January of this year.  Deputy Wilson deserves great credit for his honesty in that regard, but the effect of the delay was to add £12 million to CIE's deficit last year.  I am only citing that as an example of the omissions by Government which can add to the problems of CIE, who are then berated for the huge increase in their deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be further fare increases. There is an application at present before the Prices Commission which will have to be decided very shortly.  Bad industrial relations and bad financial results cannot be laid at the door of the workers or management or both; others must share the blame, primarily the Government.  I hope the policies we are now pursuing will help to minimise or, preferably, eliminate <Col N="1860" /> any contributions the Government have been making towards the problems of CIE.  For that reason when I become Minister I felt that we must adopt a new approach to CIE.  As I said in my opening speech I pursuaded the Government in June of this year to adopt that new approach, which I will repeat briefly because it is important.</P>
    <P>First, the Government have identified that about one third of CIE's services are social and, therefore, one third of their expenditure will be met by the Government subject to that expenditure reducing in real terms by about 2½ per cent per annum over the next five years to give a total reduction of about 12 per cent.  An expenditure reducing by 12 per cent and linked to the subvention also implies a reduction in the subvention of 12 per cent over that period.  Secondly, that subvention will, in economic jargon, be paid &ldquo;above the line&rdquo;.  I consider that very important because it affords an opportunity for CIE to make a profit.  If CIE do as well in 1984 as they did in 1983 they will achieve profits which will be a great morale booster for them and badly needed.  I have told the board on several occasions that low morale is inevitable when an organisation is being constantly berated&mdash;and I have fallen into that trap myself&mdash;but when morale suffers so do results.  Conversely, if morale improves following the achievements of this year and a hope for profits next year, that will stimulate even greater performances in CIE, better service, cheaper fares, fewer redundancies and fewer cuts in service. That is what our new policy was designed to achieve last June.</P>
    <P>For the first time CIE know in advance what their subvention will be over the next five years.  They will not have to wait until the end of December when the Book of Estimates is published to know what they are getting for the following year.  Very often decisions had been taken in the previous year or years which had cost implications for the following year.  At least now when CIE are making decisions they will have to take into reckoning the cost implications for succeeding years and how they fit into the subvention they are getting.  In addition <Col N="1861" /> to that part of our package in June was an additional decision to set up a permanent capital committee&mdash;which has been set up&mdash;whose job it will be to analyse and assess every major proposal for capital expenditure in CIE.  This is modelled on the airport construction committee which has been operating very successfully for 40 years.  I hope it will achieve better and speedier decisions and better evaluation of proposals.  The committee is comprised of officials of my Department, the Department of Finance and CIE.</P>
    <P>In June we also decided to make decisions before the end of this year on the McKinsey Report.  My proposals, as distinct from those which were in existence when I came into office, are now ready and I have had preliminary discussions with the new chairman-designate.  However, in fairness I felt I should delay bringing them to Government until he has had a few weeks to find his feet.  For that reason our decision on that will be a little later than expected, perhaps two months into the new year.  A decision will have been made in that time on the options in the McKinsey Report.  As I said in my speech, McKinsey does not make any precise recommendations on any of CIE's activities.  For instance, with regard to the railways he cites the options&mdash;keep them, expand or reduce them, or close them.  He said it is not really worth thinking about expanding or reducing them so our options are to keep or close them.  He went on to say that the system costs of either option in a ten or 25 year span is more or less the same, although it has to be said that the direct Exchequer cost of closing would be a great deal less.  Given that the railways constitute two-thirds of CIE's deficit, it is obvious that the major issue is the question of the railways, which Deputy Wilson never fails to remind everybody does not serve County Cavan&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Wilson's constituency, the headquarters of the railway are in my constituency and <Col N="1862" /> Inchicore Railway Works are almost part of my blood as I was born and reared right beside them.</P>
      <P>I want to turn to some of the points made by Deputies during the course of this debate.  Before turning attention to the longer term transportation problems in the Dublin area, I should like to refer to two issues which came in for particular comment.  These are the cheap day bus excursions to Newry being advertised by CIE and bus services in the Finglas area. As some Deputies pointed out in relation to the Newry traffic, it is anomalous on the one hand to press CIE to perform more commercially and on the other hand to complain when they try to compete with the private sector as in the case of the excursions to Newry.  Independently of this debate I have been considering this problem and have come to the conclusion that commercially, if that can be taken in isolation, CIE were correct in seeking to capture a part of this market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very keenly aware of the damage that this type of traffic can do to jobs and trade.  There can be no doubt about where my first loyalty lies.  It is most regrettable that so many people are travelling to Newry for the purpose of shopping though down through the years the situation has varied as between traffic coming southwards and traffic going northwards.  It is going northwards at present but this is something that I deprecate. However, having considered the situation and taken advice on it, I decided it would be wrong of me to make any approach to CIE on the matter because first there is the consideration that very often CIE's problems have been added to either by deed or by omission of Government.  I have made a conscious decision to try to keep out of the day-to-day affairs of the company.  As I have said, I will not be dealing with deputations in respect of day-to-day matters of CIE.  There has been too much of that.  It is not the role of the Minister or of the Government especially when pressure created in that way has had implications and has left the company in a situation of defending criticism of a deficit thus created, criticism from politicians who pressured <Col N="1863" /> the company into foregoing revenue and adding to the company costs. Therefore, I will not be interfering with CIE in relation to their Newry bus service.  That is a matter the company can decide for themselves, they have heard the widespread criticism that has been levelled against them in this regard both by Deputies and by people outside of here.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Finglas area, I must disagree with some of the views expressed.  As a percentage of the population, Finglas has no more or no fewer trouble makers than any other locality. However, the grim fact is that in Finglas bus crews have been seriously assaulted and buses damaged.  These problems will not be resolved by describing them as harassment.  They will not even be resolved by better insurance schemes for bus crews.  Though I have no direct responsibility for any particular bus service, I should like to record my concern that bus crews, whose jobs are difficult enough anyway, cannot go about their normal work of servicing the general public without fear of assault.  It is disgraceful that CIE bus crews trying to serve the genuine needs of the people of Finglas and else where should be assaulted in this manner by a small unrepresentative minority.  I very much regret that the responsible majority must suffer because of the misbehaviour of a small number.  I am hopeful that efforts by the Garda and by community leaders in the Finglas area will lead to a full restoration of services.  While I understand Deputy Tunney's concern in this matter, I considered his contribution to be lacking in terms of balance.  I cannot recall making any reference to efforts made by him or by any other public representative from the constituency to ensure that bus crews would not be attacked in future.  I say that because last year a similar problem arose in part of my constituency.  In that instance Deputies for the area went to the locality concerned, convened a meeting and were successful in mooting an effort which would ensure that there would be no repetition of attacks on bus crews.  That effort was successful and the <Col N="1864" /> bus service was promptly restored with agreement from the bus crews and from their unions.  Perhaps Deputy Tunney and the other Deputies concerned in the case of the Finglas area might try a similar effort, if they have not done so already.</P>
    <P>The longer-term transportation problems of the Dublin area have been raised in the context of the Howth-Bray scheme, developments in relation to the DTA, the Tallaght rapid transit proposal and current road policies.  I agree fully, as some Deputies suggested, that the Howth-Bray service should be marketed heavily by CIE so that the daily carryings reach the projected targets as quickly as possible.  Undoubtedly, in purely transport terms the scheme is very attractive. However, as I pointed out in my introductory remarks, the point at issue is not so much the improvement in transport itself but rather the cost at which this is being achieved.  Both the capital and operating costs of the scheme clearly underline the magnitude of transportation decisions for the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>Deputies have mentioned the CIE proposal for a rapid transit link from Tallaght to Heuston Station.  This proposal, like its predeccessor for the Howth-Bray line, derives from the recommendations of the Dublin Rapid Rail Transit Study.  I am more than well aware of the pressing demands in the Tallaght area for improvements not only to the transportation system but also to any other facilities and amenities.  We would be doing no good for the people of Tallaght if we embarked on a very costly project of this nature without being certain beforehand that the proposal was merited not just in terms of the capital investment costs but also having regard to the ongoing interest charges that will accrue from such investment. At this moment the question of Tallaght transportation is on the agenda of the permanent capital committee.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in tackling transport problems there has been a tendency on the part of various bodies to opt for high technology and costly solutions when very often something much less costly might prove equally effective.  A prime example of this are the bus lanes that have been introduced throughout <Col N="1865" /> Dublin.  It is only fair to congratulate the Dublin Transportation Task Force in this respect and also Deputy Reynolds who as Minister for Transport initiated these lanes with great gusto.  All of these bus lanes will repay their investment within three years, some well within that period. There is the question also of the competing demands for investment in either road or rail solutions of our difficulties.  These are the considerations that prompted the Transport Consultative Commission to recommend the creation of the Dublin Transport Authority.  In that regard proposals were agreed by the last Government and, while I am very committed to the introduction of a Dublin Transport Authority, I am happy with the details of those early proposals.  I am having another look at them before a decision is made.</P>
    <P>Deputies have raised questions in relation to CIE's new buses, the manufacturing arrangements at Shannon and the export prospects.  As Deputies will appreciate, the Shannon company is a private concern and I have no direct dealings with it or responsibility for it.  I am glad to confirm that a small export order is just being completed and I hope that the company's efforts to secure export orders will be successful.  The arrangements for meeting CIE's future bus needs will be influenced by the outcome of negotiations going on between the Shannon firm and CIE in relation to the board's 1984 requirements.</P>
    <P>The renewal of the school bus fleet from the mid eighties onwards is an issue which, I understand, the Minister for Education has under consideration.</P>
    <P>The poor condition of CIE's mainline rolling stock, particularly on trains to the west, has been mentioned.  As I have already told the House, CIE's carriage building programmes envisages the acquisition of 124 carriage units over the next few years.  The first train sets will be available from Inchicore before the middle of 1984, in the next six months.  I understand that it is CIE's intention to use the new stock to gradually upgrade the standard of carriages in use on the western lines, though of course the decisions <Col N="1866" /> as to which services they will be used on is a matter for the board.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly in the course of the debate repeated his rather novel suggestion that some attempt be made to get private sector involvement in the proposed Tallaght rapid rail link.  Novel as the suggestion is I know of no successful urban transit systems in which private sector interests participate directly. Given the costs involved, the lack of population density and the rather meagre revenues, I see little private sector involvement in any urban rail transit operation here.  There is, however, some potential in the bus area for private sector involvement in public transport.  The Road Transport Act, 1932, effectively governs the operation of the private sector road passenger industry in Ireland and I have initiated a review of the operation and the provisions of that Act.</P>
    <P>I should like now to refer to the transport statistics mentioned by Deputy Wilson. There are a number of trends in these statistics that are worth referring to.  In the case of railway receipts for passengers, parcels mails, etc., there was an increase of just over 5 per cent in the first four months of this year, by comparison with the same period last year.  However, when account is taken of inflation during the period, rail passenger receipts fell in real terms by almost 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>The picture for revenue from freight trains is a little more encouraging, although the revenue base is smaller than that for rail passengers.  Nevertheless, in the first four months of the year the CSO show that freight train revenue rose by 17 per cent over the comparable months of 1982.  This represents a real increase of nearly 6 per cent after account has been taken of inflation.</P>
    <P>In terms of rail passenger carryings there was a welcome increase of nearly 7 per cent in the first four months of this year.  The trend in rail freight tonnage was in the opposite direction.  The CSO show a 10 per cent drop in the first four months of the year by comparison with the same period of last year.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Wilson pointed out in his speech, the CSO have more up to date figures on road motor passenger services. <Col N="1867" /> Statistics are available for the first five months of the year.  They show that gross receipts for road motor passenger services are up over 18 per cent in the first five months of the year.  After adjusting for inflation this represents a real increase of over 6 per cent by comparison with the same period last year.  In terms of actual passenger journeys there was only a slight increase of just under 1 per cent in the first five months of the year.</P>
    <P>I do not have time to refer to all the points raised by Members but I undertake to send a detailed reply to all Members who raised issues during the debate. In regard to the Dublin passenger service I should like to tell Deputy Wilson, who asked me about the component parts of the great recovery in the position of CIE this year, the best year they have had for a long time, that I do not have the full facts.  However, I should like to tell him that one of the areas where there has been an encouraging trend was in the Dublin city passenger service.  For example, the amount of loss compared to the amount of expenditure has fallen from a figure in the region of 42 per cent in 1981 to 27 per cent.  For the first time in several years the number of passengers carried has increased.  That halt in an adverse trend is welcome and, hopefully, this new development of increased passenger numbers of Dublin buses will continue. It is not easy to be certain of the reasons for this, but three factors have contributed to it.  Firstly, with the renewal of buses there are fewer breakdowns resulting in a more reliable service.  Passengers feel more comfortable and happy travelling on the new buses.  The second factor is the introduction of bus lanes and they have helped to reduce the journey times of many buses. The third factor is that we have had fewer strikes on the Dublin bus service.  I do not have figures for this and this is only an impression I have.</P>
    <P>I should like to say to people working in CIE, particularly those working on the Dublin city services where there has been an undue number of stoppages, that one man can put up to 250,000 people walking over a trivial matter.  I appeal to CIE <Col N="1868" /> employees to stop this practice.  If there are one-man, undemocratic pickets employees should pass them.  When such strikes take place CIE lose more people than the passengers unable to use the service for the duration of such strikes.  It is because people are not sure when a strike will occur that they resort to using their cars to get to work.  If people could be sure of a comfortable and speedy bus service they would use it to a greater extent.  We could then look forward to a greater increase in passenger numbers carried.  That would greatly help the performance of the company in achieving the new targets set by the Government. It would avoid the possible necessity for cuts in service which may lead to redundancies. In fact, those employees might be saving their own jobs.</P>
    <P>Given the very encouraging trend this year there is a great incentive for all CIE employees to break out of old practices and bad habits which have not helped the position of the company in the past so that the company and the travelling public can look forward to a better future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to provide social assistance to alleviate the hardship of smallholders in need, following the abolition of the notional method of assessment.</P>
      <P>Before commencing I should like to pay a tribute to Minister of State, Deputy F. O'Brien, whom I understand is leaving the Department of Social Welfare.  I should like to thank him for his courtesy. I wish Deputies Pattison and Donnellan, who I understand are becoming Ministers of State at the Department of Social Welfare, every success during their terms of office.</P>
      <P>The reason for this motion is that smallholders and my colleagues whose names are appended to the motion believe that the Government are using the result of the High Court ruling that the poor law valuation system was unconstitutional to launch a major onslaught on the standard of living of the small farmers of the 12 western counties. Indeed, the farmers of those counties have lost confidence in the Government, as have my colleagues who appended their names to the motion.  Indeed one of their own Ministers has lost confidence. Because of a letter the Minister sent out earlier this year it is important to recognise that it was this Coalition government who abolished the notional method of assessment in the Social Welfare Bill earlier this year.  The Minister, in the course of that debate, used the High Court judgment of July 30 1982 in saying:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> ...that sections of the Valuation (Ireland) Act, 1852, were unconstitutional, the Attorney General advised that the continued use of the notional method of assessment of means is unlawful and the 1981 Act should be amended as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The first question I should like to pose to the Minister is, does that ruling apply to the distribution of benefits, in this case, social welfare benefits, which are made available through the legislative processes of this House?  Also, did the judgment include the paying out of benefits or did it refer only to the collection of tax?  As I said, it was this Coalition Government who abolished the notional system of assessment for smallholders. We are asking Deputies on both sides of the House to give consideration to the very serious implications of this decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I think we are probably violating the <i>sub judice</i> rule because, as I understand it, this decision of the High Court is on appeal to the Supreme Court.  If we were to dissect the judgment of the High Court and have a long discussion on it we would be violating the <i>sub judice</i> rule.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to say any more about it except that the comments you have made yourself, Sir, probably render the situation worse, in that the Minister has taken precipitate action in advance of the decision of the Supreme Court.  However, we shall not say any more about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister circulated a letter which received a lot of publicity in local papers around the country.  He gave the impression that it was the Fianna Fáil Government who were responsible for the abolition of the notional system when he said, in his letter dated 14 September 1983, referring to the High Court case that this position was accepted by the previous Government which took the initial action to give effect to the High Court ruling.  While the previous Government did not investigate any other smallholders under the notional system, they did not bring forward, nor had they any <Col N="1871" /> intention of abolishing the notional system altogether.</P>
    <P>It is important to recognise that it would be more realistic to recognise the small farmers' unemployment assistance as an income supplement, as a compensatory measure for farmers living in disadvantaged areas where traditionally farm incomes lagged behind those of other areas.  This is recognised not alone by our Government but by the EEC who have provided all kinds of special schemes for the western counties, for example, the western drainage scheme and the western headage payments.  This is a recognition of the fact that people in these areas are endeavouring to make a living on land totally uneconomic to work.</P>
    <P>Unemployment assistance was introduced under the Unemployment Assistance Act implemented 50 years ago this year.  While farmers could apply for unemployment assistance, provided they satisfied the necessary means test and were available for and able to work, it was not until 1966 that they were given recognition in their own right.  In that year this income supplement for smallholders in the western counties was initiated in five counties of Connacht, three counties of Ulster, in Clare, Longford and parts of Limerick and Cork where there were people living on very small holdings.  The Government of the day decided that they should introduce a notional system of assessment for such people.  That assessment was based on what has been the basic social philosophy of all Governments here, to try to retain as many people as possible on the land, rendering it attractive for as many as possible to remain on smallholdings in the west.</P>
    <P>The Report of an Inter-Departmental Committee on the problems of Small Western Farms acknowledges the difficulties in devising a system which would not have unfortunate side effects.  I am referring to a report on small western farms, published by the Government Stationery Office in 1962 in which it was said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> Some more flexible method of assessing means which would have an incentive rather than a disincentive effect should be devised.</P>
    <P>That was one of the reasons why a Bill was introduced in this House in 1965 whose provisions were implemented in 1966.</P>
    <P>We are talking about some of the very poorest people in the land, people living on small holdings.  Over the past three years we have had two by-elections in Donegal.  Practically all Members of this House, including the Minister, were in Donegal, west Donegal in particular, and saw the circumstances in which these people, about whom we are talking this evening, live.  It is fair to say that one would not have to be a social welfare officer, or an investigating officer to recognise that these people need some supplementary income to help them survive on their land.  In fact, whilst canvassing, one would need only to look over the garden gate to see the type of land, much of it bog and rock, which these people work.</P>
    <P>The people in Donegal have reared some of the finest families in the land, and that applies throughout the western seaboard.  Had it not been for the contributions through the Unemployment Assistance Acts they would not have been able to survive on the land and the west would have been denuded of many more of its population.  The legislation to give effect to the notional system was introduced in 1965 in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill by a former Member, Mr. Kevin Boland, whom I will quote during that debate:</P>
    <P>The object of the change is to make small farmers in the congested areas free to work their holdings to maximum capacity and to participate readily in all schemes designed to increase agricultural output without being concerned about losing some or all of their unemployment assistance as a result of expanding farm income arising from greater effort and enterprise on their part.</P>

      <Col N="1873" /> The Government found it necessary to introduce that legislation to ensure that farmers would be able to work on the land with the aim of getting the maximum production without having investigating officers coming along to reduce their incomes.  The debate was on 29 June 1965 and it is interesting to read the contributions of Deputies.  For instance, Deputy Declan Costello, the author of Fine Gael's &ldquo;Just Society&rdquo;, said:</P>
    <P>There are special changes in the Bill which deal with special cases of applications by smallholders for unemployment assistance.  Of course, the general idea is a good one.  I should like to know why the Minister is to restrict this benefit to areas he will define by order and why this new scheme should not be operating throughout the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>Not alone did he want it applied to the 12 western counties but he wanted it extended throughout the country. Deputy Corish, former leader of the Labour Party, listening to him, intervened, &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo;.  Deputy Tully, a former prominent member of the Labour Party, wanted to know why it was being confined to certain areas.  He, too, wanted it extended to the whole country. Deputy Crotty of Fine Gael said on that occasion:</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister has brought in sections 8 to 10 in this Social Welfare Bill which will enable people in the congested areas to work the land to the fullest capacity and to the extent of their ability, and that there will not be strict inspection of every family and every beast on the land for the purpose of a means test in relation to home assistance.</P>
    <P>They are the views of prominent and respected Members of the House when that Bill was introduced.  The circumstances are exactly the same and one can justifiably ask why the change in the social philosophy of the Coalition?  What we are trying to do now is to ensure that those who live in smallholdings, in the <Col N="1874" /> west coast particularly, will be able to survive to rear their families in confidence.</P>
    <P>There was criticism of the notional system in the early years.  The system was based on an income of £20 per £1 PLV and the rate remained unchanged until 1976.  In the early seventies the number of farmers who benefited increased from 6,958 to 24,180 in 1976.  It was realised then that perhaps some farmers at the upper end of the scale did not need this direct supplementary income and measures were taken by successive Governments to bring the system back into line. The £20 per £1 PLV was the accepted basis for those of £15 and less than £20 PLV.  That was increased to £30 per £1 and those on more than £20 PLV were credited with £40 in the £.  Those with less than £15 PLV would benefit fully.  Therefore, the imagined inequities in the scheme were eliminated.  Today one can see 118 questions on the Order Paper for written reply addressed to the Minister for Social Welfare and it makes one realise the problems of so many people coming up to Christmas.</P>
    <P>In this motion we are talking about small farmers.  In my constituency recently a small farmer came to me.  He has seven children and he was receiving £75.25 per week in the last two years. Suddenly, at 6.30 p.m. that Saturday, a social welfare officer arrived and after two weeks the farmer found himself with £6 per week.  I ask the Minister to say in all honesty how he expects anybody to manage his affairs on a small farm and seven children on £6 per week.</P>
    <P>This criticism does not come from our side of the House only.  I have a quotation from the <i>Roscommon Herald</i> of December 2 1983:</P>
    <P>Speaking at a Fine Gael District Executive meeting in Castlerea last Friday night, Senator John Connor was critical of the way Department officials are taking welfare allowances from small-holders in west Roscommon.</P>
    <P>That is the problem.  People are losing their welfare allowances, in this instance in west Roscommon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1875" /> Calling for these cases of harassment and inequities to be brought to his notice he said he would be meeting Fergus O'Brien, TD, Minister of State with a view to having these officials and faceless bureaucrats brought to heel.</P>
    <P>I hasten to add that my experience of the officials of the Department is that they do their jobs conscientiously and efficiently. I do not want to cast any reflection on the officials who do their work. They are working under the system and the regulations.  Ultimately the Minister has to take responsibility for the manner in which these people are losing their benefits.</P>
    <P>The farmer I mentioned whose benefit was reduced from £75 a week to £6 a week appealed his case.  After six months he got over £40 a week.  It is wrong that he should have to wait that length of time.  This is an indication of how the smallholders are being asked to survive. Surely a case can be made for a notional system of assessment for these smallholders.</P>
    <P>The ICMSA expressed concern about the administration of the income supplement for small farmers.  In an article in a newspaper in your own town, a Cheann Comhairle, they said:</P>
    <P>The ICMSA has achieved a significant breakthrough on the Farmers' Dole issue following a case made by the Association which met Minister of State Fergus O'Brien... Mr. O'Brien expressed concern at the situation of farmers who have had their Smallholders' Assistance suspended or restricted when the facts were outlined to him by the delegation.</P>
    <P>That appeared in the <i>Anglo Celt</i> of 2 December under the heading &ldquo;Agri-News&rdquo;. The Minister said he was most anxious to resolve the problems of the farmers concerned as quickly as possible. The Minister went on to say that the Department of Social Welfare were drafting a new assessment system which would give full recognition to all farm expenses involved in production.  The <Col N="1876" /> Minister gave the delegation his personal assurance that &ldquo;every single genuine case that ICMSA had on file involving farmers who believed they had been unfairly assessed in their entitlements to Smallholders' Assistance would be reviewed and resolved immediately&rdquo;.  The final comment is that the ICMSA hoped that would be done before Christmas.  That is right and correct because we are talking about people who are trying to manage on very small holdings.</P>
    <P>On 22 March 1983 speaking on the Social Welfare Bill, as reported in volume 341, column 455, the Minister of State said:</P>
    <P>On the question of smallholders and of doing away with the notional system, assessment on a factual basis is a fair system which will in time work out satisfactorily.  There is no question of hounding people or taking money from them.  In any welfare system there must be obvious fairness.  The administration of any welfare system has to be seen as fair.  It must also show that people in need will not be cast aside. Whatever money we have&mdash;and vast sums are being expended&mdash;it must be spent where there is hardship and necessity.  That is what we intend to do and that is what we will do.</P>
    <P>That is all very well but we have to submit that that is not what is happening.  In the 12 western counties, including your constituency and mine, a Cheann Comhairle, people are not able to survive on what they are receiving.  I was told about a case in Donegal of a girl who received a scholarship to go to the university.  She got the higher education grant but that was not sufficient for her.  She intended to go to the university but, as a result of the doing away with the notional system of assessment, their supplementary income was reduced and her parents were unable to give her the extra money necessary and she did not go to the university.  We are speaking about the difficulties people have in trying to live on some of the poorest holdings in the land.  Anybody who was at the by-election in west Donegal and saw the quality of the land knows that these people need a supplementary <Col N="1877" /> income.  In doing away with the notional system of assessment we have left these people in a much worse position. Many of them will be unable to carry on and we will have a major reduction in the population of the west.</P>
    <P>The number of people in farming has been reducing over the years.  Approximately 100,000 people have left the land since 1971.  In 1971 288,000 people were working on the land and in the 1981 census that figure was reduced to 196,000. Surely in these days of rising unemployment when we cannot create jobs, when the Government have failed to create jobs, they must adhere to the social philosophy of all Governments since the foundation of the State and ensure that people can live on the land.</P>
    <P>In the NESC document No. 41 they gave various options for amending the smallholders assessment scheme.  They recognised that the principle of income supplementation is necessary.  That is accepted in all European countries.  They pointed out that a minimum income was guaranteed to farmers in 1966.  One of their options was to abolish the notional assessment and revert to the pre-1966 factual assessment of income, which is exactly what the Minister did in the Social Welfare Bill this year.  Their comment was:</P>
    <P>From an administrative point of view, however, such a change would be more costly and time consuming.  Furthermore, a reversal to a factual means testing could be regarded as a retrograde step in welfare administration.</P>
    <P>We agree with that, but that is exactly what the Minister did.  Another option was to retain the notional basis of assessment but provide for an updating of the land valuation system as a result of the High Court action.  Perhaps the Minister is right in saying it is not possible to use that, but I would ask him to question whether this applies to the administration of social welfare schemes resulting from legislation or refers only to the collection of tax.  There is another suggestion regarding the adoption of a regional notional income providing for periodic adjustment with a base on an updated <Col N="1878" /> land valuation.  It is said that this would be more equitable than the present system. The recommendation of the NESC is as follows:</P>
    <P>From the point of view of administrators and claimants the less complex an assistance scheme is, the better.  In assessing farmers' means for small holders' assistance we recommend that regional notional incomes with a base on an up-dated land valuation be adopted and that the multipliers be adjusted periodically.</P>
    <P>There are certain anomalies which create serious problems for people who are used to being assessed on a notional basis.  To receive maximum benefit under the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme one must have no means whatsoever.  It has been suggested that people on higher valuations are doing better than those on lower valuations. Another problem with a complex method of assessment is that income is assessed on the basis of a whole year.  In the 12 western counties, in areas where the land is suitable, most of the farmers are engaged in the production of milk and hence they are getting a higher income during the summer than in the winter.  I would ask the Minister whether he believes that a farmer with a wife and two or three children who is getting £30 or £40 in unemployment assistance during the summer months would be able to save that money for the winter months.  We are speaking about people living on the poorest land and we are suggesting in the method of assessment we are using that if they have a so-called &ldquo;high&rdquo; income in the summer they should be able to save some of that money for the winter.  Surely something must be done to rectify the matter.</P>
    <P>In answer to a parliamentary question of 8 December last it was revealed that 1,141 small farmers lost unemployment assistance.  Can the Minister be sure that all those people have sufficient money coming up to Christmas, simply because they happened to have an income from milk production during the summer months?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1879" /> The same applies to board and lodgings. The Minister of State prepared a booklet earlier this year which states that there are no statutory criteria for the assessment of board and lodgings and that each case is decided on its merits. This is creating serious hardship for many people, not only in the western counties. The wife of a smallholder may go out and do a few hours work each day and her income will be taken together with her husband's if a young adult in the household applies for unemployment assistance. He or she may be credited with means of £27 or £28 per week and receive nothing by way of unemployment assistance or perhaps as little as £1.40 a week. I saw a girl cry as she asked me &ldquo;Is that all the State thinks I am worth, the price of a packet of cigarettes?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These are the problems caused by the system as operated by the Minister and aggravated by the abolition of the notional system.  We are not surprised that the situation is as it is because the whole social philosophy of this Government is totally insensitive to the needs of the people and many are unable to manage as a result of the Government's social policy.  I will not deal with the rise in unemployment resulting from Government policies.  The Taoiseach stated in this House that the policies being pursued were diametrically opposed to the policies necessary to create employment. The number of people who can expect to be out of work continues to rise.  This afternoon we passed a Supplementary Estimate for another £70 million, again as a result of total lack of judgment by this Government earlier this year.  We told them that unemployment would rise, that more people would be out of work because of their policies and that more money would be needed for unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>The Government's attitude to children is shown by the Christmas Eve announcement last year of the introduction of major charges for school buses.  There was no increase in the children's allowance this year and no double dependants' allowance for children in September, or for the children of short-term recipients <Col N="1880" /> of social welfare payments at Christmas, even though the Minister stated that the scheme this year was exactly the same as the scheme last year.  The Fianna Fáil Government last year gave a double dependant's allowance for children at Christmas.  Even that would alleviate in some way the hardship suffered by all those on low incomes, including smallholders. Increases of 10 per cent and 12 per cent are totally inadequate for those on social welfare payments.  The 5 per cent increase in October to those unemployed for more than 15 months was very meagre, costing £2 million.  It was pointed out again and again on this side of the House that the increases were totally inadequate.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to find some way of giving a direct supplementary income to smallholders on very poor uneconomic land, particularly in the western counties outlined in 1966 when the scheme was introduced.  I would ask him not to take the easy way out by abolishing the notional system and hiding under the umbrella of the High Court decision.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to face up to the reality of the situation and to give the smallholders a direct supplement so that they will be able to continue to live on the land, so that in ten years' time it will not be found that everybody has gone off the land in the west.  I ask him to look at the system and ensure that these people will be able to survive there and rear their families there.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that entitlement to unemployment assistance is now decided on a uniform basis in the case of all applicants having regard to their actual means and further notes that with a view to alleviating the position of <Col N="1881" /> unemployment assistance recipients generally the Government provided an increase of 5 per cent in the standard rates of assistance from October last to those who had been unemployed for 15 months or more, including smallholders whose entitlement to assistance was based on a factual assessment of their means.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is appropriate for me at the outset to outline the origins of the notional system of assessing the means of smallholders for unemployment assistance purposes. As we know, it was first introduced in 1965.  Prior to that smallholder applicants or unemployment assistance were treated in the same way as other applicants, that is if they satisfied the means test, if they were unemployed, available for and seeking work they were eligible for assistance. In the early sixties, however, it was proposed that a less exacting method of assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes would be more favourable to smallholders on small farms in western areas as it would enable them to work their holdings and increase their incomes without losing the unemployment assistance payments.  The method devised was to calculate farm means on a notional basis by reference to the poor law valuation of the land.  In 1965 it was, therefore; provided that in calculating means derived from the use of land in certain specified areas the yearly value would be derived from the use of land in certain specified areas the yearly value could be deemed to be £20 for every £1 of the rateable valuation of the land.  The areas specified were counties Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Longford, Monaghan, all the counties of Connacht, and the poorer parts of west Cork and west Limerick.</P>
    <P>It was considered that this method of assessment would allow smallholders in those areas to increase their production without affecting their entitlement to unemployment assistance, because as long as their valuation remained the same and provided they had no other means their assessment would remain unaltered.</P>
    <P>The motivation underlying the introduction <Col N="1882" /> of the notional system was, therefore, to stimulate increased output by smallholders in the areas concerned.  This might be regarded as something not entirely appropriate to the functions of the Department of Social Welfare.  However, at the time it was considered that because the Department had a network of local officers the most convenient mechanism to achieve the overall objective would be to operate through the social welfare system.</P>
    <P>The special arrangements for smallholders continued to operate, subject to a number of modifications, until last year. On 30 July 1982 the High Court, in an action brought by a number of farmers, gave judgement that sections of the 1852 to 1974 Valuation Acts were unconstitutional. My Department were advised by the Attorney General that the continued use of the notional method of assessing means based on rateable valuation was no longer lawful, that it should be discontinued and that the social welfare legislation should be amended as soon as possible. I would stress that the previous Government in the person of Deputy Woods took the initial action to give effect to the High Court ruling by discontinuing the application of the notional system to new smallholder applicants for unemployment assistance.  When the new Government took up office they gave effect to the legal advice which had been received by repealing the relevant sections of the social welfare legislation in the Social Welfare Act, 1983.  The Act also provided that existing recipients could continue to retain their entitlements pending reinvestigation of their means on a factual basis.  The reinvestigation process started in May 1983 and under the legislation must be completed within three years.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged when the notional system was introduced that it would encompass a relatively small number of applicants &mdash; basically those with rateable valuations under £10.  In 1965 there were approximately 8,000 smallholders on unemployment assistance based on factual means assessment and the vast majority of those were under £10 valuation. The numbers increased rapidly, <Col N="1883" /> however, in the following years.  By early 1967 the numbers had risen to over 11,500, by early 1970 to 15,500, by early 1973 to 21,000 and by early 1976 to a peak of 31,000.</P>
    <P>The main reason for this huge increase in the numbers benefiting under the scheme was the method of calculating the amount of unemployment assistance payable in individual cases.  This was done by deducting from the maximum rate of assistance the amount of means assessed. Over the years there were regular significant increases in unemployment assistance rates while means notionally assessed remained the same at a flat £20 per £1 valuation.  Consequently each annual increase in the rates of unemployment assistance widened the valuation range within which smallholders could qualify for unemployment assistance and increased the numbers covered by the scheme.</P>
    <P>As a result a whole new group of people who by no stretch of the imagination could be compared with other applicants for unemployment assistance and who by the criteria set down when the notional system was introduced would not have been covered, were brought into the scheme.  In 1976 and subsequent years, therefore, specific measures were taken to restrict the application of the scheme, measures taken by the Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments of the day.  These measures consisted of increasing the £20 multiplier for valuations over £15 in 1976 and introducing variable multipliers for different ranges of PLV in 1979, withdrawal of the notional system for those with valuations over £20 in 1977 and the exclusion of smallholders on notional assessment on a number of occasions from the budgetary increases in rates of unemployment assistance.  The measures taken were, however, on a very <i>ad hoc</i> basis and designed purely to prevent the scheme from getting totally out of control.  No consistent policy was followed from year to year and the result was unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>The result of the various measures taken to restrict the scheme over the years was that the number of smallholders <Col N="1884" /> in receipt of unemployment assistance had fallen to some 20,500 by the beginning of 1983.  Of those some 7,700 were on factual assessment of their means. Even allowing for this decrease in the overall numbers, however, it is clear that the scheme still covered a much larger number of applicants than those for whom it was originally intended.  A very significant fact regarding the number of smallholder recipients of unemployment assistance in early 1983 is the numbers who were receiving unemployment assistance based on a factual assessment of their means.  The various restrictions of the notional system over the years, and, in particular, the denial of budget increases on a number of occasions, meant that, increasingly, smallholders were finding it more beneficial to have a factual assessment and take advantage of the higher rates of assistance which applied to those factually assessed.</P>
    <P>In 1980 the budget increases in rates of unemployment assistance were withheld from all notionally assessed smallholders. If my memory serves me right, that was a Fianna Fáil decision.  They were individually advised of their option to have their means factually assessed.  About 5,000 of the 18,000 then on notional assessment availed of the option and about two-thirds of those gained as a result.  There is no doubt that the notional system, which by 1980 involved three different multipliers and three different scales of unemployment assistance rates in addition to the two standard scales &mdash; urban and non-urban &mdash; which applied to factually assessed applicants, had no clear underlying philosophy and was in need of radical reappraisal.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, apart altogether from the fact that the notional system had by the late seventies embraced a much larger number of smallholders than was originally intended, doubts were being more frequently expressed as to whether the scheme had achieved its original underlying aim of increased farm output in the areas concerned.  The point was often made that the unemployment assistance scheme, even under the notional system of assessment, still remained a disincentive to increased farm income.</P>

      <P>I would refer in particular to a number of NESC reports which pointed out that there was a definite disincentive under the notional system to acquire additional land in as much as this would increase total valuation and lead to a reduction in, if not a complete loss of, payments under the scheme. Other reports suggested that in the light of the changing scene in the agricultural sector and the introduction of other incentive schemes for farmers, such as the disadvantaged areas scheme introduced in 1975, the necessity and, indeed, desirability of the smallholders' scheme of unemployment assistance were open to question.  A great deal of concern was expressed to the effect that farmers with relatively high incomes could qualify under the scheme although they could not reasonably be regarded as in need of assistance.  In effect, the scheme has become a method of support for a limited section, though admittedly in general terms the less well off, of the farming sector.</P>
      <P>Deputies are well aware of the level of assistance organised by the State through the Department of Agriculture for the agricultural sector as a whole.  It is appropriate for me to mention here a few of the measures taken by that Department to assist farmers in disadvantaged areas, in particular, and these are still in operation.</P>
      <P>There is a headage payments scheme for disadvantaged areas.  This is part of an EEC measure whereby cattle headage, beef cow and sheep headage payments are paid to eligible farmers in certain &ldquo;less favoured&rdquo; areas.  These areas consist of counties Galway, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Cavan, Clare, Donegal, Kerry, Longford, Monaghan and parts of west Cork and west Limerick.  The Sliabh Felim area is also included and certain mountain sheep areas scattered throughout the country. The aids were introduced</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>to ensure the continuation of farming, thereby maintaining a minimum <Col N="1886" /> population level or conserving the country-side in certain less favoured areas</P>
    <P>and</P>
    <P>to encourage farming and to raise farm incomes in these areas.</P>
    <P>That is the particular purpose of the headage payment schemes in those areas.</P>
    <P>The following aids are also available in those areas for eligible farmers:</P>
    <P>(i)  Cattle Headage Scheme</P>
    <P>Thirty-two pounds is paid on each of the first eight livestock units and £28 for each of the next 22 livestock units subject to a maximum of £872.  An estimated 63,500 farmers will receive some £26 million under this scheme in 1983.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Sheep Headage Scheme</P>
    <P>The first 150 eligible ewes are paid £9.50 each and the next 50 eligible ewes are paid £6.50 each subject to a maximum of £1,750.  An estimated 18,700 farmers will receive some £9 million under this scheme in 1983.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Beef Cow Headage Scheme</P>
    <P>Thirty-two pounds is payable on the first ten beef cows and £28 on each of the next 18 beef cows, subject to a maximum of £824.  An estimated 9,600 farmers will receive nearly £2 million under this scheme in 1983.</P>
    <P>There is a programme for western development which was introduced in 1981 and which consists of a range of measures designed to alleviate the special problems of agriculture in the west of Ireland.  These aim to develop services such as electricity, water supplies and roads in as much as the living conditions of farmers and of the rural communities in those areas are in need of improvement. It applies to counties Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan, Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Sligo, Leitrim, Longford, Clare, Kerry and parts of west Cork and west Limerick.  As Deputies know the measures include:</P>
    <P>(a)  Infrastructure</P>
    <P>(i)  Rural water supply</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1887" /> (ii)  Agricultural roads</P>
    <P>(iii)  Electrification</P>
    <P>(b)  Direct Farm Aids</P>
    <P>(i)  Land Improvement grants at a rate of 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>(ii)  On-farm investment grants of 40 per cent for farm buildings and 30 per cent for fixed equipment.</P>
    <P>(iii)  An interest subsidy for two years on borrowings of up to £100 for each beef calf reared to fattening stage.</P>
    <P>(c)  Forestry</P>
    <P>(d)  Agriculture</P>
    <P>(e)  Agricultural Marketing and Processing</P>
    <P>In all, if one takes the 1981 prices, the injection is no less than £300 million of particular benefit to these areas to ensure the maintenance of farm income and of the many smallholders in the area.</P>
    <P>I must also have regard to the criticism frequently put that the smallholders' scheme was inequitable by comparison with the scheme as it applied to unemployed people generally, all of whom are subjected to factual means assessment. Many people object to means tests but they do represent a reasonably fair way of allocating scarce resources and are likely to be with us for some time to come.  I consider that the operation of the means tests should be and should be seen to be equitable as between the different categories of people to whom they apply. The overall cost of unemployment assistance in 1984 will be over £260 million and the numbers of people long-term unemployed and dependent on unemployment assistance is a matter of grave concern.  I want to ensure that the resources available to me are used in the fairest way and to the best possible effect.</P>
    <P>In the light of the experience to date therefore and bearing in mind the necessity in present circumstances to make the best possible use of the limited resources available, I am convinced that the fairest system for applicants for unemployment assistance is the one which we will have <Col N="1888" /> in future, namely, a system in which the means of all applicants will be assessed on a factual assessment basis and their entitlements determined accordingly. Factual assessment of means is just that &mdash; an attempt to assess the factual situation as far as income is concerned.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words about what factual assessment of means actually involves because there has been a lot of comment in recent months regarding the manner in which means for farming and small holding are assessed. Much of that comment has been quite wrong and many misleading statements have been made.  The suggestion has been made that officers of my Department take account only of the gross income from the farm and do not take account of the costs involved in earning that income.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity therefore to set the record straight and to outline briefly the method of assessing farm income.  What we are trying to assess is the normal yearly income from the farm.  The basis of the calculation of farm income is the net income over the 12 months preceding the investigation of means.  The applicant is interviewed in all cases and the assessment is made on the basis of information supplied by the farmer himself.  I stress that point in parof gross income from farming activities such as the sale of stock, crops or other produce, sale of milk to creamery and so on.  If there were exceptional circumstances associated with the particular year in question, allowance would be made for this.  Account is also taken of additional income, for example, from letting of land, hiring out of machinery or from headage payments.</P>
    <P>When the gross income has been ascertained it is then reduced by the amount of the costs actually and necessarily incurred in connection with the working of the farm.  These would include items such as rent, rates and annuities, the cost of seeds, fertiliser and feeding stuffs, renewal of tools and farm machinery, repairs to farm buildings, fences and the <Col N="1889" /> like, veterinary expenses, the cost of electricity, petrol and diesel and so on.</P>
    <P>In relation to farm machinery, hire purchase and other instalments are allowed or a reasonable annual allowance is made for depreciation.  An additional and significant cost item for many farmers in recent years is interest paid on moneys borrowed and here again such interest is allowed where it arises out of borrowings in connection with the working of the farm and where it is paid.  Necessary labour costs, excluding that of husband or wife, are also allowed as a deduction in calculating net income.  I defy anybody to go into an urban area throughout the country and point out that method of assessment to some fellow applying for unemployment assistance in an urban area.  Frankly that system of assessment is more than fair.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise, therefore, that the purpose of the exercise is to determine the facts and the officers of my Department have no vested interest in denying any person whatever he may be entitled to.  There is a detailed interview with each applicant for unemployment assistance and for this purpose the social welfare officers undergo a comprehensive training programme and have detailed instructions to guide them.  Furthermore, they are working under the control of district supervisors who have many years of experience in this area. Finally, any person who is dissatisfied with the amount of means assessed against him can appeal against the decision and have his case referred to an appeals officer for determination.</P>
    <P>I am emphasising in particular the question of the method of assessing means because I regard it as crucial in this whole debate.  I am not suggesting that the assessment of means is a simple straightforward exercise in all cases because often the information required may not be readily available to the applicant. What I am saying however is that there is a well-tried system in operation whereby a fair and reasonable assessment can be made.  Since I took office as Minister for Social Welfare I have had the method of assessing farm means subjected to detailed analysis and I am satisfied <Col N="1890" /> that all possible measures are taken to ensure that the assessment in individual cases is a fair one.  Reference has been made to the allegedly lower results for family farm income emerging from the farm management surveys carried out by An Foras Talúntais.  Discussions have been held with An Foras and comparisons have been made between the results of their surveys and the average income as assessed for unemployment assistance and they have been found broadly comparable.</P>
    <P>I have listened also to the views which have been put to me by various farming representatives on this whole matter and it is clear to me that what farmers want is a fair and reasonable assessment of means.  They are not seeking that assistance should be given to any person who does not have a genuine entitlement. They accept too that the abolition of the notional system will result in some farmers having their entitlements reduced or cut off.  I have met no resistance, however, to the idea of factual assessment, provided the assessment is fair.  In my view the system as I have outlined it is fair and with a view to providing more information about it, and promoting a greater understanding of it, a memorandum setting out in detail the method of application of the means test for unemployment assistance purposes was circulated some while back to all Deputies and Senators.  I would urge Deputies to study this memorandum because I would hope it would provide them with grounds for a greater belief in the equity of the system.</P>
    <P>It is inevitable that a number of smallholders who earn a reasonably good living will suffer reduced entitlements, or indeed have their payments terminated entirely.  Others, however, and particularly those with smaller farms in areas where the land is poor will benefit from the change-over to factual assessment.</P>
    <P>Reassessments so far have been concentrated as far as possible on smallholders in the higher valuation ranges.  Nevertheless it has been found that some 1,000 or 25 per cent of those reassessed have had their rate of assistance increased. This is because on the change-over to <Col N="1891" /> factual assessment the rate of unemployment assistance payable is calculated by reference to the higher rates of assistance which apply to those assessed on a factual basis and which include all the budget increases given down the years.</P>
    <P>I readily accept unemployment is a shattering experience at any time but what is of greatest concern in present circumstances is the increasing duration of unemployment and the extent to which unemployed people are becoming dependent on unemployment assistance as their long-term source of income.  In the early stages of unemployment the existence of unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit can to some extent cushion the blow but once a person has been unemployed for over 15 months he ceases to be entitled to unemployment benefit and must rely on unemployment assistance.  It was with this in mind that earlier this year I sought the authority of the government for increasing by 5 per cent the standard rates of unemployment assistance paid to all those who have been unemployed for 15 months or more.  Over 80 per cent of all unemployment assistance recipients, including smallholders whose means have been factually assessed, will benefit from this increase.</P>
    <P>I accept of course that the only real solution to unemployment is the creation of employment.  The unemployment benefit and assistance schemes can at best only alleviate the problem and unfortunately it is in times of economic recession when the demands on the unemployment schemes are highest that there is the greatest difficulty in making available the resources necessary to provide an adequate level of income under those schemes to an increasing number of applicants.  As far as smallholders on unemployment assistance are concerned the problem is not one of unemployment as such but rather of under-employment and low incomes.  For this problem the only long-term solution lies in the area of agricultural policy through efforts to make holdings more viable and capable of providing a reasonable level of income.  The unemployment assistance scheme can play a limited role but we <Col N="1892" /> must be careful that this role does not develop into one of inhibiting progress and thereby perpetuating an unacceptable standard of living.  However, the social assistance scheme has been and will continue to be an important source of income for those smallholders who meet the criteria laid down in the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to say at this stage what the effect will be of the abolition of the notional system in terms of the overall numbers of smallholders qualifying for unemployment assistance.  As I pointed out earlier, the review has concentrated as far as possible on smallholders with higher valuations, amongst whom it is likely that a higher proportion of applicants will have a reduced entitlement.  The overall number of smallholders on unemployment assistance at the end of November is estimated at 18,700 &mdash; a reduction of some 1,800 on the figure at the beginning of this year.  I would expect that as the review progresses, the numbers failing to qualify on the basis of factual assessment would decrease and the numbers qualifying for a higher rate of assistance would increase, as we go down to the lower levels of valuation.</P>
    <P>To sum up, therefore, having regard to developments that had taken place and the legal advice I received I had no option but to discontinue the notional system of assessment of means derived from land. There has been a lot of criticism about this but let us be frank about it, the whole question of notional assessment of means had been under question long before 1983.  It had been closely scrutinised over the years and previous Governments, including Fianna Fáil Governments, took frequent measures to restrict the application of the scheme.  These included the notional multiplier being increased, thus increasing the means assessment; the notional method of assessment was withdrawn from those with valuations over £20; those with valuations over £15 were excluded from budget increases and on subsequent occasions all smallholders on notional assessment were excluded from budget increases.</P>
    <P>Nobody can deny that these restrictive measures were an indication of dissatisfaction with the essential soundness and <Col N="1893" /> equity of the system.  We were faced with serious financial problems in trying to find the resources that are necessary to meet all the demands that are made on the Exchequer.  Not least of those are the demands for social welfare.  Next year the Department of Social Welfare will spend close on £2 billion and it is vital that this huge amount of money be spent to the best possible effect.  At present the total numbers receiving unemployment assistance is about 111,300.  Of these some 18,700 are smallholders of whom about 8,000 qualify for assistance on the basis of the notional method of assessment.  I cannot agree that, in a scheme where the basic criterion for entitlement depends on means, one section of the population should be given different and more favourable treatment as compared with another.  I think it is important that all be treated alike and the use of a common means test is a fair and equitable way of achieving this.</P>
    <P>If anybody considers that the method of applying the means test is unfair in any given set of circumstances, they are open to avail of the appeal system.  They are open to make representations to me and they will receive every consideration.  It is something at which I am quite prepared to look from time to time.  There has been an enormous amount of propaganda in relation to this, more particularly from some lugubrious Deputies of the Opposition Party from the west.  I am implementing a High Court decision.  I am doing no more and no less.  The Fianna Fáil Government in 1982 took a decision to implement the High Court decision and my immediate predecessor took the initial steps of issuing circulars prior to leaving office so implementing the High Court decision and I continued to implement that High Court decision and no amount of propanganda can get rid of that particular decision.  Indeed, in relation to the extra £70 million for which I had to come back to the Dáil today, that £70 million is largely due to the situation at the end of 1982 when estimates were made and these estimates were inherited by me at the beginning of January 1983. There was not a great deal of time in which to consider the amount since we <Col N="1894" /> had only a couple of weeks and there had been a fall off in PRSI of £35.5 million because of the very serious economic situation in relation to unemployment and the level generally of employment.  As a consequence I have to provide that money.  Lest there be any cavil about the double week at Christmas, I say to Deputy O'Hanlon that if the Fianna Fáil Party had provided even a penny of that for the 1983 Estimates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer first of all to some of the statements made by the Minister in what I would regard as a most unfair presentation in relation to the question of the abolition of the notional system of assessment for smallholders.  He referred to benefits that have been made available to the farmers in the disadvantaged areas. First of all he referred to infrastructure and rural water supply.  What is involved here?  A grant of a few hundred pounds to enable farmers in the west to get an amenity which they have been awaiting for many a day.  While rates were in <Col N="1895" /> operation these small farmers paid for the people of the towns who had this facility.  Now the Minister tries to make capital of the fact that a few pounds are made available and used for this, in order to bolster up his case for the abolition of the notional system.</P>
    <P>He has a very lame case to present to the House when he has to introduce matters of this kind.  He refers to agricultural roads.  What is involved here?  A grant of 50 per cent to a farmer who wants to build a road to his house, something which he has not already got and which is available to citizens in every other part of this country.  No direct grants are available to farmers for electrification.  The only grant available is an 8 per cent EEC grant to a person living in rural Ireland who wants to have electricity brought into his house.  A person who builds a new house and want to have electricity installed has the benefit of an 80 per cent grant from the EEC.  Let us look at what is happening to the people of rural Ireland in relation to this.  They must pay huge costs to have electricity installed in their homes, whereas a person living in urban Ireland in a city or town has no charge of this kind to meet.  When the people were building their houses and getting electricity for the first time they had a charge of £2,000 and in some instances as high as £3,000 from the ESB and were given an EEC grant of up to 80 per cent towards the cost of having electricity installed in their homes.</P>
    <P>When the Minister introduces this kind of argument to bolster up his case it shows the lame duck he is on in relation to the question of the abolition of the notional system.  He refers to direct farm aids. How many small farmers can avail of these?  Farm investment grants of 40 per cent for farm buildings and 30 per cent for fixed equipment suggest that the Minister should have consulted with the Department of Agriculture before putting these figures before us.  He referred to farm modernisation grants which have been abolished since this Government took office.</P>
    <P>These are a few points in the Minister's speech which I think I have a right to <Col N="1896" /> refer to and I know that my colleague, Deputy O'Hanlon, will take up other matters when replying to this tomorrow night.</P>
    <P>When talking about this question of the notional system and how it was introduced one must go back to the situation here in the late fifties and early sixties when we had mass emigration from rural Ireland, when whole families were leaving the land.  The method in which the factual system was being used was such that the farmer who tried to improve himself, who bought a few cattle or tried to get the most out of his land, was penalised under the system.  The person who was doing nothing on his land, was not stocking it or improving it, was getting full benefit, as it was called, because he had no stock or was not in any way trying to improve himself.  As a result of this the person who might have benefited from having a few cattle had to make judgment as to whether he should keep those cattle or benefit from the full amount of social welfare that he would get from the State if he did not bother to do anything on the land.  In other words, there was no incentive for a person to do anything on the land because of the way the factual system operated.</P>
    <P>As a result of the interest taken by some rural organisations at that time, deputations were sent to the Government and the Minister for Social Welfare and one of the things suggested was that a notional system of assessment would be introduced.  I happened to be with Father McDyer on one of these deputations in relation to this matter, and the Government of the day saw the sense of introducing this notional system.  We have seen the results of that in rural Ireland.  The whole life of the west changed as a result of that.  Up to then we had mass emigration, families going away, fathers of families being away for most of the year, school numbers going down, schools closing, and all of rural Ireland was dying.  It would be dead now were it not for the introduction of this system.  When this notional system was introduced farmers could stock their holdings, drain, fertilise and improve the land and get full benefit from it.  They could avail of the various <Col N="1897" /> grants from the EEC mentioned by the Minister, and we have seen the result. Rural Ireland has been transformed and the introduction of the notional system of assessment did more than anything else to improve life in rural Ireland.  The people there were now in a position to avail of these grants.  The structure in relation to population, employment, life on the land and in our little towns and villages, the whole countryside, was transformed.</P>
    <P>I say categorically here and to any forum that nothing did more to improve the lot of the people of the west than the introduction of this system.  People have improved their houses and their holdings. Little creameries have cropped up.  We see cattle marts.  There is life in every little town that you go into at present in the west.  The shops look better and brighter because the people have a better standard of living.  They can go and spend their money in these towns.  Thank God for the day the small farmer can drive into town or even to the employment exchange.  We have seen the improvements that have occurred in the west as a result of the introduction of the notional system of assessment.  For long enough people in the west were laughed at and were scoffed by people working in industries in towns when they came in on their donkey and cart to do their shopping.</P>
    <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon has said, we are not blaming the social welfare officers because they are doing a job for the Government.  Last June the Minister said there would be cuts of £5 million in social welfare at a time when unemployment was increasing.  The only way he could get the £5 million was to hit the farmers in the west.  He need not come in here and tell us people are not losing their dole money.  I have written countless letters to his Department on behalf of constituents who have lost their social welfare payments or have suffered large reductions in such payments.  These people are in a desperate situation.  They have to pay the cost of school transport, there has been a cut in the health services and they have to pay rates by the back door in the form of water charges.  In <Col N="1898" /> addition to all of that, now their steady income is being taken from them.</P>
    <P>How can a small farmer in the west, with five or six cattle and who may sell two or three cattle each year, be in a position to survive unless he has some money to supplement his income?  I will give the Minister an instance of a case with which I am familiar.  A married man with five children was in receipt of £51 social welfare.  The social welfare officer assessed his income from milk as being worth £76 per week and his social welfare benefit was cut to £6 per week.  If one adds £76 to £51 one gets a total of £127 which is the average industrial wage. Recently we were told £7,000 per year was the average industrial worker's wage. The notional system was never meant to be dole money: it was meant to supplement the income of the small farmer to help to keep him on the land and it has been very successful in doing this.  I do not think the Minister would regard a wage of £120 per week for a man with five children as excessive.  I have read the circular the Minister has sent out in relation to the method of assessment but I do not agree that that method is being used. All that is being used is the gross income of the small farmer but his expenses are not taken into account.  I have been told this by my constituents.</P>

      <P>When I raised this question&mdash;I was rather annoyed about it at the time&mdash;the Minister said that small farmers would not lose their dole as a result of the abolition of the notional system.  The figures given by him today show the numbers whose unemployment assistance has been cut off or drastically reduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are back to the situation that existed in the fifties.  People are frustrated <Col N="1899" /> and anxious about their future.  If people are in receipt of £50 or £60 a week they more than need it for the running of their homes and for keeping their children in school.  They have to buy school books and clothes for their children and also give them a certain amount of pocket money.  We will have a situation where people will not be able to send their children to secondary school.  Nowadays children will not go out if they are not properly dressed and if they do not have some money in their pockets.</P>
    <P>We accept that some farmers who were doing quite well were not entitled to social welfare benefits.  However, in every sector there are always people who use a situation to their advantage.  Generally speaking, the principle was right. It served a good purpose in revitalising the west and in this connection I include disadvantaged areas such as Kerry and Donegal.  In those areas emigration had stopped, people felt secure in their holdings and, most important, the heads of families were able to stay with their families. Because of the farm supplement they could stay on the land and work it to the best advantage.  I can tell the Minister that the advantages gained by people in the west as a result of the notional system will have gone in six months.  We will revert to the situation of the fifties, with people packing their bags and seeking work elsewhere in order to give their families a decent standard of living.  The unfortunate thing is that these people will have nowhere to go.  There was a time they could take the emigrant ship.  Our young educated people will be roaming around rural Ireland with nothing to do.  The whole of rural Ireland came to life when the notional system was introduced.  One could see it in the number of football and hurling clubs and in the social life.  Already there is evidence of the frustration that has been caused.  People feel let down by this Government.  It is no use for the Minister to say Fianna Fáil were responsible.  The decision was taken when the Finance Bill was introduced and there is no way the Government can get out of their responsibility <Col N="1900" /> for taking that decision.  They cannot gloss over it.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been waiting for a long time to express my almost unreserved welcome for this Bill.  I speak as a Deputy representing a constituency where the need for action in the criminal justice area is felt as a very great need. As other speakers have said, it is competing with unemployment as a major issue of concern locally.  Crime immediately and seriously affects people's lives in a constituency such as I represent, which is very mixed, but does contain a very large working class area.  In the past, it has been traditional to think of crime affecting wealthy areas rather more than working class areas but it has been a feature of the rise in crime and the nature of the change in crime over the last decade that working class areas have been <Col N="1901" /> hit as badly as middle class and wealthy areas.  It is the most vulnerable in our community whose lives are being made even more intolerable by the activities of criminals.  Perhaps that is why at an earlier stage in my political career I had a different emphasis in relation to the criminal justice area.  I consider that action is necessary to create better living standards and a better quality of life for everybody, from the poorest and most vulnerable to those who have a lot at stake.</P>
      <P>The Bill, with some reservations, is very welcome and will help to improve both the situation in relation to crime statistics in relation to detection and to the general confidence and morale of the people and the Garda Síochána with regard to the ongoing struggle with crime.  The fact that it affects all areas and groups has made it an urgent problem and I need not repeat what so many speakers have pointed out with regard to the problems of the old and the poor and the sad incidences lately of attacks on infants so horrifyingly depicted in British newspapers.  The atmosphere is very depressing and a solution must be found. It is not surprising that the Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, has become a figure of respect and one worthy of confidence.</P>
      <P>One hears more and more stories of known criminals and vandals who seem to be thumbing their noses at authority. The system has broken down as there are so many ways in which they can by-pass it.  Not all of these will be tackled by the Bill but some will.  The situation in regard to bail is an ongoing scandal in that a person on bail can commit crime in the knowledge that there is no possibility of extra punishment being inflicted on him. The tightening up in this area is one of the most welcome elements in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other national scandal is that a person can get off on a technicality. While this will not be ended by the Bill, certain loopholes are being closed.  The Minister said in his speech that even in cases of murder, certain evidence had been disallowed because of technicalities in relation to the right to detain and question which had been presumed to exist in the past but which had been called into <Col N="1902" /> question by a number of recent court cases.  As a result of this, even in cases as serious as murder, evidence was ruled to be inadmissible because it was gathered in circumstances which were not legally defined.  The publication of details of these and many other examples, some perhaps less serious, have broken down public faith and confidence in the Garda Síochána and in our system of justice and it is time to tackle these problems.</P>
    <P>The sentencing structure has not been tackled in the Bill and this has also become something of a public scandal. Arising out of a combination of these factors there has been a sense that the Garda are powerless in the face of crime but perhaps this Bill will improve that situation and redress it to some extent.  Parts of the Bill are non-controversial and have been welcomed by most Deputies, even those who criticised other parts of it.</P>
    <P>The changes in relation to bail are very welcome, the fact that extra sentences can be imposed on a person who commits a crime while on bail and that absconding while on bail is liable to a sentence of one year has tidied up an area which badly needed it.  The powers of detention is a controversial section but the amendments suggested by certain Deputies, such as a code of questioning, will be a very necessary part of the Bill and will be of great use in the detection of serious crime.  It relates only to crimes which will carry a sentence of more than five years.</P>
    <P>The public perception of the criminal &mdash; and a very valid one&mdash;is of somebody who is a professional and an expert in crime, better informed with regard to his rights and privileges than the members of the Garda Síochána who may be investigating the case.  The fact that this is so, brings into question the whole method of training.  It is unquestionable that the type of criminal operating today is a new phenomenon and it is necessary that our laws should be able to contain them.  In relation to that, the powers of detention will offer an opportunity for the investigation of crime, to take fingerprints and photographs and to check records and alibis to prevent evidence being destroyed.  The powers that have been suggested here are within those recommended <Col N="1903" /> in the Ó Briain Report and are moderate compared with those of other countries.  They should be of assistance in the fight against crime.  I am very sympathetic, however, to the suggestion of Deputy Shatter that a code of questioning might be implemented so that a certain established order could be agreed upon and publicly known to protect the right of the person being charged with a crime or being investigated.</P>
    <P>While one presumes that in general the persons being dealt with will be either criminals or persons charged with serious crimes, inevitably there will be people taken in for questioning who are found ultimately to be entirely innocent.  In any event, our aim must be to protect the civil liberties of both the innocent and the guilty while ensuring that the rights of the community to live in a crime-free society are protected also.  The proposal by Deputy Shatter for a code of questioning is one that could be incorporated in this section by way of amendment, thereby improving the section and retaining its effectiveness.</P>
    <P>The proposal that alibis be notified is to be welcomed.  It is one that should not meet with any serious objection from anyone, even from those most experienced in the field.  Obviously, it is desirable that if one intends relying on this form of evidence, notification be given in time for it to be fully investigated.</P>
    <P>The proposal in relation to majority verdicts is welcome also.  The question of the intimidation of witnesses has been put forward as one of the main substantive reasons for bringing in this package. Again, this proposal is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The question of the possibility of inferences being drawn is one of the most controversial in so far as this Bill is concerned. This is an area that could be tightened up.  As a non-expert in this area, the right of anyone to hide behind silence is a right in regard to which I have no difficulty.  This may be naive of me but I have sympathy with the examples suggested by some speakers, for instance, the innocent person who is being questioned about crime and who may not have <Col N="1904" /> the wit, the sense, the knowledge or the confidence to cope with the question at the time.  As this is a very broad section in relation to all forms of crime, perhaps it ought to be tightened up to relate specifically to named types of crime, to certain types of questioning and to the seeking of certain kinds of information on which broadly it would be reasonable to expect a person to supply fairly substantive answers.  Then, a refusal to give information in respect of those areas could result in an inference being drawn. In this way we would be removing some of the grounds for criticism in this regard. Otherwise the section is desirable.</P>
    <P>Obviously there are two situations we are trying to cover here.  One is the question of strengthening the hands of the Garda and of the courts in dealing with hardened criminals who are adept at using both the courts system and the interrogation system and who may be more familiar with the courts of law than are some of those who will be dealing with them.  At the same time, we must protect the basic human rights of the criminal as well as the rights of those who are found to be innocent.</P>
    <P>On the question of the powers of detention also, Deputy Shatter raised certain points in relation to strip searching. I am aware that the current practice in this regard is that in the case of women, ban gardaí undertake the searching and that if medical attention is needed or if there is need for closer internal examination, there is provision for a choice of doctor.  Abuses in this regard would be of such a personal nature that the safeguards which are adopted in practice should be incorporated in the law in order to ensure that there is no possibility of any such abuse and that there is a maximum recompense for any person who may be abused in this way.  This would be to the benefit of all concerned.</P>
    <P>The powers of detention have come under questioning also because of the possibility of a person being detained for a further length of time and during the night time period.  It is written into the Act that should a person be detained for questioning for a further length of time a Garda superintendent would have to <Col N="1905" /> give reasons for the detention and would have to approve of it.  Were the extra detention to be proved subsequently not to be justified, I understand that any evidence taken during that time would not come under any serious questioning.  This is a protection against an abuse that I do not envisage happening.</P>
    <P>In general, the Garda have welcomed the Bill but have indicated that it may not go far enough.  In this context they refer particularly to the area of the powers of search.  I have some sympathy with them in that the powers of search in this country are more limited than is the case in any other country.  It would seem reasonable that in relation to such serious offences as murder, rape or serious bodily injury, there would be provision for some powers of search in an effort to find the murder implements and so on.  This is another matter that might be considered to be amended at the next Stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment in relation to bringing in a complaints procedure.  This will be an important partner in this legislation but it is important that a complaints procedure would be independent and civilian orientated.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy expressed the opinion that the courts were adequate for dealing with the kinds of complaints that would come before such a tribunal but I would not agree, because for a case to arise in the courts a civilian must make a charge initially.  In making a charge the civilian is at an undue disadvantage <i>visà-vis</i> a member of the Garda because in the first place the complaint must be made through that body.  From the one or two complaints I have had as a public representative in relation to this area, I am of the opinion that an individual wishing to make a complaint would find that the cards were too heavily stacked against him.  A civilian and independent authority in this regard would be desirable and essential.  Then, if a complaint were substantiated, it could be followed through with the support of the complaints tribunal.</P>
    <P>The proposals in relation to taping of investigation of accused persons are ones that must be developed and taken up. Essentially such a system is the best long <Col N="1906" /> term defence for the person detained and those involved in the interrogation.  In other countries where taping is used the number of claims of abuse have reduced. The material on the tapes is used, when necessary, but the existence of the system has reduced a lot of the controversy in regard to evidence gained during interrogation. It would be a very good form of protection for the police and the person being questioned.  The Minister should develop this system rapidly. Resources should be provided to purchase the necessary equipment and to train gardaí in its use.</P>
    <P>Legislation is only one weapon necessary in the fight against crime.  Since the Government took office there have been a lot of advancements at local level.  From observations in my constituency it is clear that there have been changes in regard to discipline within the force and the setting of certain standards.  That has had a great effect on national morale and confidence in the Garda Síochána.  One of the most significant though simple changes that has occurred resulted from an instruction by the Commissioner, and the Minister, to the gardaí to return to the beat.  That has had a considerable impact in Dublin and it did not involve any legislation.  The gardaí had become motorised and distant figures.  In some cases they were considered to be part of the crime scene in that they chased at high speed through areas in pursuit of youngsters in stolen cars. They were viewed as part of the threat to normal living.  The gardaí lost a lot of contact with local people, and their return to the beat is the most significant change put into operation.</P>
    <P>Another welcome change was the decision to deploy more gardaí in Dublin. The provisions of the Bill will do a certain amount, but a lot more is possible by imaginative use of existing resources and improved procedures within the Garda Síochána.  Dublin Members have been critical of the deployment of gardaí. Although there is a population of twice that of Limerick city in my constituency we have one tenth of the number of gardaí policing it.  The same difficulty exists in other areas of Dublin.  Improvement in that area has led to a better <Col N="1907" /> community atmosphere and a reduction in the number of crimes committed.  I welcome the decision to increase the number of ban gardaí.  The arrival of ban gardaí has helped to improve the image of the force in terms of community sympathy. I also welcome the decision to deploy native Dubliners who join the force to stations in Dublin city.  The old tradition of sending recruits away from areas they were familiar with was to the detriment of the force.  I welcome the return of Dublin-born gardaí to the city, because they understand the way of life. That change in policy came from the top, and it has been most effective.</P>
    <P>The extensions to prisons last summer have eased the problem of prison accommodation. However, prison accommodation is still inadequate and there must be continued investment in this area.  The legislation on community service orders was imaginative and will help to deal with crime and the problem of prison accommodation. It is important that its provisions are available to our courts as an alternative form of punishment, particularly for young people facing a court for the first time.  I know of cases where community services orders would be a better approach.  It is impossible to assess the effect imprisonment has on young people, and that is why I should like to encourage the Minister to ensure that our probation services are developed so that the legislation on community services orders is effective.</P>
    <P>There is need for changes in the Department of Justice, and they should take place in conjunction with the introduction of the provisions of the Bill.  The numbers recruited to the Garda Síochána are inadequate.  We must have sufficient gardaí on the beat so that they can become part of a community.  Very few people are acquainted with the gardaí in their area.  I am aware that a request has gone from my area where a community policing policy is developing for a garda to patrol the area on a regular basis so that local people can become acquainted with him or her.  It is also important that the system of training recruits is reviewed.  It is generally accepted that a <Col N="1908" /> training period of six months is inadequate. We are all aware of the complexities of modern crime and the drug problem and the importance of the development of a community relations service.  Many other elements need to be dealt with during the garda training programme. We are all aware of the statements to the effect that the inadequate knowledge of the law by gardaí results in many criminals getting away on technicalities in court cases.  Gardaí should be given more legal training.  The Garda authorities will have to review the deployment of gardaí in urban and rural areas.  There are problems in rural areas, and a community relationship with gardaí is desirable there also.</P>
    <P>There is also a great need for court reform.  Some of the problems we have in relation to the release of people on bail exist because of the extraordinary delays that occur in bringing cases to trial.  A change in that area will mean that we will have fewer people committing crimes when on bail.  It is desirable that those charged with any crime are brought before the courts within a short period, three to four weeks at the outside.  A person who has been charged with any crime, serious or otherwise, should come before the courts at least initially within three to four weeks at the outside. currently and it is necessary that the Minister consider committing resources to this area.</P>
    <P>In relation to the courts, there has been a proposal by the task force that there should be a special court for drug-related offences and that there should be a judge who would deal specifically with this area.  There has long been an understanding that we need a children's court and that family courts, with properly trained personnel, should be established in a more homely environment.  These are areas warranting immediate investigation. Perhaps the only way this could have been dealt with under the provisions of this Bill was by mandatory sentencing which I do not believe to be desirable. There is the question of sentencing and the problems we have had therewith in <Col N="1909" /> the country in the past year.  We can think over the past year of many examples of what would seem to the ordinary person, and indeed to all of us in this House, as extraordinary and outrageous sentences being imposed by the courts.  For the first time I think such a case became the subject of a debate in this House.</P>
    <P>If the provisions of this Bill prove successful, do what is intended, help in the detection and conviction of criminals and if we cannot then rely on a logical and stable sentencing system, all of that work will have been in vain.  We must look at how to modify this and how to improve the situation.  I think it was Deputy Shatter who suggested that there should be periods of training for judges.  He outlined the example of the judge who came from the solicitor's office where perhaps he had been dealing with house conveyancing and found himself the following morning endeavouring to assess and judge very serious crimes and deciding on sentences, and that those who were responsible for the establishment of this system should examine it very seriously. As a minimum suggestion, the question of training should be examined.  I would think that judges, as a group, should come together regularly to discuss their common experiences and perhaps develop a more uniform system of sentencing and of approaches to crime.  This area will have to be tackled.  If in ensuing years the legal profession itself, the Judiciary, does not meet the challenge then it will be necessary for this House to examine the situation again and perhaps consider other methods of imposing some form of uniformity on the sentencing system currently available to us or that may become available to us through legislation at that stage.  Some of the experiences of the past year put the whole of the criminal justice system into disrepute, putting serious worries into the mind of the average person who feels not alone unprotected from the criminal but may feel in need of protection from certain of the judges of the State who should be the main upholders of law and order. This situation warrants immediate attention. I would call initially on the body independently responsible for sentencing <Col N="1910" /> in this country and for the handling of the courts, the Judiciary, that they should look to their own house and do something about putting it in order.</P>
    <P>There are other important elements to this problem of the solution of crime in our society, of which this Bill can constitute only one.  Even were we to deal with all the other areas of the Department of Justice I have outlined, even were they all reformed tomorrow, we would still have a crime problem.  The problem lies in the roots of our society and, of course, is not unrelated to the recession through which we are going.  It is extremely important that we amalgamate our national energies in tackling our economic problems and in a resolution of those sorts of problems I have mentioned as speedily as possible.  However, we shall have to live with recession for some years to come.  Within that environment it is extremely important that we take decisions of discrimination in areas suffering maximum deprivation.  It is open to the Government and local authorities to discriminate positively in favour of deprived areas from whence most of the criminal population emerge, that any spending in environmental areas, in community areas, should show positive discrimination in their favour.  This may exist in Dublin Corporation area at present by virtue of the enlightened approach of certain individual officers but it should not be left to chance in local authority areas.  A policy of positive discrimination should be the responsibility of every local authority in deprived areas.</P>
    <P>In regard to education, certain areas must be immune from any cut-back and must be positively discriminated in favour of, for example, on the question of the pupil-teacher ratio.  I know this operates to some extent but it needs to be developed in relation to pre-school facilities, to possible grant-aiding or encouragement of any further involvement in education, in second chance education and so on.  This preventative measure in relation to crime can be illustrated by an example given me recently by a teacher involved in a very deprived area where they had gathered a class of 11 year olds whom they had identified as <Col N="1911" /> very high risk young people who, in their experiences given the normal pattern of similar children, would find themselves dropping out of school within a very short time into unemployment, with possibly a high level of them becoming delinquent and involved in crime.  But through a programme of identification, prevention, a special programme aimed at their needs, the level of drop-out was reduced significantly.  Certainly through that action in the educational field society was protected from the emergence of a further number of criminals.  Also five or ten individuals in this case had their lives immeasurably enriched and improved and their future as human beings protected by society in a way that should be done on a much more extensive level.</P>
    <P>In particular I would call for the Children Bill to take up a great deal of the work that is needed in this area of prevention and of caring for the youngsters who may become criminals.  There is no doubt that public and parental neglect allows large sections of our young people to move into the area of delinquency, eventually becoming criminals.  I look forward to the Children Bill which we have been promised in the next session. I look forward to it being a vital complement to any changes in the criminal justice area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony in the course of his contribution referred to the portrait painted for us of the north city centre community where the superintendent responsible for that area, was able to isolate down to a number of 40 those responsible for crime in his area.  Deputy Molony said that superintendent had said they could be identified, no longer now at the age of ten or 11 but at the age of eight, that at that age they were living rough, they were without adequate parental supervision and that, by the age of 12, they would have established a criminal habit which it would be difficult to break.  It is quite clear that intervention in the lives of those youngsters at an early age would improve their lives and be likely to reduce the impact of crime on the community.  It is extremely important <Col N="1912" /> that the Children Bill will tackle this bravely.</P>
    <P>Even at the moment, though the power available is limited, some intervention might make a difference, but there are no facilities, support services, no places to which the children can go.  None of the existing children's homes would take severely disruptive young people, and because they have nowhere to go they are either put into institutions which have a minimal reforming element or they will have to go back to the environment from which they came where they are without adequate care and likely to find themselves in more serious crimes later on. Therefore the question of their care must be tackled in the Children's Bill.</P>
    <P>I suppose it is a source of optimism that the criminal problem here is limited and that crime is confined to a tiny minority. Of course that minority are having an impact on the community far greater than their numbers would suggest.  Between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the whole crime of the country can be located in inner city areas.  Because those criminal numbers can be isolated this is a problem that can be tackled if we deal with it early.</P>
    <P>The approach should not be just in regard to criminals but in regard to caring also.  Continued involvement of the voluntary services will still be necessary, and my final point will concern the involvement of the community in the fight against crime.  It is in the area of drugs that the involvement of the community has been tested most, and of course the drug problem is one of the most terrifying problems in Dublin and in the country as a whole, but particularly in Dublin.  Communities have felt especially threatened in a way they have not felt in regard to other elements, perhaps mainly because it affects their young people most.</P>
    <P>The response of the community has been to come together to inform themselves and to take communal action.  Pilot projects are under way to establish alternative cultures to the drug culture and dependence on drugs in Dublin.  When local communities come together and arm themselves with information they feel an involvement in preventive and <Col N="1913" /> alternative activities for young people. They have found this to be the best answer, and it is in that atmosphere that the development of the idea of community policing, or community involvement in policing, has taken root.  It is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>In Finglas, in the constituency I represent, a pilot project for community policing is being investigated and has been warmly welcomed by the people there. They were anxious to get involved in trying to improve the quality of life in the area, and in a very short time there has been a significant improvement arising from better communication between the police and the people.  The various community groups got to know the names of the superintendent, the inspectors, the sergeants and the gardaí in the station and they can contact them.  Garda officers come to their community meetings and there is a feeling not of separation, which had grown up in the past between the police and the community, but the feeling of a shared task.</P>
    <P>The community have begun to understand the task of the Garda Síochána and the limitations under which they work, and co-operation for mutual benefit has been built up.  This community policing idea is at a very early stage.  It has been tried in other countries where results have been significant.  In some American cities there has been a resultant drop of 30 per cent in the crime rate.  It is therefore worthy of experiment.  Even before a formalised approach was adopted there had been improved community relations and there has been a significant drop in the number of, for example, car thefts. The figures for 1983 are very much reduced, from 1,100 to 700, a significant drop although there is a long way to go.</P>
    <P>It is through this type of community involvement that the long term health and happiness of the people will come about.  Of course there is need for a trained and co-operative police force backed up by adequate legal measures which we hope the Bill now before us will provide for the Garda.  However, progress in all the areas I have outlined will be necessary, but I look forward in particular to community policing projects.  I <Col N="1914" /> compliment the Minister once more on the initiatives that have emerged from the Department in his short term of office.  I hope this will continue so that we will make serious inroads and at least contain and perhaps reduce the level of crime in the community in the next decade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the general proposals in this Bill in view of the dramatic rise in crime in our society over the past few years.  The problem has become so serious today that it is only right that we as politicians unite to take the necessary legislative action against the criminals. The situation has become so serious that the criminals themselves now seem to think that they have a right to mug, rob, kidnap, murder and terrorise the people of the nation without action being taken against them.</P>
      <P>The present situation cannot be allowed to continue, and I would hope that this Bill will work effectively to ensure that the perpetrators of crime will have no place in our society.  The ordinary decent law-abiding people of Ireland are living in a world of fear and concern, concern that we as legislators and the forces of law and order in this country have lost control of the battle against crime.</P>
      <P>I believe that the general public have nothing to fear from this Bill.  People and organisations have expressed serious concern regarding some sections of the Bill, particularly in relation to the right to remain silent, detention of arrested persons, bail for firearm offences and trial procedures.  I am glad that the Minister has agreed to look at these issues on the Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>While ensuring that the Garda have adequate powers we, as legislators, must never turn this country into a police State, the rights of the citizen must always be protected, but if a citizen is convicted of a criminal offence he should be dealt with by the courts of this land and be given a punishment to fit the crime.  Until now too many loopholes existed in our legislation which enabled criminals to find a way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many reasons are being put forward <Col N="1915" /> for the alarming rise in crime, and I must agree that most of the problems are caused by the high unemployment figures, bad housing and broken marriages. Our young people are living lives of idleness with too much spare time on their hands and as a result are turning to crime, vandalism and other acts of violence which are a threat to democracy in the country.  Today we find a certain apathy towards crime.  The gardaí and the people in general seem to have accepted with total resignation a situation that would have been unthinkable in Irish society less than ten years ago.  We as politicians have a duty to tackle these problems and to ensure that the Garda have adequate powers to deal with the present rising crime situation.  The problem of the escalating crime rate can only be dealt with by the whole community working together in total co-operation with the Garda Síochána.  Poor social conditions, bad housing conditions and lack of employment opportunities have forced many young people to turn their backs on society and to reject what is on offer from the State.  This has led to a confrontation between the young people and the gardaí.  I believe that in relation to juvenile crime we must get away from prison sentences; we must provide alternatives, such as community service through youth organisations and local authorities.  We must keep these young people within their own localities and offer them the chance to rehabilitate themselves.</P>
    <P>There are three other sections of society I would like to see playing a major role with the Garda in trying to combat juvenile crime.  Parents have a serious role to play.  While we may be living in a free society, I believe parents must adopt a tougher attitude towards their children and be aware of what they are doing, particularly late at night.  Teachers have a role to play in the moulding of today's youth.  They are dealing with children at a stage when they are more open to guidance and leadership, and they should play a more active role after school hours by encouraging teenagers to become involved in clubs and organisations <Col N="1916" /> involved in community work.  The clergy also have a major role to play in combating juvenile crime.  Many of our clergy are very active but I believe the majority are not giving the lead and guidance to teenagers they should be giving.  Saying Mass on Sunday and giving sermons that are boring and outdated are no longer relevant to young people.  What we need are clergy who are prepared to get involved in the community, to talk and discuss the problems with the young people concerned.</P>
    <P>Another area that has led to an increase in juvenile crime is the problem of drugs which has affected so many people, either directly or indirectly.  The drug addict, in his mad craze for drugs, will attack, rob, steal and even resort to violence to get the money to purchase these drugs.  This problem has become a major one in the cities and is rapidly spreading to the smaller urban towns. Some years ago cigarette advertisements were banned from our television screens because they were a danger to health. The time has come for the Minister and the politicians to look at the Aspro/Anadin advertisements on our television screens today.  So many pick-me-up tonics are advertised that the young people seem to think that these pills have a part to play in their lives.  In my view these advertisements should be banned from television and the Minister should take note of the situation.</P>
    <P>Action should be taken against the drug godfathers who cause grave hardship for families and young people.</P>
    <P>The passing of this Bill will not solve all our problems in relation to crime, it will take a positive reaction from all sections of our community working in close liaison with the gardaí.  To identify the young law-breaker at an early age is most important for himself and the community in general and to ensure that he does not become a hardened criminal.  Therefore, there is a need for complete involvement of the community in the fight against crime.</P>
    <P>The Bill is a very detailed one which can be examined further on Committee Stage.  It is obvious that we on this side of the House agree that strong legislation <Col N="1917" /> is needed to combat the present state of criminal activities in this country.  The granting of bail by the courts is at present causing grave concern to the public.  We have the lunatic situation where people are being released on bail and are continuing to commit offences, knowing that when brought back to court they will only receive concurrent sentences.  I welcome the section in the Bill providing consecutive rather than concurrent sentences. I am not suggesting that bail be abolished completely, but I believe that the conditions for granting bail should be tightened and made more difficult.</P>
    <P>The serious professional type of crime is a whole new ball game.  We must ask ourselves if we have adequately trained personnel.  Is our investigation system good enough?  Is our prison system efficient? Is our judicial system able to cope? I would say no, and the criminal is very much aware of the whole incompetency in the field of detection and sentencing. Regarding the courts, it is now necessary to have a review and overhaul of the whole court procedure to eliminate the lengthy delays in bringing cases before the courts, particularly in relation to criminal court proceedings where it can take up to three years to have cases heard.  The appointment of extra judges, longer sittings and better courthouse facilities are needed, and I would urge the Minister to take that into account.</P>
    <P>Another area we must look at is the deployment of our gardaí.  Too many gardaí are being used to carry out functions, such as office work, which would be done by ordinary secretaries, which would enable these gardaí to get back on the beat.  It is essential to get more gardaí back on the streets amongst the public, thus creating better policing and improving community relations.  It is very important that the gardaí are involved in the community to ensure that a position of trust and good-will exists on both sides, thereby ensuring that the problems relating to law and order are tackled together.</P>
    <P>The section dealing with powers of detention should be carefully examined on Committee Stage to ensure that it is not open to abuse.  To safeguard the <Col N="1918" /> ordinary citizen notification of detention should be given immediately rather than as soon as is practicable, as stated in the Bill.  I welcome the provision in the Bill for increased penalties for the unauthorised taking of motorcars.  This is a problem in our cities which is spreading to our rural areas and has grown out of all proportion in recent years, resulting in the death of many innocent people.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and believe it will give a certain amount of protection to the ordinary law-abiding citizen.  However, the full value of the Bill cannot be achieved unless the Minister is prepared to look at the overall situation in relation to reform of every section under the control of the Department of Justice, such as the Garda, the courts and prisons to ensure that the whole administration is working effectively and efficiently.  The basic principle of good government is that the first duty of the State is to protect the citizen.  The crumbling away of law and order must inevitably lead to a collapse of the whole social structure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister made two significant statements.  He said &ldquo;Crime and its consequences, in one form or another, cast a shadow over much of our social life today and force us to reassess many of our traditional values and attitudes.&rdquo; I sincerely hope they do, because in a fast changing society the widening gap between the haves and the have nots needs to be reassessed.  The Minister is saying that there is no point trying to off-load our problems on to the Garda force by giving them increased powers, by building stronger and bigger jails and higher walls around our property. Not only is that not the right, human, responsible or civilised way to treat this problem, but in practical terms it will not work.  That is one of the realities that we as elected representatives have to face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister also said: &ldquo;Yet it is clear that poverty, unemployment and poor social conditions generally are factors that play an important part.&rdquo; Deputy Browne said that we must ensure when passing legislation that the perpetrators of crimes have no place in our societies. <Col N="1919" /> There is more significance in that statement than perhaps the Deputy realised. I believe the majority of people commit crime because they believe they do not have a place in our society and that they do not have a future in society.</P>
    <P>This Bill cannot be seen in isolation.  I hope this will not be perceived in this House or by the electorate as a panacea for all our ills or that, with amendments, it could remove crime from our streets and permit us to lie abed in comfort.  Like most other problems it is not that easy of solution.  It will require a painful approach and an acceptance that the Bill is not a simplistic answer to a very complex problem.</P>
    <P>I should like to see more statistics on crime in our society.  We cannot rely on rumour and counter rumour and on the suggestion that if we have increased powers and more prisons crime will go away.  We have not done enough research into the causes of the fear that exists at the moment that crime will overwhelm us all.  We must look at all the agencies we are now expecting to cope with crime. After all the changes we have seen over the past ten or 20 years, have we provided the backup, the training and the resources to our police force to make them a modern police force which could rely on detection rather than more powers to interrogate and get confessions? We must be effective and just in the detection of crime.</P>
    <P>I share the concern that some sections of this Bill would not only cope with the problem but increase and exacerbate it. We must ask ourselves if there is a danger that, in our efforts to reduce the rate of crime, we might increase the risk of convicting innocent people.  The implications and long-term consequences are far too serious to be ignored.  In saying that, I am sensitive to the fears of the elderly who lock themselves behind doors and are afraid to come out even in the afternoons. We must achieve a balance in a just and civilised society.  Consider the implications of convicting an innocent person to a term of three, five or seven years imprisonment.  That would not help <Col N="1920" /> or serve the victim of a crime and would leave us in a very dangerous position.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies spoke about the power of detention.  I see that power as a two-edged sword.  Some of the wording in the Bill is not defined closely enough.  The provision regarding reasonable cause may be too broad.  The hardened well-heeled criminal will know every loophole in the law and will be able to afford legal assistance.  We may end up with the inarticulate and vulnerable in our society at the receiving end of the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem about the extension of detention.  Under section 3 a rest period may intervene between the first and second detention.  A person in detention, denied his freedom and under pressure, will not see that in human or psychological terms as a rest period.  We must also think of the conditions in which people will be detained.  Many of our Garda stations are inadequate, primitive even.  They have not got the facilities to keep people in detention and give them a rest period or a sense of reassurance. The Minister might also consider the comfort of the gardaí who have to work under considerable stress in these stations. This is a practical example of what has to be taken into consideration while questioning the power of detention in the first place.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the right to silence. This shifts the emphasis.  A person now has to convince a garda of his innocence rather than the garda having to prove that he is guilty.  That is an incredible shift and a total turnaround.  I am sure many gardaí would agree with this.  If certain members of the community feel that the Bill would allow them to be hauled in, detained, harassed, hassled &mdash; the gardaí were not sure they were guilty of crime but they would be given a good dressing down or, if they did not commit this crime the chances were that they had committed some other crime, and if you do not get them for one you will get them for the other &mdash; that would be dangerous not only for the victims of such abuse but also for the Garda and society.</P>
    <P>I believe decent gardaí who believe in justice and civil rights would agree with <Col N="1921" /> that.  This could alienate that group of people from the Garda and make them suspicious, fearful and hostile, and it could also alienate the community because of a lack of credibility in the actions of the Garda.  Models abroad show us that the only way we can cope in a constructive, positive and long-term way with crime is with the co-operation, the trust and the support of the community. I suggest very strongly that certain sections like section 3 will not improve the position but make it deteriorate to such an extent that we could alienate the community from the Garda and put the Garda in an isolated and very dangerous position.  I would hope that the Garda would also see it in that light.</P>
    <P>I stand behind those who have expressed concern and anxiety about the rights of citizens, and I have pointed out some inherent dangers.  There are, however, some aspects of this Bill I should like to raise which may not already have been mentioned.  While some of our Garda stations may be inadequate for the powers now being given to the gardaí, our prison system is also inadequate.  Is the thrust of this Bill to increase the conviction rate?  Presumably if we introduce greater powers in relation to detention and interrogation and abolish the right to silence, that is the objective.  Let us consider the prison system.  We are aware that our prisons are overcrowded.  Prisoners are under stress and in many centres they lack training and exercise facilities and the space necessary to make life liveable.  I am especially concerned that we have no centre for female juveniles and that prison facilities for women are very overcrowded.  There is evidence of the resulting effect on women.  In Mountjoy women have not the necessary training facilities or exercise space and their main rehabilitation is concerned with doing laundry and sewing.  It is lamentable and depressing that these activities form the sole basis of their rehabilitation and no further skills or training are provided to enable them to return successfully to society.</P>
    <P>The Annual Report on Prisons and Places of Detention for the year 1982 states with regard to Mountjoy prison <Col N="1922" /> that a total of 4,448 men and 348 women were committed to prison during the year and that was the total on remand, for trial and under sentence.  There is a huge disparity between the numbers of men in prison and the number of women.  It is stated in the same report that during the year 12 males out of the 4,448 and 9 females out of the 348 were transferred to the Central Mental Hospital.  Most of them had been diagnosed as suffering from depression or schizophrenia. Nobody can tell me that the conditions under which these women were held and the very fact of imprisonment did not contribute to the transfer of a much higher proportion of women than men to the mental hospital.  This is a matter which needs urgent attention.</P>
    <P>Prison is one of the failures of all time. We know from the evidence of statistics that a great number of people are so damaged by the experience and so ill-equipped when they leave prison that they are set on a course which will continually return them to prison.  In this age of technology and psychology it should not be beyond our efforts to bring about a system which would have a higher success rate.  In other countries other means of coping with crime and criminals are being tried other than convicting them and sending them to prison.</P>
    <P>I do not want to appear to be sexist, but it has been suggested that we have one of the lowest crime rates among women in the western world and most of those convicted have committed crimes such as shoplifting, drunkenness and prostitution, often due to their environment. I attended an international seminar a couple of years ago and learned that a survey on the crime rate among women shows that the rate is not rising and that the crimes are usually a direct result of environment and experience rather than a deep criminal pattern.</P>
    <P>I suggest that instead of building a very large and expensive women's prison we should set up a series of units where the emphasis would be on training and retraining.  This would be an investment in people who have lost first time around and deserve an opportunity to live successfully in society.  Unless constructive <Col N="1923" /> measures such as this are adopted, legislation will not adequately redress the problem.  Investment in training and rehabilitation rather than in large buildings could be a model which could be evaluated and, perhaps, used for larger numbers and in relation to more serious crimes.  If we do not adopt that type of approach we will not get anywhere.  It has been said that there is no point in talking about legislation or increased convictions, longer prison terms and higher fines unless the whole framework and structure are changed radically and quickly.</P>
    <P>I accept and welcome the commitment of the Minister for Justice not to implement this legislation without also introducing a complaints procedure under an independent body.  However, because of the long-term results of this legislation and the need for safeguards and balance, much thought and consultation must go into the setting up of this independent body.  It should be a statutory body with the power given to the High Court of calling people before it.  It must be seen to be above pressurising or influencing from any source.  Welcome as this body will be, the complexities involved must be taken into consideration and there must be no hasty decision which would result in its not fulfilling the requirements for which it has been set up.  I would welcome a discussion paper on that subject, with perhaps inputs from the professional people of experience in the community, so that the body will succeed and will not need amendment, revision or patching up later.  Far too often agencies here do not meet their objectives because of political expediency or because not enough thought is given to them, particularly in the long-term.  I urge that great independence be given to that body so that lay people and gardaí will recognise it as a body which will give a fair and true judgment.</P>
    <P>We have talked much here, and rightly so, about Dáil reform.  At the outset, we stated that the reason for its necessity was that the parliamentary system under which we work was set up in a day and age when not alone was society more <Col N="1924" /> simple but it had traditional values and attitudes which emanated from one class only.  The British Parliament from which we inherited ours was set up for one class only and it is only slowly and painfully that the democratic procedural and practical changes have come about.</P>
    <P>The same can be said about our courts. Within the legal profession there is tremendous concern that we have not had the required court reform to meet the needs and complexities of the present day and have not got away from the days when one social class set up these courts to judge the lower social classes.  Court procedures are outdated.  They do not move quickly enough.  There is so much to be done on the administrative side. We update our industry and attempt to update our administration here and in the public service, but need the same updating for the courts.  The judges should not be involved in registering or in the day to day work which administrative staff should carry out.  It has been suggested by people in the legal profession that the court sittings are too short. Again, they are based on the standards of an outworn era of a more leisurely pace.  They cannot cope.  I think it was John Gore-Grimes of the Irish Association of Civil Liberty who said recently at their AGM that the courts may close down, but the need for the courts does not.  There is no holiday on that one.  The whole procedure on convictions and on the holding of people before charge is such that it attacks the credibility and constructiveness of the legal system and brings it into disrepute.  The Garda are frustrated because incredible time is wasted by them in waiting to see whether their cases will be called.  The same applies, even more painfully, with regard to those awaiting trial.  The public are concerned that there should be such delays.  Where serious crime is concerned, there is extra apprehension on the part of the public that a serious case may take two years to come to court. This leads to a cranking, old-fashioned machine which fails completely to meet the legal or human requirements involved.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have mentioned grave <Col N="1925" /> concern about the disparity and discrepancy between certain judgments handed down.  Some judgments, seen almost as aberrations, also occur in other countries. Within this House I would like to think that we realise that one person does not hold all the wisdom and professionalism, the strength and justice, within himself.  The judges must be facilitated in ensuring that judgments are in keeping with the circumstances of the crime and its seriousness.  I viewed with interest a television programme some time ago about certain American States which faced up to that problem.  They had set up a process whereby a prisoner who felt that he or she had been sentenced too harshly could have the case brought before a panel of judges in the specific State.  A judge or group of judges or legal professional people could follow the same procedure if they felt a doubt about the sentencing.  In no way should we have the right to intervene, as politicians, in the judgments or sentences handed down by judges.  At the same time, there must be a mechanism under which a case under appeal could be voted upon by a panel of judges and, on a majority vote, a judgment could be reviewed, revised or amended.  I urge the Minister to consider setting up such machinery.</P>
    <P>I refer now to a recent British television programme which interviewed the victims of crime, particularly of violent crime against the elderly and the vulnerable, which is an overriding fear in our society.  The programme showed that the great majority of victims of crime did not scream for vengeance.  They had such a sense of outrage at the invasion of their privacy or of their private person that they felt that even a conviction did not go any way to allay it.  It was interesting to find that the emphasis of the victims was not on increased powers or longer convictions but on the feeling that in some way they could get across to the person or persons who had treated them in that way how they felt.  One of the things we can do, knowing the fears, the isolation and the sense of outrage people feel, when they have been invaded in that way, is that we will do as they have done <Col N="1926" /> in Britain.  We will cope with this problem and try to solve it other than just by imprisonment.  They set up support groups for the victims where they were able to acknowledge their feelings.  Some kind of process should be set up so that the victim can be brought face to face with the person who has committed the crime against him or her so that, by dialogue, each can find out how the other feels.  In that way we could, hopefully, begin to get across to the person who commits the crime not just the denial of a person's property but the denial of the person's dignity and privacy that is taken from that person.</P>
    <P>I believe that until we actually operate on that level in regard to dealing with the motivation of criminals and the feelings of the people against whom crimes of violence have been committed, we will continue to isolate a situation where we say: &ldquo;Lock them up, send them away, extend the sentences&rdquo;.  The victims will not feel any better because of that unless they are of a very vengeful nature. Research has shown that is not fact, thankfully.  I believe we have to understand and support the victims of crime. We must ensure that the danger and the fear in which people live is removed.  I believe the only constructive long-term way in which we can do that is by everybody taking responsibility for the fact that it will not go away and that we cannot lock everybody up.</P>
    <P>I believe it is wrong and unfair to isolate and alienate the gardaí within the community and pretend they can carry out in isolation the task we have set them. We all have to take responsibility for the kind of society we want.  We know that until we get a more equitable and just society, until we remove the desperate poverty, the lack of future and the lack of any kind of human dignity worth preserving in people there will not be any motivation for them to stop committing crime.  We have actually damaged people in prison so much that they feel desolated outside prison.  Some of them even commit crime to get back into the security of a prison because there is no other security open to them.</P>
    <P>It is a particularly Irish characteristic <Col N="1927" />&mdash; we need not go into the historical reasons for it &mdash; that we demand conviction for breaking the law when it is somebody else who is involved.  All of us flout laws every day, from not wearing seat belts to drinking over the limit, trying to get somebody to fix it that we will not have to face a fine.  As long as we have that ambivalent attitude that it is all right if we can get out from under, if we can fix it but let the other person, particularly if it is something which injures us, pay for it, we will not have any kind of secure legislative system which will be seen as just or there is a need to uphold it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to everybody that not alone do we take personal responsibility within the community and make sure that we all shoulder responsibility for removing crime but that we all start taking the laws we have seriously and seeing it as socially responsible to uphold them.  We should also look at the hypocrisy where we have certain laws and certain legislation we think we can flout if we have enough money or enough status to avoid it while we victimise the rest.  There is no point in the Criminal Justice Bill, there is no point in increased powers.  I believe, with the powers we have, if we only set about striving to do what we should be doing in this area, then we would actually be tackling crime in any kind of responsible and honest way and the setting up of the kind of society where we can walk around in peace and security because everybody else will have enough peace and security not to threaten it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>My initial reaction to the Criminal Justice Bill was to regard it simply as a vehicle deliberately contrived to divert attention away from the failure of successive Governments over the last few years.  I saw it initially as a divergence from the major social issues of the present day, the issues of poverty and inequality as well as the massive unemployment question, in the sense that the Bill is being used to fabricate the view that the Government are responding to the needs of society when this Bill is doing nothing of the sort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider the Bill is a tactic of Government <Col N="1928" /> at a time when there is general dissatisfaction throughout the country with Government policy and its impact, particularly in disadvantaged areas and the poorer sections of the community. That dissatisfaction was very evident in the recent by-election in Dublin Central, an area which has suffered more than most from Government neglect over the decades and continues to do so, particularly now in a time of recession.  It was not just that element of what I call opportunist diversionary strategy which is of most concern to me.  The overall impact of the Bill itself is of more importance.  I believe if the Bill is implemented in full it will have a very important part in moulding society in the country over the next decade, but the type of society it will mould will be a very negative one.  It will be a most repressive society of this Bill in its entirety is implemented.  I do not welcome repression in any shape or form, but I firmly believe that if this Bill becomes law that will be its main contribution, because it will produce a very repressive society.  It will impose as part of our permanent legislation measures which are more akin to special short-term emergency powers.  It is certainly true that the public have for some time been demanding that action be taken to curb the rise in crime.  The public have been rightly calling for an increase in the number of gardaí on the beat to provide protection for the old and the vulnerable in particular.  It has been suggested also that the Garda need more modern equipment and training.  But it is not enough to increase numbers.  They have to be better trained and equipped.  I have yet to hear the public call for more restrictions on the individual's civil liberty or for repressive measures and yet that is what they are getting in this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is my view that the only people who have been pressurising for such repressive measures are a hardline section within the Garda supported by an ultra conservative section within the Government majority party.  I believe they are solely responsible for the oppressive nature &mdash; I emphasise &ldquo;oppressive&rdquo; because that is what it is &mdash; of many sections of this Bill.  It has been stated on <Col N="1929" /> a number of occasions that the motivation behind this Bill is to enable the Garda to deal more effectively with an increasingly sophisticated criminal element by giving them more powers to detain, search and interrogate persons suspected of involvement in crime.  The recent very alarming rise in crime, particularly the many vicious attacks against the person, is clearly of major public concern particularly in our urban areas. I certainly share that public disquiet and I will support any positive measures designed to combat crime.  The all-important question here is whether or not the increased police powers given in this Bill will have any positive effect whatever. Will they help to contain crime?  Alternatively, as an increasing number now believe, will they have a very negative effect?</P>
    <P>It is my view that this Bill, if passed in its present form, will have a negative effect.  While it may give the appearance that something is being done it will go nowhere near getting to the root of the problem.  If we fail to tackle the desperate social problems, especially in disadvantaged areas, and if we fail to provide modern resources and training for the Garda rather than the draconian powers proposed, we shall not do anything but add to the rising crime spiral.</P>
    <P>I will give just one or two examples to demonstrate what I mean.  There is a very definite connection between the recent widespread increase in the level of heroin abuse, particularly in Dublin, and the parallel rise in vicious criminal attacks. Heroin addicts feed their habits and pay the pushers by robbing or engaging in other criminal activity.  The recent Ministerial task force issued a list of priority recommendations which fall into several categories but can be summed up in two particular categories.  They refer to the need to provide more modern facilities and training for the Garda and, at the same time, concentrating social and economic resources into disadvantaged areas.  The thrust of the task force recommendation, if speedily implemented, could have a very positive impact on the heroin problem and, parallel <Col N="1930" /> with that, on the crime problem itself.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that the task force recommendation appeared approximately a week prior to the publication of this Criminal Justice Bill but the big difference is that the task force recommendations are simply that &mdash; recommendations &mdash; with no timescale whatsoever for their implementation while the Criminal Justice Bill will be implemented right away, and implemented in a very specific way.  On the positive side therefore we simply recommend and do very little and, on the negative side, we carry things through in very specific terms.  If the recommendations of the task force are not implemented, and it would seem to me there is little or no intention of implementing these recommendations in the short term, then there is hardly any likelihood of the Government concentrating resources in disadvantaged areas or doing anything positive to prevent that type of crime directly related to poverty.</P>
    <P>If we think in terms of those who fill our prisons today, the vast majority come from disadvantaged backgrounds, come from poor communities, and it does not need any great argument to make the case that there is a direct link between many categories of crimes and poverty. It follows logically then that unless we eliminate poverty we are not doing anything about the type of crime that stems directly from it.  I will give just one example of the type of crime I mean.  In Mountjoy women's prison there are mothers of six, seven and as many as ten children.  I know many of them.  They are serving terms of 12 months and more for shoplifting groceries and clothes for which they had a desperate need.  They saw no alternative available to them to provide for their children.  I am not now talking in theoretical terms.  I am talking about actual prisoners at the moment in Mountjoy.  I regard that so-called crime as morally defensible and morally justifiable. I could not say to any mother of a large family living in a poor area that she is not justified in taking such measures if she feels they are necessary and she has no alternative open to her to provide reasonable comfort for her children.  If <Col N="1931" /> we, the custodians of society, force her to do that we are criminals and she is a victim and not a criminal in any sense of the word.</P>
    <P>I well remember a leading trade unionist saying that this type of crime is in a crude way an attempt to redistribute the wealth of the nation.  I support that view wholeheartedly.  Far too many of those within our prisons today are there because they are poor and have no other option open to them but to engage in petty crime to give them some hope of a future worth living.  For the poor and the disadvantaged there is no justice in this Bill, in the courts, or anywhere else, and there will be no justice until we have a Government with the political will to eliminate poverty and redistribute the nation's wealth.  What we are getting is a very draconian measure.  It cannot be described in any other way.</P>
    <P>This Bill has many quite new and dangerously negative elements among its measures.  I refer to the section which would introduce unacceptable restrictions on the freedom and rights of individual citizens by making it possible to detain persons without charge for long periods and restricting their right to remain silent.  This is an unwarranted limitation on the civil liberties of our citizens. If introduced, these measures together will give Ireland the most oppressive pre-trial procedures in western Europe.  The effect would be to move the administration of justice out of the courts and into the cells of the Garda stations.  Several leading lawyers have already suggested that these measures &ldquo;effectively overturn the criminal justice system as it has developed over the past century.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>To look more specifically at the new powers contained in the Bill, it would allow the Garda the power to arrest and detain without charge anyone of whom they have even a mere suspicion of having been involved in an offence.  That person could be detained initially for six hours extended by another six hours and added to any period between midnight and 8 a.m. when no interrogation takes place. Such a lengthy detention of a citizen who <Col N="1932" /> is not charged with any crime whatsoever can have no justification.  It has been pointed out by many very eminent criminal lawyers that the use of the 7-day power of detention under the 1976 Emergency Powers Act did not have the effect of increasing the rate of convictions.  The likelihood is that there would be an increase in irregularities and abuses producing cases where innocent persons could be convicted and where Garda credibility would be increasingly undermined both in the courts and in public opinion.  It is hardly necessary to refer to the case of Nicky Kelly who after a very lengthy period of detention and interrogation during which he had no access to a solicitor &mdash; this Bill does not provide for that, it does not even give a guarantee that people detained for such lengthy periods would have access to solicitors &mdash; and during which he claimed he was abused and ill-treated and later produced medical evidence in support of that claim, yet was convicted solely on the basis of a statement made by him when he was, as he said, at the point of despair and exhaustion.</P>
    <P>What public confidence would we have if this treatment is to be a regular feature in our courts?  The Nicky Kelly case by itself has helped to undermine public confidence in the courts and the Garda.  Any increase in the powers of detention without charge could only add to that atmosphere of disquiet, and we would not have an isolated case such as Nick Kelly's but an increasing number of similar type victims of the system of justice.  To extend this power further would be a very serious departure from the principle that a person should not be punished, in this instance, by the deprivation of his liberty, unless convicted of a criminal offence.</P>
    <P>The second disquieting aspect of this Bill is the curtailment of the right to silence.  The provisions in the Bill make it an offence to withhold certain information and also allow the court to take negative inferences from an accused person's failure to mention relevant information to the Garda even if he simply forgets to do so.  These provisions clearly impose a dramatic restoration on the long-standing right of a person to remain <Col N="1933" /> silent.  My understanding is that such provisions are taken word for word from recommendations in the British Criminal Law Revision Committee's Report which were rejected by the House of Lords.  It has also been pointed out by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that such provisions run counter to the firm legal principle that you cannot torture silence into an admission.  One of the underlying principles of our criminal justice system will be altered by this curtailment of the right to silence.  It will mean effectively that any suspect must convince the Garda of his or her innocence in order to obtain freedom.  The basis principle that one should be considered innocent until proven guilty all but goes by the board.</P>
    <P>This change is all the more serious in that it would apparently be introduced without any effective system of safeguards to prevent its abuse.  In this regard the victims would not be the new sophisticated godfathers of crime; quite the contrary, it would be the very young, uneducated, inarticulate who would fall victim to the very real danger of ever-increasing Garda harassment and ill-treatment. The Minister has indicated that some kind of complaints procedure as a safeguard against abuse would eventually be introduced.  It is ironic that, despite the very specific details of the repressive measures in the Bill, there is no clarification whatever of this complaints procedure.  How any complaints procedure could operate effectively in the context of this Bill becoming law is hard to imagine, since it would inevitably be a question of the word of the complainant against the word of one or more gardaí.</P>
    <P>Even now, given this new opportunity, not one of the O'Briain Committee's recommendations for the safeguarding of persons detained in Garda custody is included in the Bill.  Remember that the O'Briain committee under Judge Barra O'Briain was set up after the very disquieting detailed reports in <i>The Irish Times</i> that suggested that a heavy gang were operating within the Garda and that Nicky Kelly was one of their victims.  The Government set up the O'Briain committee who produced a lengthy report <Col N="1934" /> with a long list of recommendations.  So far not one of those recommendations has been implemented or is contained in the Criminal Justice Bill.  I may seem one-sided in what I am saying about the Bill, yet that alone demonstrates how one-sided the Bill itself is.</P>
    <P>Another disquieting element about the Bill is that there is no provision for or guarantee of access to a solicitor for a detained person.  There is no guarantee of immediate access of young persons &mdash; I am talking about children &mdash; to their parents.  The power of detention applies to all citizens from the age of seven upwards and to a whole range of offences, many of a petty nature.  It is not directed against the elite heroin pushers which we have been led to believe is the real objective of the Bill.  In many cases the victims will be anything but the criminal elite.  They will be those who are already social victims themselves.</P>
    <P>The overall impact of the Bill appears to me to be repressive, with no attempt to examine the underlying causes of much of crime today.  Those who want a police state will warmly welcome the Bill but those who believe in civil liberties inevitably will deplore it.  All Deputies will be aware of the many organisations who have communicated their dissatisfaction with the Bill.  I am not talking of organisations in one particular sphere of activity. I am talking about a wide-ranging group of organisations as diverse as, for example, on the one hand the Conference of Major Religious Superiors and, at the other end of the spectrum, the Prisoners' Rights Organisation.  All of us have received lengthy communications from these groups, expressing disquiet at many of the provisions in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that society must deal effectively with the new ruthless criminal elite but I do not accept that society need degrade itself by stooping to the level of that criminal elite.  That is the real danger inherent in the repressive aspects of the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I have listened to the previous speaker and other speakers and it appears that everything that could be said about criminal justice has been said <Col N="1935" /> at this stage.  Deputy Gregory has been consistent with what he believes in.  He has attacked many of the provisions in the Bill and I will deal with them more specifically during my speech.</P>
      <P>I am concerned, as are my colleagues in the House, with the promotion of law and order.  I believe that people who are guilty of committing crime should be brought to justice and made paid the penalty for their misdeeds.  The passing of the Criminal Justice Bill will give greater power to the Garda to combat crime more effectively.  That is long overdue.</P>
      <P>The power to detain, search and interrogate suspected criminals is a necessary aid to our police force at a time when crime is increasing at an alarming rate. The low level of conviction associated with this major increase in crime must reflect very much on the constraints imposed on the detection methods by the most recent interpretations of our courts. Many people have referred to the differing penalties imposed in the courts for offences that may not appear serious or grave to people outside.  All of us know of such instances which can lead to resentment.  I support the view expressed that there should be uniformity in the penalties imposed by district justices in the District Court.</P>
      <P>The police force exists to serve the public need.  The question arises whether the Garda Síochána are meeting that public need.  In my view, the answer has to be in the negative because they are being seriously impeded from securing detection in the first place and, in the final analysis, securing conviction because of the legal constraints to which I have referred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Crime, both indictable and summary, has increased significantly in recent years.  Various Governments, the police force and the agencies associated with the detection and conviction of crime have preoccupied themselves with attempting to find solutions.  In the past ten years reported crime has increased by 156 per cent but in the same period the percentage of crime detection has fallen from 48 per cent to 34 per cent.  It is no <Col N="1936" /> wonder the public are seriously concerned about this matter.  Heroin abuse to which Deputy Gregory referred &mdash; one of the most insidious and destructive maladies to affect any society &mdash; is rampant in Dublin city and, to a lesser extent, in Waterford and Cork.  The problem is increasing there all the time.  The Garda are experiencing difficulties and this is an attempt to strengthen their hands.  For that reason I support the Bill.</P>
    <P>The annual Crime Report by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána which was published last October shows more than a 9 per cent increase in crime.  The largest increase was in the area of offences against property.  The theft of cars and larcenies of all kinds are on the increase but with a lower level of detection and convictions being achieved.  That situation cannot be allowed to continue. In his year in office the Minister for Justice has shown his determination to tackle the problem and he has my support in this matter.  During 1983 almost 1,600 persons were found in possession of drugs.  The most disturbing factor was the amount of heroin seized.  The use and abuse of drugs has heralded a new era of crime.  The effectiveness of the due processes of law to deal with this great social evil demands serious and immediate examination.</P>
    <P>The extent and involvement of young people in criminal activity is a cause for serious concern.  One-third of all apprehended for criminal offences are under 17 years.  Is that not a startling reminder that something is amiss with our educational system?  Lack of full participation in that system in a more rewarding and meaningful way leads to frustration, boredom and a high percentage of dropouts at all school levels.  Eventual lack of opportunity towards a positive involvement in society opens the way to criminal activity.  I do not believe one can put the blame for criminal activity on lack of opportunity, either educationally or otherwise.  In a civilised society we cannot stand aside and allow criminal activity to develop unabated.  The enforcement of law and order is vital to any civilised society, whether it be theistic or atheistic. The terrifying escalation of offences <Col N="1937" /> against a person or property demands an immediate response from all who desire that society be protected against this hooligan element.</P>
    <P>How has the law responded to this threat?  It has responded to the detriment of crime detection by applying more rigid interpretations of Garda powers giving rise to additional impediments to the investigative process which, in effect, nullifies many investigations.  I suggest that much of the machinery and proceedings which are available to the Garda ten or 15 years ago have now been nullified because of various interpretations of the law by the courts.</P>
    <P>In the case of a rape of a 12 year old or a 14 year old, a finger mark of the culprit is found at the scene and a man strongly suspected.  Common sense demands an arrest should be made immediately but, under existing law, the gardaí are preempted from making such an arrest.  They are entitled to detain only for the purpose of bringing an offender before the courts, but to justify such action they must have a <i>prima facie</i> case against the accused.  In the rape case which I have cited no such case against the suspect exists and, consequently, through lack of finger print evidence which would make up the deficiency and bring about a conviction, the suspected person is freed.  The gardaí in those circumstances are virtually impotent to take positive action in regard to many serious crimes, and the public are horrified that such a situation should obtain.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets about the task of assisting the Garda to a greater degree in securing evidence for the conviction of criminals. It will undoubtedly facilitate the police force in ensuring that all advocates of crime and social disorder are rendered liable for their crimes.  It is then a matter for the courts to secure a conviction.  The powers, however, which this Bill proposes to bestow on the Garda for the apprehension and prosecution of suspected criminals needs further examination lest the rights and liberties of innocent citizens are seriously diminished.  I know that the Minister and all Deputies are conscious of this very important aspect.  Nevertheless, the Minister has an <Col N="1938" /> obligation to assure the House that sufficient procedures attend the enactment of this Bill whereby the innocent will not be unfairly treated.  Such provisions are contained in the Bill, but a proper complaints procedure mentioned by many speakers, to eliminate abuses, is a necessary condition to assuage public disquiet. Can we say that increased powers to our police will significantly reduce crime levels?  It has been suggested that this is tinkering with the symptoms rather than tackling the disease.</P>
    <P>Many people suggest that factors like slum dwelling, mental deficiency, unemployment and an unhappy home life are the causes of crime.  It does not follow, however, that the unhappy victims of these adverse conditions are fatally geared towards a life of crime.  There is no evidence to support such a view.  If poverty, bad housing and unemployment are the sole causes of rising crime, why is it that only some people experiencing these conditions become delinquent or break the law consistently?  Therefore, there must be personal factors as to why some people can endure these conditions and remain law abiding while others cannot. Irrespective of the squalor of one's upbringing or the conditioning of society in which one lives, the perpetrators of crime must be made to answer to society for their wrongdoing.</P>
    <P>The most serious objection to this Bill has come from a section of the legal profession and the Council of Civil Liberty. They suggest that detention without charges for long periods and the curtailment of the right to silence is an unwarranted assault on the civil liberties of the person and interferes with the due processes of law.  Such pre-trial procedures would lessen pressure on the time of the courts, and if there was a proper investigatory process in police methods, provided they have the powers to do so, I do not believe there would be abuse in that respect.  If there were abuses, procedures should be introduced to ensure that those who abused privileges in that respect would answer for it.  The people who make these accusations against legislative measures are those who have a high level of income by fiddling and playing about <Col N="1939" /> with the law knowing at the outset that in many instances the people they purport to defend are guilty.  That is the law and we cannot change it, nor can we change the right of anyone in the legal profession to take on a case even though he or she may know they are on a loser. I do not concur with the fears expressed by members of the legal profession with regard to sections 14 to 18.  The innocent need have no fears and, by its very nature, law enforcement is only concerned with the guilty.  The right to silence has been openly abused in the past and continues to be abused on a much wider scale by very cunning and skilful criminals.  These people manipulate the law by using clever and well-versed lawyers.</P>
    <P>In the past the right of the gardaí to detain suspects was not clearly defined but this form of detention was not seriously contested in the courts.  Lately, however, that situation has changed dramatically. It stands to reason that many provisions in the Bill are badly needed. Many judgments on how evidence was secured, even to the extent of murder charges, have been given stating that confessions were made while in detention that were not in accordance with the law and, consequently, people were acquitted. As the law stands the Garda have no right to arrest for the purpose of obtaining evidence.  As a result of that the time of the Garda is wasted while the criminal goes free or goes underground.  Therefore, in relation to the question of detention without charge I urge the Minister to assure the House that we are not permitting an unending, Garda-station pre-trial situation, that a person who is allowed to go free after being questioned in relation to an offence will not be re-arrested subsequently and re-interrogated.  We must enshrine in our law definite precautions so far as the innocent are concerned.  I am not seriously concerned about those who are guilty, but until such time as people are proved guilty or acquitted as the case may be, we must ensure that their civil rights are protected.  Up to now the Garda have detained suspects.  If they did not do so they would not be in a <Col N="1940" /> position to secure lawful prosecutions. This Bill is merely formalising and legalising a procedure that has been part and parcel of the interrogation and detention process down through the years.</P>
    <P>There has been reference during the course of this debate to alleged serious Garda brutality in relation to the apprehension of an epileptic.  There have been reports in the newspapers also in regard to this case.  I would be horrified to think that anything of that sort could even be contemplated by our gardaí.  I am hoping that when concluding this Stage of the Debate the Minister will be able to refute those charges and tell us that they are without foundation.  I suggest that the full facts of the case in question be made available and put on the record of this House in order to eliminate any public disquiet that may have been created by the outburst of the Deputy who raised the matter.</P>
    <P>The possibility of someone being invited to attend at a Garda station to help in inquiries was demolished in 1981 as a result of a further court ruling in this regard.  There is a reference to reasonable suspicion which may include such factors as confidential information, a known criminal record of the suspect and a propensity for the type of crime in question. In such circumstances the Garda are in a quandry in that on the one hand they are authorised to arrest on suspicion, on grounds which would be insufficient to warrant a charge before the courts, while on the other hand they are debarred from getting the necessary evidence to secure a conviction.  That situation must be changed, and that is precisely what we are doing in the Bill.</P>
    <P>During my short time in this House I have canvassed in a number of Dublin by-elections and I have found that there are some areas of this city in which I would not like to park my car.  There may be some Deputies who have had their cars stolen or subjected to vandalism while the owners were canvassing.  In any event, the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles is a feature of criminal behaviour that has become all too prevalent in recent years.  Many of these stolen vehicles are taken by joyriders.  The youths <Col N="1941" /> involved in this sort of activity repeat these criminal acts on a regular basis. Vehicles are stolen also for use in the commission of even more serious crimes including armed robbery, another crime that has become all too prevalent in modern society.  However, only a very small percentage of the criminals involved are brought to justice.  In many instances the Garda are well aware of the identity of the offenders but they are powerless to take any action against them.  When vehicles are found there is usually ample scientific evidence to bring the culprits before the courts but because of lack of finger-printing facilities no action is taken.  All too often cars are stolen and driven past Garda stations by way of inviting the Garda to give chase.  Some gardaí on motor bike patrol have been rammed by those cars and killed in some instances.  Yet there are people who come in here and say that the Bill is repressive. Perhaps that accusation can be levelled at certain sections of the Bill, but if there is provision for proper supervision to be applied to the various detection methods in order to guarantee that no abuse of privilege will arise, I do not see what anyone has to complain of.</P>
    <P>Detention is permissible only in the case of offences against the State.  I regard such a provision as essential in enabling the Garda to carry out their detection duties.  In the long history of our police force the level of abuse of power and authority is insignificant when compared with the difficulties in which the Garda have had to operate.  In my view an extension of these powers will not transform arrest into a tour of crime investigation without judicial supervision of the period of detention despite the contrary being suggested by some of the liberal elements, even if they be well-meaning liberals, who set themselves up as the great protectors of society.  These are the first people to squeal if, on demanding protection for themselves, they think that that protection is not forthcoming quickly enough.  It was suggested also by a speaker this evening that when this Bill becomes law, it will be the most repressive piece of legislation of any country in western Europe.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1942" /> The position in other countries does not bear that out.  I do not see the reason for the major concern in regard to being charged or detained on suspicion.  In Belgium a person who fails to produce identification is liable to 24 hours minimum detention.  We are a long way from that.  In Holland the authorities may detain a person for up to four days, while in England, where there is no recourse to a solicitor when in detention, a person can be detained for up to 48 hours.  In Ireland a prisoner has an absolute right to a solicitor but that right does not exist in England or many other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>For far too long criminals who have had the right to remain silent have produced alibis when they appeared in court. In many cases the production of an alibi secured unworthy acquittals because the evidence tendered could not be checked. What is wrong with imposing an obligation on the person detained to produce evidence that will mean either instant acquittal or a conviction in court eventually? The provisions in the Bill are necessary to deal with the guilty people but I must demand certain safeguards so that innocent people are protected adequately.</P>
    <P>Commentators here condemned the power being vested in the Garda to hold suspects in detention as an unwarranted assault on the liberty of individuals.  That assertion was made by the last speaker. That amounts to a biased and unsustainable view because the public interest is at stake.  If such powers are not available the system is open to abuse.  If immediate detention is not available to a police force criminals will go underground remaining free to commit other offences.  Criminals can also destroy evidence vital to secure a conviction, interfere with witnesses or secure an alibi.  Experience has shown that failure to detain them is an incentive to commit further crimes.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that some of the provisions of the Bill will lead to resentment by the public of the police, thereby creating poor community relations, needs careful examination.  However, if the Bill is to be effective it must ensure against deliberate or unintentional harassment of <Col N="1943" /> people not involved in crime now.  Further discussion and amendments to give adequate protection to the innocent is most desirable on Committee Stage.  That is my serious reservation about the Bill. If there is not a safeguard, the police and the public, could be at loggerheads to the detriment of the community</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that in order to tackle the alarming increase in crime there is a need to have more gardaí, better equipment and so on.  It is no harm to repeat what Deputy Bruton said in regard to this.  He pointed out that in the last ten years the strength of the force has increased from 8,000 to 11,500 or one garda for every 80 families.  The comparative figure in Great Britain is half that number, although there are more slum dwellings in the bigger cities there and a greater level of poverty.  In our prisons the number of prison officers has increased from 400 to 1,600 in the last ten years or almost one officer for every two prisoners.  If criminals are made aware that there is a greater prospect of their being detected, that will act as a deterrent and we will not need the extra prison accommodation some Members have called for.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that it costs £30,000 per year to keep a person in prison.  I do not accept that.  These are relative matters. The prison service must continue and we must provide accommodation.  If we had that type of money we would not spend it on prisons but keep four or five families in reasonable living conditions. In regard to the technology that is available to the Garda, I should like to point out that those from other countries who have examined the equipment available are amazed that we are so advanced.  The Department of Justice is often accused of failing to provide adequate equipment but that is not so.  In 1975 we did not have a forensic expert but we have 16 in 1983 and eight technicians.  It is said that our police force has the most up to date services possible.</P>
    <P>It is alleged that gardaí are not availing fully of forensic science and modern technology, that we suffer from an appalling deficiency in regard to equipment; but we <Col N="1944" /> have increased the number of experts since 1975.  It is for that reason that the Garda Commissioner is more than happy with the forensic science laboratory which compares favourably with similar facilities in other countries.  Other experts are available to the Garda, in particular the services of the State pathologist. It is wrong to claim that the facilities should be improved.</P>
    <P>I should like to know why those new methods are not being used in the detection of crime?  The answer is simple.  The legal constraints I mentioned ensure that without a change in the law such as is proposed in the Bill the Garda cannot secure a conviction.  Once there is not an authority to take the fingerprints of a suspect, take a sample of blood, hair, scrapings from fingernails or traces of blood or fibres on clothing it is difficult to get a conviction.  What is the greatest fear of first offenders who approach politicians? &ldquo;What kind of a penalty, what kind of a fine will I get?&rdquo; Sometimes they question if there is some way around the law.  Probably that is the first thing they will ask.  I am happy to say that the present Minister has improved that situation considerably and assured the public more than did other Minister in the past.  Such criminals are also concerned about whether it will appear in the papers or whether they will get a prison sentence. These are the deterring factors.  As long as a culprit knows that the possibility of detection is remote he will continue in that vein and most certainly will not be deterred from committing further crime. That is particularly true of people who steal cars and so on.</P>
    <P>I reiterate that there is an obligation on the Garda to ensure that they do not abuse their position.  Possibly there is need for further training, of an enlightened approach to the use of their position and not abusing it.  The abuse of their privilege in the past by a small minority of Garda &mdash; perhaps under intimidation &mdash; did reflect on the Force generally and created a certain measure of public disquiet. We must ensure that there is sufficient training to safeguard against that recurring.</P>
    <P>Since assuming office the Minister has <Col N="1945" /> achieved significant improvement in policing and the availability of police on our streets, of which I am totally supportive. I am indeed concerned that, as a rural Deputy, in many rural areas I have noted the decay &mdash; and I use the word deliberately &mdash; of local, parochial Garda stations which in the past would have been manned by a sergeant and perhaps two or sometimes three gardaí.  That situation no longer obtains; one would be lucky to find one garda in most rural parishes for two hours on average each day.  It must be remembered that rural communities are growing and developing but that they are being policed by remote control. Even with the increased personnel in the Garda Síochána from 8,000 to 11,500, account has not been taken of that fact. A policeman who knows his community, who is in continuous contact with them will be a better policeman, will prevent crime because he will build up a happy, proper relationship, which, at the end of the day, constitutes an extremely important cost-saving factor.  Most of these rural Garda stations are now closed at night though one may find the occasional one remaining open.  I am most concerned about that.  With the passage of this Bill I am sure we will see a significant increase in the level of detection, that people will discover that they can no longer get away with what they did in the past.  Therefore I am certain its provisions will act as a deterrent.</P>
    <P>There are various pilot schemes being promoted which may sometimes not have the support and backing of the rank and file members because it maintains a check on them, it is known where they are at any given time of the day or night and, above all it is known where such personnel should be.  In that respect there is great need for greater commitment from a number of our Garda who, by and large are an exemplary Force who have served the nation exceptionally well over the years.</P>
    <P>I am happy that it is clearly stated in the appropriate section that finger-printing, tape recordings and so on that will form part and parcel of the provisions of this Bill will be destroyed immediately if a person is not charged or is acquitted. <Col N="1946" /> Section 9 takes account of further offences committed while a person is on bail.  That is a most important section because people on bail have flouted the law for far too long and have committed further crimes for which there was no further penalty or penalties.  I am indeed happy that that loophole is being closed. Of course this Bill does not provide for a majority verdict in the jury system &mdash; it is outside the terms of the Bill &mdash; although in respect of certain offences a majority verdict does apply and I welcome that provision.  Formerly if one person only could be got at, in many cases, that was sufficient to secure a conviction whilst the majority of that jury knew damn well that that person was guilty.  In the past some people who were found to be guilty by a jury system were acquitted subsequently.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he examine some aspects of the law dealing with motor insurance problems where the jury system has milked &mdash; and I use the word deliberately &mdash; those people paying insurance on their motor cars.  There should be some study undertaken so that the amount of time usurped in the courts on some of these cases could be lessened as also the cost to the insurance companies. The PMPA may have been inefficiently run.  Nonetheless they gave a service to young people, indeed to all sorts of people who could not otherwise get motor insurance cover.  Part of the problem of that company and many others engaged in similar motor insurance cover was that they were forced out of business through the high costs imposed on them by enormous court awards.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be specific on a Bill of this nature but I am seriously concerned about the great discrepancy existing between the fines imposed by certain district justices and others.  I heard of a case recently of a small prank &mdash; when a tractor was moved from outside a public-house a few yards up the road, placed in a safe position inside a gateway &mdash; when the unfortunate person associated with it had his driving licence suspended for two years and was fined £200, with an associated one year suspension and so on. That amounts to a maladministration of <Col N="1947" /> justice and serious account should be taken of it.  Some of the district justices should be sent back to school to learn the best way to ensure the maintenance of understanding between the public and the legal system.</P>
    <P>Criminal law must not be regarded as purely academic.  It is not something for lawyers, well versed, to play around with in court.  They must take some account of the nature and circumstances of the crimes with which they are dealing.  The criminal law has to do with everyday situations in the real world.</P>
    <P>The people concerned with civil liberties and most strongly opposed to the reform of our archaic laws may be well intentioned.  Some of them are concerned about the right to silence, about detaining persons for 12 hours, about inferences arising from silence, but they must equally have a responsibility towards the degradation caused when a 12-year-old or a 14-year-old is raped.  The gardaí will tell you all about it after they visit parents in such cases.  In the last few days a harmless, well intentioned old vagrant was mugged and murdered in Waterford and last night a 75-year-old was similarly murdered. Are the people who advocated civil liberties suggesting that we should be protecting the perpetrators of such crimes?</P>
    <P>Allegations against the Garda in many instances are without foundation. Because of the nature of their work they are prevented from making statements in their own defence and because of their silence it appears to the public they may be guilty.  However, the level of guilt proved against them is extremely low. That campaign against the Garda is orchestrated by professional criminals in a campaign to degrade the police in the eyes of society.  Their aim is to demoralise the force &mdash; I am sure the Minister for Justice, through this Bill, will ensure that that will not be the effect of such campaigns.</P>
    <P>I could develop further points.  I am glad of the opportunity to make my views known on the Bill.  I have no legal training but a certain measure of common sense, and that applies whether one has legal <Col N="1948" /> degrees or not.  I know what is acceptable and not acceptable to the majority of our people.  Whether it is by improving economic conditions or the environment in which people live, we have an obligation as a civilised developing society to ensure that criminality will be challenged and defeated and that those responsible will be detected and punished.</P>
    <P>For all those reasons I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on it.  Many of his predecessors had thought about it but they did not have either the courage or the time to bring it to this stage.  The fears expressed by the legal profession are mainly in regard to sections 14 to 18. Fears have also been expressed by various minority interests.  I believe these fears will prove unfounded if a proper complaints procedure is initiated and effectively administered.  The Garda Síochána have earned the respect of all sections.  They are a body of outstanding men and women whose only desire is to detect and to prevent crime, to protect public property and life, to maintain public peace and good order.  Surely they are entitled to our full support and co-operation in pursuing these objectives.  How effective the Bill will be in combating crime remains to be seen.  I hope that lack of prison space will not in any way hinder or impede its value to society.  I will be looking forward to any amendments the Minister may propose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>The last thing the Bill is intended to do is to put the liberty of innocent citizens at risk.  However, none of us in the House should apologise for increasing the risk of loss of liberty of those guilty of serious crime.  That is what this long awaited Bill should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The escalation of criminal activity and its cost have been well documented.  I will not trouble the House with the statistics, but a conservative figure of £250 million per annum brings home to us the economic and social burden of the rapidly increasing crime wave.  There is little comfort for the Government in the fact that the problem is world wide &mdash; we share it with most of the developed world.  The cause remains undefined or at best disagreed on.  There is no doubt <Col N="1949" /> that poverty, unemployment and poor social conditions play a major part, but the great majority of the poor are never involved in crime.</P>
    <P>What do we mean by &ldquo;the poor&rdquo;?  The definition applies to a criterion far wider than a mere economic one.  True equality in a society, by man's very nature, is unattainable, but to make the concept of equal opportunity for all our children a reality, far more needs to be done, particularly in the areas of housing, education and health care, and in the workplace and the area of justice.</P>
    <P>Immediately the question of further capital expenditure is raised, and we all know that the opposite is probably what faces us as a country.  The concept of only spending on ourselves what we can afford as a nation is gradually dawning on us. We can no longer count on the option of unlimited foreign borrowing.  We should no longer count on it, because we did so for far too long and we will be servicing the debts of the spending of the last decade for a long time to come.  With a limited budget we must insist that it will be spent where it is most needed and that we will get the best possible value for money.</P>
    <P>Money alone will never solve the problem of crime, nor indeed will legislation. Why is it common today for old ladies to be mugged, raped, assaulted, for no obvious reason, maybe for as little as £10?  Why do those most vulnerable, the old, the young and the infirm, come under increasing attack?  They are afraid to open their doors after dark, apart altogether from going out alone.  It is a long time in this city since one could leave the front door ajar, when neighbours dropped in and out several times a day. It happened in rural Ireland up to recently.  Neighbours dropped in to borrow tea or a spoon of sugar, or just to chat.  It was an excuse to chat, to communicate, to have time for each other. Loneliness was unheard of.  We never had old people dying alone, unattended, suffering from hunger or hypothermia.</P>
    <P>No longer is this the case.  What has changed it?  Is it pride due to increasing prosperity?  Are we too proud now to admit need?  Is it the demise of the <Col N="1950" /> extended family due to unmarried couples living in high-rise flats very far from their parents?  In the extended family, word of mouth passed on our traditions and our culture, all the things that were dear to us.  There was time to sit, to think, to talk without competition from the television at full volume, to occupy the leisure hours, where there was unison with and an understanding of nature itself &mdash; the land, seasons, from the spring sowing to the autumn harvest, understanding growth and all life cycles that regulate our existence.  Is it any wonder that the child who has never seen a green field or felt the sand of a beach under his toes as he gazes at the sea goes from a life of vandalism to petty crime and on to serious crime?  There are thousands of such children in our cities.  Many people think this statement could not be true, but those of us with experience of our bigger urban areas know this to be a sad reality.  If you live in harmony with the environment your chances of living in harmony with the community are good.</P>
    <P>Being truly poor does not mean being relatively lacking in material goods in this life; it means being deprived, deprived of the beauty of life itself and of understanding what life is about.  The wealthiest in our community can also be the poorest or the most deprived.  Money is not the only answer.  It is of course very important for the provision of basic rights, and we must strive to ensure that no one's standard of living falls below certain acceptable standards of existence: too many do at the moment.</P>
    <P>We must expect more from our education system in our fight against crime. Our education system fails miserably to open our children's eyes to the world that exists beyond academia to true values. Our children are taught to look without seeing.  The wonders of the meadows, the forests and the seashore are not on our curriculum.  We teach them nothing about themselves, their development or human relationships.  Is it any wonder old women or young children are raped when the only reference at school to human sexuality is a list of what you must not do &mdash; if you are lucky.  There is something wrong with our system when the sight of <Col N="1951" /> a child at the breast causes either acute embarrassment or hysterical giggles.  Is this the price we pay for so-called sophistication? Education in child care should be part of the curriculum for boys and girls, as it is on the continent, as should a thorough understanding of human biology.  In my opinion there would be less drink and drug abuse if the damage such abuses causes the human body was immediately understood by the abuser. After all, self-preservation is our strongest instinct.</P>
    <P>Drug related crimes are one of the most serious aspects of the problem before us.  Desperation drives the addict to criminal activity to meet his needs. The Medico-Social Research Board recently showed that most heroin addicts end up in prison.  I do not have the solution to this problem, but while I feel the solution to the crime is not the same as the solution of the criminal, this Bill will help.  There is no doubt that this problem will not be solved by this Bill.  This will only be done by tackling the grave social problems that exist for a variety of reasons, especially in our cities.</P>
    <P>This Bill should be a deterrent to the criminal, and the increased police powers should significantly affect crime levels by increasing the criminal's chance of being detected and charged and, above all, attempting to tilt the balance of our system in favour of the victim, who is so often forgotten.  We must get the equation right.  As a community we must have the right perspective on the criminal and the victim.  The Garda act on our behalf and deserve reasonable powers to do their job, and I stress &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo;. Undoubtedly they had problems with criminal investigation over the years. Inadmissibility of evidence, even in murder cases, has resulted in the guilty going free.</P>
    <P>Before I go into some of the sections in the Bill, I would like to refer briefly to two very important and related matters. The first is the question of Garda recruitment and training.  At the moment with more than 11,000 members in the Garda Síochána we have a force with a good record in most areas.  However, any <Col N="1952" /> organisation this size, no matter how well it is run, would have a few who do nothing to enhance the public perception of their role.  It only takes the behaviour of a small number to abuse their authority to undermine the community/Garda relationship which is vital to the task of combatting crime.  To this end, even with our budgetary restrictions, we will have to provide the resources and training which any modern police force now requires. We will have to provide the forensic equipment required to increase the present detection rate of one in three.  Our policing policies in general need a thorough reappraisal.  The day when every child knew the name of the local garda on the beat has long gone, but there is no reason why every child should not realise that the garda on the beat represents security and a helping hand if needed.</P>
    <P>The Special Task Force and the operations of the recently strengthened Drug Squad have met with great success.  The effect of the increase in the numbers in the force, especially on the beat in our cities, is in evidence.  Yet, a lot needs to be done to restore the community's confidence in a situation which they fear is getting out of control.</P>
    <P>The whole area of parental control of juvenile offenders needs immediate attention in conjunction with increasing the age of criminal responsibility.  It is frightening to think that in discussing this Bill we are in fact considering its application to anyone over the age of seven years who may have committed a serious offence.</P>
    <P>There has been criticism of this Bill on the ground that a procedure for investigating complaints against the gardaí was not set up simultaneously.  The Minister has promised, and stated categorically, that the new Garda powers contained in the Bill will not be brought into effect until the complaints scheme or independent tribunal has been set up.  I accept without any doubt that this will be the case, but I must admit it would have been much better if the details of such a tribunal were known to all, including the force itself, before this Bill was passed. But this is not to be.  That such a procedure for dealing with complaints is necessary <Col N="1953" /> is beyond doubt, not least for the sake of the gardaí themselves.</P>
    <P>This Bill is a piece of complicated legislation and its main provision deals with detention.  Section 3 allows detention in a Garda station where, under existing law, a garda has arrested without warrant a person &mdash; seven years old and over &mdash; suspected with reasonable cause of having committed an indictable offence punishable by imprisonment for five years and where the member in charge of that station has reasonable grounds for believing that detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.  The six-plus-six-plus-eight hour detention period has been well documented by other speakers.  There is common sense in this provision, provided it works as intended.  I would like to see an obligation on the member in charge to log or record the reasonable grounds for obvious reasons, not least because under subsection 3 (4) the detained person must be released immediately if there are no longer these reasonable grounds for suspecting he has committed an offence. Without a record of these reasonable grounds I fail to understand how this subsection will work justly at all times.</P>
    <P>Under subsection 3 (5) in my view a record of the reasonable grounds would be helpful because this subsection imposes a duty on the gardaí to charge the detained person as soon as they have evidence to do so, unless the person is suspected with reasonable cause of having committed another such offence, and that the member in charge has reasonable grounds to prolong detention.  Without record of the reasonable grounds for the original six-plus-six-plus-eight hour detention period, who can prove that the reasonable grounds involved in the second, or indeed subsequent, detention periods are based on the same or similar issues or whether they involve another offence?</P>
    <P>Section 3 provides for a person being detained between midnight and 8 a.m. and where the member in charge considers questioning should be suspended to allow the detained person a period of rest.  As such, this rest period will be subtracted from the permitted period of <Col N="1954" /> detention.  Provision is made for recording this break and the detained person will have it explained to him and will have to sign the record.  Provision is also included if it becomes necessary to further question the person during the time of suspension.  This can be done for serious reasons only.</P>
    <P>While we are increasing the powers of the Garda, quite rightly, we must ensure that there are adequate safeguards which a written record of the so-called &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; would provide.  The member in charge of the station should have an obligation to accept responsibility for what constitutes &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; and should be able to overrule a member's view if the grounds were in any way unsound.</P>
    <P>Before I leave section 3 I should like clarification on whether the reference in the conditions for detention also includes an indictable offence punishable by penal servitude for five years or more as, for example, in the case of embezzlement. Can I presume that the term of imprisonment in the Bill is to be interpreted in its widest sense?  The Minister may refer to this in his summing up or on the next stage.</P>
    <P>Section 4 does not change the present situation effectively.  It provides for notification of a solicitor and named person of the detention.  The expression &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; worries me if only because of its possible wide interpretation. As well as notifying a solicitor the juvenile has the right to notify a parent or spouse, again as soon as practicable. Could this possibly be changed to read &ldquo;immediately&rdquo;?</P>
    <P>I am in full agreement with photographing and finger-printing any suspect of a serious criminal offence.  On strip-searching I should like to see a specific clause in the Bill relating to the conduct of strip-searching of female suspects.  I accept that in practice this has been done by ban gardaí, but many fears would be allayed if this code of practice was made law, and <i>vice versa</i> must also hold as well. Why strip-searching is confined to cases involving drugs or explosive substances is unclear.  Why not also stolen jewellery and money or contraband?  The reality is <Col N="1955" /> that the search can be done anyway on the pretext of looking for drugs or explosives.</P>
    <P>With the possibility of the strip-searching of a detained person under this Bill I feel that my argument that a record of the original &ldquo;reasonable grounds&rdquo; for detention must be made and the responsibility for it vested with the sergeant or the member in charge is even more fully substantiated.  The power to strip-search, unfortunately, is very necessary today, but it must never be possible for it to be done on the whim of an individual garda. The Bill also provides for the subsequent destruction of photographs, fingerprints, <i>et al</i>, if the person is not charged or is acquitted.  Those concerned are entitled to witness the destruction of, hopefully, all such records.</P>
    <P>Section 8 deals with prohibiting the rearrest of the detained person for the same offence, with two exceptions.  The first is for immediate charging or, on the authority of a district justice, where further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda after an oath has been taken and from a garda of at least superintendent rank.</P>
    <P>The promised provisions for tape-recording the questioning of persons in Garda custody are very welcome and will provide a good safeguard for both the detainee and the Garda.  Apparently implementing these provisions takes time, but I would be very happy to see them in effect as soon as possible.  Perhaps the system could be operable by the time the complaints tribunal is operable, and before the new Garda powers are brought into operation.</P>
    <P>It must be recognised by all of us that we must increase the powers of the Garda to improve their chances of success in dealing with serious crime.  If we want the Garda to deal with the very serious crime problem all around us, we have to let them get on with it and investigate serious crime properly, and not give to the force with one hand and take back with the other.  The period of questioning during the detention may well have the advantage also of allowing an innocent person <Col N="1956" /> to be cleared of charges without having to go through the courts.</P>
    <P>The general problem of offences committed while on bail has been causing disquiet for some time.  Apparently our written Constitution limits what changes can be made in the law in this regard, unlike the case in Britain.  Sections 9, 10 and 11 are very welcome and, in so far as they can, they tighten up this area.  Failure to surrender to bail is being made an offence with a consecutive sentence, as will any sentence imposed for an offence committed while on bail.  The possible aggregate of consecutive sentencing imposed by district courts is being doubled to two years.</P>
    <P>Certain aspects of the problem of crime have been singled out in the Bill, and rightly so, particularly the stealing of cars and penalties for serious firearm offences. It will now be an offence to fail or to refuse to disclose the source of firearms or ammunitions or any property believed to be stolen, but such information when disclosed will not be allowed as evidence against the person or his or her spouse.  I personally would have been happy to see some tightening up of the legislation in the area of pushing and peddling drugs.</P>
    <P>In sections 16 to 18 it would appear that the basic common sense of judges and jurors in drawing inferences is being put into print, particularly in relation to the accused person giving an explanation at his trial which could reasonably have been expected to have been mentioned previously, or by his failure or refusal to account for any object or mark, or for his presence in a place when a crime was being committed.  The accused must be told in layman's language what the effect of such failure might be and he cannot be convicted on such inferences alone.</P>
    <P>There is a good case for safeguarding the position of the uneducated and inarticulate in relation to this section of the Bill.  Fears have been expressed about this section by many previous speakers on both sides of the House.  Perhaps we should try to find whether there is any way in which safeguards could be put into this area to ensure that the uneducated and inarticulate are not put at a disadvantage <Col N="1957" /> as against the professional criminal who will have the back-up services to help him to drive a horse and cart through any legislation.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that a solicitor is present at all times during the detention so that the detainee will understand fully the implications of his action or inaction as the case may be.  There is no doubt that there is an erosion of the right to silence in these measures, but, with a solicitor present and tape-recording facilities, the innocent should have nothing to fear.  If a bloodstained shirt can be explained satisfactorily to the Garda &mdash; a genuine accident, perhaps, or going to the aid of a mugging victim &mdash; it is in the interests of the detainee to give an explanation. Remember, provision is being made for a court or jury to draw inferences in certain circumstances, but not for the Garda to draw inferences.</P>
    <P>Many changes in the area of trial procedure are being put forward, and not before time.  The accused will now be required to give notice of his intention to produce an alibi.  Surprises being sprung in this regard with no notice are out.</P>
    <P>Provision is also being made for proof by written statement and by formal admission by both parties to a criminal trial.  The unsworn statement is to be abolished.  The accused will have to be sworn in and cross-examined like the other witnesses.  The order of closing speeches is to be changed, with that for the defence coming after that for the prosecution.  Majority verdicts are being introduced, avoiding the need for retrial if not more than two jurors disagree.  This will also hinder intimidation, which undoubtedly exists at the moment.  Provision is being made for finger-printing people prosecuted for an indictable offence and dealt with under the Probation Act or convicted.  It has been said over the years that criminal trials have become an exercise in semantics with elaborate games being played with the rules of evidence, particularly the law on inadmissability of evidence.  This often resulted in the guilty failing to be convicted on technical grounds.  This problem should now be improved.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that it is time to <Col N="1958" /> redress the balance in favour of the victims of crime, and the Bill before us, given some tightening in the area of safeguards &mdash; particularly for the uneducated and inarticulate &mdash; which I feel the Minister will insert by amendment on Committee Stage, will provide answers to many of the problems in this area.  We have to trust in the integrity of our police force and ensure the community recognise that the situation is under control, for all our sakes.</P>
    <P>As we speak tonight I am very conscious of the brutal double murder of two helpless old age pensioners in Waterford. I will never apologise for increasing the risk of loss of liberty to the perpetrators of such crimes.  May they be quickly brought to justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>As we approach the witching hour of midnight I join with my colleagues in congratulating the Minister and the Government on having the courage to initiate this Bill.  The Minister has the support of all right-minded people and we wish the Bill a speedy journey through this House.  Although it had a rather long incubation period it has now seen the light of day and is to be welcomed. I am pleased to have this opportunity to speak on aspects of the Bill.</P>
      <P>That there is a need for such a Bill is a sad reflection on society, but it is an effort by the Minister to meet a very pressing need and I make no apologies to those who find that the civil rights of people, especially criminals, are being curtailed. In the recent crime report for 1982 published by the Garda we note with a certain amount of concern that indictable crimes increased by 9.2 per cent in 1982.  There was a welcome fall-off over the 1981 figures, but nevertheless an increase of those proportions is rather alarming, and I would hope that the measures proposed in the Bill would enable gardaí to apprehend many more criminals who otherwise would go free.  The Minister has struck the correct balance.  There are those who would say he has not gone far enough, while others would say he has gone too far.  Any law abiding citizen will have nothing to fear when the Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> I am glad on behalf of old people, those living alone and the infirm who are virtual prisoners in their houses once darkness falls &mdash; every footstep, every loud voice, every knock on the door conjures up visions of attack, assault and burglary &mdash; that this Bill will be some consolation to them.  At long last the Government have realised that there is a need to give them further protection.  People have a basic fundamental right to expect of any Government that they be protected, that they can walk the streets without being molested, that old women can do their shopping without the danger of their handbags being snatched, that they can enjoy the privacy of their homes at night without the fear of burglary or of being attacked, and that the motorist can drive along the streets of Dublin or any other city or town without the fear of a windscreen being broken, a handbag snatched or other damage being caused.</P>
    <P>Not too long ago, especially in rural Ireland, people never locked their doors even at night.  They could leave their cars unattended and unlocked with property on the seats and return in the knowledge that the property would not be interfered with.  It is a sad reflection when we see public property vandalised, and one would have to travel quite a distance in this city to find a telephone kiosk which had not been vandalised and was fully operative.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that the Bill was conceived, and I would hope that the Garda in using these extra powers would be successful in apprehending the perpetrators of crimes.  The problem was fully brought home to us recently when a national insurance company put a 60 per cent loading on policy holders in Dublin and other areas because the incidence of housebreaking was so severe. This is an indication of the type of crime with which this Bill is meant to deal.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately in the past the victim has had no rights while the defendant had all the rights.  If he was apprehended he wanted his solicitor or his doctor and a witness at his side, but he did not give the same facilities to his victims.  These victims were often left broken in mind, <Col N="1960" /> heart, health and spirit for the rest of their lives.  I remind those who feel that this Bill is going too far and that the civil liberties of people are being endangered to visit some of the victims of these crimes.  They might then have a different view.  While the views they now hold are sincere, they are misguided.  All Deputies have recieved submissions and I have been amazed at some strange bedfellows, people of very different backgrounds pleading and urging that we should reject this Bill.  Good legislation, coupled with a well-disciplined, well-trained and well-equipped Garda force, is the best deterrent to law breakers and potential law breakers.</P>
    <P>It is not the intention of the Minister or the Government to introduce any jackboot or Gestapo-type tactics.  This is an honest attempt to confront the increase in crime and to give gardaí, the protectors of law and order, a chance to apprehend those who would violate the civil law. There seems to be some apprehension among a lot of people about these extra powers.  Perhaps this is a throwback to our history, to a different era when the police force represented a foreign power, a foreign government.  I suppose there is a touch of that still in the minds of the Irish people.  In former times when you were &ldquo;agin&rdquo; the law you were deemed to be a patriot or something very near to it. I would like to remind the Members of this House who are apprehensive about this legislation that our gardaí are flesh of our flesh, our own kith and kin, our neighbours' children.</P>

      <P>Arising from the reply to Questions Nos. 3 to 15 today, Deputy Noel Treacy has been granted permission to raise on the Adjournment Question No. 3, Deputy Seán Byrne Question No. 8 and Deputy Kitt Question No. 13.  The Deputies will have 20 minutes between them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this question on the Adjournment. I propose to share my time with Deputies Byrne and Treacy.</P>
      <P>At Question Time today the Minister attempted to answer together 13 questions which related to the Farm Modernisation Scheme, the operation of the western package and the introduction of a pre-development scheme.  We on this side of the House were not satisfied that we got full information in reply to these questions.</P>
      <P>I asked specifically when the pre-development scheme for small farmers would be introduced and got no reply.  Deputy Connaughton has spoken about this on many occasions.  I can quote from <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> issue dated 4 November 1983:</P>
      <P>The Minister added that he would be introducing a pre-development scheme which would help small farmers to increase their viability substantially and also give them the opportunity of obtaining higher farming standards.</P>
      <P>I was trying to establish the type of pre-development scheme envisaged. Were we talking about a new scheme, or about changes to the western package which many would regard as a pre-development scheme if modifications and certain changes were made in it?  There is confusion on the subject.  The western package has contributed in many ways to the needs of farmers, but it is disappointing that very little money has been spent on the farm investment end.  For County Galway this year the allocation was only £1,100.  A lot of money has been spent on water supplies and the provision of electricity, for marketing and processing, for roads, for lands improvement, training facilities and shelter belts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that the part of the package allocated to roads be utilised. The allocation to each local authority under the local improvements scheme has been greatly reduced.  There is also the question of qualification for roads in Gaeltacht areas.  I am thinking particularly of Connemara, where the roads are in very bad condition.  There was <Col N="1962" /> recently a strong protest by the people from that area at the last meeting of the Galway County Council.</P>
    <P>When the farm modernisation scheme was suspended on 9 February, farmers expected that the grant would be restored quickly when the review was carried out. Many small farmers thought that in the absence of a farm modernisation scheme changes and improvements would be made to the western package.  Neither of these things happened.  I welcome the news from Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, that the farm modernisation scheme will be restored within the next few days.  However, I cannot accept that there should be a delay of ten months before the grant can be restored.  We were told that it would be restored in early autumn, then in late autumn and now, in December, we are without the farm modernisation scheme but with a promise of a new scheme in the next few days.</P>
    <P>The past ten months have been frustrating for Irish farmers as regards development. There was confusion concerning the introduction of the farm modernisation scheme, with the farmers in the west under the impression that there would be changes in the western package. We still do not know what type of scheme will be introduced, or the rate of grant. A very important question is the operative date for the new scheme.  For example, will farmers who applied before 9 February or those who had finished the work but had not received their final certificate from the farm development service now be considered for farm grants?  The Minister has told us that 14,644 farmers had applications in before 9 February last.  Because of the large numbers involved, I ask the Minister to make the operative date retrospective to 9 February.  I have always maintained that the farm modernisation scheme could be reviewed without suspending it and it is only fair that it would be dealt with in this way.  Farmers have lost confidence in the agricultural industry through the decision to save £10.3 million by the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme this year.</P>
    <P>Farmers should be given adequate time <Col N="1963" /> to complete the work involved, as many are experiencing financial problems.  The Minister cannot expect us on this side of the House to believe that the problems of the super-levy caused a delay of ten months in restoring these grants.  Neither can he say that the super-levy problems delayed improvements which his Department intend making in the western package, or the introduction of a pre-development scheme for small farmers.  There are three Ministers in the Department of Agriculture.  Surely one of them could have dealt with these development schemes?  I ask the Minister who is present tonight to tackle these problems for the sake of our farmers and the agricultural industry.  Could he give some of the answers for which we were looking today at Question Time?  Possibly because 13 questions were taken together we could not get the required information.  I ask him to bear in mind what we on this side of the House have said when any future schemes are being introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the few minutes available to me, I want to say a few words on the farm modernisation scheme which has been discontinued since 9 February. I am deeply disappointed at the failure of the Minister of Agriculture to make progress here in the last almost 11 months. Especially with the threat of the super-levy hanging over our little nation, we should not have a Government dithering on this issue.  As my colleague said a few minutes ago, we have enough civil servants and advisors in the Department of Agriculture for these schemes to have been ready months ago.  Last July they were promised for early October.  They will probably now be introduced when the Members are having a few days' holiday at Christmas, depriving them of an opportunity of debating it.  It is an insult to the farming community to treat this issue in that fashion and a complete con job by the Minister.  A number of questions were lumped together and we got a blanket reply, which was not a reply at all, to the effect that the new scheme would be introduced in a number of days. To suggest that the Department are not <Col N="1964" /> equipped to deal with this matter and that the super-levy interfered with the introduction of the new farm modernisation scheme, is a sad reflection on the officials of the Department.  It is only a lame excuse to delay the announcement of the scheme and deprive the Members of this House of an opportunity of debating it.</P>
      <P>What confidence can any farmer have in the ACOT advisers, the farm development service or the Minister for Agriculture and his Department officials in the future after the manner in which they have been treated by the Ministers for Finance and Agriculture in the last 11 months?  A great deal of damage has been done to the services given to farmers to develop their holdings.  I lay that blame squarely on the Minister's shoulders.  He failed miserably to deliver the goods on behalf of the people he is supposed to be representing at Cabinet level, which is a sad day for out little country.  What do the people in Brussels think of us when our Government are penalising the people?  This is really a super-levy.  The reply we were given today was full of ifs and buts.  We were told that if the 14,644 people who were deprived of their grants in February would fall in line with the type of work they should be doing they may get a grant.  This is disgraceful, and no section of society would accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have thought seriously before he introduced this scheme and done justice to the people who are trying to rear their families and earn an honest living on their holdings. We are losing out in a lot of money from Brussels also.  It is a shame that we have a Government with so little confidence in our basic industry when farmers had such a tough time during the last three years trying to survive.  The Government should have speeded up the introduction of the new scheme and should have brought it in early in October.  This would have shown the people in Brussels that the Government had confidence in the future of our farmers, especially our young farmers.  They would have been given hope for the future if this new scheme had been introduced then.  I again warn the Minister that any type of con <Col N="1965" /> job over the Christmas weeks will not cod our farmers.  I hope he will go back to his Cabinet members during the next few days and tell them that this will not be acceptable.  These people work hard and are very honest people.  They do not cry out for assistance unless they need it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for giving us the opportunity to say a few words about the farm modernisation scheme.  I also want to thank the Minister of State in the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, for coming in to make a contribution.  I am very disappointed that the Minister for Agriculture did not see fit to come in at this stage to make his contribution, because we have already had both Ministers of State at Question Time yesterday afternoon.  We are raising this matter on the Adjournment because of our confusion and because of the farmers' anger and frustration at the attitude of the Government towards the farm modernisation scheme and towards agriculture in general.  Only 25 per cent of our farmers are up to full development. The primary purpose of the farm modernisation scheme is to ensure that there is equal opportunity within all the member states for all farmers to develop and expand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the last ten years our farmers and our economy have benefited to the tune of £234 million from EEC funds through the farm modernisation scheme.  This is an average annual grant aid of £23.4 million. On a pound for pound basis we have benefited to the tune of £10 to £12 million per annum, so it is simple logic to state that we have lost in the region of £10 to £12 million of EEC aid for agriculture this year.  The Minister of State said today that the Government saved £10.3 million through the suspension of the scheme.  Therefore it is reasonable to state that agriculture has lost in the region of £20 million in 1983.  Through the failure of the Government to continue the scheme we have lost £10 million from Europe and we have lost a further £10 million of Government investment through the suspension of the scheme.  If that is the attitude of the Government, the Minister for Agriculture and the Ministers <Col N="1966" /> of State charged with the responsibility to lead, develop and programme our primary industry, what hope is there for the future of the country?  Surely it is an indictment of the Government and shows their attitude to our principal industry.  At a time when over 200,000 people are out of work an investment of £20 million would do a lot to help to expand and develop our agricultural industry and our economy.  It would help to cushion many companies who find themselves operating in a very tight fiscal situation if extra money was available for agriculture, because our farmers are our biggest spenders.  They are constantly investing the money they get in their own industry and in ancillary agri-industries. They help every sector of our economy through spending the grants and the moneys which are at their disposal.</P>
    <P>It is reasonable to conclude that the fact that the Government failed to invest £20 million in our primary industry in 1983 has had a major effect on our overall economic situation.  At a time when we are threatened with this terrible super-levy by the EEC surely our whole credibility in Europe has been weakened and our negotiating strategy has been completely weakened by suspending the farm modernisation scheme at a loss of £10 million to our economy from European aid in 1983?  Now at the end of the year we are negotiating in relation to a super-levy which we cannot accept. Surely it is very hard for us as an agricultural nation to be reconciled with what our skilled counterparts have?  We are the only member state in the history of the EEC who have suspended the farm modernisation scheme.  This has done irreparable damage to Irish agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Dáil is the only democratic institution in the State, where the true facts should be known at all times.  It is very unfair to have a situation where, repeatedly during 1983, the Minister for Agriculture and the Ministers of State in that Department have come in to the House and taken groups of questions together and have failed to give us proper detailed information.  I want to object strenuously to the fact that the first question on the Order Paper yesterday to the Minister <Col N="1967" /> for Agriculture for a number of months, which I had tabled, was not answered fully.  We were told by the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, that the announcement of the return of the farm modernisation scheme will be made in a few days.  Surely this was an opportunity for him to give the knowledge to this House because this House should know first what is happening, and to allay the fears of our farmers about this scheme?</P>
    <P>In my constituency we have the proposed closure of the Tuam sugar factory. We were told today that a Government decision would be made shortly, but last Saturday night, the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, was able to tell his friends at a local ball in east Galway that there was no need to worry, everything was in order and the factory would not be closed.  Surely this is not the way to treat the Members of the House and our primary industry.  I appeal now, as we go into 1984, for a fresh, clear, positive approach to agriculture and to the operations of this House <i>vis-à-vis</i> agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have sympathy with the Deputy that taking too many questions together may not be such a good idea and it might be easier on the people asking the questions if they were taken individually.  As was stated yesterday afternoon in reply to a parliamentary question, an announcement about the reintroduction of the farm modernisation scheme will be made within the next few days.  I cannot, pending this announcement, give the details of the revised scheme.  I can say that it will emphasise the most essential forms of farm investment, in particular basic livestock housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards applicants who are caught by the suspension of grant aid for building and fixed assets earlier this year the position is that the intention behind the suspension was to save money.  I estimate that saving in 1983 amounted to £10.3 million.  The cut-off applied to applications on hand on 9 February which had not been processed to the approval stage and, of course, to any applications for <Col N="1968" /> buildings and fixed assets received after 9 February.  Any applications which have been approved not later than 9 February were not affected by the suspension.  Any applicants caught by the suspension are free to re-apply when the revised scheme is reintroduced and their applications will be dealt with, provided the works proposed are eligible for grant aid under the terms of the revised scheme.  Of course, the normal practice of the farm development service is to insist that written approval must issue before work commences.</P>
    <P>In 1981 the western package commenced but the part dealing with farm planning and development did not get going until late 1982.  Under this, small farmers who cannot make development category can get the same rate of grants for farm buildings and fixed assets as development farmers were getting in the west prior to the cut in grants for farm buildings and other special aids under the farm modernisation scheme last February. Their farm plans had to concentrate on cattle and sheep, and plan targets were not as onerous as for development farmers under the FMS.  These grants for western farmers under the western package were not cut last February.</P>
    <P>The recent EEC proposals on farm structures which are being discussed in a working party envisage aid being available to all full-time farmers below the comparable income who can make profitable investments.  If these proposals are adopted any full-time farmer will be eligible for the highest grant rate and will not have to reach specific planned targets. This will go quite a bit of the way to meet the wishes of those seeking a pre-development scheme for small farmers. When the proposals are adopted we will incorporate them in a further revised farm modernisation scheme.</P>
    <P>We have not, in fact, lost any EEC aid for the FMS in 1983, because any refunds we get do not come until the year following the expenditure by the National Government.  For instance, our refund from the EEC is about 16 per cent of our expenditure and is received a year in arrears.  As I have said, the reason for the suspension was in part financial, and this <Col N="1969" /> was stated by the Minister for Agriculture earlier this year.  The problems related to finance arose before the Government took office and there is little use at this stage in complaining about the situation.</P>
    <P>The western package, which was negotiated by a previous Government as Deputy Kitt knows, is not ideal for our conditions in that it does not allow for any worthwhile expansion in milk production. The package is being reviewed and the Government will seek to improve the conditions so that it will be more suited to the needs of western farmers. However, Deputy Kitt must be aware of the problems about increased milk production and that this will be a difficult nut to crack.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies are courteous enough to stay here so late, I would like to inform them that I will be writing to them all individually because at Question Time today I may have given an incorrect impression with regard to the rescue package and the reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty. I would like to clarify the position, and I am availing of this opportunity to say that <Col N="1970" /> of the 9,300 applicants some 4,400 have so far received interest relief amounting to about £9 million.  In regard to the balance of the applications, some were deemed ineligible while some others consisted of duplicate applications; in other words they owed money to both the banks and the ACC.  A decision on some of these has still to be decided.  This leaves about 2,500 cases where farm plans are awaited or where agreement has not yet been reached by the lending agency and the applicant on the plan provided.  In other words, 2,500 are still in the melting pot.</P>
    <P>In regard to the closing date for receipt of completed application forms by the lending institutions, this was extended to 30 June for applicants who had made an approach to the lending agency prior to the closing date for the scheme and had been turned down in error.  I hope that clarifies any impressions.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 12.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 14 December 1983 until 10.30 a.m.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 384 to 388, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>In relation to a contract concluded for fencing off of potentially hazardous areas at Avoca Mines, the position is that the receiver recently awarded the contract to a local concern, following consideration of seven tenders submitted.  The fencing work, which will commence shortly, will be carried out in accordance with standards recommended by the Industrial Inspectorate (Mines and Quarries), Department of Labour.  Periodic monitoring of all abandoned mine sites is carried out by the Inspectorate and, should any deterioration in the condition of the fencing occur in the course of time, arrangements can be made to have it restored to the required standard.</P>
      <P>The work of filling and sealing certain shafts and other openings, identified as requiring such attention by the inspectorate &mdash; who carried out a detailed inspection of the area &mdash; is currently in progress in accordance with the specifications of the Inspectorate.</P>
      <P>The general restoration of the mine area, apart from fencing and sealing of hazardous openings, is being considered by the receiver in co-operation with Wicklow County Council and my Department. Due regard will be had to the relevant stipulations in the planning permissions given to Avoca Mines Limited. Particular attention is being given by the receiver to the tailings pond area and I understand that he hopes to be in a position within the next few months to settle the nature and extent of measures necessary to deal with this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied as to the adequacy of the <Col N="1676" /> measures being taken to put the mine in order and to guard against any hazard to health or safety.</P>

      <P>As stated in reply to questions by the Deputy on 8 December 1981, and 22 March 1983 the person referred to was awarded a disability pension under the Army Pension Acts in respect of the injury he sustained. He, subsequently, received a lump sum payment for the same injury, in settlement of a civil claim.  The Army Pensions Acts provide that where compensation is received after the award of any such pension, the award may be reviewed and, having regard to the amount of such compensation, the pension may be either terminated or reduced.  As the annual value of the compensation in this case, assessed on an actuarial basis, exceeded the appropriate rate of pension under the Army Pensions Acts, payment of pension has been withheld. The question of resumption of payment will be considered if and when the annual rate of pension, appropriate to the degree of disablement, exceeds the annual value of the compensation awarded.</P>

      <P>The excise duty on motor vehicle tyres is chargeable on home manufactured tyres at the rate of 5 per cent of the retail price and on imported tyres at the rate of 10 per cent of the value for customs purposes.  These rates are designed to meet our obligations under EEC rules to ensure that the same burden of excise duty is borne by tyres irrespective of whether they are home-produced or imported from other member states.</P>
      <P>Whilst the duty payable on any particular type of tyre depends on the relative retail and import prices, respectively, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that, in general, our practice is non-discriminatory as between imported tyres and home-manufactured tyres.</P>
      <P>The feasibility of a restructuring of the duty is under examination at present in response to representations by the EEC Commission, which is concerned that imported tyres should enjoy no less favourable tax treatment than that enjoyed by tyres produced within the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health how he proposes to assess farmers for health charges in 1983-84; if the Revenue Commissioners assessment for income tax will be the gross wage on which health charges are based; if there is a variation in the actual income assessed by the Revenue Commissioners and actual income earned for tax purposes as audited by an accountant; and if the health charges will be adjusted accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the question refers to the collection of health contributions from farmers. Under the revised method of assessment applying in 1983-84 farmers' incomes will be assessed on the basis of profits or gains from farming activities less expenses, such as rent, wages paid out, purchases of seed, fertilizers etc., incurred in earning these profits and less any superannuation contributions that may have been paid.</P>
      <P>Unlike the procedures which apply to payment of income tax, deductions for capital expenditure are not allowable in determining reckonable income for health contributions purposes.  This applies not only to the self-employed, including farmers, but also to employees in the PAYE sector who, equally, are not entitled to any allowances for capital expenditure when liability for health contributions is being assessed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made inquiries with the hospital authorities concerned.  The situation to which the Deputy is referring arose from difficulties experienced by the radiology department at Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, in coping with the demand for X-Rays.  As the area in which the child resides is outside the catchment area of <Col N="1702" /> Harcourt Street Hospital, the authorities there felt that the child would be more appropriately dealt with at Crumlin.  Following discussions between Crumlin hospital authorities and my Department, the difficulties have now been resolved.  I understand that the child in question was X-rayed at Crumlin hospital on 7 December 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of cases of infectious hepatitis reported in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1982; the studies that have taken place; and the steps that have been taken to reduce the incidence of this disease.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of cases of infectious hepatitis notified to the Department of Health under the infectious diseases regulations, was as follows: 1978, 524; 1979, 419; 1980, 512; 1981, 840; 1982, 1276.</P>
      <P>There are two major forms of the disease &mdash; hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Hepatitis A is usually associated with poor hygienic practice and may be spread from person to person or by infected food or water.  Hepatitis B is caused by infected needles or syringes and is usually contracted by drug abusers.</P>
      <P>A number of studies have been conducted regarding infectious hepatitis, the most recent of which relate to hepatitis B in drug abusers.  These studies show that there is a high incidence of hepatitis B amongst drug abusers and that there is a transmission of the disease from drug abusers to their contacts (mainly sexual) and indirectly to others.</P>
      <P>The Government are currently tackling the problem of drug abuse and, indirectly, the spread of hepatitis B, by implementing the measures recommended by the Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse.  A feature of this is the provision of beds for drug induced hepatitis at Cherry Orchard Hospital to ensure that such cases are effectively treated.  In addition, a vaccine is available for persons who are at high risk of contracting hepatitis B because of their occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1703" /> The health boards, as part of their functions relevant to the control of infectious diseases, routinely implement measures under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, and the Food Hygiene Regulations, 1950, to prevent and control the spread of hepatitis A.  The directors of community care and medical officers of health were asked in March 1982 to take particular steps with regard to hepatitis A in their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Midland Health Board area has a full in-patient service at consultant level in the specialities of general medicine, general surgery and obstetrics.  The other specialties which might be provided on a local basis are paediatrics, orthopaedics, ENT and ophthalmology.  At present these services are provided on an out-patient basis by consultants attached in the main to Dublin hospitals and I am aware that the level of service is less than adequate in some respects.  In view of the difficult budgetary situation and the continuing restriction on the creation of additional posts in the public sector I am not in a position to say when a full range of consultant in-patient services will be provided in these specialties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present the health board have a proposal in my Department for the establishment of a locally based paediatric service and I have recently indicated my agreement to the board's request for the provision of an elective orthopaedic unit in Athlone.  The pace with which these services can be provided will of course be determined by budgetary considerations which I have mentioned above.  The health board are currently making arrangements with the Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital in Dublin for the provision of ENT and ophthalmic services for the Midland Health Board <Col N="1727" /> area.  I have approved these arrangements in principle and I am satisfied that they will lead to a much improved level of service for the area.</P>

      <P>All the public psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units in general hospitals provide, <i>inter alia</i>, specialist services for the treatment of alcoholism.  There are 22 public psychiatric hospitals and 10 units in general hospitals as well as four private psychiatric hospitals which provide treatment services for alcoholism.  In addition there are five units run by voluntary organisations.</P>
      <P>Apart from psychiatric facilities in general hospitals which are included in the general hospital development programme, there are no proposals before my Department for the development of further specialist in-patient units to deal specifically with alcoholism.  In general, I would feel that this country has adequate bed provision in this area and I would see the future development of specialist treatment services for alcoholism taking place mainly in the area of additional community-based services including counselling and out-patient services.</P>

      <P>An extensive range of in-patient and out-patient treatment facilities is available through the psychiatric services for persons suffering from alcoholism. Increasingly, services are being provided on an out-patient basis within the community, thus reducing the demand and need for in-patient services.  It would be my intention that the treatment services, which would involve preventive strategies, should continue to develop along these lines.</P>
      <P>In addition, the Health Education Bureau has recently launched a special alcohol education programme for second level schools.  The aim of the programme is to develop a responsible attitude in young people to the use of alcohol.  The bureau have also devised an integrated programme of health education materials for use in second level schools.  Substance abuse, which includes alcohol, is one of the subjects in this programme.</P>

His claim was subsequently disallowed from 17 October 1983 on the basis that he was not available for employment.  He appealed against the decision but the decision was upheld by an appeals officer after an oral hearing of the case which took place on 6 December 1983.  He was notified of the appeals officer's decision on 7 December 1983.  He is continuing to sign as unemployed and inquiries are being made to ascertain his availability for work from 7 December 1983.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit from that date will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of these inquiries.</P>

      <P>The person concerned submitted a first medical certificate dated 8 September 1983.  Disability benefit was allowed at the personal rate from 13 September 1983, the fourth day of incapacity. It was indicated in a completed claim form for disability benefit dated 23 September 1983 that the incapacity concerned resulted from an occupational accident on 15 September 1981.  Injury benefit is confined to a maximum period of 26 weeks from the date of the occupational accident.  The injury benefit claim was in respect of a period outside the injury benefit period and was disallowed accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The disability benefit claim linked with unemployment assistance with the result that disability benefit including an increase in respect of his wife was allowed from 9 September 1983, the first day of incapacity.  Unemployment assistance paid to 13 September together with a balance of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the Eastern Health Board to 10 December have been withheld from arrears of disability benefit in respect of the period to 5 December, date <Col N="1740" /> of the last medical certificate received. Payment of the balance of £143.33 has been made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative requirement to take account of the value of board and lodging has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants whose parents are in good circumstances and those whose parents are in poor circumstances. Otherwise all such applicants would become entitled to the same level of assistance, regardless of their circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1747" /> The value of board and lodgings is assessed by reference to the net parental income after deducting allowances in respect of the parents.  The value of board and lodgings depends therefore on the amount of income involved.  The method of assessment is outlined more fully in the summary of the criteria for assessment of means for unemployment assistance purposes which was circulated to Deputies recently.  It is open to any person who considers that the amount of means assessed against him is excessive to appeal and to have his means determined by an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit from 21 October 1982 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an accident at work on 15 July 1981.  Injury benefit had previously <Col N="1748" /> been awarded in respect of three periods between 29 July 1981 and 20 February 1982 for the same accident.  However, injury benefit is confined to a maximum of 26 weeks from the date of the occupational accident and as the latest claim was outside the maximum injury benefit period it was, accordingly, disallowed.</P>
      <P>The claim was treated as a claim to disability benefit which was allowed from 25 October 1982, the fourth day of incapacity. Pay-related benefit was also allowed from 4 November 1982, the thirteenth day of incapacity.</P>
      <P>A delay in some recent payments resulted from inquiries which had to be made to the Department of Health and Social Security in the United Kingdom regarding employment contributions required to satisfy the qualifying conditions for receiving disability benefit for a period exceeding 12 months.  Payment of benefit was resumed on receipt of the required information.  Supplementary welfare allowance paid by the Western Health Board during the period of delay was withheld and refunded to the board.

When these inquiries are completed his means will be assessed and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined accordingly.

      <P>One of the conditions for payment of an orphan's pension is that the child in respect of whom the pension is <Col N="1752" /> claimed must be an &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; as defined in the Social Welfare Acts.  In the Acts an &ldquo;orphan&rdquo; means:</P>
      <P>(a)  a qualified child, being a legitimate child, both of whose parents are dead and who, where he has a step-parent, does not normally reside with the step-parent or a person married to and living with the step-parent, or</P>
      <P>(b)  a qualified child, being an illegitimate child, whose mother is dead and whose father is dead or unknown and who, if there is a surviving husband of his mother, does not normally reside with that husband or a woman married to and living with that husband, or</P>
      <P>(c)  a qualified child one of whose parents is dead and whose surviving parent has abandoned him or refused or failed to provide for him.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires the person concerned to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953-54 contribution year to 5 April 1983, i.e. the end of the last complete contribution year before she reached age 65.  She does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that she had a total of 73 such contributions in this period, which is equal to a yearly average of only two. Neither will she qualify for old age contributory pension at age 66 for which she would need a yearly average of at least 20 from 6 July 1953 to 5 April 1984. Contributions paid in respect of employment which was insurable under the former National Health Insurance Acts prior to 1953 are not reckonable for the purpose of calculating a person's yearly average for retirement pension or old age contributory pension.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The detailed deployment of Garda manpower is a matter for the Garda authorities and the precise arrangements for the policing of particular areas are made by or in consultation with the local Garda officers.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the current Garda strength at Oldcastle station is one sergeant and two gardaí and that a vacancy for a garda which arose on 3 November will be filled in the near future.</P>
      <P>The authorities report that it would not be feasible at present to provide a 24-hour service from Oldcastle station having regard to the strength of the station party.  The service provided by the Garda at Oldcastle is supplemented by a 24-hour service and mobile patrols from the district headquarters at Ceanannus Mór and the authorities consider that these arrangements are adequate to meet the present police needs of the Oldcastle area.</P>
