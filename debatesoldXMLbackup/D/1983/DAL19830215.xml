      <P>Since its introduction in 1978, pre-movement testing of cattle for bovine TB and brucellosis has disclosed some 10,000 reactors which would otherwise have moved into clear herds.  It has also enabled infection in the herds of origin to be detected and tackled much earlier than would have been possible under the annual rounds of testing.  I do not envisage the abandonment of this useful weapon in the fight to eradicate disease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the quantities of weedkiller containing the chemical 2, 4, 5-T which were used by his Department; and if, in view of the established danger to health from this substance, he will consider prohibiting its use by his Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>No weedkiller containing the chemical 2, 4, 5-T is used by my Department.  The World Health Organisation and the Food and Agriculture Organisation have stated that there is no danger to human health or the environment from this chemical provided that the dioxin content does not exceed a specified level.  This position was endorsed by the Commission of the European Communities on the basis of an opinion of its Scientific Committee for Pesticides.  Any 2, 4, 5-T on sale in Ireland contains less than the recommended maximum level of dioxin.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that ten countries, including the United States of America, have banned all formulations of 2, 4, 5-T and that the EEC <Col N="4" /> have recommended that it should not be used by householders in gardens and so on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that a number of countries have banned the use of 2, 4, 5-T but I am also aware that a number of countries, including us, use it.  In June 1982 the European Commission considered this matter and did not recommend the banning of the use of 2, 4, 5-T.  However, they did recommend a maximum level and the product used here contains an element of dioxin which is less than the level recommended.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 4 to 7, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am indeed aware of and concerned about the damage, suffering and death being caused to sheep by marauding dogs in many parts of the country and the losses which these attacks entail for farmers. My Department have recently conducted an extensive publicity campaign on radio and television to bring home to dog owners the necessity for keeping their dogs under proper control at all times and their legal obligation for doing so.</P>
      <P>Existing legislation, which concerns a number of Departments, provides comprehensive powers and measures for the control of dogs.  My Department are primarily concerned with the protection of sheep and other farm animals from dog attacks and in this connection the Department have been examining the question of strengthening the implementation of existing measures and the possible introduction of additional measures.  In this examination the suggestions by the National Action Committee for Dog Control are being given full consideration and, in this regard, a preliminary discussion with the committee has already taken place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any indication of when he hopes to take some action in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not give a definite indication at this stage but the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, had a meeting with the committee referred to in the reply last week and I hope that as a result we will have some definite steps taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a considerable amount of work has been done in his Department on the preparation of the appropriate memorandum for the Government?  Is the Minister also aware that legislation could be drafted fairly quickly in this matter?  I would ask the Minister to take the urgency of this matter into consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have just stated, we have tackled this matter with some urgency and we will be taking action as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the local authorities take the view that existing legislation is inadequate to enable them to control marauding dogs? Will the Minister be considering the provision of dog wardens in suitable areas with full powers to take marauding dogs under control and have them brought to a pound?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the matters which will be considered.  Many of the problems in this field concern the division of responsiblity.  There are four Departments involved &mdash; the Department of the Environment, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Justice and the Department of Finance.  Until such time as we can get a clear-cut division of responsibility, or a definite allocation of responsibility to one specific Department, we will have problems.  However, I hope to be able to introduce measures under the control of one specific Department which would enable the employment of dog wardens.  At present there are very substantial grants for the setting up of dog shelter homes which are administered by the Department of the Environment. <Col N="7" /> The Deputy may rest assured that my Department will assist in every manner possible to see that there is a concerted effort to control stray dogs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give an approximate indication as to when these measures might possibly be taken?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to be specific on that point; it will be as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the urgency of the matter from the point of view of the protection of sheep flocks, will the Minister not agree that the Department to deal with the matter should be the Department of Agriculture?  We should cut out this nonsense of different Departments having different responsibilities in the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  That is why my Department on 8 February had a meeting with the National Action Committee for Dog Control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>My question is not motivated by a recent personal loss caused by dogs in my area but the Minister should consider some form of compensation to flock owners for the serious losses incurred by marauding dogs.  As the Minister is well aware &mdash; and I have personal experience in this regard &mdash; the Garda find it extremely difficult to get the dogs involved in these instances and to issue prosecutions.  My own failure to shoot a few dogs resulted in a loss to myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Deputy should have a chat with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, and try to get some portion of the increased dog licence fee announced in the budget.  Certainly compensation is a matter that should be considered.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>While acquisition policy in all counties, including Galway, is directed primarily towards improving land structure, the Land Commission are at present concentrating their attention on dividing the large area of land already on hands and on the early completion of existing acquisition proceedings. In these circumstances and in view of the serious Exchequer situation, the initiation of proceedings for the acquisition of further properties is necessarily curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Land Commission be stepping up the acquisition of land? The land pool in many parts of the country, including Galway, is falling and many farmers are anxious that the Land Commission proceed to acquire more land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has said the land pool is diminishing and there are several reasons for that.  It is a heavy drain on the Exchequer.  The cost of land in the past few years has been a deterrent not alone to the Exchequer but also to the people getting land because in some cases they are not able to pay for it.  As has been the policy in the past few years, it is not envisaged in the immediate future that very much more land will be acquired.</P>

      <P>The annuities paid to farmers who retire under the existing farmer retirement scheme, which is operated under EEC Directive 160/72, have for some years past been revised annually to take account of changes in the consumer price index.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that there are many farms of which the Land Commission took possession more than ten years ago and which have not been allocated?  The EEC farmer retirement scheme was introduced on 1 May 1974 by the present Ceann Comhairle, when he was Minister for Lands. On the day he introduced the scheme I <Col N="11" /> rang the Department of Lands and asked them to send me a number of application forms.  Two of the applications were subsequently approved but that land has not been allocated.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the Deputy's concern about the length of time it takes land to be divided.  Since I became Minister of State I have taken steps to ensure that any additional land is divided among congests very speedily and this will become obvious in the next year.  I agree with the Deputy that in normal circumstances the Land Commission should not have land on hands for ten years, which I appreciate has happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should be interested to know the view of the EEC with regard to the Department.  One of the holdings I mentioned was land owned by a very efficient farmer but now the land has been completely run down.  As a matter of urgency the Land Commission must take some measures to allocate the land. Alternatively, they should introduce some leasing system between the acquisition and allocation of land so that it may be put to good use.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will consider all those matters.  Some of the points raised by the Deputy will be considered very seriously.  I hope when the review is completed that very little land will be left on hands.  I agree throughly that we should not have land on hands because from the point of view of fertility it is a case of diminishing returns after nine or ten years.</P>

I hope for the sake of the farmers of the small congested farms in this part of County Leitrim and Sligo that the land will be divided among them and that proceedings will go ahead on that as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is prepared to have the same headage grants etc. paid in less severely handicapped areas as those paid in severely handicapped areas in accordance with EEC Directives and Regulations; and if he will make a statement setting out clearly the reasons these grants differ.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirement that the level of headage payments rates should reflect the degree of permanent natural handicap affecting farming activities in disadvantaged areas is set out in Article 7 of EEC Directive 75/268 which also states in its preamble that &ldquo;it should be left to the member states to fix the amount of such allowances according to the severity of the handicaps involved within the limits and conditions fixed for the different types of areas, both as to the amounts which may be paid and the types of production which may be covered&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, the approach adopted by successive administrations since 1975 and approved by the EEC has been to limit the types of livestock eligible in areas of less severe handicap rather than reduce the headage rates payable.  For this reason cattle headage grants are confined to beef cow herds in the less severely handicapped areas whereas all herds are <Col N="15" /> eligible in the more severely handicapped areas.  In the case of sheep, headage payments are confined to hogget ewes in lowland areas whereas breeding ewes and hogget ewes are eligible in mountain areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he proposes to withdraw the restrictions introduced in June 1982 in regard to supplementary investment being added to a farm development plan during the currency of the plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The restriction on aid for new supplementary investment was introduced because of a ruling by the EEC Commission against the practice previously followed here.  To withdraw the restriction would jeopardise EEC recoupment of part of the cost of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a waste of time probably to ask supplementaries on the disallowance of additions to their plan when the complete plan has been suspended. I ask the Minister to have another look at this measure which was introduced in the budget regarding the suspension of the Farm Modernisation Scheme.  This will have a very serious effect.  It will curb completely the development of many young farmers.  In that area a multi-million pound industry has mushroomed over the last couple of years.  They have plans for extension of their compost and processing plant development, but they anticipated that the growers would be getting grant aid for their housing.  If they do not get that aid it will be practically impossible for them to continue.  I ask that in instances like that allowances be made in this farm development scheme.</P>

I believe the people who organised this scheme in their wildest dreams did not think that such a large area of land would be drained.  That causes its own trouble.

      <P>A substantial volume of socio-economic data in respect of over 60 separate areas throughout the country was collected by field staff of my Department in the course of last year. One of the areas involved is the Slieve Felim area, the bulk of which is already designated as disadvantaged.  An analysis of the data is at present being carried out in the Department, but in view of the very considerable amount of details involved, it is unlikely to be completed before the autumn.  The analysis is a prelude to consideration by the Government and later by the Commission of the case for further adjustments to the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In considering any extension of the existing disadvantaged areas it will, of course, be necessary to bear in mind the position in regard to the availability of Exchequer resources for the purpose.</P>

      <P>It is likely to be later in 1983 when the actual submission will go to Brussels.  With regard to the areas which will be included, there are very strict criteria laid down by Brussels so far as areas to be included in the severely handicapped areas are concerned. Once the Department have forwarded the applications to Brussels we will then see what is likely to happen.  It appears from the workload involved at the moment that it will be later in 1983.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider putting in a formal application because in many cases there is considerable doubt about this?  Northern Ireland are supposed to have sent in a formal application for aid and many organisations are very concerned that such a long time has elapsed and there is still no formal application.  The Government now appear to be waiting until the survey is carried out before the application is sent.  Could the Government not expedite this survey?  The Minister of State is from one of the 12 western counties so I ask him to ensure that the Government realise that very few of those 12 western counties can remain outside the severely handicapped area.  I hope the Minister of State will use his influence to have all those 12 counties included.</P>

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 27 and 28 together.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that the incidence of crime in the Tallaght area and the problem involving the driving of stolen cars at high speed through the various housing estates are of particular concern and a number of measures have been taken to deal with the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four additional gardaí were assigned to Tallaght station on 11 February, bringing to 24 the total number of extra gardaí allocated there since mid-September, 1982.  The assignment of these gardaí to a revised rostering system is making the maximum number of personnel available for duty at the times when the demand for Garda services is greatest.  Apart from foot and mobile patrols by the local gardaí, the Tallaght area is receiving regular attention from special patrols operated <Col N="26" /> by the Crime Task Force based at Dublin Castle.</P>
    <P>The effectiveness of the measures taken to combat crime in the Tallaght area will be kept under review by the Garda authorities and the manpower needs of the area will be further considered according as additional gardaí complete their training in the coming months. I understand that there are no proposals at present to allocate additional official transport to Tallaght station but this matter will also be kept under review by the Garda authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that despite the measures that have been taken, involving an additional small number of gardaí, the incidence of the matters complained of in the question is increasing?

        <i>(Limerick-East):</i> The deployment of gardaí is a matter for the Garda authorities.  Obviously, not all the gardaí stationed at Tallaght would be on the beat at the same time since a support service must be provided at the station. Because there is a high incidence of recruits in the Tallaght area the new rostering system applies there so that the number on the beat in Tallaght would be proportionately higher than in areas where there would be more senior gardaí to whom the new rostering system would not apply automatically.</P>

This represents a net increase of 29 on the number serving there on 31 December 1981 or an increase in strength of 112 per cent since 31 December 1979.  On the point of Garda vehicles, my information is that in the opinion of the local gardaí they have sufficient vehicles to deal with the situation but the Garda authorities are reviewing the manpower needs of the situation and that will be kept under constant review.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is difficult to defend the distinction.  Perhaps it is on the basis only of expediency and not on the basis of principle.  However, there is a difficulty.  A virtue of the distinction is that it prevents men from contracting marriages of convenience for the purpose of useful citizenship and consequent access to the labour markets of Britain, Ireland and other EEC countries. British and Dutch officials have cited to us frequent cases of third-country nationals contracting such marriages which are followed by quick divorce and are for the purpose of the people concerned coming into the EEC countries as foreign spouses who are entitled to work. At the time the provision was made the likelihood of a man using that device was much greater than in the case of a woman but I would agree with the general drift of the Deputy's supplementary.  All I can say is that I will consider the matter at an early date.  In the meantime the position remains as set out in the reply to a parliamen-Deputy Mitchell as Minister on 17 December 1981 in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy Fennell and also as set out by Deputy Doherty as Minister on 15 July 1982 by way of reply to Deputy O'Keeffe.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> There has been a quick turnover of Ministers for Justice in recent times.  When the provisions were introduced, they were introduced more by way of a privilege to women than by way of discrimination against men.  It appears now internationally that there is more uniformity as between men and women in regard to the acquisition of citizenship but there is also the trend of the elimination of the right of the alien spouse to acquire automatically the citizenship of the other spouse.  Therefore, early consideration in the light of similar experiences abroad might not necessarily move the situation in the direction in which the Deputy would wish it to move.</P>

      <P>The question arises from a problem in relation to the courthouse in Galway city.  The Department of Justice asked Galway County Council to vacate that courthouse in which are located the county library headquarters. The county council were prepared to comply with the request at an additional cost to them of £35,000 per year for new headquarters but they requested the Department to make some contribution towards the upkeep of the courthouse.  Is the Minister aware that the situation in Galway courthouse is that people, especially in relation to the ever-increasing number of family law cases, must consult with their lawyers in the corridors?  Is the Minister also aware that almost £2 million in fines was collected by that court this year but that because of the outdated Act the Department are refusing to make any contribution towards the upkeep of the building or of many other courthouses throughout the country?  I am asking the Minister to consider this very serious problem.  It is ludicrous to expect local authorities to contribute towards the upkeep of courthouses which are earning quite an amount of income especially in the case I am talking of where there is such a problem in regard to accommodation.</P>

At the moment this is in dispute with the court clerks and my Department, and I am not prepared to comment on it.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>In so far as both questions concern civil liability for damage caused by animals, the position is that the Report of the Law Reform Commission in this area is under consideration in my Department and I am giving the matter as much priority as is possible though I am not in a position at the moment to say when I may be able to seek Government decisions on the various issues that arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to prosecutions in respect of animals found wandering on the public <Col N="33" /> roads, these prosecutions are brought by the Garda under the 1961 Road Traffic Act.  Any amendment of that Act is a matter for the Minister for the Environment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 40 and 41 together.</P>
      <P>A copy of the memorandum prepared by the National Action Committee for Dog Control has been received in my Department.  In relation to the proposal for the establishment of a national dog warden service, I should say that this is not a matter primarily for my Department and I do not consider that the control of stray dogs is a matter for the Garda Síochána.  Accordingly, I have no proposals for legislation relating to these matters.</P>
      <P>As a related issue may I say that the Law Reform Commission have prepared a report and draft Bill on the subject of civil liability for damage caused by animals. The main proposal in the report is that the keeper of any animal which causes injury should be strictly liable therefor.</P>
      <P>This report is under examination in my Department but I am not in a position at present to say when I am likely to be in a position to seek Government decisions on the various issues that arise.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 42 and 43 together.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance, in the documentation circulated in conjunction with his financial statement on the budget delivered to the House on 9 February 1983, indicated that an amount of £30,000 is being reserved for the Coolock Community Law Centre in 1983 in the Vote for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>As regards Deputy De Rossa's question concerning future funding, he will appreciate that it would be neither possible nor appropriate for me to give any undertaking about future funding for the centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The unfortunate position of the Coolock Community Law Centre is that they have been passed from the Department of Justice to the Department of Social Welfare to the Department of Health and they do not know from one year to the next whether they will have money the following year, or even the following month.  Would the Minister say if he regards his Department as having any responsibility in the area of providing finance for that centre which deals almost exclusively with questions of providing free legal advice and assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy is aware, the Free Legal Aid Board operate under the auspices of my Department and over the past number of years it was anomalous that separate provision was being made for a voluntary group outside the auspices of that board. I am aware that the Coolock Community <Col N="35" /> Law Centre provide a service in excess of strictly legal aid and consequently it was thought more appropriate that the matter should be funded under the combat poverty scheme in the Department of Social Welfare rather than the Department of Justice, and that will be the position from now on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures provided to me by the Coolock Law Centre indicate that the service they provide is approximately four to five times less expensive than that provided by the Free Legal Aid Board and they are obviously providing a service which the board, for one reason or another, are not in a position to provide at the moment.  Therefore, would the Minister not reconsider his attitude to this centre and see if he could provide funding on a long-term basis rather than each year as at present?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> That is exactly the reason why it is going to be funded by the Department of Social Welfare. I have seen the figures referred to by the Deputy and I do not agree with them because I question the relative base.  I appreciate that the Coolock Community Law Centre are doing very useful work in the area they serve and it is so that they will be in a position to operate a service distinct from that being provided by the Free Legal Aid Board in my Department that the arrangement is now being made to place them under the auspices of the Department of Social Welfare. I am sure the people responsible and working in that centre are not worried whether they get the money from the Department of Social Welfare or the Department of Justice so long as they get money and have the freedom to operate the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The money provided this year is less than that provided last year by the Department of Justice.  It seems extraordinary that the Department of Justice are not willing to accept responsibility for the provision of this service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As I <Col N="36" /> pointed out, the Department of Justice already have responsibility for the Free Legal Aid Board who provide a comprehensive national service.  The Coolock Community Law Centre provide a voluntary service beyond what is simply free legal aid and they provide a very useful service in the area in which they operate. I suggest that the arrangement being made now whereby funds will be provided by the Department of Social Welfare &mdash; with further submissions on the adequacy of the funding being made to the Minister for Social Welfare &mdash; is a better arrangement than the one made heretofore, which was an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement which continued unsatisfactorily over a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice will be aware that for some time the Free Legal Aid Board made the services of one or two solicitors available to the Coolock Community Law Centre.  In view of the fact that even though a great deal of the work of the centre is other than legal aid would the Minister not recognise that a very considerable part of it in fact still is legal aid and that therefore some liaison between the Coolock Community Law Centre and the Free Legal Aid Board, some swopping of provision of services would be desirable?  Furthermore &mdash; while I agree with the Minister that the hard-pressed staff of that centre do not really care where the money comes from &mdash;as a great amount of the work done is of a matrimonial, domestic type, does he not think it is not entirely suitable to transfer it to the Department of Social Welfare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Yes, I am aware that previously one solicitor was supplied by the Free Legal Aid Board to the Coolock Community Law Centre.  That arose out of the extent of the advice being provided by the Coolock Community Law Centre to victims of the Stardust fire.  That process has now been completed.  I take the Deputy's point that many of the services provided by the Free Legal Aid Board and the Coolock Community Law Centre are co-extensive.  My Department and the Free Legal Aid <Col N="37" /> Board have no objection to the Coolock Community Law Centre referring cases to the Free Legal Aid Board.  Certainly I should like to see liaison between what is the official Department of Justice Free Legal Aid Board and the voluntary body which is certainly supplementing the particular scheme on the north side of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister acknowledges the desirability of liaison, would he look into the question of whether that liaison can best be effected by the provision of staff by the Free Legal Aid Board to the Coolock Community Law Centre, because the question of situation comes into it and the provision of a legal aid service in the centre would be very helpful in all the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Free Legal Aid Board operate nationally.  In certain situations as well as operating a central office they operate a clinic system. If the management and staff of the Coollock Community Law Centre were to put forward proposals to the Free Legal Aid Board to avail of their centre in Coolock for clinic purposes, where a solicitor from the Free Legal Aid Board would attend, that would be a matter for the Free Legal Aid Board.  Certainly I would have no objection to it.</P>

There has been a fall of 4 per cent to 5 per cent in interest rates over the past six months or so and we feel a full two-year period is not now justified. The subsidy payments will accordingly be limited to one year only but farmers benefiting under the interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty, that is the rescue package, will continue to get the subsidy for two years.  The 5 per cent subsidy was paid to farmers irrespective of whether there was any real need for it and in present circumstances this has obviously been reconsidered.  The saving involved in 1983 will be £2 million.  The EEC 5 per cent interest scheme for development farmers will continue to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of the schemes for the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis is very substantial and I have previously voiced my concern about the vast expenditure involved.  I understand that in 1983 the cost will be approximately £24 million.  This is a great drain on Exchequer resources.  Notwithstanding that, it has been agreed that the Exchequer will provide a further £3 million to meet the <Col N="142" /> Government's commitment to increase the reactor compensation grants.  This is an increase of 35 per cent per annum.  I have not yet announced the exact details of the payments but hope to do so in the next week or two.  It will be an increase over present reactor prices of something in the region of 35 per cent on average. It is obvious that there are many inhibiting factors in getting rid of disease in cattle.  The price of reactors is not up to the market value.  Much of the evasion and falsification involved in moving animals illegally is connected with this low price.  This is a positive step to help farmers obtain a more realistic value.  Hopefully we will reach a stage where full market value can be paid for such animals thus eliminating the temptation to move them illegally.</P>
    <P>The improvement of these grants to realistic levels will reduce the need for payments out of the hardship fund which is designed to help farmers who are severely hit by disease problems.  Payments from the hardship fund will in future be confined to cases where total depopulation of the herd is deemed necessary on animal health grounds.  The decrease will be of the order of £.65 million in 1983.  The reduced demand on the hardship fund together with some tightening up of the management of the eradication schemes as a whole and more careful monitoring of the volume and rate of testing to be undertaken will yield a saving of about £1.8 million in 1983.</P>
    <P>As regards the £3 million being made available to enable reactor grants to be increased, I shall be making a detailed announcement shortly but I would like it to be known at this stage that the improved grants will be payable in respect of all reactors detected on or after 31 January 1983, the date on which the current annual round of testing commenced.</P>
    <P>I have also been reviewing the operation of the farmers` retirement scheme. It can be hardly described as having been successful; in fact only 594 farmers availed of it in nine years, a very small number for a national scheme.  By suspending the scheme we hope to save £1 million in 1983.  The reasons the scheme <Col N="143" /> has not been successful are complex and embrace deep-seated social attitudes which are obviously not offset by the financial benefits available under the scheme.  Despite the small number of participants, the scheme has proved costly to the State.  Because of the age pattern and location of the retiring farmers the cost of the land purchased from them falls almost entirely on the Exchequer and only about 10 per cent of the cases have qualified for subvention by the EEC.  In addition, resale of the land purchased has involved the Land Commission in heavy losses.</P>
    <P>To qualify for EEC subvention the farmer retiring would need to be in the 55-65 age bracket and in most of our cases farmers have been over 66 years of age.  Secondly, the land acquired from the retiring farmer must be allocated to a development farmer and there is no recoupment from the EEC if the land is not so allocated.  Unfortunately, much of the land in question has had to be allocated to people other than development farmers and did not qualify for the EEC grant.</P>
    <P>Most of the people I have encountered who have made inquiries about this scheme have been farmers who wished to hand over land to a son or sons.  This scheme does not cater for that type of case.  The Land Commission allocate the land as they see fit and there is no guarantee to a father that his son will benefit from his participation in the retirement scheme.  This difficulty stopped a lot of people who might have been enticed into the scheme.  It is an understandable difficulty.</P>
    <P>We have now had quite a few years' experience of farmer retirement measures and the time is opportune to reconsider the contribution which retirement can make to structural reform in the future and to see how retirement could be made more socially acceptable.  This reappraisal is being carried out in the context of the review of land policy generally which I have initiated in my Department.  In the meantime I am suspending the scheme as outlined for the reasons stated.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="144" /> In my attempts to achieve land reform, long-term leasing is one of my objectives. I am gratified by the amount of support I have received from the farming organisations, the IFA and the ICMSA, and also from the ICOS, the body governing the co-operative movement.  They have shown a keen interest in long-term leasing of land.  Also a number of co-operative societies around the country have individually shown a willingness to get involved and I hope to be able to make some contribution, not just in words but in actual cash in the current year, towards the development of a scheme for long-term leasing.</P>
    <P>Under the disadvantaged areas scheme it has been decided that farmers whose off-farm income combined with that of their spouses exceeds £3,500 in the income tax year to 5 April 1983 will not be eligible for livestock headage grants in 1983.  The introduction of the lower limit on non-farm income for the 1983 schemes will enable the limited resources available to be used to benefit those most in need of assistance, that is full-time farmers and those with lower off-farm earnings who depend on farming for their livelihood.  Those now excluded will in fact be persons with incomes of nearly £70 per week from outside agriculture plus the income from their farms.  The saving envisaged in 1983 is £0.5 million.</P>
    <P>It is also my intention to disband An Comhairle Olla, The Wool Council.  The main functions of An Comhairle Olla included the introduction of grading of wool for sale, the registration of wool buyers and the licensing of wool exporters. These objectives have long since been implemented and expenditure on current activities such as wool displays, shearing demonstrations and so on, and promotion of wool must be regarded as a low priority item in the present financial situation.  These activities, while useful, do not justify the continuance of State expenditure in present circumstances and it has, therefore, been decided to abolish the council.  All the staff, with one exception, are Department officials and they will continue to implement the statutory requirements of the Wool Marketing <Col N="145" /> Act.  The saving will be £60,000 in 1983 but about £100,000 in a full year.</P>
    <P>I should like to emphasise that the decision to wind up the council should not be interpreted in any way whatsoever as a reflection on their performance.  I appreciate that they have done a very good job but we feel that The Wool Council have outlived their usefulness and can be done without in the present economic climate.  The schemes involved are generally administered by officials from my Department and this can be done without any undue extra effort.  The marketing of wool has improved greatly over the years and this is due in large part to the activities of the council and the valuable services rendered by the members over the years.</P>
    <P>In deciding where the reductions in the expenditure of my Department will be made, my objective has been to ensure that they should have as little effect as possible on the ordinary productive farmer.  Of course, it is not always possible to make reductions that will have no effect and it is nonsense to suggest that there is a painless path back to financial stability.</P>
    <P>The most direct and obvious way in which the use of existing resources can be maximised is through expansion of the national herd.  In many respects the infrastructure already exists to cater for an increase in animal numbers.  The main thrust of agricultural policy must, therefore, lie in this area.  With livestock and livestock products supplying more than 70 per cent of gross agricultural output, this is the best starting point for achieving higher output and income.  With this in mind we will look to the EEC for measures aimed at encouraging herd expansion and, of course, the recent Commission proposals for the continuation of the calf premium and the suckler cow arrangements are welcome.  At last week's meeting of the EEC agricultural Ministers there was a certain amount of resistance to the renewal of these measures, although they were contained in the Commission's original proposals and we would be hoping for an increase in the premiums and subsidies.  I hope that the <Col N="146" /> opposition withers away and does not resurrect in the coming talks because these special measures are a vital aid for our farmers in increasing the national herd.  The levels of incentives available under these measures could, however, be improved and I will be following this up even though at the most recent meeting of the Council of Ministers some member states raised objections to even the existing levels of assistance for Ireland. Coupled with the calved heifer grant of £70 and the headage payments in the disadvantaged areas, these two measures constitute a substantial incentive to increase livestock numbers.  Indeed, a farmer in the disadvantaged areas can get as much as £167 in grants for an extra heifer and calf while a farmer outside those areas can get as much as £116. These certainly make expansion of the breeding herd an attractive proposition.</P>
    <P>The budget contained a number of other items of significance for agriculture. The VAT rebate for farmers is to be increased from 1.8 per cent to 2.3 per cent.  This 0.5 per cent increase represents about £10 million for farmers and offsets the extra VAT which they will have to pay on their inputs.  The stock relief rate for farmers paying income tax is being continued for a further year at 110 per cent and this will maintain the incentive to expand the breeding herd. The concessionary fuel oil arrangement for the glasshouse industry is also being continued.  On the Estimates side the changes include a sum of £5 million for the continuation of EEC special measures for the subsidisation of AI and ground limestone.  These measures which are financed equally by FEOGA and the Exchequer are due to expire in May and it is my aim to have them continued.  The revised Estimates also included an extra £93,000 for ACOT to assist the agricultural college at Ballinafad, County Mayo. I had numerous representations from Deputies, particularly Deputy Kenny, to retain that college which is involved in training young farmers for the current year.  In order to be fully effective and to bring about a return to higher growth and better employment opportunities, the overall measures being taken by the <Col N="147" /> Government will be reinforced by further steps in the fields of incomes, investment, production and exports.</P>
    <P>Substantial growth in output, particularly for export, is needed if the economy is to provide the large increase in sustainable jobs that is required over the medium term to halt, and ultimately to reverse, the current upward trend in unemployment.  This means improving the competitiveness of Irish products as regards price and in other important respects such as reliability and service. At the same time, the present unsustainable level of public sector borrowing, particularly from abroad, has to be reduced.  We must also ensure that public investment is directed to projects which yield a substantial positive return to the economy.</P>
    <P>The performance of agriculture during 1982 has already demonstrated the ability of the industry to contribute to progress and growth in the economy.  Following three years of depressed agricultural output and incomes brought about by a combination of factors, including a severe cost-price squeeze and adverse weather, the improvement in both output and incomes during 1982 was most welcome and most encouraging.  We can thank the weather for that.  We had a good year climatically, milk yields were up substantially and all aspects of farming benefited. Our weather conditions are often commented on but for once they benefited us to a considerable extent in 1982.</P>
    <P>These developments show that agriculture is capable of returning to the dynamism and buoyancy of the mid-seventies, with all the benefits for farmers' incomes, gross national product and the balance of payments that these developments imply.</P>
    <P>There is now a sound infrastructure on which further growth of agricultural output can be based.  Many Irish farmers are already achieving very high levels of output and where these farmers have led, others can follow.</P>
    <P>I find it interesting, and pleasing, to learn that some farmers, particularly those in my constituency, can attain milk produce levels comparable to those of <Col N="148" /> farmers on the Continent.  While the national average is between 600 and 700 per cow per annum farmers in my constituency can produce milk yields of between 1,200 and 1,300 gallons per annum and that shows that our farmers can do as well as those on the Continent if the effort is made.  In the long run the only way to raise farm incomes is through increased and more efficiently produced output on the farm.  Achievement of progress and prosperity will depend on making the most effective use of available resources.  Only in this way can we secure the economic expansion which will ensure a better future for all the people on the land of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I should like to congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment and to wish him well in his performance of the arduous tasks he will face.  I should like to refer to the lead up to the budget. After the general election Fine Gael invited the Labour Party to walk into their parlour and to partake with them of the fruits of office.  The Labour Party then proceeded with their now well-known ritual dance of wrestling with their conscience.  Having done so they acquiesced and the budget before the House is the result of that union.  To say that it is difficult to see any similarity between what was promised by the two parties prior to the general election and what is contained in the budget is self-evident. It is a sad commentary on the parties which form the Government that they should have so little concern for what they said they would do before the election especially when compared with what they have done since elected. Socialism, as far as the Labour Party are concerned, is dead.  Of course, there are those who never believed that the Labour Party had any socialist content in their philosophy but those who believed that there was a socialist philosophy there have got a rude awakening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The experiences of the Labour Party in former Coalitions should have been sufficient to cause them to eschew Coalitions for evermore but it appears that the lure of office is as strong today as it <Col N="149" /> ever was and that the Labour Party find themselves trapped by their own decision in a conservative Fine Gael web.  The people for whose cause the Labour Party had pledged their unequivocal support, the poor, the sick, the unemployed and the under-privileged are now being made to carry a sharply disproportionate share of the burden in the Coalition's bookkeeping exercise.  The increases granted to social welfare recipients have reduced their living standards in real terms, not alone because they will only be granted increases of between ten and 12 per cent &mdash; between 4 per cent and 6 per cent below the estimated rate of inflation &mdash; but also because the increases will not be paid until the end of June.  Children's allowances will remain static and children's allowances for apprentices under 18 years of age are being abolished. Before I deal with the content of the budget I should like to refer to the document, <i>Principal Features of the Budget,</i> in which the Minister for Finance refers to what he claims Fianna Fáil were about to do and what he has done in this budget, the purpose of the comparison being to try to blame the former Government for his own Government's actions.  I totally reject the Minister's attitude on this matter.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Government published the Book of Estimates before the general election.  Because of this, the Fine Gael and Labour Parties knew what the Estimates contained during the election campaign.  That the Fianna Fáil Government should have published the Estimates in the circumstances was unprecedented.  The Fine Gael and Labour Parties, therefore, were in a position to accept or reject the implications of the Estimates.  The Labour Party rejected them almost completely out of hand before the election.  Both parties were in a position to state just where they stood in relation to them.</P>
    <P>As a simple example I will take the case where Fianna Fáil appeared to be considering altering the pupil-teacher ratio in post-primary schools.  The Fine Gael and Labour Parties replied to the teachers' organisations before the election proclaiming that they would not <Col N="150" /> agree to any such change in the pupil-teacher ratio.  Those who had an interest in this matter were able to decide whether they agreed with what Fianna Fáil appeared to be going to do in this matter, or whether they accepted the Fine Gael and Labour stance in relation to such a change, and vote accordingly.</P>
    <P>Because of the publication of the Estimates, the voters could vote for what were supposed to be the then Government's proposals or for the Fine Gael-Labour alternatives.  They voted against the Fianna Fáil proposals and a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition ensued.  The people rightly expected the implementation of the Fine Gael-Labour policy and not the Fianna Fáil policy, and they were very sadly disappointed.</P>
    <P>The nub of what I am saying is that the Coalition Government are responsible for their actions and must be made to accept that responsibility.  The people elected the two parties in the Coalition, once they formed a Coalition, to carry out their policies, and Fianna Fáil have not the slighest intention of accepting any responsibility for those policies.  I could go into some detail, which I do not propose to do now, on the difference between Coalition policy and Fine Gael and Labour policies.  I am accepting the situation that we have a Coalition Government which put forward their policy to the people, a policy which they told the people they would follow, and we have seen the result.</P>
    <P>The manner of the implementation of the cuts suggested by Fianna Fáil must also be given due consideration.  If we take the cuts in the education estimate, the Fianna Fáil attitude is that such cuts would be implemented only after due consideration and consultation with the parents, teachers and other interested bodies.  Such consultation would have prevented the total chaos which has existed in the educational sphere since the Coalition cuts were announced.</P>
    <P>My final point on this matter for the moment is that the Fianna Fáil Estimates must be viewed in the context of the document <i>The Way Forward</i> which stated the problems and difficulties facing the Government and pointed to the manner <Col N="151" /> in which the Fianna Fáil Government proposed to deal with them, and how they proposed in a determined, systematic and well-thought out manner to advance the economy, to create employment, and to take care of those in need.</P>
    <P>In the Coalition budget we have a stark bookkeeping exercise and, far from having anything of substance about employment, social welfare, health, education and so on, we have the philosophy of despair only.  To create a national corporation and impose it on this type of concept will be little better than window-dressing at best, and a mean and cynical effort to delude the people at worst.  We were never short of money, even during times of recession, to finance worthwhile ideas and help them to develop, and our records shows that to be so.  The problem was whether worthwhile proposals and ideas were there which the Government could finance and develop.</P>
    <P>I have already pointed out that the Labour Party, with full knowledge of the Estimates, rejected many Fianna Fáil proposals out of hand and put alternatives to the electorate which the electorate accepted.  I am not concerning myself to any great extent with the Fine Gael Party because I never believed they were anything but a conservative party, in recent times trying to put on a liberal face.  I would not expect the social changes from them which my party visualise for the future, any more than they accepted the really forward-looking changes we made in social legislation in the past.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party at least should have been expected to underwrite a different social policy, and either to implement it or leave the Coalition.  The Labour Party programme published prior to the election in November is now totally contradicted by their actions in respect of the budget.  It is a shame that so little respect was shown by that party for the people who voted for them in all good faith.  I want to quote from the Labour document <i>Jobs, Equality and Justice</i> published before the November general election. On page 3 under the heading &ldquo;Who Pays for the Crisis?&rdquo; we read:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="152" /> The main parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;meaning Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash; propose massive cuts in public spending falling especially on health and social services and affecting the weakest of the community.  Labour rejects utterly any policy that makes the poor, the unemployed, the sick, the homeless and the young bear the brunt of corrective measures.</P>
    <P>That is what they said to the electorate and it was on that policy that voters voted for the Labour Party.  How has Labour Party policy, as seen in the budget, lived up to that manifesto?  Labour have done the exact opposite to what they promised the electorate.  In this Labour-Fine Gael Coalition budget they are making certain that the poor, the sick, the unemployed, the underprivileged and the young bear the brunt of the corrective measures.  A disproportionate load has been placed on these people.</P>
    <P>By granting a mean 10 per cent to 12 per cent increase in pensions, benefits and allowances, much below the estimated increase in inflation, by cutting back severely on short-term benefit payments for those unfortunate enough to be on short-term working, by putting 5 per cent extra taxation on the few briquettes and blocks needed for warmth, the Labour Party are forcing the poor, the needy, the underprivileged, the unemployed and the sick to carry a burden well above that which they are capable of carrying.</P>
    <P>By imposing transport charges on young children seeking admission to post-primary schools they are inflicting an excessive burden on these young people and, more particularly, on underprivileged young people who will now be unable to attend school for financial reasons.  The Labour Party now apparently believe that those who are most vulnerable must carry a disproportionate share of the load.</P>
    <P>I again quote from page 3 of the Labour Party manifesto:</P>
    <P>... The wealthy to pay the major <Col N="153" /> share of the cost of economic adjustment....</P>
    <P>I note that the Tánaiste pointed out recently that there were certain elements incorporated in the budget which were Labour policy in operation.  One of the matters to which he referred was that if a person has a house valued at £65,000 or over and earns an income in excess of £20,000 a year he will pay a few shillings in tax.  That is one of the great concessions made by Fine Gael to the Labour Party.  Is this what the Labour Party manifesto meant?  The man whose income is cut by £20 per week because of short time working will hardly be amused.</P>
    <P>The Tánaiste also said that the Labour Party had gained concessions from Fine Gael because the Labour Party were responsible for the decision to make every farmer fill in a tax return.  That is nonsense because everybody knows that from the date a court issued its decision in respect of poor law valuation a decision to compel every farmer to make a tax return was inevitable.  It had nothing whatsoever to do with Labour policy.</P>
    <P>I also quote from page 4 of the Labour Party manifesto:</P>
    <P>...no further increases in VAT on essentials....</P>
    <P>Need I say more?  I wish, however, to emphasise the words &ldquo;no further increases&rdquo; because this clearly relates to items which are already charged at different VAT rates at present and not on articles which are zero-rated.  I do this because I suspect efforts might be made by the Coalition to pretend that they were referring to zero-rated goods.  When it is noted that we will now be paying almost half the normal selling price extra on some goods because of VAT, then we have some real understanding of the effect of the increases.</P>
    <P>The policy of the Fianna Fáil Party has always had a social content.  The problems of the old, sick and underprivileged have been matters of constant and deep concern to them.  Their concern was shown by the fact that, for quite some time, increases of 25 per cent have been granted annually to social welfare recipients <Col N="154" /> by Fianna Fáil Governments, the objective being not only to help people dependent on social welfare to keep pace with inflation but also an attempt to increase the real value of social welfare payments.  We always recognised that we had a special duty to the old who had worked hard all their lives to help improve the standard of living of those who came after them.  We believed that there was a consequent responsibility on us to ensure that they were not forgotten. The Coalition in this budget have certainly forgotten them.  Fine Gael and Labour who in the run up to the election were so loud in their demands and in their promises of justice, fair play and equity for the poor and underprivileged have now not only gone back on their promises but have worsened the conditions in which the same poor, sick and underprivileged must live in the future.</P>
    <P>To put it mildly, the budget in so far as the poor are concerned, is a cynical exercise of which both parties, but especially the Labour Party, should feel deeply ashamed.  It is totally unacceptable that people in receipt of social welfare should be forced to carry a burden which it is clearly beyond their capacity to bear, especially when you remember the lavish promises made to those same people before the general election last November. We were told by the Coalition Party that they stood for a comprehensive health scheme and no cutbacks.  Those are the exact words used in a Labour pamphlet which was circulated in my constituency before the election.  Far from developing a more comprehensive health scheme, we are faced with considerable cutbacks to the tune of £12.3 million net. The drugs refund scheme, which helped those in the middle income group, but more especially those who were just outside the means test limit for medical cards to cope with the enormous cost of drugs, has been rendered almost useless.  Provision for that scheme has been cut from £13 million to £8 million.  How can the Government expect people who must take expensive drugs regularly to continue with their treatment?  Even with costs as they were prior to the budget, there were many cases of people who, <Col N="155" /> because of financial necessity, simply stopped using drugs and imperilled their health as a result.  What will the position be in relation to those people now?  The amount payable per month at present will have to be increased considerably and it will be impossible for many people, especially those relatively close to but above the medical card income limit, to meet the increased costs.  This will result in their giving up drugs which their doctor regards as being essential for their wellbeing. I have no doubt that because of the change there will be a public demand for less stringent tests for medical cards. But however the public may protest, when we look at the Government's attitude to old age pensioners, whose medical cards are being withdrawn in very large numbers by the health boards, there can be little hope for them.  It is another pointer to Government policy in the social welfare area.</P>
    <P>When I remember the furore before the election in respect of the £5 contribution for certain outpatient services introduced by voluntary hospitals, which did not have to be paid by people holding medical cards, people covered by long-term illnesses, children under 16 years of age, emergency cases, maternity patients or by people suffering from infectious diseases, I wonder what the people who reacted so angrily to the £5 charge have had to say about the matter at that time if they realised that the £5 charge would be removed, that there would be severe cutbacks in the health services, that the drug refund scheme would be drastically reduced resulting in higher payments for drugs and that many old age pensioners would have had their medical cards withdrawn.  Here again we have a situation where the poorer people are being forced to finance the better off and the effect of all of this on the health services will create further problems for many people.  These problems will come to the surface when the changes in the health services become apparent, and more especially in the light of the specific promises given by the Labour Party that there would not be any cuts in the health services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="156" /> The basic problem facing the country at the moment is unemployment.  The number of unemployed is at an exceptionally high level.  Day after day more people are losing their jobs.  The bookkeeping style of budget introduced by the Minister for Finance is unimaginative. The whole thrust of the budget is deflationary and far from holding out any prospect of more employment or even holding the level we have at the moment the opposite is the case.</P>
    <P>As a result of the budget we face the prospect of vastly increased unemployment levels.  Those whose jobs have been put in jeopardy are dreading the thought of what tomorrow may bring.  The Minister's objective appears to have been a book-balancing one and it will result in slowing down economic activity considerably. When framing the budget the Minister might have been expected to give some thought to the traumatic experience being suffered by the unemployed who had been led to expect that the many promises of the new Government would be fulfilled.  Instead, as a result of this budget they find a bleak future facing them.  The general belief is that, as a result of the budget, many more will join the ranks of the unemployed. The feeling of despondency and hopelessness facing those people who suddenly find themselves unemployed, especially in middle age or later years, is frightening.  They can see no future.  They feel let down in front of their families and they feel isolated from their comrades. For these people the budget holds out no hope.</P>
    <P>There is no plan or strategy for the provision of employment: indeed, the reverse is the case.  The whole thrust of this deflationary budget is in the opposite direction.  The 1 per cent levy put on all gross income and deducted from net pay, the VAT increases and the special fuel tax, among other things, will reduce the buying power of the public to such an extent and will result in such resistance to buying that of itself it will cause more unemployment.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach said that the Government now intend making plans to deal with unemployment.  I am <Col N="157" /> sure he is aware that the questions of provision of employment and of budgetary strategy are inter-related and cannot be considered in isolation.  In the budget the Government have dealt with their financial strategy but that strategy is deflationary and it reduces any real prospect of progress towards the provision of jobs.  It appears to me that any planning done now will be for the sole purpose of window-dressing and when in the future it fails to produce results the gloom and despair among the unemployed will be even deeper.</P>
    <P>The development of industrial employment is vital and the IDA have done trojan work in this sphere for many years. Looking at development in the industrial sphere in my constituency, it is clear that the provision of industrial employment in large, medium and small industries is basic to overcoming the serious unemployment problems facing us.  Of itself industrial employment also increases service jobs.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to underestimate the problems facing us at the present time.  I am aware of the difficulties facing industry and the IDA in their efforts to promote industry, but I fail to see how reducing the money to the IDA for the promotion of industrial development will help.  I am convinced that at this critical juncture in our history we should be providing more money for the IDA to pursue their objective of creating more employment. They should be in a position to pursue more industries abroad and encourage them to come here.  They should be in a position to give every assistance to industries at home as well as to seek out young people who have worthwhile ideas and who, if given the necessary financial impetus, could help to provide jobs.  To reduce the allocation to the IDA is deplorable.  It is an admission by the Government that they have given up all hope of improving the employment situation.</P>
    <P>In the document giving the principal features of the budget, the Government take the attitude that because the expected level of grant payments fell below the amount anticipated they should reduce the allocation to the IDA. <Col N="158" /> This is the policy of despair and it will be poor consolation for the many unemployed. The least the Government should do is to inform the IDA that if more money is needed it will be allocated immediately.  Whatever cutbacks may be needed in other areas of expenditure, a job-producing agency such as the IDA should be allocated more money, and certainly the allocation should not be reduced.</P>
    <P>More industry is needed immediately in my constituency, especially in the Drogheda, Dundalk and Ardee areas where there is a constant rise in the numbers unemployed.  These people will find it very difficult to understand why money to the IDA is being reduced at a time when the unemployment queues are growing.  The input of the IDA in industrial development in my constituency is well known and appreciated.  The cutback now is inexplicable and will be poor encouragement for all those concerned in industrial development to give of their best.  To say that the amount of money needed was not as great as anticipated is not the answer.  The Minister and the Government must take another look at the situation in this area and at least see that further moneys, if needed, will be available to the IDA and they must not force the IDA to operate within the narrow confines of the amount of money now being made available to them.</P>
    <P>I will refer to another aspect of industry which is being hit severely by this budget. An increase in taxation, which perhaps to the uninitiated would appear to be a relatively minor matter, is in reality of considerable gravity for many industries, particularly for two in my constituency of Louth.  I refer to the increase of 1p per gallon on hydrocarbon oils.  This increase, which appears so small in itself, will have very serious repercussions on the two industries to which I refer.  One of these is already on an enforced holiday. The fact that a further 1p per gallon is added to their costings will result in a considerable increase in their costs and will do little to help this industry is also on their feet.  The other industry is also a very heavy user of the type of oil in question.  They have gone through very <Col N="159" /> difficult times and this further imposition will not help, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>How deeply has the Minister examined this matter?  As I have said, to the uninitiated it appears to be a relatively small matter and, if I remember rightly, the Minister in his speech said that no increase had been put on this type of oil for some time.  I repeat that it is a very heavy imposition and it creates specially difficult problems for the industries I have in mind who use very large quantities of this oil.  I have not got figures here of the level of excise duty on hydrocarbon oils of other member countries of the EEC but if my memory serves me rightly it is at a much lower level than it is here.  I can remember not very long ago examining this situation and finding that no excise duty whatever was imposed on hydrocarbon oils in some member states of the EEC.  While I have not up-to-date information on this here, nevertheless from past experience I can safely say that the duty on hydrocarbon oils is much lower in other EEC countries than it is here and, because of the level of excise duty here, it is much more difficult for industries here using large quantities of this oil to be competitive.  In industries where jobs would appear to be at risk already the situation can only deteriorate. I do not propose to name the industries that I have referred to, but I suggest that if the Minister will have a look at his files in relation to this matter he will find that I have made representations on quite a number of occasions in regard to them. I feel very strongly that this tax should be reviewed.  The extra income to the Exchequer can hardly justify the potential loss of jobs which is likely to arise as a result of the increase in this duty.</P>
    <P>This budget contains a reduction of £13 million for housing.  In the document entitled <i>Principal Features of Budget</i> the Government state that the revised assessment of the Housing Finance Agency for 1983 requirements has enabled a reduction of £10 million to be made in this provision.  Of course this means in effect that this system of financing housing which was brought in by the last Coalition has proved a failure, but I do not see any <Col N="160" /> reason why that £10 million which was saved in that area in respect of housing could not be used in other areas of house building.  This will be the most seriously shaken sector of the economy as a result of the budget.  Job losses in this area have occurred over a period but this will accelerate the number of building workers losing their employment.  The forecast by those involved in the construction industry is that very large numbers of building workers will become unemployed in the course of 1983.  The need for the development of roads and infrastructure generally is recognised by all.  If we are to overcome the problems of the recession and particularly when these problems are overcome, we will need a worthwhile road system and the infrastructure necessary for the development of industry, but hopes in that direction have been dealt a very severe blow by this budget. In relation to road construction and development I am keeping an eye on Donore Road and Rathmullen Road in Drogheda which are in a deplorable condition. The residents there were given to understand in recent times that in a relatively short space of time all would be well.  I hope that is so.</P>
    <P>As far as my constituency is concerned there are other problems in the employment area which relate to house building and infrastructure generally.  Cement Roadstone have one of their factories sited at Drogheda.  This factory will be affected severely by the cutback in building construction work.  They had already had problems in relation to the importation of foreign cement which I have done my utmost to counteract.  Now by the Government's decision in this budget a situation is being created which can lead to more unemployment in this cement processing industry.  I hope that the Minister will keep in mind the needs and problems of this factory.  I also hope that he will impress on his colleagues, as I did on mine when Fianna Fáil were in office, that they should encourage the use of Irish cement and discourage by every means in their power the importation of foreign cement.  Too many individuals go around to various ports throughout the country holding out prospects of a few <Col N="161" /> jobs so as to be facilitated in the importation of cement from abroad.  This is highly damaging to that long-established industry in Drogheda.  When these individuals find their activities no longer pay high profits they will pull out of the areas in which they established themselves without the slightest regret or concern for the people they employ.  In the meantime while they are there they can do irreparable damage to a very worth-while industry in Drogheda which uses home-based raw materials.</P>
    <P>The problem on one side of the coin is the importation of foreign cement.  The problem on the other side for cement workers is the cutback in demand for cement due to fewer buildings, houses or otherwise, being erected.  The large cutbacks in this area do not augur well for recovery.  The enormous cutbacks by the Minister for Finance in his reconsideration of the Public Capital Programme of Fianna Fáil will surely have a significant detrimental effect on building generally. The building sector will bear the brunt of these cutbacks.  If one includes in one's calculation &mdash; as indeed one must &mdash; the inflation rate this year, the severe impact on costs resulting from VAT increases on construction and on building materials, it must follow that there will be quite a considerable fall in building activity which will result in lay-offs on building sites and cutbacks in the production of cement in Drogheda.</P>
    <P>We have now a very severe unemployment problem.  Unemployment among our young people is very high.  A nation with half its population under 25 years should be a nation with the incentive and the will to develop.  The budget has nothing in it to help young people leaving school at various levels.  There is no prospect for them.  They have a unique contribution to make to the development of the country but the budget, which is deflationary, has nothing to offer them. There is no prospect of employment for them and no direction as to how they can contribute.  If this is allowed to continue our many unemployed young people will begin to stagnate and end up unemployable.</P>
    <P>I have a particular interest in the tourist <Col N="162" /> industry especially since I was Minister for Tourism.  At that time I saw very great potential in tourism for our economic growth.  At the end of the 1973-77 Coalition period tourism had become a stagnant industry.  Tourist numbers were falling off considerably when I took office as Minister for Tourism.  Fianna Fáil recognised the value of tourism and we underlined the importance of this industry by putting the word tourism into the Minister's title.  Under Fianna Fáil's policy tourism began to develop and soon became one of our major industries. About 1978 we had the largest number of tourists ever coming here.  The industry was growing at a great rate.</P>
    <P>Tourism provided more and more employment over the years and it seemed to be well set for further development in the future.  The tourist industry has had its problems over the last two years and those will now be exacerbated by this budget.  The penal increase in VAT will severely hit all facets of the industry including goods and services.  The two increases in the price of petrol, one in the budget and one at the beginning of January, as well as the enormous increases in the price of liquor are pricing us out of the tourist market for foreign tourists as well as for our own people to take holidays at home.  There is little doubt that we will see a further decline in this industry, which has not far to drop to be on the ground.</P>
    <P>Forecasts have already been made about the likely increases in hotel tariffs during this year.  Those increases plus the cost of getting tourists to the holiday resorts will deter people from holidaying here and this will result in more money spent abroad.  My constituency of Louth is a Border constituency which is very badly hit.  Taxes generally and particularly the price of petrol are very much lower in Northern Ireland than they are here.  The result is that there is a very considerable drop in business in the hotels and public houses in my constituency. Petrol pumps, particularly in the part of the constituency close to the Border, are lying idle.  The manager of one hotel informed me that in February 1982 they already had bookings from the <Col N="163" /> North for 20 to 30 weddings.  At the same time this year they had one booking.  This will result in a great loss for hoteliers and public house owners.  It will create a serious situation for the people employed in the industry as well as the whole locality. If no action is taken the extra increases put on in the budget will mean an end to this very great industry.  In some of the villages close to the Border, which had a very high reputation as tourist areas, there are hardly any visitors in the summer in comparison with a few years ago when they were crowded out.</P>
    <P>In the course of my speech I have directed most of my criticism to the Labour Party because the budget presented to the Dáil by the Minister for Finance is exactly what we have come to expect from Fine Gael Ministers for Finance.  They can only bring those budgets before the House because the Labour Party are giving support to them. In this instance they are giving support to a Fine Gael-orientated budget.  The Fine Gael Party are anxious at times to give the impression that they are a radical party but it is by their deeds you will know them.  Their deeds are starkly portrayed in this budget.  When one examines the Labour Party election programme of November 1982 one is immediately struck by the stark differences between what was put forward then as policy and the policy now being given the full support of the Labour Party.  The poor, the unemployed and the sick are not forgotten by the Labour Party.  In relation to this budget they would be a lot better off if they were because the Labour Party are ensuring now that they will find 1983 a much more difficult year than 1982.  What of the homeless?  By a decision of the Government, which includes the Labour Party, money for housing has been reduced and this will ensure that the homeless will unfortunately remain homeless.  What of the young?  The Labour Party and Fine Gael Coalition by their imposition of transport charges for post-primary students are ensuring that few of these children will be able to receive further education.  This <Col N="164" /> is hardly the policy on which the members of the Labour Party were elected.</P>
    <P>My other reason for concentrating on Labour Party policy is that I have noticed in my constituency that the local branch of the Labour Party, particularly in Drogheda, as soon as it was evident that the manna from heaven which was promised during the election campaign was failing to materialise, immediately attempted to distance themselves from the actions of the Coalition Government in order to give the impression that they had no responsibility for the deeds of that Government.  When the Minister for Education, Deputy Gemma Hussey, announced her education cuts and when Deputy Mitchell, the Minister for Transport, made the rather silly statement that CIE workers should accept a reduction in their wages, which may I point out in respect of the latter nobody with any sense believed, they became the targets. We had headlines in the local paper of 31 January stating that the Labour TD had not ruled out the possibility of voting against the budget if, for example, substantial increases were not granted to people on social welfare payments.  Let us consider what social welfare recipients are to receive by way of increases.  First, the increases are well below the estimated increase in inflation and in addition they will not be paid until the end of June.  The result of this is a severe drop in the standard of living of the old, the sick, the underprivileged and the unemployed and what is even worse, they will be asked to pay greatly increased VAT charges. They will have to pay a 5 per cent levy on their briquettes and logs.  However, if I were to deal with all the extra costs to which the poor are to be subjected, I would not have time to talk about anything else.</P>
    <P>In the following week <i>The Drogheda Independent</i> carried the heading, &ldquo;Labour Hits Out at Cabinet Members&rdquo;.  Singled out for mention in that context were the Minister for Education because of the cuts in education, and the Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs because of the suggested reduction in the pay of CIE workers.  At <Col N="165" /> the Labour Convention in Limerick the Drogheda branch of the Labour party voted for a coalition Government.  The votes of all Labour Deputies put into office all the Members of the Government and are supporting them in office. The Minister for Education would not be in office were it not for the votes of Labour Deputies.  The same can be said for the Minister for Transport and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  If the Drogheda branch of the Labour Party were so anxious to get out from under when the cuts in education were announced, what must be their attitude now in supporting a budget that is lowering the living standards of the old and the underprivileged and which is increasing VAT charges by 5 per cent while imposing a fuel rate of up to 5 per cent in addition to collecting an income levy of 1 per cent from the worker's pay packet? At the same time, the Government are increasing petrol prices, reducing money for housing, reducing money for the IDA and so on.  If the Drogheda branch of the Labour Party could go into hysterics about a rather silly statement from the Minister for Transport, and Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, when we all know that the possibility of cuts in the wages of CIE workers is not on, how much more hysterical must these branch members be now after the budget?  The simple fact is that for the purpose of achieving office, Labour, supported by the delegates from the Louth constituency, voted for a coalition. They are responsible now for the plight of those they promised faithfully to protect.  They were seen as people who would bring in a new era for the poor, the jobless and the underprivileged.  Certainly it is a new era but not for these groups of people in terms of what they expected from Labour.</P>
    <P>This deflationary budget offers no hope for the unemployed.  It is a budget that reduces the living standards of those who are unable to help themselves and for whom much more concern might have been shown by the Government.  It is a budget which underlines a policy of despair.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach in his <Col N="166" /> contribution to this debate outlined clearly the differences between this Government and the previous administration in terms of the formulation of the budget.  These differences do not lie in the level of Exchequer borrowing. Indeed, both Governments agreed very much on the level of £1,700 million for the Exchequer borrowing requirements. The difference between them revolved around whether the current budget deficit or the capital budget should take the adjustment.  The previous Government clearly would have opted to sustain the capital programme at all costs and to seek even more severe adjustments in the current budget.  The implication of that should be stressed.  We do not know exactly what course of action the previous Government would have taken had they aimed for achieving the lower deficit of £750 million that they mentioned.  However the difficulty they had in implementing cuts to the tune of £134 million &mdash; something that they expressed a commitment to but did not put through in policy decisions &mdash; suggests very much that the extra adjustment would have come by way of a higher level of taxation, probably to the order of £150 million to £200 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of this it is very difficult to take seriously the Opposition's jibe that this is a bookkeepers' budget and that it is repressive and deflationary.  It is clear that the strategy of the Leader of the Opposition, as underlined in his speech, of opting for a £750 million deficit would have involved far more severe taxation on the hard-pressed taxpayer.  By this time we have all recognised the difficulty of borrowing abroad this year.  It is regrettable in this difficult year that the ability to use resources raised abroad to help the economy out of one of its most severe depressions in a number of years, has been dissipated in the past five years by Governments borrowing at times when it was not necessary to do so and for projects that were proven to be not worthwhile.  That is the reason for our being forced and constrained in this budget, despite the severe depression and the high level of unemployment, to opt for a budget that is taking money out <Col N="167" /> of the economy.  It gives us no pleasure to have to do that but we do so in the growing realisation that if we are to continue to raise finance abroad in order to implement the necessary projects and to create the employment that is necessary, we must remain within those limits.</P>
    <P>The Government are right in putting much greater emphasis on cuts in the capital programme than would have been the case if the previous Government had remained in office.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey criticised the cuts in the capital programme.  That criticism was echoed by Deputy Faulkner who said that these cuts would result in unemployment. We must realise that in the past five years the capital programme has almost doubled but that it has not in any way increased the level of growth in the output of the economy nor resulted in a sustained employment growth.  Although the capital programme has succeeded in giving a short-term stimulus to employment, the problem is that it has not been devoted to areas of worthwhile investment. That short-term stimulus may be regretted by the Leader of the Opposition. In order to provide employment by way of the capital programme for one person the cost is about £40,000 whereas the cost on the current side in that respect is only £7,000.  Therefore, unless the extra £33,000 devoted to the capital programme results in the production of something really worth while, we are dissipating resources that could be used for employing our young people and for reducing the high level of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It is to be welcomed that this Government have gone for trimming the capital programme in the areas where there is notable waste.  There are some areas which obviously have been hit, such as Government offices.  It is well known that there are vacant Government offices around this city and there is no point continuing to expand the building and construction of public offices for Government Departments on the grounds that this is a stimulus to employment, a very expensive and wasteful stimulus.  The existing advance factory programme has <Col N="168" /> a lot of factory space idle &mdash; two million square feet &mdash; and it would have been foolish to press ahead with the same vigour in that area.</P>
    <P>I have done some study in the area of arterial drainage.  It is clear that we have gone beyond the point where investment in this area is producing worthwhile returns.  That programme needs to be restructured drastically if it is to achieve worth-while results for farmers who are supposed to benefit from it.  It was correct for the Government to cut back on this programme.  The level of investment in the area of farm modernisation grants has gone beyond what is economically justifiable. In the present situation where there is a clear choice between either raising more taxation or pressing on with these wasteful schemes, I believe the Government were right to call a halt to those schemes and trim them back.</P>
    <P>In relation to the capital programme the Minister gave a very important commitment to improve procedures for planning and controlling capital expenditure generally.  What is involved here is the long-sought-after appraisal of capital spending before it goes ahead.  Until systematic appraisal of our capital spending is introduced, we can be quite confident that the kind of wasteful spending we have seen in recent years will continue in the capital area.  It is appropriate therefore to bring in proper assessment before we use the scarce resources of taxpayers for these purposes.</P>
    <P>As I said, I worked in the area of arterial drainage.  That is one area where the Office of Public Works have used appraisal procedures.  However, there is a lesson to be learned from that, that it is possible under appraisal procedures to show virtually any investment to be worth while.  What is critical is the sort of assumptions put in, what one assumes about future growth and the output from the capital project.  It was clear to me that it was not right to leave the job of appraisal within the Department bringing forward the proposal.  There is a natural incentive to regard all one's geese as swans, to regard one's capital project as well worth while, and therefore to overestimate its value to the community.  In <Col N="169" /> my view a system of appraisal should use independent outsiders, such as the National Planning Board proposed in the joint programme of Government, for this purpose.</P>
    <P>I would like to consider the current spending side of the budget.  It has been said by a number of Opposition speakers that the Government did not go far enough in cutting current spending. Deputy Brennan dealt at length with that point which must be seen in the context of the last few years.  If it is looked at in that context it will be seen that the Government have gone a long way towards trimming current spending rather than putting all the burden on the taxpayers once again.  For example, in 1982 current spending went up by 23½ per cent.  This year the Estimates are down very considerably to a 13 per cent growth. That is very significant progress in putting the current spending house in some degree of order.  In real terms that means that in 1982 consumption spending increased by 1½ per cent; this year it is budgeted that it will be down by 2½ per cent.  I do not think Deputy Brennan's criticism holds water.  The Government have tried to bring forward real cuts in the Estimates and we are seeing the painful difficulties of putting through any expenditure cuts by the degree of opposition that has been aroused in the educational and other areas which have been hit.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that in one budget one cannot succeed in trimming spending to the extent one would like.  At present public current spending is made up as follows: debt services, 25 per cent; public service pay, about 37 per cent and social welfare 22 per cent.</P>
    <P>In those three areas, where there is virtually no scope for trimming in the short term, there is 84 per cent of Government spending.  It is only the remaining 16 per cent which offer any scope for trimming.  If that remainder is trimmed very drastically there will be the inevitable result that while people are kept on in public service employment the services will be starved because a civil servant cannot work just on his pay.  He needs the other resources that go with an <Col N="170" /> individual in employment.  If we pruned further, the inevitable consequences would be that services would be strangled. For example, a county council worker could be sent out to mend the roads without even a shovel.  That was a real constraint on this Government in trimming back in the spending area.  This budget forced emphasis on significant increases in taxation which to all of us were regrettable.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for renewing the Government's commitment to presentation of current spending in a form that Deputies and the public at large can make sense of.  He committed the Government to setting out in programme fashion the various expenditures involved &mdash; objectives for specific programmes, quantifying the output from those programmes and estimating the level of costs.  It is regrettable that at present we do not see what we are getting for the money we are devoting to a certain area, but we have fallen into the habit of measuring by input what is achieved by spending.  For example, in the area of education there is undue emphasis on the pupil-teacher ratio, but that does not tell all that the education programmes are achieving.  Likewise, the ratio of gardaí to people does not tell all that can be achieved in the security area. In my view, we have unduly blinkered ourselves from many important options that should be considered by this House. I welcome the Minister's commitment to have a more sensible way of presenting programmes so that we can debate those real options that are alternatives to simply increasing the numbers employed in various areas of the public sector.</P>
    <P>There is one other point I should like to make in passing, that is that it is regrettable that, in the presentation of spending at present &mdash; certainly as regards the global figures &mdash; no distinction is being made between expenditure cuts and increases in charges.  That is regrettable.  If increases in charges are regarded as expenditure cuts they are inclined to blur the need for real elimination of waste in certain areas.  If there is a wasteful programme I do not believe the answer is to put in charges that make <Col N="171" /> a taxpayer finance part of it.  Rather we need to see the full cost of the various programmes and not blur them by charges.  I do not say that charges are not desirable.  In many areas I believe increased charges will not only improve the efficiency of the services, such as those in local authority areas &mdash; because they will have to answer to the person who pays the charge &mdash; but will also increase democracy in relation to those services.  If a person is paying the piper there is a greater chance he will call the tune.  I should not like to see charges brought in under the guise of just another form of cutting spending.  They provide an easy option which I do not think should be used in ensuing years.  In those years there will be a need to shift the emphasis very dramatically from taking more in the form of taxation or in charges from the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal now with the question of public sector pay.  It is important that in this budget the Minister has pointed up for the first time that there is a stark choice between pay and employment not only in the private sector where trade unions and employers now realise that but he has also pointed up that that choice exists in the public sector also.  Pay increases in the public sector must be financed.  In the past we have deferred that, to some extent, by the expedient of borrowing.  But it is important that this year the Minister has laid down quite clearly that public sector pay increases will have to be financed in this, the same year, by effecting expenditure cuts somewhere else.  It is important to bring that home to the public at large at this stage, that pay increases in the public sector do mean either increased taxation or cuts in spending, that they are not costless.</P>
    <P>The whole question of public sector pay, constituting as it does such a large component of our public spending, will have to be tackled as a priority in the coming year.  There is no doubt that the present practice of internal comparisons within the public service, used as the basis for pay claims and arbitrated upon quite separately from national pay agreements, <Col N="172" /> has resulted in dramatic increases in public pay over the last couple of years. It is the system that is, to a very large extent, at fault.  Therefore, it is important that decisions on what the public sector should be paid enter the same forum in which decisions in respect of all sectors, the private included, are taken.  Without such integration of the two sectors there will be the danger that our sectors exposed to external competition will become increasingly uncompetitive because their pay rates will be pushed up by demands from within the public sector based on an antiquated system of bargaining.</P>
    <P>Something must be done in the very near future about the system of pay negotation in the public sector.  The blunt instruments used in the past year or so, such as absolute freezes on special pay awards, or attempts to hold the line for a short period merely put off the evil day because the arbitration agreements are proceeding.  There were recent arbitration agreements deferred but in time they will have to be met.  Until we devise a better system, providing pay negotiations within the public sector which maintain competitiveness within the economy at large, we shall be in serious difficulty on the pay front and will experience serious difficulty in getting the best out of our public sector.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the question of taxation.  I do not think anybody on any side of the House can be happy that the Minister for Finance has had to dig so deeply once again into taxpayers' pockets.  It is especially regrettable at a time when the Government and the public at large recognise the need for dramatic tax reform throughout our taxation system.  The Government's commitment to tax reform is absolutely beyond doubt. It is enshrined in the Joint Programme for Government and is proven also by the record of Coalitions in the past in their having introduced new initiatives and effected radical changes in our taxation code.  In the Coalition's period in office between 1974 and 1977 they introduced for the first time farmer taxation and for the first time also capital taxation.  In their more recent period in Government they <Col N="173" /> introduced radical tax reform by way of tax credits.  Also for the first time they gave teeth to the capital gains tax code by abolishing the tapering relief that had obtained until then.</P>
    <P>Therefore this House should have no doubt about the commitment of this Government to the radical reform of our taxation code.  In this budget, although the message that has come across is one of increases in taxation, we have made a significant start on the necessary path to tax reform.  In this connection the area in which everybody sees the need for action is that of the inequity between the PAYE sector, the self-employed, farmers and others.  There are two reasons the self-employed and others have not made a proper contribution to the tax yield.  One is the way in which their reckonable income is determined.  There they have two advantages, one that they use last year's income as the basis for calculating their tax liability and the other that they have very significant allowances not available to the PAYE earner.  One of the other reasons the self-employed and so on have not made a large contribution is that there is ample evidence that the delay in payment from that sector is dramatic. In the last report of the Revenue Commissioners they gave figures of the ratio of tax remaining due at the end of one, two and four years to the tax that had actually been paid at that stage.  Just to give the House an example of the situation, in the PAYE sector, after one year, the proportion of tax due to that already paid was 1½ per cent, after two years only ½ per cent and, after four years, virtually everything had been paid.  The situation in the self-employed sector is completely different &mdash; after one year there was 70 per cent due as a proportion of the tax that had been paid, after two years a further 50 per cent still remained due and, after four years, 20 per cent due.</P>
    <P>A similar situation prevails in the case of capital gains tax.  Therefore there is a very serious problem occasioned by delay in raising taxation from areas other than the PAYE sector.  This is one area to which the Minister has committed himself to action and in respect of which he <Col N="174" /> has taken immediate action this year.  The report of the Revenue Commissioners also highlights the problem that we have an ineffective collection system.  For example, last year there were enforcement actions taken out for a sum of £350 million from 50,000 taxpayers.  That is a massive sum.  Tax collectors had to take legal action against taxpayers in order to have that money collected.  Indeed, it is that poor method of collection that has caused the delays now being experienced.  The Comptroller and Auditor General himself has drawn attention to that fact.  In 1980 and 1981 a quarter only of the taxation being pursued by the Revenue Commissioners through the legal system, through enforcement actions, was in fact collected.</P>
    <P>The Auditor General commenting on that fact said: &ldquo;They do not represent the full contributions which such enforcement procedures make towards safeguarding the collection of far greater amounts under each tax head which are due on a current basis&rdquo;.  Without the threat of enforcement receipts from current collection would drop.  The Auditor General is highlighting the fact that as a result of poor enforcement procedures not only do we have a delay in the collection of tax but there are many people who are obviously evading.  It is welcome that the Minister has gone a very significant way towards eliminating the problems that have made the contributions from the self-employed sector so small.</P>
    <P>The Minister is committed to increasing the level of penalties in relation to tax evasion.  The Auditor General's report gives us some indication of the problem in that area.  There were very few cases of tax evasion followed up in the year. There were only about 100 cases and the penalty imposed was 33 per cent in addition to the tax which was due.  That is cheap money for someone who has been evading tax.  If you went to the bank and tried to raise the kind of money that had been reneged on by the taxpayer you would be asked by the bank for far more than 33 per cent.  Far from being a real penalty there is almost an incentive for evasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister made important progress <Col N="175" /> in the budget by doing three things &mdash; bringing the self-employed under the same tax year as the PAYE sector; taking effective action to increase penalties and the disincentive to evade even to the extent of publishing the names of those involved in settlement and, thirdly, taking dramatic steps in the area of tax assessments and delays allowed for periods of appeal.  I am happy the Government made significant progress in the area of tax reform.</P>
    <P>We have brought in a property tax. The Minister has penalised the advantage which existed heretofore for people with second homes and large personal borrowings for unproductive uses.  These are significant reforms in the tax code but this budget has not said all that is to be said in the area of tax reform.  It is a start.</P>
    <P>The Minister initiated an investigation of the capital acquisitions tax and taxation of small businesses.  It is in the Joint Programme for Government that tax credits will be investigated.  Another matter we will have to examine is that of payroll taxes.  Over the past few years they have been taking an increasing portion of the taxpayers' pound and they are a direct tax on unemployment.  It is not to be recommended that such taxes become a permanent part of the tax code. The Government's commitment is clear in the area of tax reform.  There is much that needs to be done.  The Commission on Income Taxation Report, which is before the Government, will be examined seriously.  It is regrettable that they presented the package as a single one and more or less built the whole report around the fact that they could not be considered separately.  Piecemeal reform is important in the tax code and there will be a need for gradual reform.  To hope that a single report could be accepted and implemented <i>en bloc</i> is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>It is important that the examination in a systematic way of expenditure proposals both current and capital and the examination of the tax code in order to bring in radical reform is carried on in future years.  The Government should publish a plan for the public sector.  It is important that they know where the <Col N="176" /> Government are going in the area of their spending and tax proposals.  That kind of plan coupled with the important work of the task force as outlined in the Joint Programme for Government designed to deal with the bottlenecks preventing employment growth is the real way to plan.  The attempted planning offered by the previous Government in <i>The Way Forward,</i> mainly to publish grandiose objectives without any policy which would set about achieving these objectives, may be convincing to people who do not read the report, but are convinced by a glossy report shaken in the air.  That is not the way to plan.  This Government in their commitment to reform spending procedures and our tax code and provide a task force to iron out problems in employment and industries is the real way forward and is the proper planning procedure for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is just part of the instalment of budgets we get from month to month.  It is a big instalment when added to the taxes put on the old reliables &mdash; beer, tobacco, motor spirits and so on.  It has been described as disastrous and catastrophic.  I would be the last to disagree with either of these appellations.</P>
      <P>Previous speakers may have their views and present reasonable arguments about a path leading somewhere which the Government's strategy would appear to have convinced them of, but I do not see it as such.  The realities are more stark and cannot be explained away by pointing to the strategy of budgeting in this fashion.  We have these taxes.  Let us be aware that the taxes imposed bear mainly on those who are working and who are increasingly unable to bear the burdens imposed on them.  These taxpayers are getting fewer in number while there is a growing need for taxes.  We must ask how long this state of affairs can continue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been said, and will be said again, that our situation is no different from that prevailing in other countries in Europe and the world generally and that we cannot escape the effects of this worldwide depression.  On the other hand, what are we doing about it?  What reserves have we to call upon?  We must not idle our <Col N="177" /> way through it but must work our way out of our difficulties instead of becoming further bogged down in the mire of the national debt, which is now a massive burden and will be so for many years.</P>
    <P>It is being said that the problem of borrowing for current spending is being tackled and that the spending spree in which we have indulged for many years has now come to an end.  There is a reduction of £91 million in demand for this purpose this year as against last year. When we consider how this reduction is being made, we must ask whether we are satisfied that this is a good tactic.  It has been stated that only one in every three vacancies arising in the public service may be filled in the foreseeable future. By this strategy we will be adding further to the unemployment problem which is already out of hand.</P>
    <P>A massive cut of £330 million has been made in capital spending.  In a very direct way this will add immensely to the numbers unemployed and deny us the benefits which could be provided by so many of the unemployed, particularly in the construction industry.  This industry has been the hardest hit during the past few years and we have come to recognise it as the most important barometer of the well-being of the economy.  When it is down, the economy is down; when it is up, everything is on the up.  Our country is unique in western Europe in that we have a rising population and in these times of depression we have not the old safety valve of emigration to take our surplus labour off the market.  We must find work for our people at home or pay them to be unemployed, which seems to be the strategy of this Government even more than of the previous Government, who, had they remained in office somewhat longer, might have taken the steps necessary to reflate the construction industry.  This is the one industry which is not dependent on outside markets and which is less dependent on imported materials than any other.  Thousands of its workers are on the dole queues and are drawing from the State almost as much as they would get on average in take-home pay if they were constructing our roads, building houses, hospitals, <Col N="178" /> water and sewerage schemes and other projects which are so badly needed.</P>
    <P>Without these things our young people will not be prepared to stay in this country even when the recession is over and they have jobs.  They will not be prepared to stay unless they can be properly housed and enjoy all the essential services.  It seems the height of folly and madness, bad strategy and bad economics that we are paying almost as much to keep people idle as they would earn on the building sites and the roads, providing the infrastructure which will be so badly needed in the future if we are to retain our population. I have been advocating this policy for the past five years.  It is crazy beyond imagining that we are now contemplating not only the continuance of unemployment at the present level but also a massive cut of £330 million in capital expenditure. We are compiling a recipe for putting many more people on the dole queue, to the detriment of our infrastructure.</P>
    <P>It hardly needs to be said that the road system is breaking down and there is no future for it unless there is a massive input of capital immediately.  There has been neglect for at least ten years and we have been penny pinching in the maintenance of even the lesser roads to the point where in certain places we soon will not have any roads at all.  That is supposed to be good economics.  We save on that today even though we may have no road tomorrow.  We save on the building of houses today and in the future we will see people leaving the country to get jobs elsewhere because they have no future here without a roof over their heads.  Instead of giving a little encouragement to all those who would be interested in house building and the construction industry in general there is a massive pull out of capital to this sector of the economy.  This is a dire warning to our people that there is no thought to the future and no thought for young couples getting married and hoping to bring up families.  They will have no prospect of housing, either public or private.  The costs of private housing have escalated to the point where the vast majority of young people have no prospect of ever <Col N="179" /> being home owners.  They will have to depend on public housing schemes which are already so overtaxed that they are a disgrace to this House and to the various Governments who have allowed the situation to develop.</P>
    <P>Diminishing numbers of taxpayers are being asked to pay more so that more people can go on the dole and at the same time we witness the failure to provide all the services which will be needed by our young people.  It will not be through dire necessity that they will emigrate but we will see them leaving because we will not have done enough to provide the essentials such as houses, decent roads and communications, adequate hospitals, schools and services such as water and sewerage.  These are the things we have sacrificed and our young people will not stay long with us once there is somewhere else to find a job.  We are not providing for them.  We are not giving them any hope or prospect that they can get a job, set up home and rear a family.</P>
    <P>On the question of job creation, apart from the construction industry, I accept that there is great difficulty for the State, or the State allied with the private investor, to find outlets for any great investment of capital.  However, far from us heading in the direction of encouraging such investment in these difficult times, it seems that the strategy of the Government is brought about by the pressures of the financial masters abroad, the World Bank and the European Investment Bank.  I can see the hand of those institutions in the strategy adopted by the Government in the budget.  Should we bow the knee to such institutions and at the same time destroy any prospect for the future for our young people?  We should give those institutions the picture as to why we should be aided, particularly in regard to the construction industry by an input that will help us over these difficult years.  We should also explain that such help would provide much needed services which are a prerequisite to any recovery we may hope to see in the years ahead.  We should be leaning in that direction instead of saying, we will do as you bid us, we will cut down our capital <Col N="180" /> and current borrowing, put our people out of employment, depress our people and leave them no hope for the future so as to conform to the pressures.</P>
    <P>I do not think the decisions by the Government represent the collective wisdom of the Cabinet.  I do not believe the Minister for Finance devised the strategy that emerges in various colours in the budget or as depicted by those who have contributed from the Government benches.  The Government, and the Minister for Finance, instead of bowing the knee should paint a picture of what is going to happen to us.  They should ask the institutions I have mentioned to help us by temporary measures to help ourselves to put our people to work.  We should be given help to do what has to be done today because if that does not happen those schemes will cost three times as much tomorrow.  We should be aided in our efforts to reduce unemployment, give our economy a bit of a revival and our young population hope for the future.  We should be painting that picture in addition to the one they have got about how the books do or do not balance, how much we owe and how much we are over-borrowing for capital and current spending.</P>
    <P>The real situation is that the numbers unemployed are increasing.  It must be remembered that it is not like the days when the cure for a recession such as this was to put the workers on the streets and let them starve.  If they are put on the street now between all the various stages of bureaucracy it costs almost as much net to keep them on the dole as it would cost to put them into useful and gainful employment.  Gone are the days of the twenties and thirties when that was the cure and when no other cure was thought of.  We have reached the stage when we think of the folly of putting people out and letting them starve until the recession is over but we have not got around to considering that our unique position in Europe is one we should be working on day and night.  We should be trying to put our people to work providing the things we need which other countries with their declining populations have a surplus of. They have too many houses and roads <Col N="181" /> that will be good for the next 20 or 30 years.  Those countries have services that are more than adequate for their needs. Their schools and hospitals are too large but the reverse is the situation here. Therefore, we should not trot out the usual thought that because all others are helpless in this situation we must also be helpless.  The situations are different but the Government do not seem to think so and they are not acting in that way.  We are going the way of the others.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the other countries I am referring to, whether it is our nearest neighbour or those further afield in Europe, have the reserves to live through such a depression and come back.  We do not and that is another reason why we should not stand idly by watching our people being shoved into unemployment while there is necessary work to be done.  For that we do not have to sell a product abroad and the least possible amount of materials and components would have to be imported.  We can do so much of that from within ourselves. It would make a vast difference and would result in up to 60,000 people being brought back, directly or indirectly, into employment over the next 12 to 18 months.  They could be engaged in building houses and roads and all the things we must provide if we are to have any future.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage the Government should reconsider the idea of cutting the capital budget by £300 million and think in terms of directing it into the construction industry which is breathlessly waiting for such an injection of capital.  There are many schemes awaiting sanction and we do not have to spend months planning them.  When the Government came to office we were told about a £500 million development fund.  Those of us who knew the score felt it was a bit of a laugh.  Why set up new paraphernalia when we have adequate avenues for that sort of money? It could be put through the various construction projects that are held up for lack of money.  Those schemes could commence if local authorities are given the go ahead.  They have plans prepared and tenders accepted but no money to carry out the work.  That $500 million <Col N="182" /> development fund would add unnecessarily to the bureaucracy which is costing us so much.  There are ample ways of spending that money on top of what was spent last year.  To cut the public capital programme by almost £300 million is disastrous. Before the end of 1983 the Government, and the House, will see that bad as things have been in recent years and constricting as our economy has been it will not compare with what will emerge.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with what can only be regarded as the tragedy of the Border counties in 1983.  Tobacco, liquor and petrol prices here have so far outdistanced the prices on the other side of that unnatural divide that what is happening daily will be multiplied as the weeks go on.  Weekly or daily everyone within 30 or 40 miles of the Border will cross the Border to fill up their cars with petrol.  They will buy a few bottles at a cost 50 per cent less than the cost here. They will bring their wives with them and they will buy everything they need for the following week in the supermarkets immediately on the other side of the Border.</P>
    <P>Think about our tourist industry that was.  Think about the disincentive these prices have been to tourists even at their lower levels over the past few years. Think about the new impact of these increased prices on potential tourists from the Six Counties and from the North of England and Scotland.  The tourists just will not come.  They are not so flush that they can pay up to 80p per gallon more here in comparatively real terms than in the Six Counties.  Think of the cost to people who come here for a weekend or for their holidays.  Think of the cost of drink in our public houses, lounges and hotels.  Think in terms of the hotel industry and the catering industry which attracted a large number of tourists in the past.  We had a lucrative and employment-giving trade.  People from the northern side of the Border found it more pleasant and even perhaps more safe to hold their functions, annual dances and weddings south of the Border. Now the trade is going the other way <Col N="183" /> despite the fact that there may be more danger in holding your function north of the Border.</P>
    <P>We have gone on blindly ignoring the fact that this country is partitioned.  Ours is a unique situation.  We are not free to do what we might do if we were a total island separated by the sea from everywhere else.  We cannot afford to ignore price levels when we are talking about taxes on petrol, tobacco and liquor. Allied to the attractions of our country, the catering industry provided us with an industry which gave a considerable amount of employment.  If these increased taxes and differentials continue, and if they should be increased by any action on the part of the UK Government with an election approaching, in 12 months' time there will not be a business inside a band of 30 miles on the Border from Louth to the north of Donegal.  It is as bad as that, but the Government do not seem to accept that.  They do not seem to be aware of it.</P>
    <P>They told the hotel trade that the increase in VAT from 18 per cent to 23 per cent will not apply to the hotel and catering industry before 31 December of this year.  Much good that will do them. They will not have much to tax if the differentials are maintained by Government action in imposing crazy taxes without having regard to the fact of Partition. We cannot ignore comparative prices on the two sides of the Border.</P>
    <P>As if the building and construction industry was not getting enough of a hammering we have the residence tax.  This has been mooted for some time.  There are people in the Labour Party who appreciate the damage and dangers to the construction industry which are inherent in the present situation.  It looks as if this residence tax is intended to placate the Labour Party because of some of the other things the Government have in the budget which no Labour Party worthy of the name would accept.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are now in for a pound or for a shilling and they cannot get out no matter what Fine Gael do to them.  The Labour Party did not realise that when they helped Fine Gael to form a Coalition.  In the present dire circumstances, <Col N="184" /> once the Labour Party were in, Fine Gael could do as they wished.  If the Labour Party leave the Coalition in the foreseeable future, they will be annihilated. The Labour Party seem to be giving an <i>imprimatur</i> to Fine Gael while, at the same time, trying to suggest that in the ordinary way they would have a very vocal influence.  If the Labour Party were not in the Coalition Government they would be screaming this House down about the things I am talking about and the things other critics of the budget have been screaming about.  Unfortunately the Labour Party are silenced by their marriage to Fine Gael in this Coalition.</P>
    <P>The residence tax is another blow to the house building industry.  It is another blow at the provision of houses for our people.  People may say: &ldquo;If they are worth over £65,000, what the hell?&rdquo; We have come a long way from the time when all sides of this House were agreed that every encouragement should be given towards the provision of additional houses small or big.  We are told the Government are now hitting at the higher priced houses.  Indeed we are not even sure of that.  It may be that they were built as low cost houses and now their market value is beyond anything like their replacement cost.  If that is so, it is even worse than it appears at first.  In taxing any residence we are taxing the right of our people to have roofs over their heads in a society which is drastically short of housing and now provides less housing due to the cuts in the public capital expenditure outlined in this budget.</P>
    <P>There are some things we do not expect any more.  On the question of income tax the Government may say: &ldquo;We increased it for the big fellows at the top only.  The 60 per cent band is going up to 65 per cent.&rdquo; We have had various crusades and protests on various aspects of income tax such as PAYE or the married or single allowance.  The one thing that has gone down over the years is the dependant's allowance.  I do not know how any Government could put those together and justify them.  The harder the times the more should there be an increase in the dependant's allowance, particularly <Col N="185" /> for families where the indirect taxation raked off from the breadwinners is immense.  It is multiplied by the number of dependants in the household.  No thought is given to that.  These allowances have been coming down as compared with every other item you can think of and the general intention is to wipe them out altogether.  It is all very well to talk about increases in allowances but the one that has been neglected by several Governments of all parties of different political hues is the dependant allowances, which have been whittled away to such an extent that they do not exist.  I wonder if there is any possibility that the Minister and the Government in their dilemma of balancing the budget might give a thought even at this late stage to the plight of families and to the lack of proper tax free allowances for them. Indirect taxes, including VAT, are costing the breadwinner more all the time, but this fact is ignored and they are forced to pay more direct tax also.</P>
    <P>Farming has also got a jolt.  There will be people who will say that is no harm, but I am not one of them.  I am not going to elaborate on the subject except to say that any diminution of input into the farming industry at present, in so far as farm prices are concerned, on top of a decreasing price structure which shows the farming community as being at least 16 per cent in real terms worse off today than they were a couple of years ago, cannot be justified.  From 1978, in real terms, they are something like 26½ per cent worse off in their earnings than is projected this year.  Anything that further adds to this by way of Government tax, taking away incentives or cessation of schemes, will have far worse consequences for the economy than the amount of money that the cessation of these things will save.  Even at this stage there should be second thoughts about retrenchments made by the Minister in trying to balance the books.  It should be remembered that when you are knocking the farming community you are knocking our greatest industry and that anything that hurts it, even if it seems to be a question of the farmer carrying his little bit as well as the rest of the population, <Col N="186" /> hurts our greatest industry at a time of recession.  That is a very dangerous policy and, on reflection, the game might not be worth the candle.  It should be remembered that farmers' incomes have been declining since 1978.</P>
    <P>There is also reintroduction of rates, although they are called service charges. I take my hat off to the Government for the clever way they are about to apply these by saying to the local authorities that they want £65 million and it will be for the local authorities, by utilisation of the powers given to them by the Government, to make the choice as to how it is going to be collected.  It is a very neat ploy and may even convince some of the Government's most rabid supporters that this measure is restoring power to local authorities.  I would love to hear the reaction of other Deputies when local authorities apply £65 million on their ratepayers.</P>
    <P>One could go on harping and cribbing about this budget but I will finish by asking the Government to look at the construction industry.  We need this industry more than any other since it is one that produces the goods which do not need an export market.  It utilises materials which mainly do not have to be imported and, therefore, do not seriously affect our balance of payments.  It is an industry in respect of which we have between 50,000 and 60,000 idle hands on our dole queues.  They are costing, on average, as much as their net take home wages would cost if they were working. There must be something wrong when we do not employ these workers to build houses and provide what people are crying for.  The building of houses has seriously run down and is far short of our needs.  Our roads are breaking up and services generally are inadequate.</P>
    <P>It is wrong to sit around moaning and crying about our plight and blaming the great big world outside for our ills when we cannot do anything for ourselves. Surely that is not the way for a growing population, growing faster than any other country in Europe, to act?  Are we going to say to our people in the Six Counties &ldquo;here is a land which is yours and ours in which there is a future for all of us&rdquo;? <Col N="187" /> Judging from the taxes that have been imposed we do not know that the Border exists and we do not seem to be concerned what they think about us, even if we are aware they are there.  We could be a shining light, not only to Europe but to the world, if we could, in the midst of world depression, raise ourselves up, even at this late stage, by building the things we need with the hands that are idle today and put life into our economy and into our people again.  The effect of 40,000 or 50,000 people active in the construction industry would be so immense in a year or two that the entire economy would be unrecognisable from the dire straits in which it is today.  This is the most important aspect that the Government should reconsider and, far from cutting the capital programme and the construction industry to the bone as they are now proposing, they should be adding about £400 million or £500 million instead of a cut of £330 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Labour Deputy I am surprised at some of the criticism coming from the Opposition about the budget because it was agreed by the Opposition that if they were returned to power they would cut the deficit to £750 million.  This Government have only cut the deficit to £897 million.  If the Opposition had been returned to power I believe they would also have cut the deficit to £750 million.  They could only have done this by removing the £100 million on food subsidies which was fought for so hard by the Labour Party.  That would put the price of a loaf of bread up by 15½ pence, a pound of butter by 32.9 pence and a pint of milk by 4½ pence.  I am proud that Labour are in Government and that the £100 million subsidy was held for the betterment of the poor and working classes.</P>
      <P>It also grieves me to hear Opposition Deputies shouting about taxation.  If they cut the budget deficit to £750 million they would have had to find another £147 million in taxation.  I am surprised at Fianna Fáil spokesmen saying they are disappointed that the tax free allowance for workers is not increased this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="188" /> As a Labour Deputy, I am also disappointed; but I will make the following point.  In 1960-61 the allowance for a single man was £234 and the allowance for a married man was £394.  Let us not forget that this was the situation in what Fianna Fáil refer to as the glowing 1960s when everything was going right.  Yet, for eight consecutive years they failed to increase the tax-free allowance for the working class.  Farmers did not pay tax in those years and the PAYE sector carried the burden of taxation.  This happened during the years Fianna Fáil were in Government and when the Leader of the Opposition was Minister for Finance.  It was not until 1969-70 that the allowance for a single man was increased to £249 and the allowance for a married man to £424.  Now we know the sincerity of the Opposition with regard to PAYE tax reform.  The glowing 1960s prove what some of their prominent spokesmen did when in Government.</P>
    <P>I was amazed to see Deputy Woods on television recently claim that his Government gave a 25 per cent increase to social welfare recipients in April 1982.  I would like to remind the Deputy that it was Deputy Eileen Desmond, a Labour Minister for Social Welfare, who gave that increase.  When one considers the 12 per cent increase in June 1983 in addition to the 25 per cent, one sees that over two years social welfare recipients will get an increase of 40 per cent in benefits.  That is much more than any other section of the community is getting.</P>
    <P>There were cries from the Opposition about the 5 per cent VAT charges.  I did not agree with this charge on fuel as possibly it will affect the old age pensioners, but I would remind the House that it was not until the period 1973-77, when a previous Coalition Government were in power, that the age limit for old age pensions was reduced from 70 years to 66 years.  If that had not been done by the Fine Gael and Labour Government there would be 40,000 fewer old age pensioners. The Fianna Fáil manifesto of 1977 has been the cause of all the trouble and has destroyed our economy.  This is despite all the give-aways in that budget such as no car tax and rates off houses. <Col N="189" /> However, Fianna Fáil did not see their way to reduce the age limit for an old age pension from 66 years to 65 years.  I would also mention that in the 1973-77 period we introduced the allowance for single women.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision in the budget for the family income supplement for the lower income group.  This is the first occasion money has been provided for this section.  I was a clerical officer in a local authority for 20 years.  In my constituency in Meath there are hundreds of people who are earning only £100 per week gross and an increase in the tax-free allowance is useless to them.  I am glad that this family income supplement for the lower income group is being provided in this budget.  Such people are not eligible for income tax.  I regard what has been done in this area as Labour Party policy.  The agency to combat poverty has been reactivated and money has been provided for housing the elderly.</P>
    <P>The Government have made increased allocations of expenditure in key areas. For example, a sum of £31.5 million is being provided for local authorities.  I worked in a local authority for 20 years and it amazes me to hear the Opposition talking about the financing of local authorities.  The 1977 Fianna Fáil manifesto, which removed rates completely-from houses, was the downfall of local authorities.  From 1977 to 1981, when Fianna Fáil were in office, local authorities were given an average increase of 11 per cent but their costs were three times that amount.  That is the reason local authorities are starved of finance.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers referred to the condition of our roads.  I should like to put a question to Members of the Opposition. Do they remember the lovely plan they printed which they called the road development plan for the 1980s?  I remember when it was presented to the press by a Fianna Fáil Minister but somebody must have been at its funeral the next day because I have not heard of it since.  Fianna Fáil promised to spend £1,000 million on the roads in the 1980s. They presented their plans in a lovely blue document &mdash; I was surprised to see the Opposition picking blue as the colour. <Col N="190" /> That document was presented to the press but not one penny was spent.</P>
    <P>The PAYE worker cannot continue to carry the burden.  This Government have given a commitment about tax evasion and the Labour Party will see that that commitment is followed through.  I will give a guarantee to the PAYE workers who voted for me that those who are evading tax will be caught, prosecuted and made pay their fair share.  Generally people do not mind paying tax if the system is fair and if the money is put to proper use.  The problem is that when PAYE and PRSI contributions are taken together there is little incentive to work.</P>
    <P>This is our first budget.  We have a programme of work for 1982 to 1987 and I hope that during the five years there will be some incentive in the tax system, something on the lines of a scheme used by private companies.  For instance, in one company I know if workers do not miss any day at work in a year they are given a bonus of £300; if they miss one day at work they are given £270 and so on.  If they miss ten days at work they do not get any bonus.  In order to encourage people not to miss work, the Revenue Commissioners could bring forward a somewhat similar scheme, where if a person did not miss any day at work he or she would get a tax bonus at Christmas. Even if it were only £200 or £300 at the beginning it would be an incentive to the PAYE worker.</P>
    <P>I am glad that some progress has been made in widening the scope of other taxes aimed at those who can afford to pay. The Opposition talk about property tax and tax on farmers and this leads me to believe that if Fianna Fáil were in Government the PAYE sector would suffer because there would not be a property tax or a tax on farmers.  The 1960s prove that.  People must be honest.  The economy is in a mess.  People were spending more than they were earning and we were borrowing too much abroad.  In Government the Labour Party must accept the responsibility to tackle some of the problems.  I welcome the increase in the levy on banks.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party are deeply concerned about the number of people, <Col N="191" /> particularly young people, out of work. I cannot understand the financing of Government bodies and this is something I hope to take up in my party.  When I was working in a local authority we had men working for wages of £101 gross, which meant a take-home pay of £76 per week, and we would have to tell those men who wanted to work in the month of September that they would be let go, yet they could go to the Department of Social Welfare, sign for unemployment benefit and get as much on social welfare as they did while working.  Therefore, I hope that this Government will look at the Department of Social Welfare's budget.  If extra money is to be voted for local authorities in respect of young people, then labourers could be taken on and given work instead.  Would it not make more sense to give this money to local authorities to enable them to employ men who want to work rather than pay social welfare benefits to them to be idle?</P>
    <P>Some Opposition members have called on the Labour Party to leave Coalition.  These people criticised the change in the school transport scheme.  I remind the Opposition that it was they who compiled the Book of Estimates but they left it to us when we came into office because they had not the guts to take the decision.  The electorate were well aware of the problems facing this country when they voted in the November election, and one reason the Opposition were not returned to office was that the people identified the leader as a man who came publicly on television when he was elected Taoiseach, identified the problems of this nation and then did damn all about them.  In five years' time the present Government will be judged and if by then they have not faced up to the problem they will be dumped too.  We will have the guts to face up to them and in five years' time things will be reasonably right.</P>
    <P>I make a final plea regarding the financing of local authorities.  I have mentioned the programmes published by Fianna faíl and their 1977 manifesto destroying the finances of the local <Col N="192" /> authorities.  I have worked with a local authority and I know that at the moment the local authorities are in a bad way for finance, particularly for roads.  I was ruled out of order here by the Ceann Comhairle some time ago when I got up to ask a question about the local authorities, but I am taking this opportunity in my budget speech to put across the problem seen by the public in the financing of them.  Each year the Department of the Environment give in excess of £2 million to Meath County Council to repair and improve national primary routes.  A national primary route would be the Dublin-Galway road or the Dublin-Belfast road.  We are given money to repair roads which structurally are in good repair while main roads and county roads are broken up completely.  I am a public representative and the public come to me to say: &ldquo;Why are you repairing a road which is in quite good repair while main and county roads are falling apart?&rdquo; At this time of high unemployment moneys given to local authorities should be left at the discretion of the local authorities to spend, subject to proper technical advice from their engineers.  Another reason why that should be done is that two-thirds of the money spent on by-passes on national primary routes and on major road-widening is being paid in compensation. If that money immediately went to the repair of main and national secondary roads and possibly some county roads we could create employment.</P>
    <P>I want to speak about the Youth Employment Agency and environmental schemes which are dealt with by local authorities.  I never could see the reason why money is given to local authorities for the purpose of giving work to young people, although I welcome jobs for young people.  Why give money in the month of August to county councils to enable them to take on 40 or 50 young people for four months' work and then sack them?  Why not decide to give the local authorities enough money to keep 15 men working all the time in permanent jobs?  They could be put to work on the roads which are so badly in need of repair.</P>
    <P>I intend to finish now because another <Col N="193" /> Government speaker wishes to come in behind me.  When I was standing for the last election I knew that our economy was in a mess, that too much money was borrowed from abroad and that since 1977 votes were bought here.  Money was thrown around like confetti.  Knock Airport is one example.  Those days are over. We are in the EEC competing with other EEC countries for sales.  Foreigners owe the Irish people nothing.  The sooner the Irish realise that we must work harder the better, and that concerns workers, management, the farmers, everyone.  We must increase our output otherwise it is Doomsday for us.  There is nothing for nothing for anybody, and the sooner the public realise that the better.  We must put our heads together and as Irishmen we will do that because when we were in trouble in the past we did so.  If we work harder and pull together we will pull out of this recession, and we have a good Government now to lead us out of it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>When I first read this Budget Statement I could not help comparing it with an essay written by a leaving certificate business organisation student. I had the feeling on reading it that such a student could probably do a better job given the guidelines.  The Department of Education advise their business organisation students that when answering a leaving certificate question each point should be expanded upon and developed to its logical conclusion, that answers must not be given just as stabs in the dark.  However, I find on going through this statement that it contains many stabs in the dark.  The Minister for Finance clearly was not sure of his ground in preparing his Budget Statement.  For example, it contains many phrases such as, &ldquo;examining the situation&rdquo;, &ldquo;changes must be made&rdquo;, &ldquo;I will welcome the views of interested parties&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Budget Statement is full of ambiguities. It has the hallmark of budgetary decisions hastily arrived at, rather than properly planned and researched and a clear course of action decided upon.  The decisions contained in this document are arrived at to satisfy two ideologies which are directly opposed.  Reading between <Col N="194" /> the lines one can see clearly deep divisions within the Government with regard to their budgetary strategy.  Clearly a serious effort had to be made by the Government to try to achieve a balance between the policies of the two parties who make up that Government.  In trying to achieve that balance we have ended up with a budget which will be a cause of disaster for our economy for the remainder of this year and for 1984.</P>
    <P>The most important target undoubtedly which this or any budget set out to achieve was to bring about financial rectitude. This Budget is preoccupied with financial rectitude, but at the same time I am not satisfied that it goes far enough in this regard.  Unfortunately the achievement of a proper fiscal policy is of no value unless it brings about economic growth, unless it can in time bring about an improvement in our GNP, unless it can improve our economic activities.  The real disaster of this budget is that, rather than achieve those aims, it will have the effect of depressing seriously the Irish economy and of causing a tailspin towards the end of this year and early next year.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment the Minister on some aspects of the budget.  I welcome the family income supplement, the removal of VAT in part from imports, the reform of our financial procedures and the reform proposed in regard to the public sector.  However, the real problems which face our economy at the moment are completely and totally left aside.  Let me quote from the introduction to the Fine Gael-Labour <i>Programme for Government.</i> That introduction states at the first line:</P>
    <P>The unemployment situation, with 170,000 unemployed, 50,000 of them under 25 years of age, and the state of the public finances facing a new Government taking office at the end of 1982, are alarming.</P>
    <P>Both require firm and decisive action by such a Government.  The dual task of halting and reversing the growth of unemployment while phasing out the current budget deficit poses a greater challenge than any Irish Government <Col N="195" /> has faced domestically since the early years of the State.</P>
    <P>I find, in reading through this document, no mention of the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; until I get to the conclusion I find that in the Budget Statement the Minister for Finance said:</P>
    <P>In our Programme for Government we are committed to achieving economic growth and higher employment, while exercising a disciplined financial management and placing special emphasis on competitiveness.  This is a difficult target, but the measures which I will introduce today are a first step on the road to genuine progress.</P>
    <P>I cannot find any measures to achieve economic growth and higher employment in the budget.  That is the reason why I said that each point should be expanded to its logical conclusion.  We find that many important points are made in the budget but they are taken no further.</P>
    <P>The only reference in the budget to improving the employment situation is in relation to the National Development Corporation.  I find, instead of the £20 million provided in the abortive budget of January 1982 this is being cut to £7 million this year.  I hope the Fine Gael Party will get their way and that this is the trend which will continue in regard to the National Development Corporation because we might as well put the money down the drain as spend it on the National Development Corporation.  The Minister for Finance agrees, because in the Budget Statement he describes State-sponsored bodies as follows:</P>
    <P>In general the financial performance of such bodies has not been good and in some cases has deteriorated markedly in recent years despite major investment.</P>
    <P>My view of the National Development Corporation is that it is designed to pump more money into the State sector.  I implore the Fine Gael Party to ensure that the trend that has started, where the money allocated has been reduced from <Col N="196" /> £20 million last year to £7 million this year, continues and that we have an end to this ridiculous suggestion of yet another agency which we do not need. We have been famous for identifying problems, publishing reports and setting up agencies but we tend to leave those reports on the shelves.  It is about time we took some of them down, examined them and took the action that is required in so many areas.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, speaking in Galway last Friday night to the Chamber of Commerce, made what I consider to be a very good speech.  He referred to the requirements for building up employment and encouraging investment in the country. Unfortunately his speech flew in the face of this document.  I felt, while he was speaking, that it was a pity he did not put some of his ideas, in relation to the stimulus that is needed in private enterprise, into creating growth and getting us out of the economic problems we are now in.  It should have been stated in the budget that employment can be created given a climate conducive to investment, where hard work, initiative and enterprise are properly rewarded.  Unfortunately the budget does nothing to bring about this climate.  It should put the emphasis on improved productivity, good marketing, more competitiveness, more export-orientation, product research and development. Companies prepared to improve their performance in those crucial areas should be given tax incentives and other financial incentives necessary to do so.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach looked for some constructive suggestions as to what the alternatives were to the proposals in the budget.  I am offering that suggestion as one which would have a great impact on the serious problems we have at the moment and which I believe would not cost a very large sum of money.  There are others.  For instance, employees in the production sector have no incentive to work harder and do better at present because of the tax system under which they operate.  In the PAYE system if a person does overtime and increases his, productivity his tax free allowance is liable to go up and instead of paying 35 per cent on his earnings he will have to pay <Col N="197" /> 45 per cent.  This is a regressive form of taxation and provides a disincentive to greater output and greater effort.</P>
    <P>That is a clear suggestion which should have been included in the budget in order to stimulate greater effort in the productive sector.  Sadly, such a suggestion is totally irrelevant as far as the budget is concerned.  With regard to the employer the incentive is to employ less people rather than more because the cost of employing people is increasing all the time.  The Minister for Finance received many suggestions from various industrial groups on how he could improve the situation in this regard.  I will make another constructive suggestion.  In relation to the traditional industries, for example the apparel industry, rather than tax the company by having them pay the employees' contributions for PRSI, which is a cost on production and which, therefore, must be added to the selling price of the goods produced by that company, the Minister should tax companies on their profits instead of forcing them to pay PAYE and thereby making them less competitive and less export-orientated.  This kind of initiative is totally lacking in the budget.</P>
    <P>In regard to employment, the Government must have a serious re-think.  With regard to the gaps that are missing in this connection from the budget I urge the Taoiseach and his Cabinet to have anther look and see if they can fill them.  As far as the Government's income policy is concerned there is nothing in the Budget Statement about it.  If the Government are proposing that there should be a pay freeze in the public sector they should come out and say so.  I would fully agree with them if they decided to take that courageous decision which must be implemented in the current economic climate. They have failed to spell out what their policy is in this regard.  It is of crucial importance that this should be done so that the country will be given leadership rather than the Government waiting for somebody else to make the moves.</P>
    <P>With regard to our problem in relation to foreign borrowing the budget has attempted to solve this.  While we are all concerned about the level of foreign borrowing and while we are all anxious to <Col N="198" /> see as little as possible of foreign borrowing, the important point is that money borrowed should be utilised properly.  I support the Government in their efforts to reduce the amount of money which we require to borrow from abroad.  However, I am very disappointed at their pathetic effort to do something in the budget about foreign borrowing.  After spending some time informing us of the need to reduce our foreign borrowing requirements the Government come up with what to me is a very silly suggestion where they are making improvements in the Post Office savings scheme, the idea being that if we can encourage people to save more we can reduce our dependence on foreign borrowing.  That kind of conclusion, having stated that serious problem, is another indication of how far removed the budget is from the serious difficulties that face our economy.</P>
    <P>I suggest that one of the ways in which we can improve our situation in this regard is by expanding our service industry. The Government should have included in the budget the extension to the service industry of export tax concessions which are available on profits to manufacturing industries who export.  I am thinking particularly of such service industries as international re-insurance and international banking and finance. By way of indication of the kind of potential in this area, 0.1 of 1 per cent of worldwide premium income in re-insurance would equal our balance of payments deficit.  If we create the right climate we can improve our position with regard to the amount of service industry located here.  The kind of benefit that can be gained from that is set out clearly by way of the statement in the budget that foreign currency appreciation added £340 million to the Exchequer's total foreign debt during 1972.  If we can attract service industry to this country, especially of the type to which I have referred, I am satisfied that we can attract also very large sums of money and that this would have a very good effect in terms of our foreign borrowing requirement.  If places like the Isle of Man and Bermuda can do it there is no reason, given the will, that we cannot do it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="199" /> I turn now to the question of tax equity, a concept to which the Minister devoted some pious platitudes in his Budget Statement. The Minister tells us that he intends providing for jail sentences for people who either avoid or evade tax. One can imagine the smiles on the faces of the tax evaders on hearing that announcement when they know well that we have not the jail accommodation in which to put the real criminals, let alone the tax evaders.  Even if we had the accommodation I doubt if we have the legislation to do so.  Therefore, the Minister's announcement in this regard is bordering on the extreme.</P>
    <P>Despite the Government's expression of anxiety in regard to having an equitable tax system, the fact of this budget is that £300 million extra will have to be paid by the PAYE worker.  He is the one who must bear the brunt of tax revenue in terms of the 1 per cent levy and of the increases in VAT while at the same time there are people who are not making any contribution.  The budget contains no evidence of any effort to ensure that those people make a contribution.  The Minister for Finance need not go far from his home in Kildare to find people right across the spectrum who either pay no tax, or who avoid tax on a very large scale.  If he had watched the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on Friday last he would have heard spelled out clearly by a number of people the options available to him to collect the tax that is being evaded.  Unfortunately, he has chosen to ignore that task which, though difficult, can be done.  Instead he put forward the rather silly suggestion about jailing evaders.</P>
    <P>With the exception of the 27p increase in VAT, I am not critical of the VAT increases because I recognise that the tax must be collected.  However, one aspect of the the VAT increases that I am especially critical of relates to the increase from 3 to 5 per cent relative to the building industry.  The least expensive house that one can buy today, at least in Galway, costs about £30,000.  The increase in VAT in this respect means that for a young couple buying a house at that price <Col N="200" /> there will be an increase of £600.  This increase of almost 50 per cent in respect of what is the most vulnerable industry signals the death knell of many building firms and of many jobs in the construction industry.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this backdoor method of collecting further finance from a construction industry which is already on its knees.</P>
    <P>There is a section in the budget that deals with the question of duty-free goods and of smuggling.  Again, as in the case of tax evasion and avoidance, there is very little action indicated in this respect despite the Minister devoting two pages of his statement to the matter.  All he does is to make a big deal of reducing the allowances for visitors to the country from 1½ litres to 1 litre of spirits and from 300 to 200 cigarettes.  The Minister went on to say that the Government will give urgent attention to combating the problem of smuggling and that he will be glad to receive any proposals on the matter. I find it difficult to accept that any Minister would include that sort of statement in a budget document at this time when we can read in the papers of lorryloads of spirits being smuggled in from Northern Ireland.  The Minister has received proposals in regard to smuggling from many interested groups.  To remind him of one, he received a submission in January from the Wines and Spirits Association of Ireland who also submitted a similar proposal to his predecessor in March last and to the Minister before him last January 12 months.  In their submission the association state that after considerable discussion they confirm that the quantity of cases of smuggled spirits is in the region of 100,000 cases per year.  They submit that that represents approximately £8.3 million by way of lost revenue to the State apart from the VAT and other taxes that would apply to the sales of that quantity of spirits.  They submit that the VAT alone would be of the order of £2.07 million.  That is an indication of the degree of smuggling in one respect alone.  Despite this the Minister has the audacity to say that he will be glad to receive proposals from the various trading <Col N="201" /> groups as to how the serious problem of smuggling might be dealt with.  This is another example of his failure to deal with the problems facing the country. Another example was the Minister's failure to pick up an extra £8.3 million from the Wine and Spirits Association because he did not take the required action to stop the smuggling which is going on.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa moved that leave be given to introduce the Bill and the motion has been opposed by the Government.  In accordance with Standing Order 88 (4), the debate has been adjourned until today, being the next day on which Private Members' Business is to be taken.  I now call on the Deputy nominated to make a short explanatory statement confined to five minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say how short five minutes is to deal with such an important question as divorce.  It is fairly clear to most Deputies that there is a growing need for divorce legislation in this State.  There is a growing body of statistics indicating that marital breakdown <Col N="202" /> is on the increase.  It does no credit to this House if we continue to ignore this problem.  Marital breakdown is a fact of life and the ban on divorce does nothing to protect family life.  It simply aggravates the distress of those who find themselves in this situation &mdash; the mother, father and children of the marriage.</P>
      <P>In accepting this Bill the House would not be committing itself to any precise form of divorce legislation.  It would simply enable the House to get down to discussing what type of divorce is required and which would best suit the conditions in this State.  The 1967 all-party committee recommended that the constitutional ban on divorce should be removed.  For that reason alone, it is pointless referring this aspect of the problem to an all-party committee.  If the House agrees that this Bill should proceed to the next stage, it would enable Deputies to express their views on this very important topic and to say precisely what kind of divorce legislation is needed.</P>
      <P>In the brief time available to me I would like to mention a number of anomalies that exist under the present situation. Irish people domiciled abroad who get divorces abroad, have those divorces recognised in this State and if they remarry in this State their marriages are recognised as legal.  On the other hand there are, I believe, approximately 3,000 marriages in this State which have been annulled by the Roman Catholic Church and when the people involved in this type of situation remarry they are considered by law to be living in a bigamous marriage. On the other hand, the Revenue Commissioners recognise as legitimate the claim by persons involved in a so-called bigamous situation and recognise them as man and wife for the purpose of tax allowances and so on.  Clearly that is a very unsatisfactory situation.</P>
      <P>Because of a lack of a clear position on this question we have desertions which are running into thousands.  There are 15,000 applications for desertion allowances, mostly from women because of the anomaly in the social welfare code and there are 6,000 in receipt of the deserted wife's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="203" /> It is pointless for us to continue to ignore a problem that exists.  In view of the fact that many Deputies from all parties have indicated that they consider this matter should be dealt with, I appeal to the parties to allow a free vote tonight.  I appeal particularly to the Labour Party who in their recent election manifesto &ldquo;called for family law reform including civil divorce for marriages irretrievably broken down&rdquo;.  Apart from the Labour Party I appeal to all Deputies to allow this Bill to proceed.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I hope Deputies will consider this Bill in the light of the great human suffering of all concerned in marriages that have broken down.  I appeal to everyone to take the position that we can no longer bury our heads in the sand. We must recognise that this problem exists, and if this House is to have any relevance we must sit down and tackle it.</P>

      <P>The Government are opposing the granting of leave to introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>The Dáil will be aware that the Programme for Government provides for the setting up of an all-party Oireachtas committee which will examine and make recommendations on the problems of the protection of marriage under modern conditions and of marriage breakdown and on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required.  The committee's deliberations must necessarily include consideration of the constitutional prohibition on divorce, and the Taoiseach already made this abundantly clear to the Dáil on 26 January 1983 in reply to a parliamentary question from Deputy De Rossa.</P>
      <P>I believe that there is a common concern among Deputies with the increasing incidence of marital breakdown and the overwhelming burden of distress and human misery it causes.  It is, however, clear that no political consensus has yet emerged on how best to deal with the problem in a way which properly balances the interests of individuals, both adults and children, with the interest of society as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="204" /> Marriages break down &mdash; and some of them break down irretrievably.  This is a sad fact of life, and the main purpose of the all-party committee will be to consider how best the State can support marriage and the family, which all of us, in the words of the Constitution, recognise as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of society.  To the extent that we can identify how the resources of the State should be mobilised in support of marriage and the family, this will be our primary aim.  Without anticipating the findings of the committee anyone concerned with the problem will certainly be aware of the need for greater emphasis on marriage counselling &mdash; and this is an area where State support might be improved.</P>
    <P>I hope it will be possible for the committee to arrive at a consensus as to how the marriage laws should be reformed in present-day circumstances.  The issues involved are very important to the type of society in which we live and we will have to consider them openly and honestly.</P>
    <P>The proposed terms of reference of the committee are at present being drawn up, and the Taoiseach has expressed the hope that it will be possible to get all-party agreement in this regard.  I believe it is essential that Deputies on all sides come together to see how best we should deal with the problem of marriage breakdown. No party can claim a moral prerogative which enables them to ignore this issue &mdash; the people who elect us are entitled to expect that we would at least have the courage to look at the contemporary difficulties of society.</P>

      <P>All Members will recognise the significance of this motion because of their contacts with their constituents. The significance will be far more evident to rural Deputies than to those in urban areas but the latter will be very well aware of the importance of this matter.  Since I considered putting down this motion and subsequently lodged it with the Chief Whip, I have spoken of the subject matter of the motion to many Deputies from all sides.  The general consensus is that public representatives have been inundated with calls at their clinics by irate constituents complaining bitterly of the recent imposition of school bus charges.  I have had far more callers on this single issue than any other over the past three weeks.  Irrespective of where my clinics are in County Wexford, the story is the same.  The cry is that we are back to a situation where only the rich can afford to be educated.  The poor children or the children of the less well off cannot now enjoy second level education because of the imposition of school bus <Col N="206" /> charges.  This has put education beyond the means of many.  The subject has also been raised at every meeting throughout the nation, community meetings, residents' associations, sporting bodies and at every level of political activity.  I am aware of many cumainn, comhairlí ceanntair, and comhairlí Dáil ceanntair who have discussed this issue at length and all have made recommendations that we should not discriminate against anybody and that we should give every child equal opportunity.  Let us cherish all the children of the nation equally.</P>
      <P>All Members will be aware of the great march of the teachers in Dublin.  They came to the city to add their voices to the groundswell of opinion against this dastardly act, the imposition of education cuts and the insensitive manner in which they were applied.  Many Members from all sides went out to meet their constituents among the teachers that day and to assure them of their fullest support. Many gave their support while having their photograph taken for the local paper but when that support really matters I would ask them to give it heartily. The time is now.  If this motion is passed we can all be happy in the knowledge that we have struck a blow for the children of Ireland who do not have a say in this House, those young people who depend on us to protect their rights.  We should not let them down.</P>
      <P>In preparing my contribution for this debate I have consulted with the Teachers' Union of Ireland and the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, both unions at local and national level, the Catholic Parents' Association, parent-teacher organisations, community school parent organisations, community care teams, public representatives at all levels, chief education officers and many others. In researching the subject I have relied heavily on the book <i>Irish Education, History and Structure</i> by John Coolahan and I believe that the combined wisdom of all those sources must be conclusive.  Added to the sources mentioned, I have applied a good deal of common sense and I feel, therefore, fully qualified to speak with reasonable authority on the subject under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="207" /> We are now going back to the situation where children whose parents cannot afford the charges &mdash; and we must admit they are many &mdash; will have to stay at home. It is very difficult to say at this stage how many children will be affected but I estimate that it will be at least 5 per cent and, based on a census of pupils attending second level education, I estimate that 14,354 children will be denied their right to second level education.  What is to happen to all those children?  The law demands that all children should go to school until the age of 15 and we all know that most children these days are ready to leave national school and move on to second level at 12 years of age.  Are these children to break the law for three years simply because their parents cannot afford to pay for their education?  That question must be answered fully and frankly tonight.  I repeat the question because of its significance.  Most of us know that children will leave national school at 12 years of age.  They are anxious to go to secondary school but their parents cannot afford to send them because of the school bus charges.  The law requires these young children to be at school.  How can these children not break the law?  What must they do during the three years in question?</P>
    <P>I should like to outline the school bus charges being imposed.  This information must be considered in the light of the prospect of 200,000 people being unemployed. Services which have always been free of charge must now be paid for as follows: pupils up to intermediate level, £42 per year; senior cycle pupils, £72 per year.  Children of medical card holders are exempt at senior cycle level only.  The impression was given that all children of medical card holders would be exempt but it must be made quite clear that they are exempt at senior cycle only.  Up to 100,000 pupils will incur these extra charges and a family may find itself facing an annual bill of £150 in school transport charges alone.</P>
    <P>Special fares for pupils ineligible for free transport are being increased also. Charges for primary pupils will be increased from £10.50 to £30 per year and <Col N="208" /> for post primary pupils the increase will be from £10.50 per year to £72.  Ordinary city school transport charges for primary and post primary pupils are being increased from 10p to 20p per single journey. It is self-evident that these charges will be particularly damaging in rural areas and that large families will be severely affected.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with educational cutbacks in general.  Additional cutbacks are proposed in secondary, community, comprehensive and vocational schools and they will have serious consequences.  There will be fewer subjects and because of that there will be larger classes.  There will also be less remedial work.  I have heard Government Deputies when in Opposition shedding bitter tears about the need to increase the level of remedial teaching. There will also be a virtual disappearance of guidance and counselling, a decline of educational standards and a worsening of employment prospects for our youth. Many jobs today require a basic educational qualification of leaving certificate but if children cannot afford to go to school how can they obtain a leaving certificate qualification?  How can they get that basic educational qualification? I hope the Minister will realise the damage her proposals will cause and that following this debate she will have a change of heart.</P>
    <P>In proposing a motion such as this it is necessary to give an example.  For that reason I should like to refer a school in my constituency, the Presentation Convent in Wexford.  That school claims that the proposed changes would prevent many of their students competing on equal terms for employment because they will be deprived of equal opportunity in education.  That school feels it is unjust to deprive children under 15, who are obliged by law to attend school, of the free transport facilities if their parents are holders of medical cards.  On the question of the holders of medical cards we should take into consideration those who are just outside the income level, those who are earning about £1 per week outside the limit.  We are all aware of such people.  They will suffer to a greater <Col N="209" /> extent because they will have to pay the transport charge for senior cycle pupils. The Wexford school also feels that the changes represent discrimination in practice against rural based families.  They consider that if one pupil has to forego education because of the financial condition of the family it will constitute blatant discrimination against the rural community. The Presentation Convent expect that the transport charges will result in a number of students not completing their senior cycle.  It is my view &mdash; it is up to the Government to contradict me &mdash; that the number will amount to 14,000.  The parents council of the Presentation Convent are aware of cases where the decision to send young girls to the junior cycle will deny their older sisters the benefits of the senior cycle.  In other words, because new members of a family go into second level education, somebody must do without education.  In that school girls at senior cycle level were pulled out after they had obtained their intermediate certificate because the parents of those children felt that as they had some basics in education they should be withdrawn so that the younger children could get an opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Presentation Convent maintain that, if enrolment drops immediately as a result of the transport charges, as is happening, the quota of teachers will be reduced to one teacher for every 20 pupils who leave.  Due to the quota being established on attendance figures over the year for the following year the numbers leaving will be spread over 24 classes.  One pupil less in each class would result in one teacher lost to the school.  The imposition of the charges will have serious consequences for this school.  I should like to explain the reason for that.  In 1978 a commitment was undertaken by the school to repay £28,000 per annum for 30 years.  That followed on the building of a complete new school at a cost of £1,300,000.  State grants, gifts, and donations left a massive £220,000 outstanding. The parents council and the Presentation community have raised the required amount to date.  A significant proportion of the £28,000 is raised by monthly voluntary subscriptions of £4 per family. <Col N="210" /> That is almost equal to the transport charge for two children.  The current debt is £170,000.  The capacity of rural parents to meet the transport charges, which are compulsory, could adversely affect the amount of voluntary subscriptions.  The consequences on the commitments can easily be appreciated.  The school cannot renegotiate the mortgage and there will not be any option but to leave all cultural commitments at risk such as drama, computer studies, public speaking and debating. Caretakers are not allowed in secondary schools, and, therefore, the financial commitments for non-teaching staff will be substantial.  For instance, if the secretary leaves she cannot be replaced but the administration of a 40-teacher 740-student school cannot be continued without staff.</P>
    <P>The current enrolment in the school entitles it to 40 teachers, 38 based on the student-teacher ratio of 19-1 and two ex-quota, a career guidance counsellor and a remedial teacher.  If the quota is changed, as proposed, to 20-1 then the school will be entitled to 38 teachers. Therefore, the first two teachers to leave will not be replaced.  The remedial teacher and the career guidance counsellor will have to revert to teaching duties, a ridiculous situation.  As the remedial teacher teaches French and English and the career guidance teacher Commerce only neither teacher would necessarily slot into a vacancy.  For instance, were the art teacher to leave all pupils taking that subject could not continue their studies. I hope the situation that exists in that school brings closer to the Minister's heart the position that exists throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I should like to illustrate some other points in relation to the motion.  The purpose of the free transport scheme was to ensure that children living in remote areas could avail of the same educational facilities as their urban counterparts. Equality of opportunity was the basic philosophy behind the scheme.  The free transport system was in part compensation for the closure of rural schools.  As everybody knows, it was Fianna Fáil's policy &mdash; it was their brainchild &mdash; to introduce free education and they did <Col N="211" /> that successfully.  Since 1967 we successfully preserved the concept of free education giving every child in this nation the opportunity to get second level education. This is not so any more.  I will repeat that many times before I finish.  If it is said often enough, it may have some effect.</P>
    <P>The costs of the system have increased principally because of the number of children from rural areas proceeding to second level education.  It is undeniable that there was a considerable escalation in costs from £1 million in 1968 to £30 million in 1982.  Between 1981 and 1982 costs increased by 20 per cent from £25¼ million to £30¼ million.  The number of users increased from about 50,000 to 150,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to go back to a local instance.  When I started second level education I was the only person in my parish who had the opportunity to go to school.  It was not necessarily that my parents were well off, but because they made that sacrifice.  I recognise that it was a sacrifice and I have always given them great credit for their sacrifice in sending me to school.</P>
    <P>More than most I recognise the great significance of the introduction of free education even at the cost presented to us here today.  I live in a rural part of County Wexford, an area where people did not have the opportunity to be educated. From 1967 to now they had that opportunity irrespective of what their parents did, whether they were unemployed or whatever.  Today we are getting back to the situation prior to 1968.  That is a disgraceful move and the Minister and her junior Minister should be ashamed to have any part in it.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil White Paper on Education stated that the Government would continue the school transport scheme while keeping costs under review with the object of getting the best service in the most economical manner.  <i>The Way Forward</i> stated that the possibility of providing school transport facilities through State agencies would be examined.  The Fianna Fáil approach was to find a more economic way to run the service. Detailed negotiations were carried out <Col N="212" /> with certain agencies.  A steady succession of education Ministers last year, and particularly last autumn, meant that proposals from the Department of Finance were not subjected to the thorough political scrutiny they deserved.</P>
    <P>Civil servants tend to take advantage of new Ministers to rush measures through.  Last year we had the proposed raising of the school entry age.  We all know what happened to that.  The Coalition Government realised their mistake and we do not hear anything about it today.  I distinctly remember a hot debate followed by a vote, and the Coalition Government still proposed that the school entry age should be raised.  We do not hear anything about it this year. I am glad they got that little bit of sense and I hope the debate tonight will have a similar effect.</P>
    <P>Some people feel that many parents could afford to pay the charges imposed. As we all know, in practice parents have to make voluntary contributions to the national and secondary schools for facilities above the bare minimum.  This will be an additional charge.  For a family with three children it could cost over £100 per year.  The decision which had not been finalised before the change of Government would have had to be reviewed by whoever was the new Minister for Education. I am afraid the Minister, Deputy Hussey, adopted what was a provisional decision only and made it her own.  This means it was fully acceptable to her.</P>
    <P>Then she had the audacity to make a pathetic attempt to pretend she was carrying out a Fianna Fáil decision instead of accepting her own responsibility.  We all remember &mdash; perhaps I more than most &mdash; before the last election when the Government parties had all the answers. We were told the Fianna Fáil Government were wrong about everything they proposed or tried.  Yet the Minister now claims she is following in Fianna Fáil's footsteps.  This is a terrible contradiction. I would not like to say any more about it. It is only one of a series of measures showing that provincial Ireland will be discriminated against under this Government. The Minister &mdash; and no offence is meant &mdash; may live physically in County <Col N="213" /> Wicklow but she has a Dublin 4 mentality.</P>

      <P>I should like to quote from a press release issued by the Fianna Fáil press office following the imposition of school bus charges on 7 January 1983. In it the former Minister for Education, Deputy Brady, stated:</P>
      <P>The Government's handling of the educational cutbacks has been hypocritical inept and insensitive.</P>
      <P>The continuing attempts by the Minister for Education to transfer the responsibility for these cuts from herself onto the former Government is an evasion of ministerial responsibility. During the General Election just past, both Fine Gael and Labour conveyed the impression that &mdash; if they came to power &mdash; they would greatly modify if not minimise the economies which Fianna Fáil were proposing in education. This may have been a beneficial electoral strategy, but it engendered unrealistic presumptions amongst parents and teachers'.</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil cutback proposals were presented openly and put before the electorate without equivocation.</P>
      <P>The abrupt manner in which the cutbacks were announced was at variance with the common practice of consultation with the groups most immediately involved &mdash; teachers and parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The motion is simple to understand.  I hope the Minister will not try to dodge the real issue.  The concept of free education was hard fought for and hard fought to retain.  Fianna Fáil retained it and would have continued to retain it since it was our brainchild.  In rural Ireland children will again walk the roads because the Minister has seen fit to deny them education.  Some of those who are well enough off to go to school will be denied the right to proper education because of the disappearance of selected subjects and the Minister's mishandling of the situation.  I plead with the Minister not to play politics with our children.  We have advanced far and the Minister is <Col N="214" /> responsible for bringing our educational system back 20 years.  She should not allow discrimination against children in rural areas.  She should not run away from the real issues and should not seek to blame anyone else for a problem of her own making.  She is now the boss and I ask her to admit that she has made a mistake and to put it right before it is too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves of the arrangements made by the Government for the continued operation of the School Transport Service within the limits imposed by the provision made for this service in the Estimates for the Public Services, 1983.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me say straight away that the Government have no wish that any child would be deprived of education as a result of school bus charges, or for any other reason, and have taken the measures, in the light of the current financial situation, to safeguard as far as it is possible, the educational provisions made for the children of the country, including the school transport service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The school transport service was established on its present basis in 1967 and its establishment coincided with the introduction of free post-primary education. During the first full year of its operation, 1968-69, it was availed of by 90,000 children at a cost to the State of £1.96 million. Some 18 years later, in 1983, it was estimated that the service would be used by approximately 167,000 children and that the cost of its operation would be £33.6 million.  By any standards this growth in the cost of the service is staggering and it reflects particularly a fundamental change that has occurred in western countries following two oil crises and the accelerated growth in the cost of oil as a primary fuel.  In school transport, whether we like it or not, we are engaged in transferring an ever higher portion of <Col N="215" /> the resources of this country to our suppliers of oil.  It is interesting to note that the growth in school transport costs over the five-year period 1977-1982 was considerably greater than that in the consumer price index, but was reasonably in line with the transport component of the consumer price index when allowance was made for the expansion of the service.</P>
    <P>The Government, however, no less than Fianna Fáil when in office, were very naturally concerned about the growth of this &ldquo;secondary&rdquo; cost of education and accepted, in general terms, the approach to achieving savings in this area as outlined in the estimates for the Public Services, 1983, published on 18 November 1982.  It is as well that we should all be clear in our minds as to what this approach was.  The provision made for school transport in the Estimates for 1982 was £30.25 million.  The estimated requirement for operating the service in 1983 was £33.6 million.</P>
    <P>The actual provision made in the Estimates for 1983 as published on 18 November 1982 was £28.2 million.  The Dáil will note that the 1983 provision was less than that of 1982 by some £2 million, that no allowance was made for increased costs, or for an increasing pupil population and that the 1983 Estimates envisaged a shortfall of £5.4 million on the amount calculated as required to operate the service in 1983 on the same basis as 1982.  Quite obviously the service could not be so operated on this provision unless steps were taken to make good the shortfall of £5.4 million.  The steps which were taken consisted of two main measures, first, the introduction of charges for second level pupils as a contribution to the cost of the service and secondly the abolition of what was known as &ldquo;the school transport subsidy&rdquo; to CIE.  Many commentators on the current measures with regard to school transport would seek to find a solution to the financial problems involved in advocating a more cost-efficient operation of the service.  I can assure the Dáil that wherever economies are possible they will be identified and they will be made, <Col N="216" /> and indeed, the school transport service is under constant examination to secure the most economic operation possible. There is no soft option, however, in this matter, either by handing over the service to private operators as has been suggested by some, or by involving local committees of schools' authorities or others in its operation, or by extending, as is so often mooted, the usage of special school buses.  The Government have no doctrinaire position on any one of these approaches.  What it does have is a school transport service operated by CIE on behalf of the Department of Education, using vehicles owned by CIE and driven by whole-time CIE drivers, using vehicles owned by my Department, maintained by CIE and driven by part-time CIE drivers and using vehicles operated by private hire contractors who tender for school runs in the various areas.  The private enterprise component in the operation of the service is substantially higher than is generally appreciated.  Contractors accounted for more than 43 per cent of the transport component of the service for the year ending 31 December 1981 and because of a preponderance of minibuses used by small contractors their vehicles outnumbered the CIE operated vehicles in the ratio of two to one.  Efforts made by my Department over a number of years to interest local and other agencies in the operation of the school transport service were without result.</P>
    <P>A criticism frequently levelled at the school transport service relates to the buses which are owned by my Department and operated by CIE with part-time drivers&mdash;the yellow &ldquo;busanna scoile&rdquo; so familiar on the roads of rural Ireland.  It is often contended that if such buses were available for general hire and use, the profits so made could be set against the cost of the school bus service.  The facts, however, do not give much support to this contention.  These buses were designed for school use and are not suitable for general hire.  The age of the fleet&mdash;the majority of the vehicles are close on 16 years old&mdash;would render the possibility of general hire unattractive.</P>
    <P>There are other factors also, including the employment structure within which <Col N="217" /> these buses operate, which weigh against the possibilities of profitable private hire. And yet these buses are a vital component of the service, in order to maintain an adequate supply of vehicles, to provide a fall-back position in the supply of particular services and to create a base which can enable competitive tendering to take place so as to secure economic contract prices.</P>
    <P>As I said, the cost efficiency of the service provides no ready panacea, or soft options in the present situation, a fact which was confirmed by the extensive study of the service made by Hyland and Associates in 1978, which did not reveal any areas of substantial economies, other than by the introduction of charges.</P>
    <P>The school transport service is a highly complex interlocking system which has to provide a predictable and reliable service for some 167,000 pupils, every day of the school year.  Implicit in this service is a complex administrative operation of procurement and scheduling, of complying with public service vehicle requirements, of determining eligibility in accordance with the rules of the scheme and of securing reliable contracts at economic cost. All of these services are carried out by CIE in conjunction with the transport liaison officers and on behalf of my Department.  Under the arrangements as announced for 1983, CIE has accepted the further responsibility of administering the school bus charges.</P>
    <P>It is through the introduction of charges on second level pupils using the service that the Government intend to make up approximately £4.2 million of the £5.4 million required to keep the service operating on its present scale and under present conditions.  The charges or contributions required are:</P>
    <P>£14 per term in respect of eligible junior cycle pupils; £24 per term in respect of eligible senior cycle pupils; £24 per term for junior and senior cycle pupils using catchment boundary facilities; £10 per term for concessionary fare payers at primary level; £24 per term for concessionary fare payers at post-primary level.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that there is no <Col N="218" /> charge being made for eligible primary school pupils who will continue to receive free transport as before.  A minimum of £50 per term has been fixed in respect of the contributions from any one family. Senior cycle pupils whose parents-guardians are holders of a medical card have been excused the contribution.</P>
    <P>All Deputies will be familiar with the significance of junior and senior cycle, the former being the years, usually three, up to and including the intermediate certificate and the latter being the post intermediate years, usually two, and embracing the leaving certificate as a terminal examination.  Concessionary fare payers are pupils at primary and post-primary level who are not eligible under age-distance regulations to avail of the scheme, but who are allowed occupy spare seats on special services provided they pay an appropriate fare.</P>
    <P>Catchment boundary facilities are more complex in that they arise from the conditions of the post primary transport scheme.  For the purpose of this scheme the country is divided up into areas, each area being served by its own adequate post-primary centre.  Pupils within a given area and residing more than three miles from the centre serving it are eligible under the scheme for transport to that centre, and to that centre only. Sometimes parents of pupils eligible under the scheme choose to send their children to school in a centre serving an area adjacent to their own.  Such pupils may be allowed to avail of school transport services to that centre, provided they cross the boundary between their own area and the adjacent area before boarding a school bus and provided there are seats available on the bus after all properly eligible children are served.  This is what is known as the &ldquo;Catchment Boundary Facility&rdquo; and it is essentially a concession extended to children who choose for their own reasons to go to a post-primary centre other than the adequate centre serving the area where they live.</P>
    <P>This, then, gives a full picture of the charges introduced and the categories of pupils to whom they apply.  Deputies will <Col N="219" /> note that there is only one substantial difference between these arrangements and the measures proposed by the previous administration on 18 November 1982.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of revenue to be generated by the charges is the same. There is no charge for eligible primary school pupils.  A season ticket lasting for a term is the <i>modus operandi,</i> with a lower charge for eligible junior cycle pupils attending their appropriate centre. The only substantial difference is that the Government felt that special consideration should be given to less well-off parents of senior cycle students.  These parents must forego the possible income which could be earned by their children had they left school and gone to work, in order to retain them at school through a stage which is more expensive in terms of meeting personal needs as well as incidental educational costs of books, requisites and so on.  In making this concession the Government were clearly showing their concern for the less well-off, by remitting the higher charge for school transport at senior cycle level and thereby ensuring that no unnecessary obstacle would be placed in the way of such pupils completing their post-primary education.</P>
      <P>I would contend that the contributions sought to this highly subsidised service are very reasonable, a total of £4.2 million as against an estimated expenditure from State funds of £28.2 million.  At the individual level the contributions amount to £1.16 approximately per week for a junior cycle pupil and £2 per week for a senior cycle pupil.</P>

      <P>These must be seen against an average cost of school transport per pupil/week of £5.66 in November 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look closely at the impact of the charges on less well-off families.  As many <Col N="220" /> such families would have children both at primary and at the different stages of post-primary schools, the structure of charges and concessions is such as to minimise that impact.  For a single child in such a family the charge for school transport over the entire 13-year cycle of primary and post-primary education is £126, less than £10 per school year, about 28p per school week, or approximately half of the price of a packet of potato crisps per school day.</P>
    <P>It is not a high price to pay for education and I have no doubt that the parents of Ireland, particularly the less well-off parents, who make many sacrifices for their children, will not regard the school transport charge as unreasonable in the very difficult economic circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have referred to the complexity of the school transport system.  I have had advice from many people on this matter.  No service is sacrosanct and must be reviewed regularly.  I have had responsibility for school transport for a short time but I have had discussions with a number of people, directly and indirectly involved in education and, particularly, in the school transport system. I have had discussions with CEOs and with parents' committees and tomorrow I shall meet the Private Bus Owners Association and will listen to their proposals <Col N="221" /> regarding school transport.  If those proposals are worthy of consideration, I can give the House an assurance they will be considered.  While the school transport service is a valuable service there are anomalies and difficulties.  If it is necessary that there be a certain number of children in a district in order to qualify for a transport service and if that number is not reached, it could be regarded as an injustice to that area.  I am examining that matter at the moment.</P>
      <P>Now that their party are no longer in office, the proposers of the motion do not have the responsibility of operating the school transport service on the moneys they provided.  Yet they see a strong case for extending to the junior cycle pupils the concession available to senior cycle pupils whose parents have medical cards. If that were done we would have to look for more from those who are paying.  I appreciate the concern of the Deputies opposite for this extension of a concession they never thought of in the first place.  The Government would be most happy to do this if that were possible at this time.  The proportion of medical card holders is such that the cost of applying this concession would amount to approximately £1 million and this would have to be recouped by increasing substantially the charge to the remaining users.  What we have done indicates clearly the intention of the Government that at least in the senior cycle every incentive will be given to the children of parents who are holders of medical cards and who are regarded as in the lower income group to continue their post-primary education.  In these circumstances many pupils would undoubtedly cease to use the service as a result of which this operation would become unviable and would be in danger of being discontinued.  There is little practical value in extending a concession which the pupils would not have the opportunity to exercise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other component of the savings to ensure the continuance of the school transport service was achieved by the cancellation of a subsidy of £1.25 million which was paid annually to CIE by the Department of Education.  A substantial number of children in urban areas, estimated <Col N="222" /> at approximately 50,000, travelled to school and back on scheduled CIE services.  Until early January this year these children availed of a special low child fare which was made possible as a result of this subsidy.  The withdrawal of the subsidy resulted in the schoolchild fares virtually doubling.  Many commentators have contended that the introduction of school bus charges discriminated against the rural population and that those living in urban areas escaped such imposition.  It must be clear now that such is not the case.  Any child, whether at primary or post-primary level, junior cycle or senior cycle, whether or not the parents hold medical cards, availing of the Dublin city bus services to travel to and from school has to pay fares amounting to about £72 over the school year.  In provincial cities the corresponding amount is £54.  If the pupils are over 16, as many senior cycle pupils are, the fares which apply are full adult fares.  It will be clearly appreciated from such figures that if any discrimination exists it is in favour of the rural population.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why it was necessary to curtail the provision made for school transport in the Estimates for 1983.  I do not propose to go into these as they are being dealt with extensively in the context of the debate on the budget. The position as I have outlined it in this address is factual and sober and contains little joy.  If the shortfall for the operation of the school transport service were not met by the measures taken and the arrangements made by the Government, then there would be little option but to seriously curtail the service.  Such a curtailment would invariably carry in its wake the consequences which the Deputies who proposed the motion quite genuinely fear, and that was the alternative which the Government and the Minister of the day had in that shortfall of £5.4 million of either imposing the charges which have been mentioned here or else discontinuing some of the service.  Many children in Ireland would be denied education under those circumstances, particularly post-primary education, very simply because they would have no means of getting to school.  In many areas <Col N="223" /> we are not in a position where children may exercise choices between various modes of transport, public, special and private, for the purpose of getting to school and home again.  It is vital to ensuring access to education that the school transport service be maintained and the arrangements made by the Government are so directed.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Byrne and the case he had made, and one would get the impression that his party were not in power for a long time, that the Fianna Fáil Party were in Opposition. He stated that in his clinics in his constituency he was inundated with callers.  He was talking about his Dáil ceantair and comhairle Dáil ceantair, agus is oth liom a rá nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge go líofa agamsa.  Here he was talking about the pressure he was under.  I would be very interested to know what his reply was. When I was speaking he saw fit to interrupt me about the measures proposed by Fianna Fáil when they were in office and before they left office when they produced the Book of Estimates and when they saw that education was being examined. I will quote the public statement made by Deputy G. Brady, former Minister for Education so that Deputy Byrne will be quite clear and know exactly&mdash;if he does not yet know&mdash;the true position and what to tell his comhairle ceantair and comhairle Dáil ceantair members.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no charge introduced for pupils of national schools eligible for free transport in accordance with the School Transport Regulations.  The cost of the scheme for primary and post-primary schools has, however, been growing to such an extent that measures need to be taken in regard to it.  Since no alteration is contemplated in the range of the service the measures required to control cost must involve <Col N="224" /> the introduction of a charge in the case of second level school pupils.  Consideration is being given to the question of the arrangements to be made for the implementation of such charge.  It is contemplated that such arrangements would take the form of a season ticket,</P>
    <P>Let the Deputy bear that in mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>that there would be a lower rate for junior pupils and that a concession would be made to take account of the circumstances of members of large families.</P>

      <P>This is a very complicated school transport service.  Under present circumstances I do not believe that it is right for any Deputy to come in here and try to make political capital out of the education of our children.  I can say that we added an extra concession where we provided for second level education, for senior cycle pupils.  We provided free transport for those children whose parents or guardians are holders of medical cards.  I do not deny that any imposition on anyone must create some hardship, but I hope that this imposition, which was necessary under the circumstances, will not deprive one child of second level education.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla, I want to explain that you cannot move your amendment now but you can explain it to the House.  We have not disposed of amendment No. 1.  We have not reached a decision on it.  The Deputy can explain his reasons for his amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it difficult to understand that.  However, I accept your ruling.  I am delighted this motion was put down so that a debate can be held on this extraordinary change in the education system, which was announced almost on Christmas Eve when there was no opportunity for the Members of the House to debate it.  The Workers' Party felt that the motion put down by a number of Fianna Fáil Deputies was not specific. It said that no child should be denied the right to education because of the imposition of school bus charges.  This is impossible because when you have school bus charges children will be denied the right to free education.  We felt that an amendment should be put down specifically <Col N="227" /> referring to the effect of the school bus charges and asking that all words after &ldquo;Government&rdquo; be deleted and the following be substituted&mdash;</P>
      <P>not to proceed with the imposition of school bus charges as these would lead to hardship particularly for children of the poor and socially disadvantaged, and further calls on the Government to ensure:</P>
      <P>(1)  that there will be no change in the availability of free school transport from the level operating on 1 December, 1982, and</P>
      <P>That is before the Minister announced her pre-Christmas budget cutbacks&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2)  that CIE be given an additional subvention to enable it to restore school bus fares to the level operating on 1 December, 1982.</P>
      <P>That second paragraph is put down for the specific reason that the Minister in reply to Deputy Byrne specifically pointed out the charges that were made in urban areas.  He specified it as an average of £70 per family.  Everybody recognises the effect the charges will have on families in rural areas where children have to be sent to school by bus because they live long distances from schools. Many of the children in urban areas have to travel five, six, and seven miles to school.  We felt that the effect of the charges in urban areas had not been recognised and we added that in too.  We felt that it was necessary to put down an amendment to the motion in order to bring out the effect of the charges on the educational system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This seems to be an additional item beginning the dismantlement of the free education system.  In the last few years a series of charges have come into second level schools.  There have been charges in relation to books, uniforms and fees are collected from parents for the heating and general running of the schools because insufficient money is going to second level schools because of the capitation grant system.  The new charges on top of those already there are the beginning <Col N="228" /> of the dismantlement of the free education system.</P>
    <P>The tradition of our people is very strongly in favour of the greatest possible education for their children.  This is what is causing such a tremendous outcry.  The list of people opposing this is very widespread and comprises Conradh na Gaeilge, The Congress of Catholic School Parents Association, Federation of Christian Brothers Schools, Parents Councils, Secretariat of Secondary Schools, The Association of Remedial Teachers, The Association of Principals of Vocational Schools, the VEC, Joint Education Committee of Catholic Bishops, the Conference of Major Religious Superiors, Catholic Primary School Managers' Association, USI, Institute of Guidance Counsellors, Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU Women's Committee and Youth Committee, Trade Councils in Bray, Dublin, Kilkenny, Limerick and all over the country.  The list is so widespread because when free education was introduced 15 years ago no measure from the time the State was founded got such widespread support throughout the country.  There is such an outcry now because the people feel that free education is being taken away from their children.  The debate on the transport charges is a vital element in ensuring that free education exists.</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement that this was necessary because of the increase in the price of oil is no answer.  When we decided on free education we decided that the taxpayer must pay for it.  Wherever the money is got the taxpayer must pay for it.  It is very poor economics to do away with this because if you reduce our education potential there will be fewer children in school and a worse education will lead to an increase in vandalism and crime.  A sum of £11 million is being paid out by Dublin Corporation on malicious damages this year alone.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>If there are fewer <Col N="229" /> children in school and more children at home and around the place this will lead to an increase in vandalism and crime and will involve the State in increased costs which will amount to more than the £3 million referred to in relation to this.  It will not allow for the preparation of children, whom we always call out greatest national resource.  They will be allowed to go stagnant, unused and unprepared for the take off which we expect will come within the next two, three or five years. Our children, because of this, will not be able to avail of the jobs that will become available.  From the immediate point of view and the future it is very bad economics to break down the free education system. It is very bad for the future of the country.  The Minister should look at this again and realise the tremendous outcry there is on this particular issue.  It is more than on the budget and is more than on any other issue.  The Minister should restore free transport and ensure the continuation of the free education system.</P>

      <P>In concluding the Minister of State said that it was not the intention of the Government to deprive any child of the right to education by way of the imposition of the school bus charges.

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise on the Adjournment this evening the subject matter of Question No. 15 of 3 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This matter is one of major importance not only to the people living on the north side of Dublin but to the population as a whole.  Last week I tabled a question to the Minister for Transport asking him to state what is Government policy in relation to future harbour works orders for the reclamation of Dublin Bay.  The Minister replied briefly that each application for a harbour works order in this respect <Col N="231" /> will be examined on its merits and that a decision to either grant or refuse an application will be taken in the light of the requirements for the development of Dublin Port.  He said that in arriving at any such decision he would take into account, in conjunction with the views of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, any representations made by interested parties.</P>
    <P>The reason for my raising this matter is to refer to a commitment given by Fine Gael before the last election to the people of North-Central Dublin, that was, that no future harbour works orders would be granted on application.  I am anxious to ascertain what the Government's future policy may be in relation to Dublin Bay. It would appear from the Minister's reply that individual applications will be examined on their merits.  This would seem to indicate that the Government are reneging on the very firm commitment given to the people of Clontarf particularly before the last election.  I have here a copy of a letter from Fine Gael to the Clontarf Residents' Association.  It is signed by Seán O'Leary, National Director of Elections for Fine Gael and co-signed by Deputies Richard Bruton and George Birmingham.  The letter concludes by confirming that in relation to the harbour works order Fine Gael policy is firmly against granting any order in the case of the LPG proposal.</P>
    <P>Dublin Bay has been an issue for many years.  Unfortunately, most of the amenities of the bay have been eroded in the past ten to 15 years.  It will be accepted generally that the area concerned is not one that is used solely by the people of Clontarf, Raheny, Coolock or Sutton.  It is used by people not only from all over Dublin but from all over the country.  It is also a tourist attraction.  There is a harbour works order with the Minister. The application in this respect was submitted more than two years ago.  It relates to an application for the reclamation of 94 acres in Dublin Bay.  The present controversy concerning the LPG issue is closely related to this because the site in that respect, an area of three-and-a-half to four acres, will be within that 94-acre <Col N="232" /> site if the permission is granted by the Minister.  I am sure the Minister appreciates how seriously the application is being viewed by the people of Clontarf especially.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil are not only opposed to the LPG installation but to any further reclamation of the bay.  Deputy Bruton will be fully aware of the concern in this matter.  He will be aware of the various meetings that have taken place between public representatives and the various interested bodies.  Both Deputy Haughey and I also gave firm commitments so far as further reclamation of Dublin Bay is concerned.  We did so in the true spirit of not wishing to see the amenities being eroded further.  We appreciate and accept that the harbour works order is a totally different matter from the LPG issue.  Since that issue is the subject of a planning appeal, it would not be correct for me or for anybody else here to go into that aspect in great detail, but I must refer to it tonight because it will be part of the existing application for a harbour works order which, if granted, will house the LPG plant.  If the application is not granted that will be the end of the matter of the LPG plant application.</P>
    <P>The Minister must realise the vital importance and the relationship to each other of both issues.  Having read the various reports from experts in relation to LPG installations we must agree that this is one of the most dangerous and sinister projects that could be situated in an area so closely located to houses, schools, factories, industrial estates, other oil installations and so on.  There is total opposition to that project from the people of the area concerned.  The democratic rights of those people must be recognised, but what concerns us greatly is that there was a firm commitment in the matter by both Fine Gael candidates before the election as well as by their director of elections, presumably after some negotiations had been entered into.</P>
    <P>One of the most serious aspects of the LPG project is the recognition by the Dublin deputy fire chief that it could represent a very serious fire hazard to the area.  In those circumstances he could not recommend acceptance of the application <Col N="233" /> to Dublin City Council.  The council in turn rejected the application, but it was granted subsequently by the city manager and it is now the subject of appeal.  Having received commitments in the matter from the three main parties before the election the residents concerned considered themselves to be secure in the knowledge that there was no prospect of such a plant being built.  It would seem from the Minister's reply that that is not the case.  The Minister is still prepared to consider applications for harbour works orders on their individual merits and in individual circumstances.</P>
    <P>This situation calls for a very clear explanation by the Government and by the Minister.  The people in my constituency will want to know why the Minister is not prepared at this stage to confirm the pledge given by Fine Gael and Labour prior to the last election.  I believe Deputies Bruton and G. Birmingham gave this commitment in good faith, and I have no reason to doubt it, but I had hoped they are not the victims of another ruse to gain votes at the expense of the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <P>We are particularly concerned, apart from the LPG plant, that the amenities of Dublin Bay should be preserved.  I do not think there is any other city of the size of Dublin which has the same facilities &mdash; beaches and so on located so closely to the city centre.  It is a shame that these amenities have not been developed and it would be a disaster if further harbour works orders were granted and other parts of the bay were reclaimed and these amenities cancelled.</P>
    <P>As I said at the outset, this issue is not only a local one, affecting approximately 50,000 people living in nearby residential areas, but is an issue of great national importance.  In our opinion the bay can be developed to benefit not only the citizens of Dublin and the nation as a whole but it can be of great advantage to the tourist industry.  Let us not destroy what we have left of this amenity.  Let the Government come out clearly and confirm the undertaking given to the people in Clontarf prior to the last election.  I hope the Minister of State will remove <Col N="234" /> any doubts that the Government are having second thoughts on this issue.</P>

      <P>The Fine Gael commitment did not refer to harbour works specifically, and the letter to which the Deputy is referring clearly mentions the LPG proposal.  I would like to reiterate what the Minister for Transport said in reply to a question on this matter on 3 February.  At column 1089 of the Official Report he said:</P>
      <P>Each application for a harbour works order for reclamation in Dublin Bay will be examined on its merits and a decision to grant or refuse an application will be taken in the light of the requirements for the development of Dublin Port.  In arriving at a decision on any application, I will take into account, in conjunction with the views of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, any representations made to me in the matter by interested parties.</P>
      <P>&mdash; Including the Clontarf Residents' Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Deputy knows, the Dublin Port and Docks Board applied for a harbour works order to reclaim an area of foreshore opposite the Clontarf seafront. Only a small portion of the area would be required for the project.  It is important that the Deputy understands that no decision has yet been taken on this application. The Minister is fully aware of the views of all interested parties in this matter and if there are other views of which <Col N="235" /> he is not aware, I am sure the Deputy and other public representatives in the area will bring them to his notice.  I can assure Deputy Brady that the Minister will bear these facts in mind when he <Col N="236" /> comes to make his final decision on the application.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.45 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 16 February 1983.</P>

      <P>The London Dumping Convention permits the dumping of low level radioactive contaminated waste in suitable packaging and under internationally agreed procedures supervised by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD.  I have no evidence that dumping carried out by the British Government has been in breach of either the Convention or the procedures.

      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board has advised me that the dumping of nuclear waste as carried out, up to the present time, in the North-East Atlantic dumpsite, does not constitute a hazard to health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department has not prepared any study on the problem.  However, the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation <Col N="58" /> for Economic Co-operation and Development has carried out a review of the continuing suitability of the dumping site for radioactive waste.  This review was undertaken by an International group of oceanographic and radiation protection experts which included a representative of the Nuclear Energy Board. The review concluded that the dose rates received by members of the most exposed group in a year due to recent average rates of dumping are no more than 0.1 per cent of the relevant internationally recognised dose limit.</P>

      <P>The announcement of the termination of the scheme as from the end of 1982 resulted in a very substantial increase in the number of applications.  There is at present a back-log of cases to be dealt with and this is being done as quickly as is possible.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Industrial Development Authority that the provision of services to 100 acres of its 186 acre site in Kilbarry was completed in 1982.  Two advance factories of 42,000 sq. ft. each and a 6×3000 sq. ft. cluster unit have been constructed on the site.  A third 42,000 sq. ft. factory is planned for construction in 1983.</P>
      <P>North Star Computers Incorporation of California, which will manufacture high performance desk top microcomputers in one of the 42,000 sq. ft. factories, is at present recruiting key management and supervisory staff.  This company will employ 290 people at full production.</P>
      <P>In addition, Iprodex Manufacturing Ltd., has acquired a seven acre site from the IDA and has initiated planning procedures for the construction of a 50,000 sq. ft. factory on the site.  This project plans to employ more than 50 people in the next year.  The second 42,000 sq. ft. factory is reserved for an overseas company which is in negotiation with the IDA for the establishment of a high technology project.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, who is an apprentice, attended a first year off-the-job painting/decorating course at the AnCO Training Centre in Waterford from 14 September 1981 to 27 August 1982.</P>
      <P>For the period of training up to 4 January 1982 the apprentice concerned resided in accommodation in Waterford in respect of which he received an accommodation allowance of £20 per week from AnCO.  He paid £7 per week towards the accommodation from his own pocket, which is the amount all single AnCO trainees are required to pay towards accommodation expenses.</P>
      <P>In January 1982, he decided to travel to the training centre from his home each day rather than reside in Waterford and he applied to AnCO for a travel allowance to cover his expenses in this regard. Consequently, for the period from 4 January 1982 to the date he completed the training course he received a weekly travel allowance of £13.55 from AnCO. This amount covered his full entitlement to travelling expenses.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Transport the current condition of the VOR/DME system located at Eagle Island, County Mayo, which has been reported as being out of action for some five months now; and if he will take immediate steps to have this major beacon, which is essential for the safety of aircraft flying nationally and internationally, restored to full service.</P>

      <P>The Eagle VOR/DME aviation navigational aid comprises two separate elements, viz. a VOR (Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range) and a DME (Distance Measuring Equipment).</P>
      <P>These elements form part of an internationally agreed grid of en-route navigational aids and while the continued operation of all of them is desirable for the regularity and safety of air operations the loss of any one of them alone has no safety implication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Eagle VOR/DME was installed in 1965 and because of its age it is difficult <Col N="68" /> to keep it operating satisfactorily.  Both the VOR and DME elements have been out of operational service since early November.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of January both elements were restored to service but cannot be put into operational use pending a mandatory flight check which is expected to be completed before the end of February.</P>

      <P>A superannuation scheme for secretarial assistants to Dáil Deputies who are not office holders has been in operation since November 1980.  The basic conditions of the scheme are similar to those applicable to non-established civil servants.  It is a non-contributory scheme, providing for a pension after 40 years' service which, together with the personal rate of social welfare pension, would give an aggregate benefit equal to one-half times pay, together with a lump sum of one-and-a-half times pay.</P>
      <P>The scheme also provides for a death gratuity on death-in-service and preservation of benefits where a person resigns voluntarily before retiring age.  Service reckonable will include service funded out of the grant for secretarial assistance and service in a similar capacity given before the grant was introduced.</P>
      <P>The question of amending the scheme to cover the secretarial assistants to Senators is being considered.</P>

      <P>European Regional Development Fund: The non-quota section of the European Regional Development fund is currently providing grants of 50 per cent of public expenditure on the provision of amenities and infrastructure directly related to the development of tourism and to cultural and recreational facilities including angling and riding and works aimed at improving scope for water sports particularly through the development of inland waterways.  This provision is in the context of the Special Five Year Border Areas Programme and is confined to the five border counties &mdash; Donegal, Leitrim, Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European Social Fund: There are no European Social Fund Grants available directly for sports and recreational facilities but fund assistance is provided indirectly, in certain cases, through the temporary youth employment scheme, administered up to now by the Department of Education but at present being transferred to the Department of Labour.  The scheme is aimed at relieving unemployment among young people under 25 years of age and European Social Fund assistance towards the cost is based on the fact that it provides work experience for young people.  The schemes is designed to aid private bodies such as youth groups, sports clubs and community organisations to initiate work projects which will have some lasting beneficial effect on the community or environment.  Participants are recruited directly by the youth/sport/community associations concerned through the National Manpower Service.  Priority is given to areas with problems of high unemployment and special consideration <Col N="83" /> is given to young people who have been unemployed for six months or more.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid occupational injury benefit for a maximum period of twenty-six weeks from 29 April 1982 to 27 October 1982.</P>
      <P>From 28 October 1982 his claim was treated as one to disability benefit and he was paid at a reduced rate based on the 1980-81 insurance record then available to the Department (a total of 36 contributions paid and credited in the 1980-81 year).  Following inquiries, it has since been established that he has 50 contributions paid and credited in the 1980-81 year and is therefore qualified for benefit at the maximum rate.  He was also underpaid pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>A cheque for the arrears of disability benefit and pay-related benefit due to 7 February 1983, date of the latest medical certificate received, was issued to him on 14 February 1983.  His present weekly rate of payment is £87.91 which includes a sum of £28.26 in respect of pay-related benefit.</P>
      <P>Pay-related benefit is normally paid for a period of 63½ weeks during a period of interruption of employment.  There are four phases of benefit.</P>
      <P>Phase 1 is paid for a period of 24½ weeks at 40 per cent of reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year governing the claim.  Phase 2 covers a period of 13 weeks at 30 per cent of reckonable earnings from the 159th day of incapacity. Phase 3 covers a further period of 13 weeks at 25 per cent of reckonable earnings from the 237th day of incapacity. Phase 4 is payable from the 315th day of incapacity at 20 per cent of reckonable earnings in the relevant income tax year.</P>
      <P>The claimant is being paid phase 3 of pay-related benefit (£28.26) from 31 January 1983.</P>

      <P>The claimant was disallowed disability benefit from 31 January 1983 as a result of a medical examination on 21 January 1983 by a medical referee of the Department who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> Registration was completed on 28 January 1983.</P>
      <P>I think I ought to take this opportunity to put it on the record of the House that the only possible way in which the flow of work in an office of the nature and size of the Land Registry can and ought to be managed is on the basis that applications for registration are dealt with in order of receipt, subject to the qualification that, where it is shown that hardship will result from delay, special efforts will be made to deal with the case as early as possible. Obviously priority can be given to any particular case only at the expense of other cases and, in assessing whether a case should be taken out of its turn, the staff in the Land Registry must have regard not only to the facts of the case itself but to those of perhaps hundreds of others.</P>
      <P>I would not wish it to be thought that I would be willing to interfere in order to secure priority for cases irrespective of the merits and I intend to ensure that the fact that a Parliamentary Question is asked about a case does not operate to give the case priority.</P>
