      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 5, 7 &mdash; and in No. 7 Votes 3, 4 and 5 &mdash; 8, 4 and 3.  By agreement, No. 7 (Votes 3, 4 and 5) and the Supplementary Estimates being introduced today, will be debated together and this debate will form the Adjournment Debate for this Dáil session.  Business will be interrupted at 7 p.m. to take items which will be brought to a conclusion according to the following schedule:</P>
      <P>No. 8, Committee and remaining Stages, 10 p.m.</P>
      <P>No. 4, Order for Second Stage and all Stages, 12 midnight.</P>

      <P>Among the Estimates is one for the Department of the Environment. May I ask the Minister for the Environment about a matter of considerable urgency?  All of us are condemned to be in this badly ventilated building in this sunny weather while our fellow citizens can be disporting themselves on the beaches, about which we are all very glad.  It is a welcome relief to have this delightful sunshine, but for most of the people of Dublin the situation is being marred by the fact that all the popular <Col N="1998" /> beaches are being seriously polluted because of the Dublin County Council strike.  In view of the special situation and the fact that we rarely get weather of this quality, would the Minister for the Environment, as a matter of urgency, intervene to have something done about this strike &mdash; I understand it would not take much to settle it &mdash; so that our people will have their beaches unpolluted at this happy time of the year.</P>

I would appreciate if you gave me permission to raise it today.  I am asking you to give special consideration to this matter.  I am asking the Minister for the Environment to intervene in this dispute, even before 3.30 p.m. because of the seriousness of the situation.  Even the drinking water is polluted.</P>

      <P>I have been trying to raise an issue during the last five weeks. It is a matter of serious interest to the country, but I have found it impossible to do so by Private Notice Question.  I ask to be allowed to raise it on the Adjournment. It concerns the dumping of nuclear waste.  The dumping has been started again this week by Britain.</P>

    <Title>Estimates, 1983. - Vote 3: Department of the Taoiseach.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £4,047,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Department of the Taoiseach and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>In so moving, I should like to review the problems which face the country and the policies of the Government to deal with them.</P>
      <P>Our strategy on coming into Government was clear and was directly related to a series of problems which were apparent to all.</P>
      <P>1.  Our capacity to stop the growth in unemployment was impaired and had to be restored.</P>
      <P>2.  A disastrous financial drift, with the public finances out of control and getting worse by the day, had to be halted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.  The ramifications of this disaster, which meant that already, even if all further borrowing were stopped overnight, for the rest of the decade we must transfer <Col N="2002" /> over £1 billion a year out of the country, or about the equivalent of the total yield of VAT, in interest and capital repayments on debts to foreign lenders, had become a major drag on our economy and had to be dealt with.</P>
    <P>4.  We needed to lay the groundwork for future development in our economy with new policies for industrial development.</P>
    <P>5.  Deteriorating relations with Britain had to be improved and the problems of Northern Ireland tackled.</P>
    <P>6.  Rampant crime rates and a growing drugs problem had to be reversed quickly.</P>
    <P>7.  A crisis in the probity of public affairs had to be faced head on, and new structures developed to ensure proper administration in the future.</P>
    <P>8.  A diminution of respect both for the primacy of Parliament and for the public representative had to be challenged by reform.</P>
    <P>9.  Other neglected areas needing considered reform, for example, aspects of social welfare and family law, had to be addressed.</P>
    <P>Already in less than seven months we have made progress in each of these areas and while the balance of our strategy inevitably leans heavily towards the economic aspects &mdash; under each heading we can now see the way ahead.  We have stabilised a runaway economy and started to control our indebtedness.  We are creating an improved environment for industrial development.  We have begun to halt the decline in competitiveness. We have the beginnings of strategies for regeneration and growth.  A new Criminal Justice Bill is well advanced, which, together with extra gardaí and more prison accommodation will tip the balance against the criminal.  We are focusing on the drugs problem, in respect of which we already have the report of a ministerial task force.</P>
    <P>The injustices of our present system of transfers between different groups in the community are being systematically identified with a view to a radical reform of the social welfare and income tax systems.</P>
    <P>We are well on the way to normalising <Col N="2003" /> relations with Britain and, with the co-operation of the main Opposition Party here, and the SDLP in the North, we have the New Ireland Forum under way.</P>
    <P>We are engaged in a major diplomatic campaign within the European Community to ensure that the Common Agricultural Policy is not undermined in negotiations now in progress and that the Community's own resources are expanded to finance new policies and enlargement.</P>
    <P>At home we have dealt with the telephone interception scandal.  We have set about sealing off police administration and planning appeals from political interference and we have begun a reform process in the Dáil, through committee structures designed to restore the role which Parliament can play.</P>
    <P>These energetic seven months have been rewarding.  They have enabled us to clarify the enormity of our economic challenge and to rally public opinion to the necessary measures to meet it.</P>
    <P>The most fundamental problem we face is employment &mdash; providing work opportunities for our people.  Even under the most favourable conditions the resolution of this problem would be extremely difficult.  Even if, for example, the early 1980s had been a period of continuing growth in the world economy &mdash; rather than a period of almost universal stagnation and decline; even if we had succeeded in maintaining our competitiveness in the domestic and external markets &mdash; which we have notably failed to do; and even if our public finances had remained in balance, giving us the leeway to pursue policies designed to create growth in employment &mdash; which notably did not happen; even if all these conditions had been fulfilled, it would have been difficult for us to secure jobs for all seeking work.</P>
    <P>The reason for this is simple and we should recognise it.  More than any other country in the developed world, we have experienced during the past two decades a rapid expansion of our population, and, above all, of our young population.  This has been on such a scale, indeed, that there are now nine young people in their <Col N="2004" /> twenties for every five in that age bracket two decades ago.</P>
    <P>Because of this revolution in the structure of our population we would have required during the present decade a sustained growth rate well in excess of that achieved over any period of years, in any other European country since the last war, in order to provide all of this new generation with jobs in their own country.</P>
    <P>Of course one of the preconditions I have mentioned &mdash; sustained economic growth in the countries with which we trade &mdash; is something whose achievement was beyond our control.  Unemployment in the EEC has risen in virtually unbroken sequence every year now since 1972 &mdash; quadrupling from a level of about 2.7 per cent to about 10.5 per cent at a recent date.  Nothing we could have done as a tiny country responsible for a fraction of 1 per cent of world output could have made any difference here.</P>
    <P>But the other two preconditions were within our control &mdash; and we notably failed to do what was necessary to create the conditions in which employment would be available during this decade to those who wanted to work in their own country.</P>
    <P>By increasing our money incomes at a rate far beyond that obtaining in other countries with which we compete, we have steadily reduced our competitiveness in price terms, both in our own market and in others, to the point where the survival of much of established Irish industry has been threatened.  Increasing incomes without matching productivity increases put the price of our goods and services up to a point where these products increasingly become unsaleable in free market conditions; and people lost their jobs.  Moreover, this reduction in cost competitiveness has not been offset by any significant move by established domestic industry to attain much higher levels of quality, of design, of effectiveness in marketing &mdash; such as would also have been necessary to provide employment for those seeking it.</P>
    <P>The other precondition which we have failed to meet is the good management of our own public finances.  Our failure here <Col N="2005" /> has inhibited to a very large degree the capacity of any Government of this State at this point to offset other disadvantages by providing through its policies compensating incentives to stimulate growth and employment.</P>
    <P>The simple fact is that at the very time when we faced unique difficulties which, more than at any other period in the history of the State, required the pursuit of prudent policies in respect of our public finances, we have experienced a disastrous loss of control in this area.</P>
    <P>In the end, last year, this loss of control came to threaten the very financial viability of the State.  For during the previous four years, when we ought to have been keeping public current spending within the limits imposed by the amount of current revenue available, we actually planned to overspend to the tune of almost £2 billion; then, year after year, we so miscalculated that we actually overspent to the tune of a further £1 billion.</P>
    <P>Despite our efforts &mdash; and in this case the first person plural refers to this side of the House more than the more general &ldquo;we&rdquo; of the previous paragraph &mdash; when in power in 1981-82 to restore some order to the public finances, the situation that this Government inherited at the end of last year, was daunting, and the danger threatening this State if these problems were not tackled promptly and decisively, was one that could have shaken our society to its foundations.  For, taking the Exchequer and State enterprises together, we had become dangerously dependent on borrowing from outside this State, to the tune of over £7 billion in total by the end of last year.</P>
    <P>This now involves an interest and capital repayment commitment averaging over £1 billion a year right to the end of the present decade.  No wonder that by the end of 1982 there had begun to emerge amongst those to whom we have recourse for this borrowing, doubts as to whether we had the capacity, or the will, so to organise our own affairs as to be capable of sustaining repayments of this ever-mounting burden of eternal debt.</P>
    <P>The commitments already entered into, and the need to borrow abroad, <Col N="2006" /> even on a reduced rate in order to sustain a smaller current deficit and a capital programme, was such that in the present year the Exchequer and our State enterprises needed to borrow abroad a further £1.5 billion, including sums required to re-finance part of earlier borrowings. Had confidence in our ability to manage our own financial affairs not been restored by decisive action within eight weeks of the change of Government last December, it must be doubted if borrowing on anything like this scale would have been open to us in the current year.  In that event, the curtailment of resources available to the public authorities to finance the continued running of this State would have been of a character difficult for any of us to appreciate in its full implications.</P>
    <P>We have been saved from that fate by the narrowest of margins.  Our credit-worthiness has been restored and now stands once again at a high level, because those outside this State to whom we have to have recourse, and to whom we will continue to have recourse for several years to come, know that there now exists a Government with a majority in Dáil Éireann, and with the necessary determination to bring the chaos of our public finances under control.  There now exists a Government who have the determination also to eliminate over a planned period of years, the need for external borrowing, by bringing current revenue and current expenditure into line with each other.  This would have the effect that our capital needs for genuine and worthwhile public investment, would then in the normal way be capable of being met from the domestic capital market.</P>
    <P>I know that, faced with the scale of the present unemployment problem, some people tend to react against this kind of stress I have just been placing on the problem of our public finances.  While claiming to recognise that we face grave financial problems, and that tough measures need to be taken to deal with them, there are those who nevertheless prefer to brush aside these realities, by claiming for example, that the Government seem to be trying to do too much too quickly <Col N="2007" /> in the financial area.  A tendency to complacency, a preference for the soft option, an impatience with reality, is being reinforced by political voices which, freed from the responsibilities of office &mdash; responsibilities which, in the closing months of last year, brought a belated realisation that severe steps had to be taken if we were to save anything from the wreckage &mdash; now feel free in Opposition to promote less responsible views.</P>
    <P>But let anyone on the opposite benches who feels inclined, from the security of opposition, to echo the &ldquo;too far, too fast&rdquo; theme, remember that when, just a year ago, panic struck the Government then in office with the realisation of just how disastrous a situation they had created, they committed themselves to a regime of eliminating the current deficit in four years, with an initial reduction to £750 million in 1983.</P>
    <P>This Government, coming to office last December, and using their wide international contacts to supplement domestic advice on just how severe were the measures that needed to be taken, were able to establish that what Fianna Fáil were proposing to do did indeed involve going too far, too fast.  We established that it would be possible &mdash; as we have done &mdash; to restore confidence in our capacity to run our own affairs by spreading the process of eliminating the current deficit over five years instead of four, and by easing the initial measures, to allow a current deficit of £900 million in 1983, rather than the £750 million targeted by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>If anyone is still inclined to think that we have gone too far too fast, let them dwell even for a moment on what would have happened had the country remained under the grip of a panic-stricken Fianna Fáil Government, lacking either the information or the judgment upon which to make a mature assessment of what steps needed to be taken.  That Government may also have felt that the manner in which they had themselves lost the confidence of those to whom we were beholden outside this State for continued access to external capital, made it necessary <Col N="2008" /> for them to try to impress those concerned by going further and faster than it was, in fact, necessary for a new Government to do.  This new Government &mdash; the actions of which during their previous brief period of office had already won them the trust of responsible people both abroad and at home have been able to proceed about this task in a considered, orderly, and less disruptive manner than the Government which they replaced.</P>
    <P>May I add that any illusion that might exist that we have been trying to do too much too fast cannot reasonably survive the recent evidence that the Budget deficit which now appears to be emerging is in danger of exceeding the £900 million target which was set last February &mdash; and I noticed that a comment from an independent source suggesting the opposite was immediately withdrawn after it had been made in the light of the June Exchequer figures.  In this context, the Government have to review the evolution of current revenue and expenditure, and capital spending, so as to identify adjustments that may be required in order to keep close to our budget targets. The Government will in fact be examining these issues closely in the next few weeks, and will take whatever steps are deemed necessary.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that in what we have been doing to get the public finances under control we are narrowly concerned about matters of book-keeping, will not stand a moment's scrutiny.  The simple stark fact is that our capacity to tackle the problem of unemployment has been gravely eroded by the disorder in our public finances.  If we are to be free to take the kind of action that will help to create sustainable employment, we will have to remove this obstacle to our freedom and independence of action in this crucial area of policy.</P>
    <P>Before turning to the initiatives which the Government are taking, or are preparing, in the area of employment policy, I want to say something about the problem of low national morale: a problem arising very largely, I believe, from our economic and financial difficulties.  There has been a loss of faith in our capacity to <Col N="2009" /> manage our own affairs; there exists amongst many a sense of hopelessness about the future.  There are fears about the job prospects for the new generation. It also has to be said, there has been a loss of confidence in politics and politicians from which no party is entirely exempt.</P>
    <P>But these doubts, these uncertainties, these fears can be allayed if we in this House, in Government and in Opposition, now take our responsibilities, show determination and leadership and, by our actions, once again demonstrate that we are entitled to the confidence of those who elected us, by giving them back faith in themselves, and faith in their country.</P>
    <P>That faith cannot be restored overnight because the problems created by this combination of our demographic situation, the depression of the world economy, and the mismanagement of our own financial affairs, can be resolved only slowly and painfully.  There are no short-cuts, there are no miracle solutions &mdash; though people still want short-cuts, they still hanker after miracles.</P>
    <P>It is our job from these benches, indeed also the benches opposite &mdash; the job of all of us in this House &mdash; to build up confidence steadily, not by promising what cannot be performed &mdash; a path that could lead only to an eventual collapse of confidence in our whole political system &mdash; but by showing how, painstakingly, and painfully, we can work our way back from the brink of the precipice to the kind of position which we held a decade ago.</P>
    <P>Let us remember that, at that time ten years ago our economic performance drew to our shores journalists from every corner of the world, concerned to discover how a small country like ours had achieved, from the stagnation and despair of the 1950s, growth and recovery. This growth and this recovery had by the late sixties converted a haemorrhage of emigration into a heartening flow of net immigration, by Irish workers, bringing back to their own country skills they had acquired abroad, and bringing with them spouses they had married and children they had begotten while in temporary exile.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2010" /> We should not forget what we achieved in those years, nor should we diminish our capacity today, even in the most difficult conditions, and against great obstacles, to achieve again great progress in many areas where we have sought after and attained excellence, such as the high technology industries.</P>
    <P>Moreover, we should not ignore the fact that the skills of our people, combined with the capital and know-how that we have imported from abroad, have yielded a continuing growth of the volume of manufactured exports at an annual rate of almost 10 per cent, even during these recent years of external depression and of spiralling domestic costs.  That is some achievement.</P>
    <P>The time has come for us to take stock not only of our failures, and they have been gross, but also of our successes, and of our capacity both to identify the problems we face and, with leadership, to overcome them.</P>
    <P>We can look with pride to the achievements of companies, in both the public and private sector, working in Third World countries, bringing to them skills acquired in the development of our own economy and competing successfully there with enterprises from far larger and more powerful states with much greater resources behind them.</P>
    <P>We can also look with pride at our exports in the computer technology area and at the extraordinary reputation which our young people in their twenties and thirties working in this sector have won for themselves and for our country through their skills, their enthusiasm and the imagination they have applied in this most exacting of industrial sectors.</P>
    <P>At another level we can look also with some satisfaction to such achievements as the reduction in our inflation rate, aided as it has been, of course, by favourable external factors.  Two years ago inflation was running at over 20 per cent; a year ago at 17 per cent; and in the last 12 months at 9 per cent, including the extra burdens imposed as a result of the tax increases rendered necessary in the last budget by the imperative requirement to reduce our budget deficit and <Col N="2011" /> borrowing.  Over the last six months the underlying rate of inflation, leaving aside these tax impositions, has been less than 4 per cent, and while one cannot, perhaps, expect to sustain such a very low rate over a full 12-month period, it is now clear that we can look forward to a further decline in inflation into lower single figures during the 12 months ahead.</P>
    <P>At the same time, despite the upward drag of high interest rates in the United States which affects every other country in the world and from which we cannot be exempt as long as it lasts, and despite the temporary hike in our own interest rates around the time of the realignment of currencies in the EMS last March, we have now seen a return of interest rates to the lower level that had been attained towards the end of last year and in the early months of this year.  We must hope that they fall further, recognising, however, that this is a function, first, of external factors outside our control, some of which are currently pointing in the opposite direction, but also, to a significant degree, of the success of all our domestic adjustment policies.</P>
    <P>We can also look with some satisfaction to the start we have made with the restoration of confidence in the equity of our tax system.  This had been undermined by evidence of widespread tax evasion and by the inadequacy of legislative measures designed to tackle this evil.  This year's Finance Act, together with the provisions contained in Deputy John Bruton's January 1982 budget, most, if not all, of which were later incorporated in that year's Finance Act, constitute together a major onslaught on the unfortunate weakening of confidence in the equity of our tax system and that had accompanied the raising of taxation to new and burdensome levels, something felt most acutely by those whose taxes are deducted through the PAYE system, which leaves little room for evasion.</P>
    <P>In passing I should remark that while some have seen fit to visualise these measures against tax evasion as reflecting in some way hostility to enterprise, they are in fact nothing of the sort.  They are a protection for all those engaged in <Col N="2012" /> enterprise, whether private or public, whose ability to do so competitively has been weakened by the heavier burden of taxation on honest entrepreneurs that has been rendered necessary because of the evasion of their responsibilities on the part of a small minority who lack any sense of public morality.</P>
    <P>I absolutely reject any attempt to equate entrepreneurs with tax evaders. The vast majority of those employers, and of employees, engaged in productive work, providing goods and services capable of being sold competitively at home or abroad, have no hand, act or part in tax evasion and they have every reason to welcome measures taken to tackle those who seek to batten on them through tax evasion measures.</P>
    <P>While we have been making progress in these areas we have also been preparing to tackle the employment problem in a planned way.</P>
    <P>In order to produce a medium-term plan that will be solidly based on reality rather than on unrealistic aspirations, we have appointed a small, effective National Planning Board.  In the early part of next year the board will produce their proposals for a medium-term plan upon which the recovery of our economy will be based.  In the meantime this National Planning Board have been working actively in the three months since their appointment on proposals for a budgetary and financial strategy in the short-run, to be undertaken within the framework of their preliminary ideas about the medium-term.</P>
    <P>We are grateful to the National Planning Board for the speed with which they have tackled this initial task and for the skills they have deployed in producing proposals which will help to ensure that budgetary strategy is coherent within itself and is consistent with a longer-term view of where we should be going.</P>
    <P>At the same time the Task Force of Minister concerned with employment is examining ways in which our existing employment policies can be improved to make them more effective.  At one level this process requires a review of some of the systems of incentives that at present exist to encourage enterprise in the industrial <Col N="2013" /> and other fields.  At another level it involves seeking to alleviate in the short-term the problems of unemployment that are posed, especially for the younger generation, but also for those wage-earners and bread-winners who have suffered a loss of earning power and of personal dignity as they have become unemployed, many of them after years or even decades of productive work.</P>
    <P>Our policies in the youth employment area have proved relatively effective and the scale of activity in our country in relation to youth unemployment is as great as or greater than that in neighbouring states.  The opportunities for training and work experience for young people have increased two-and-a-half fold in the last two years, as a result of the establishment by our previous administration of the youth employment levy and the Youth Employment Agency. This year 45,000 young people will benefit from these activities for an average period of about five months each, the equivalent of 20,000 man years &mdash; a high figure in relation to the total number of young people leaving the educational system each year, something under 60,000. In fact, a significant proportion of them are, even under present conditions, getting employment.  As a result of this progress we are perhaps nearer than any other member state of the Community to being able to adhere to the European Community's proposed social guarantee for young people.</P>
    <P>However, the Government are not satisfied that the work of the various agencies engaged in this area, despite its encouraging scale, is as effectively organised and co-ordinated as it might be.  If this be the case the fault perhaps lies with the rapidity with which this Government, both in our previous term of office and more recently, have sought to expand these programmes rather than with the agencies themselves, all of which are tackling their tasks with energy and enthusiasm.  In the near future decisions will be taken to improve co-ordination in this area so that we will get the best possible value from the very large sums &mdash; £120 million in the current year &mdash; being ploughed into training and work <Col N="2014" /> experience programmes for young people who are experiencing difficulty in securing employment.</P>
    <P>In speaking on this aspect of our problems I would not, however, wish to encourage any illusion that the problem of unemployment, either for the young or for those who have given long service and now find themselves without jobs, will be readily or easily resolved.  We must not fool ourselves on this subject, and we have no right to fool those who find themselves today without employment. The simple fact is that on the basis of the kind of policies that we as a country have pursued over several decades and that are being pursued in neighbouring countries the resolution of the employment problem would require a rate of growth and economic activity which is far beyond anything likely to be achieved in developed countries in the years immediately ahead.</P>
    <P>This means that unless we are to abandon the hope of resolving this problem we shall have to adopt some combination of two strategies open to us.  The first of these is a radical improvement in the competitiveness of the goods and services we produce, a radical improvement that would yield for us a share of our own and external markets far greater than we possess today.  This, the most constructive and positive course of action, will require a degree of self-restraint in respect of incomes far greater than any that we have yet been willing to show.  We have yet to face the fact that in every wage round in which we seek and secure increases in pay in excess of the increases in output which we are achieving, we are pushing more workers out of their jobs and are depriving more young people of any possibility of getting employment.  We must never forget the fact that one man's pay rise may often be another man's job loss.</P>
    <P>I know that it is difficult to quantify precisely the damage that has been done in recent years by the excess of income increases over increases in output.  It is certainly safe to say that some tens of thousands of people are now unemployed who would have remained in employment, or would have secured employment, if we had been willing as a people <Col N="2015" /> to accept the kind of self-discipline in this area that has been accepted by people in other countries with whose goods and services we have to compete.</P>
    <P>Satisfactory though the drop in the rate of inflation has been over the past year, it is still running at three or four times the rate of such countries as the Netherlands, Germany, United States and Japan, and their inflation rates are a reflection in a large measure of the rate of growth of money incomes in these countries.</P>
    <P>In the draft public service pay agreement which is now for consideration by the public service committee of Congress, a planned approach to the payment of special pay increases over the next three years has been incorporated, as has a provision for dealing in an orderly way with the vexed question of special claims.</P>
    <P>A general pay increase covering a 15-month period has been proposed providing for phased increases of 4.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent following a six-month pause.  These figures, while presenting a considerable demand on the Exchequer, a higher level than might have been desirable, nonetheless represent significant progress in reducing the rate of growth of the Exchequer pay bill and compare favourably with the level of settlements in this sector in recent years.</P>
    <P>These pay proposals also set a pattern which may help to ensure what is badly needed: a more realistic approach in the private sector than we have seen within the past ten days.  When the pay round in the private sector has worked itself out we shall have to review its likely impact on employment and will have to consider where we must go in future if we are to secure a recovery in competitiveness on a scale that could get back to work the tens of thousands of people who would today be at work if we had maintained our ability to compete.</P>
    <P>In our development strategy for a more productive economy providing permanent jobs we will be giving more effective and more co-ordinated incentives to domestic enterprise.  We will back that enterprise to the full and one of the primary concerns of the Minister for Industry and Energy, working with his task <Col N="2016" /> force colleagues, will be to reshape our industrial policy in a practical and effective way for that purpose.</P>
    <P>As part of our practical overhaul of industrial policy to make it more responsive to today's needs and opportunities we have accelerated the work of the Tri-partite Sectoral Development Committee. We will have recommendations from this committee this year, reflecting the combined and concerted views of employers, employees and Government agencies, for the planned development of industrial sectors which cover well over 60 per cent of those employed in manufacturing industry.</P>
    <P>The Government Task Force of Ministers will steadily convert these and the other proposals that they are and will be examining into practical Government action which will improve our capacity to protect existing jobs and to generate new ones.</P>
    <P>To the extent that we succeed with our efforts to tackle the problem of unemployment by reversing the deterioration in competitiveness, which up to the present is still continuing, we shall minimise the need for a more radical approach to the employment problem.  But given the scale of this problem, we cannot assume that even with a major change in attitudes to pay levels in the years immediately ahead &mdash; of which there is, as yet, no sign &mdash; unemployment can be reduced to anything like an acceptable level.  A much more radical approach may therefore be necessary if we are to ensure that those who have lost their jobs get employment again and that young people get a chance to work.</P>
    <P>A way will have to be found to secure a fairer sharing of work among the labour force so that we do not continue to have a situation in which one worker in six is unemployed while the other five have jobs at continually rising nominal pay rates.  There must be ways of securing a better balance in the employment market. We must have the courage to seek them out, whether that involves control of overtime, shortening of working hours at unchanged hourly rates of pay or the splitting of jobs so that we avoid perpetuating the situation where, as between <Col N="2017" /> two young people, one finds himself or herself completely without work while the other gets a full-time job.  In this context those lucky enough to be in employment must realise that every excessive demand conceded to them is depriving the next generation of job opportunities.</P>
    <P>While our main concentration during the years immediately ahead has to be on our overwhelming economic problems, there are other issues too which we shall tackle.  The problem of equity and fairness in our society goes far beyond the limits of the taxation system.  Our public finances provide a veritable rabbit warren of transfer systems, taking money from people through a complicated proliferation of tax measures and giving it back to them again in all kinds of transfers and subsidies, many of which reduce the cost of goods or services arbitrarily to all and sundry rather than being directed towards helping those most in need.</P>
    <P>We must put some order into this confused system so that the process by which the Government raise money in taxation and redistribute much of it back again to the general public is made efficient and operates in the interests of equity rather than in a higgledy-piggledy manner as at present.  A Social Welfare Commission to be appointed by the Government and the Commission on Taxation, from which a further report is due, will together help us to find a way of clearing up many of the anomalies which leave people with a sense of injustice, and which in many cases do involve actual injustices.  It is my purpose that by the time this Government return to face the electorate major progress will have been made with this complex problem.</P>
    <P>We must also face realistically our growing crime problem, which has led to a large part of our population living in permanent fear.  Already we have enacted the Criminal Justice Community Service Bill.  Allied to the recent provision of new prison accommodation in three locations this will help to expand the capacity of our system to cope with convictions.  Of particular importance will be a new Criminal Justice Bill <Col N="2018" /> designed to change the present balance between the criminal and the law.</P>
    <P>I recently set up a ministerial task force on the drugs problem and am pleased that they have already completed their report for Government.  This will lead to positive action in the near future in this tragic area of social disorder.</P>
    <P>The substantial deployment of newly-recruited gardaí is already improving a bad situation in many areas.  Allied to the other measures I have outlined, the expansion of Garda activity should lead to a marked improvement in the crime situation.</P>
    <P>We have also begun to tackle a series of other social reforms.  The Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, is working towards a comprehensive legislative package for the next four years.  The inter-departmental committee working in this field, under her leadership, are already laying the groundwork for both legislative and other reforms in this area.</P>
    <P>Already we have proposals to bring about joint ownership of family homes and we are working on improving the rights of children and human rights generally &mdash; the latter being an area in which we have neglected our international responsibilities by failing to take the measures necessary to enable us to ratify a number of international conventions. The new Oireachtas Committees on Marriage and Women's Affairs will have a major contribution to make in the area of family law reform.</P>
    <P>We are also taking a major initiative as regards youth policy.  A National Youth Policy Committee are being established in fulfilment of a Government commitment, to bring forward a national youth policy to meet the needs of the rising youth population.  The task of incorporating youth as a social partner is being tackled in accordance with our commitment to this sector of our population.</P>
    <P>The welfare of the less-well-off has been safeguarded by our budget provisions for social welfare.  By increasing benefit by 12 per cent at a time when inflation is running at 9 per cent we have ensured that the elderly, the unemployed and the underprivileged are protected while the rest of the community are finding <Col N="2019" /> themselves faced with a squeeze in their living standards.</P>
    <P>The more effective and more widespread development of the arts and culture is a high priority of our Government reflected in the appointment of Deputy Nealon as Minister of State with responsibility for this area.  We intend progressively to bring better co-ordination and direction into public provision for the arts and culture, to solve outstanding problems in the conservation of our national artistic and cultural heritage where we have been neglectful and where great damage is still being done and, in particular, to strengthen artistic and cultural activities and facilities in the regions.</P>
    <P>In a speech in an Adjournment Debate which inevitably must contain controversial matter, not all of which will commend itself to the Opposition, I am reluctant to say much about the problem of Northern Ireland where a great deal now depends upon the parties which are taking part in the New Ireland Forum developing and maintaining solidarity in their approach to the task of suggesting ways in which peace and stability can be established in this island.</P>
    <P>Deliberately on this occasion, therefore, I will confine myself to recording that the Forum provides an opportunity for the three main parties here together with the SDLP &mdash; parties representing well over 90 per cent of nationalist opinion in this island &mdash; to put forward in a constructive, open and generous way a number of alternative approaches to the problem of restoring peace and stability in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I shall not dwell either on the area of foreign policy save to make some comments in respect of one specific area where in the months ahead we shall be facing major problems and where also perhaps we may find major opportunities. This is in respect of the negotiations now due to take place concerning the finances of the European Community.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations now under way in the European Community, we shall find ourselves under pressure on aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy.  This is of immense importance to all of us on <Col N="2020" /> this island, whether we earn our living on a farm or in other walks of life where we benefit from the prosperity of the farming community.</P>
    <P>We are at present actively preparing for this difficult negotiation in which we shall seek to secure the support of likeminded countries in respect of aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy which we and they believe to be of great value. We shall also ensure that the special interests of this country in the preservation of this policy, especially in so far as it affects products of such enormous importance to us as milk, will be protected.</P>
    <P>I spoke recently at some length on the economic and social importance of a prosperous agriculture.  I took care then to point out the difficulties the farming community have experience in recent years, which are often misrepresented in such a way as to divide town and country. The extent of the real income drop of farmers in recent years has had severe impact not only on farm families but on the many other families whose incomes depend directly or indirectly on a prosperous agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>At the same time we shall be seeking to ensure that by the end of the year in Athens the obstacle to the further development of the Community posed by the present 1 per cent limitation on VAT payments by member states will have been removed.  No one should be in any doubt about the importance of these negotiations for the vital national interests of this country.  Preparations for them, and diplomatic activity in connection with them, will absorb much of the time and energy of our Government in the months immediately ahead, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>The tasks that I have outlined and the challenges that we have to face, are on a more demanding scale than anything that any Government has faced in the history of this State since its earliest years.  To tackle them successfully demands of any Government a combination of ability, energy and political skill beyond the ordinary.  I believe that the Government which I have the honour to lead have these characteristics in abundance, and <Col N="2021" /> that in their balance of personalities, of skills and aptitudes, will serve this country well during the four years ahead. Backed as we are by two political parties in this House which are dedicated to the public interest, to economic growth and to progressive social policies, and which have the courage and fortitude to sustain a Government in the face of many and grave difficulties, we are, I believe, assured of success in this most difficult of periods, and in facing so many major problems.</P>
    <P>Our two parties are determined to restore confidence in our political system. This confidence has been undermined by events such as the abuse of the telephone interception system and the politicisation of the Planning Appeals Board, to name but two examples in respect of which, as I mentioned earlier, we have already taken effective action.  We shall continue during our term of office to make any changes that may be necessary in order to ensure that the more sensitive areas of our administrative system are not open to abuse for political purposes.</P>
    <P>May I conclude by saying that the couple of months immediately ahead, during which this Parliament will not be sitting in plenary session, will not be a period of political inactivity as some commentators &mdash; not those closest to the political process &mdash; would have our public opinion believe.  While most politicians will certainly seek a few well-deserved weeks of repose at some stage during the three months ahead, throughout much of the greater part of this period, members of this House, whether in Government, or supporting the Government in the back benches, or in Opposition, will continue to be fully engaged in the task of serving the people of this State.</P>
    <P>The work of Government will proceed apace, with more time available for the discussion of policy and the preparation of legislative measures than is possible when the Dáil is in session.</P>
    <P>Many of the Committees now established by agreement by this House and the Seanad, which will be operating on a scale without precedent in our parliamentary history, will together with the New Ireland Forum, be actively engaged <Col N="2022" /> during this period of parliamentary recess in pursuing the tasks alloted to them, carrying out these tasks very largely on a non-partisan, constructive basis, to which I hope the media will, during these months, and subsequently, direct the attention of public opinion.</P>
    <P>When we adjourn tomorrow night the political process will not, therefore, come to a halt.  In fact, in certain areas of activity it will be accelerated.  And when this House resumes in three months time it will have before it an intensive programme of legislation and will also have the task for the first time in the history of the State, of examining before the Christmas recess, in advance of the process of spending the money in question, the Estimates of expenditure.</P>
    <P>There is an immense job to be done by Government and politicians on behalf of the Irish people.  In the months and years immediately ahead, all of us in this House will be playing our part in undertaking this task on behalf of those who have done us the honour of selecting us to represent them here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an appropriate point at which to review the performance of this Coalition Government and to see how the country stands after six months of their administration.</P>
      <P>The record is dismal, the picture depressing; the outlook bleak.  Unemployment is at a record level and still rising.  The economy is stagnant.  Industrial relations are in a continuing state of confrontation with constant threats of disruptions.  The budget is off course and despite a crushing increase in taxes, vital public services like health, education and welfare have all been drastically curtailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A state of deep depression prevails everywhere and for the first time most people are genuinely worried and fearful for their future.  This public feeling probably arises in some measure from the depressing economic and social outlook, but it can more specifically be attributed to a campaign conducted over the last few years and still going on by Members of the Government and their friends. They have relentlessly preached pessimism <Col N="2023" /> to the point where they have created an almost pathological feeling of defeatism and depression throughout our community.</P>
    <P>Sometimes I envy the Taoiseach his capacity to rewrite and completely distort recent economic and fiscal history.  The sweeping audaciousness with which he distorts would be the envy of even the most skilled revisionist in a communist bloc country.  I invite the impartial observe to note how in the pages dealing with the bad parts of our economic history he drags in Fianna Fáil as often as he can but when he comes to the great economic achievements of the sixties, Fianna Fáil are not mentioned, despite the fact that they were in office during that period.  I should also like to direct the attention of the House to the part of the Taoiseach's speech which deals with equity.  He said:</P>
    <P>Our public finances provide a veritable rabbit warren of transfer systems, taking money from people through a complicated proliferation of tax measures, and giving it back to them again.</P>
    <P>That is from the man who proposed the absurdity of the £9.60 payment.  His advisers have let him down badly by allowing that statement through the net. I should like to warn the Taoiseach that the people are becoming increasingly cynical about this constant refrain of blaming everything on Fianna Fáil.  He is in office now and the responsibility is his, not that of Fianna Fáil.  He should stop blaming someone else and talking about our problems and difficulties as if they were academic matters far removed from him and for which he has no responsibility.</P>
    <P>The business community have been intimidated to the point where there is almost universal apathy.  There is a reluctance because of the atmosphere that has been created to show any enterprise, to undertake any investment, to start any new projects.</P>
    <P>This general feeling of fearfulness for the future that is abroad is also due to a belief among the general public that this Government are confused and uncertain <Col N="2024" /> about their purposes, are divided on a number of important issues, and are subject to unpredictable changes of mind. The most recent of these is the false posturing and manoeuvring on public service pay.  Categoric statements were made about what the nation could afford and decisions were laid down, all of which were subsequently reversed.</P>
    <P>It is this sort of thing that conveys the uneasy feeling that this Government, because they are a coalition of opposites, because of the fumbling nature of their leadership cannot possibly generate the unity of purpose, the coherence and consistency that is needed to overcome our difficulties and secure our future.</P>
    <P>What a pathetic sight the Parliamentary Labour Party presents to us at present. They are trapped and they know it. They must maintain this Government in office because if there were to be a general election now they would be decimated. Day after day they silently acquiesce in the implementation of harsh monetarist policies, in further assaults on the living standards of workers, lower income families and social welfare recipients, in savage cut-backs in health, education and other vital social areas, to a major undermining of the semi-State sector.</P>
    <P>Labour Party Ministers and Deputies have had to abandon practically everything that Labour have traditionally stood for.  What a terrible price to pay for the privileges of office.  In a very obvious and desperate attempt to divert the attention of the general public and their traditional supporters from their sell-out on economic and social policies, Labour Ministers raise issues like contraception and divorce.  Let me make it clear to them that they are not fooling anybody by these tactics.  They are too transparently obvious.  They would be far better occupied in devoting their energies to securing the adoption by the Government of rational economic policies particularly on the employment front.</P>
    <P>The present exceptional level of confrontation and disruption in industrial relations arises directly from budgetary policies.  The construction of a rational pay policy has been made impossible by <Col N="2025" /> the budget.  In addition to the Government's own humiliating climb-down on public service pay, all over the country, wage settlements of between ten and twelve per cent over twelve months, corresponding roughly to the rate of inflation are being concluded despite the stated policy of the Government to keep increases down to five or six per cent. This situation is an inevitable consequence of the heavy increases in taxation imposed by the budget on the average employee and the increases in indirect taxation.</P>
    <P>The Government placed their policy for the public finances ahead of everything else.  They discarded every other economic and social aim and especially the problem of unemployment in favour of their bookkeeping objectives.</P>
    <P>Despite this total preoccupation with the books, however, they did not get their arithmetic right.  They are at present £75 million on the wrong side and by the time the public sector pay agreement takes effect, they will be a great deal more out of line.  We were surely entitled to expect that the disciples of financial rectitude could at least get their sums right.</P>
    <P>The statement issued by the Minister for Finance following the publication of the Exchequer Returns to the 30 June last contains a number of very damaging admissions.  On expenditure on the non-capital supply services, it stated that indications are that expenditure on social welfare will for the rest of the year exceed the budgeted levels.  This, of course, is inevitable with rising unemployment.  It goes on to say that there will be some shortfall on the overall budget estimate for non-tax revenue and a shortfall in tax revenue of the order of £20 million.</P>
    <P>What are they going to do now?  Will there be a series of further impositions and cut-backs announced as soon as the Dáil recesses?  Are the Government already looking at health, third-level education and food subsidies as prime targets for more expenditure cuts?</P>
    <P>There appears again to be no agreement between Fine Gael and Labour as to what should happen next.  &ldquo;Tax the wealthy and the farmers&rdquo; say the Labour Party.  &ldquo;Cut expenditure on health and <Col N="2026" /> education and close down State companies&rdquo; say Fine Gael.</P>
    <P>Once again basic differences on fundamental policy issues emerge.  Once again there will be compromise rather than a clear line of policy resolutely followed.</P>
    <P>It is clear from the latest Exchequer returns that we are now locked into a downward deflationary cycle which is feeding on itself.  Deflationary policies were introduced for the stated purpose of improving the public finances.  They can now be shown clearly to have the effect of accentuating the very difficulties they were supposed to cure.  Deflation is leading to falling revenues because of decreasing demand leading to a need for more taxation and further deflation.  The yield from excise duties now seems to indicate that what Ministers should have done in January was to reduce excise duties in order to raise revenues through increased consumption.  Many of the budget increases have apparently been counter-productive.  Excise duties have apparently reached the point of diminishing returns and the same phenomenon is now becoming visible with regard to VAT where buoyancy is beginning to fall off.</P>
    <P>Consideration should be given immediately to very limited changes which might be made in order to stimulate demand, and so raise the level of economic activity and help the employment situation.  I believe there is scope for selective cuts in taxation which could act as incentives and nudge the productive private sector into some modest investment decisions.  I believe the Minister for Finance should experiment prudently with a cut for instance in excise duties on beer and spirits and perhaps on some other products also.  If these cuts were well chosen and carefully assessed, they could be self-financing while at the same time increasing consumption and helping employment.  The Minister should also consider a reduction in VAT on hotels and restaurants while there is still time for such a reduction to have the effect of generating a sufficient improvement in business to pay for itself.</P>
    <P>The whole Capital Programme must be <Col N="2027" /> urgently reassessed.  A large number of important projects are now winding down.  The general level of capital investment should be maintained, and if possible increased.  There is a danger of very serious long-term damage being done to our capacity to invest if structures built up over a period of years to reasonable levels of performance are allowed to disappear. If that happens the high level of capital investment which has been one of the more encouraging aspects of our economy could be permanently impaired.</P>
    <P>In the Minister for Finance's statement there is one particular paragraph to which I would direct attention.  It is the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Exchequer expenditure on capital services in 1983 is budgeted to be about 10 per cent less than in 1982.  Exchequer issues in the first half of the year in respect of these services were 15 per cent below issues in the corresponding period of 1982 and amounting to 46 per cent &mdash; in a year just half way through &mdash; of the budgetary provision.  It is likely that, over the year as a whole, Exchequer capital expenditure will remain within budget.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Those words have an ominous ring about them &mdash; a suggestion that even the reduced capital programme set out in the budget may not be maintained.</P>
    <P>The capital programme we had planned for 1983 was reduced by this Government by £263 million.  Our programme provided £1,324 million for public construction.  That was reduced to £1,251 million by this Government as a direct result of which there are now 30,000 fewer people employed in the construction industry.  If the reduced capital programme is fulfilled the effect on employment and the general level of economic activity for the rest of the year will be extremely severe.</P>
    <P>Either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance should give us a full outline of the developments which have taken place and the present situation in regard to foreign borrowing, our external assets <Col N="2028" /> and the general situation in regard to capital outflows and inflows.</P>
    <P>It is clear that there has been no improvement in our foreign borrowing situation despite all the preaching and protestations by this Government.  In 1982 net foreign borrowing amounted to about £1,100 million which was a significant reduction on the 1981 figure.  The Government are supposed to be aiming at a figure of about £800 million this year. But, of course, devaluation means that the external debt will in fact increase by about £1,100 million not £800 million. There does not seem to be much point in making strenuous efforts to reduce foreign borrowing with a corresponding curtailment of our investment programmes if this reduction is to be thrown away by devaluation.  The Government have never come clean about devaluation. Was it simply, as the Minister for Agriculture now seems to suggest, to secure better farm prices.  If so it was an unbelievably costly way of achieving that objective.  Or was it forced on us as part of our currency management policy?</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the situation which is far from clear.  It appears that there was a sharp fall in official reserves during the first half of 1983.  If this has happened, then the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance should explain how it came about.  Were there substantial private capital outflows and, if so, to what can these be attributed?  Were they of a permanent nature of were they merely temporary short-term movements?</P>
    <P>This Government seems to have no policy at all on interest rates.  We in Fianna Fáil in Government paid a great deal of attention to interest rates, because we recognised their significance in regard to investment in particular and the general level of economic development. Does this Government subscribe to that philosophy?  And, if so, are they taking any action on this front.  There is no evidence that any particular policy is being pursued in this key area of economic management.</P>
    <P>At the time it was introduced it was argued widely from all sides that the economic strategy of this year's budget was wrong.  It was entirely deflationary with <Col N="2029" /> good bookkeeping the sole objective. The economic consequences of such a budget were predictable, more unemployment, a falling off in investment, confrontation on the pay front, social deprivation and a general decline in economic activity.  All this has happened. But it now emerges that even the bookkeeping objectives were not achieved and the deflation so warmly embraced and ruthlessly implemented has not even succeeded in achieving the budgetary targets which were its only justification.</P>
    <P>The full extent of the deflationary impact of the budget is only now becoming clear.  It has been calculated that the budget has withdrawn the equivalent of five per cent of gross national product out of the economy.  That figure almost certainly reflects the greatest single measure of deflation ever undertaken in the history of the State.  As a consequence, investment must fall by somewhere in the region of 10 per cent this year.  I do not believe that the full seriousness of this situation has yet been realised or the adverse effect it is likely to have on future output understood.  While Ministers have pointed to encouraging increases in production in the first quarter of this year, these must be viewed with great suspicion against the background of falling off in investment to this unprecedented extent.</P>
    <P>In this connection it would seem that the whole future of our State companies is at risk.  A very negative one-sided case is being stated against them.  These companies exist to provide basic economic and social functions which would otherwise not be performed in our economy. It must be recognised, however, that their performance and their profitability have been affected by thee recession in the same way as many long established companies in the private sector have been similarly affected.  There may have been mis-management, errors of judgment, bad investment decisions; but that is not the whole story.</P>
    <P>The recession has stood things on their head for managements everywhere, in Government Departments and in the private sector, just as it has in the State companies.  Decisions which were right at the time in the circumstances prevailing <Col N="2030" /> can now &mdash; of course with the benefit of hindsight and in radically changed circumstances &mdash; be severely criticised.  It is a fact of our national life that the central civil service never fully accepted the independent role of the State companies. In so far as they have been given freedom, it has always been grudgingly given. Attempts have been made from time to time to bring these State companies back under direct departmental control.  I would like to warn the Government to act very carefully in this area, not to allow the present recession to be used wrongly and unfairly against the long term value of the State companies.  They have fuelled economic and social development in the past and they can do so again in a way that no other sectors of the economy can do.</P>
    <P>It is fascinating, for instance, to see the relentless and insidious campaign that has been raged against the Whitegate Refinery.  The campaign has been intense.  The Government should however recall our experience in 1979 and understand how dangerous it is to leave ourselves completely at the mercy of ruthless multi-nationals.  When one sees a campaign undertaken right across the board in all the public media simultaneously, one has every right to be suspicious as to the motivation for such a campaign. In the case of Irish Steel, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, NET, and all the others, short term panic decisions should be avoided.  The Government must look to the longer term and have employment creation possibilities always central to every decision that is taken.</P>
    <P>It is not a case of the Government's curtailment of the semi-State sector being counter-balanced by a major drive in the private sector.  Far from it.  There does not appear to be any enthusiasm in this Government for the private sector either. In a number of important productive areas &mdash; agriculture, fisheries, science and technology &mdash; State support has either been reduced or withdrawn.  Whatever may be said about the new income tax band of 65 per cent or the residential property tax, from the point of view of the tax code itself they cannot be <Col N="2031" /> regarded as incentives to individual effort or private enterprise.</P>
    <P>By way of contrast to this total lack of coherent economic strategy for development, I wish to recall for the information of Deputies the fact that before we left office the last Fianna Fáil Government prepared and published a detailed economic plan, <i>The Way Forward</i>, which charted the role we should follow to get out of our present economic and financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>That plan, <i>The Way Forward</i>, accepted the realities of our economic and financial situation as they were revealed at that time; and, firmly based on those realities, it set out a balanced programme of action.  The plan would, of course, have to be revised today to take account of all that has happened since it was published.  But I believe that it is still valid as a basic economic strategy.  The objectives it set out are equally valid. These were:</P>
    <P>&mdash; to halt and reverse the trend in unemployment.</P>
    <P>&mdash; to protect the living standards of those who must rely on social benefits.</P>
    <P>&mdash; to promote equity in the taxation system and to reduce over the period of the plan the relative burden of the PAYE tax payer.</P>
    <P>&mdash; to reduce Exchequer borrowing progressively, and to effect this reduction essentially by eliminating the current budget deficit through a combination of measures, including wasteful and unjustifiable public expenditures, reducing the numbers employed in the public service and moderating the public service pay bill.</P>
    <P>&mdash; to increase, to the extent that was compatible with the Exchequer borrowing limits, public investment over the period of the plan and to employ more rigorous investment criteria for public investment.</P>
    <P>&mdash; to create an economic environment conducive to private investment <Col N="2032" /> and to bring the balance of payments deficit under control by increasing exports and by a programme of import substitution.</P>
    <P>Our real difference with, and criticism of, the Government in the area of economic policy is their decision to completely ignore and disregard the problem of unemployment.  A massive figure of over 200,000 is now apparently to be taken for granted.  It is quite clear from the policies and actions being pursued, and in one specific instance from what was actually said, that economic policy at present is not concerned with unemployment. The Taoiseach has stated in this House that the Government are pursuing policies diametrically opposite to those required by the unemployment situation. The Minister of Labour has given it as his view at the beginning of this year that unemployment would rise to 218,000 by the end of this year.  Have we really come to this?  Have we now given ourselves over totally to economic policies which inevitably lead to unemployment rising to and remaining at unacceptable and demoralizing levels?</P>
    <P>As the steadily rising numbers of unemployed are announced each month, the Government's statements which accompany them are becoming increasingly laconic.  The one issued on Monday last was coldly dismissive &mdash; simply a reiteration of the monetarist cliché about getting the public finances in order and restoring competitiveness.  This is simply not good enough.  The unemployment figures represent a social disaster.  The Government cannot turn their back on this situation and suggest by implication that it is not really their concern.</P>
    <P>Do the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance not understand the grim reality that lies behind these figures?  Can they appreciate the weary frustration of a young person who has answered scores of advertisements, filled in countless application forms and applied to firm after firm &mdash; all to no avail?  Do they understand the atmosphere in a household where not only the father or mother, but two, three or four children are all unemployed?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> Do they realise that there is widespread disillusionment among young people with the whole youth employment levy exercise, that they feel that they were cheated.  Do they know that many young people are cynical about being trained for jobs that do not exist?  There should now be a major revision of this whole scheme and a change-over to using the greater part of the fund for actual job-creation, as everybody thought when the scheme was introduced would be the situation.</P>
    <P>The crucial need is for policies which are genuinely favourable to employment. There is no point in bringing forward a series of isolated measures at the end of this month, as has been announced, if the whole budgetary strategy remains hostile to providing employment.</P>
    <P>At this time of the year many thousands of young people are leaving our schools and colleges and looking around to see where their future lies.  They have studied and worked, got through their exams, and now they want a job.  Surely there is something basically wrong with economic policies that require that they be told that they are not needed, that there is nothing for them, that they have no part to play, that they can just hang around.</P>
    <P>In addition to the production of consumer goods and the provision of consumer services, there is much else to be undertaken in this country: exploring and developing our natural resources; improving our urban environment; improving our countryside and our coasts; providing tourist amenities; building the many community facilities we still need.</P>
    <P>The challenge is to produce an economic strategy that, taking full account of our present financial situation, will succeed in harnessing the energy and ability of our young population to what needs to be done, an economic policy that will break the vicious circle of work needing to be done while the thousands who could do it are condemned to idleness.</P>
    <P>This cruel dilemma must be resolved. People need hope.  Everybody needs to have some sense of purpose or usefulness, <Col N="2034" /> and especially young people.  At present all is negative.  We are offered only hopelessness by this Government.  I am as certain as I am that the sun will rise tomorrow that there is an alternative; that we can develop economic and social policies that will break the barrier between high unemployment on the one hand and work waiting to be done on the other; that will give men and women the dignity and fulfilment that comes from contributing their share to the society of which they are part.  The first task is the psychological one of reversing the current devastating attitude of hopelessness. Those who have sought to depress and demoralise us have done their work well. The defeatist doctrine is expounded from every quarter.  It has almost succeeded &mdash; almost but not quite.  The tide can still be turned because hope and optimism are natural human attributes.  We must turn that tide.  We must reverse these attitudes.  We can do this by offering policies which are balanced in their approach, which recognise the need for corrective action and at the same time provide scope for development and employment.  That is how we see our role. That is the task that Fianna Fáil have set themselves and are now undertaking.</P>
    <P>This Government have shown a complete disregard of the contribution that Irish agriculture can make to the Irish economy.  They have done nothing to stimulate agricultural production or to support the food processing industry. The carefully prepared four year plan for agriculture has been scrapped and a whole range of production and investment incentive schemes have been cut. The cheap loan scheme for restocking was scrapped; the farm modernisation scheme suspended.  These actions, undertaken apparently for monetary policy reasons, indicate a short-term outlook and a failure to understand the potential for development of one of the most productive sectors.</P>
    <P>A much wider section of farmers are in financial difficulties than is generally realised.  The Government appear to be doing nothing to alleviate this situation. The Government have also taken a whole series of important land policy decisions <Col N="2035" /> that depart from the policy laid down in Fianna Fáil's 1980 White Paper, without any debate in this House.  It is quite apparent that, apart from realising the laudable aim of increasing land mobility as between elderly farmers and young progressive farmers, the changes could result in a new landlord system whereby wealthy individuals and financial institutions will be able to buy up large areas of land and then lease them out.</P>
    <P>The tragedy of Northern Ireland continues and indeed in many respects the situation can be regarded as having deteriorated. We must, nevertheless, constantly and unremittingly work for political progress.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the New Ireland Forum is an important development, but it is not taking place in a political vacuum. Since we set it up there have been important developments both in Northern Ireland and in Britain and others will follow in the normal course of events. The Government must have a coherent political strategy apart from which the Forum can carry on with its own particular specialised task.  This strategy should encompass developments here, in Britain and in the US.  It now appears that, despite early indications to the contrary, an Anglo-Irish Summit will take place before the Forum has reported.  This raises a number of complex questions. Particularly we must ask if the Forum and its work will be on the agenda for the summit meeting and, if so, in what context?</P>
    <P>Another issue which must feature in Anglo-Irish relations is the indiscriminate use of plastic bullets by the British army in Northern Ireland.  I recently met the parents of children who were killed by plastic bullets.  Each of them gave me simple but harrowing accounts of how their children met their tragic deaths.  The plastic bullet, it is clear, is a weapon of death, not a method of riot control.  It is moreover used by soldiers in armoured cars against innocent children.  No responsible politician condones violence of any kind or from any source.  Numerous serious complaints have been made by respected citizens of harassment and <Col N="2036" /> oppression of the nationalist population by the British army.</P>
    <P>It is our duty in every way open to us to demand that the use of these weapons, which are unacceptable, lethal and probably contrary to international provisions regarding human rights, be prohibited.  It should be made clear that, if we are not given satisfactory guarantees that the use of these weapons will be banned, Ireland will take a case against Britain to the Strasbourg Court of Human Rights.</P>
    <P>Another feature of this Government's eight months in office has been a lack of progress in promoting North/South economic co-operation.  The most serious example of this is the fact that negotiations over the supply of natural gas to Northern Ireland have not been brought to a conclusion.  I would like to ask also, whether the monitoring committee which the Taoiseach promised the Northern engineering union representatives has yet been set up?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil in Government were concerned to unify Irish-Americans behind the Irish Government's policy on Northern Ireland.  We believe that Irish-American opinion can be mobilised to inform and influence the American administration on the need for new political structures.  We had made considerable progress in this area last year.  But I am sorry to see that, following the change of Government, relations between the Irish Government and different sections of Irish-American community have deteriorated sharply again.  This is a regrettable failure of Irish leadership.  It represents a dissipation of diplomatic effort which should be constantly and firmly directed to informing American opinion of the Irish analysis of the Northern problem and the role that the United States can play in persuading Britain that the ultimate solution requires her withdrawal from Ireland.</P>
    <P>The recent visit of Vice-President Bush to Ireland has been a grave disappointment. I welcome his statements on the subject of Irish neutrality, which hopefully have confounded some of the critics of our neutrality at home and abroad. Unlike some other commentators, the <Col N="2037" /> Vice-President clearly betrayed no desire to decry our neutrality.</P>
    <P>Otherwise the visit achieved nothing. For some incomprehensible reason the Taoiseach apparently asked Vice-President Bush to do nothing about Northern Ireland at present.  Does the Taoiseach think that Irish-American opinion and Irish-American political effort is something that can be turned on and off like a tap in accordance with some obscure timetable of his own?  The very opposite is what is needed.  The British propaganda effort about Northern Ireland in the United States is constant, comprehensive and unremitting.  We must ensure that at all times there is a continuing Irish effort designed to ensure that both the political establishment and American public opinion are motivated in favour of positive American action towards a solution of the tragedy of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>We share with the Government a concern about human rights in Central America.  In this area also apparently the Taoiseach achieved nothing.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil condemn the escalation in the nuclear arms race and we urge that every effort be made to ensure the success of the current disarmament talks.  The Taoiseach apparently missed the opportunity to express the viewpoint of the vast majority of the Irish people on a matter on which the survival of the entire human race could depend.</P>
    <P>The continuing rise in all crime, but particularly in organised crime and drug trafficking, is a cause for deep anxiety. The alarming extent of the drug abuse problem, with all its attendant evils and appalling consequences for our young people, particularly demands urgent action.</P>
    <P>The Government have agreed to our proposal to establish a Select Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism to examine such aspects of the administration of justice, the implementation of the criminal law and existing legislation which, in the opinion of the committee, affect the personal safety and security of our citizens in their homes, on the streets and in public places, to report thereon and to make recommendations where appropriate.  There is no more important <Col N="2038" /> or urgent a task which could be given to a Select Committee of this House and I hope the committee will make a worthwhile contribution to this crisis situation.</P>
    <P>The first and most fundamental right of all men and women is to be able to live in peace, free from any threat of violence to their homes, their property or their persons.  We all have a heavy responsibility to uphold that right and to safeguard it for the Irish people.</P>
    <P>There has been a considerable amount of discussion this year about Dáil reform. It was also mentioned by the Taoiseach in his speech.  A large number of Parliamentary Committees have been established. It remains to be seen how effective these committees will be and what contribution they will be able to make.  A great deal of comment about them and the expectations that have been expressed in regard to them is, in my view, misdirected and I ask the question how much reality there is in all this advocacy of Dáil reform.  We have had the experience of, perhaps the most important single piece of legislation introduced in any year &mdash; namely, the Finance Bill &mdash; being put through this House on the basis of a complete stone-walling performance by the Minister for Finance. He put up the most wooden performance ever witnessed on a Finance Bill, refusing to accept anything of any significance from the Opposition benches in regard to the Bill.  It is valid to suggest that the Government are not serious about Dáil reform when that sort of thing happens. Any impartial observer would have to admit that in all the many suggestions and proposals we put forward in relation to the legislation there were a number that could have been accepted by the Minister for Finance in the genuine interest of a better taxation system and the public finances.</P>
    <P>Later we had the Tánaiste and the Minister for the Environment bringing in most objectionable and unprecedented legislation whereby the existing Planning Appeals Board will be abolished.  It was party political vindictiveness and the fact that that legislation, reprehensible in itself, was railroaded through the <Col N="2039" /> Oireachtas with the aid of a guillotine motion, again causes us to seriously doubt the sincerity of the Government. Real reform of the parliamentary process will only be achieved when serious arguments and responsible proposals from the Opposition are listened to and, if clearly beneficial, accepted.</P>
    <P>This Government are not managing the Irish economy in the best interests of the Irish people.  They have accepted some other criteria.  The policy is totally deflationary and as a result unemployment is soaring, with no attempt being made to stem the tide or tackle the evil. Our bright, educated young population is being betrayed and left without hope or prospects.  Crime, lawlessness, drug trafficking are threatening the very basis of our democratic society.  The personal safety and freedom of movement of many of our citizens can no longer be guaranteed. There is social deprivation and hardship.  A reasonably adequate education system, built up patiently and painfully over a long period of years, is being devastated.</P>
    <P>It is now at last being seen that personalised public relations campaigns and the packaging of political leaders and achieve only so much and that when the crunch comes there is no substitute for clear thinking, resolute leadership, a caring philosophy and enlightened policies.</P>
    <P>This Government have by now been clearly identified as the most confused Government in the history of the State. The cold truth is beginning to dawn even on themselves that they do not know what they are at.  I say to them: if you insist on staying there, befuddled and confused, then at least have the honesty to admit that you got it all wrong, that your policies are totally inappropriate to our circumstances and that you are going to begin again.  If you do that it will be our duty to give you every assistance we can to get it right the next time.</P>

      <P>At the outset I want to put before the House the Government's views on the role of agriculture in the national economy and their assessment of the prospects for the industry's future development.  First, let me stress that Government policy on agriculture, like that on every other sector of the economy, must be considered in the light of the critical economic circumstances we now face at home and abroad.  The general unemployment situation and the position of the public finances pose a greater challenge than any Irish Government have faced domestically since the early years of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The script will be available within a few minutes.  To solve our current serious problems, we must follow policies that will rapidly enhance the competitiveness of the goods and services we produce; we cannot hope to be able to sell goods abroad or to compete with imports if our prices are not right.  The decline in competitiveness in recent years has been responsible for much avoidable unemployment.  To remedy this it is necessary to have a radical improvement in management, a joint effort by management and workers to raise productivity sharply, and a prudent policy on incomes, all supported by continuing vigorous measures by the Government to reduce the rate of inflation.  The agricultural sector can make a major contribution <Col N="2043" /> towards the improvement of our economic fortunes but it too has to be subject to the disciplines which will bring about economic recovery.</P>
      <P>In an historical context, the Irish economy has had relatively little experience of industrialisation on a scale enjoyed by most of our trading partners. As a result, much of the burden of fuelling economic development in our small open economy has been carried by the agricultural sector.  Despite the declining share of agriculture's contribution to gross national product &mdash; from some 18 per cent in the early seventies to around 12 per cent in recent years &mdash; its pivotal role has remained.  The growth in industrialisation, as shown by our industrial sector's rising share of GNP, has been largely responsible for the apparent decline in agriculture's contribution to national output.  But this does not detract from the importance of the absolute level of that contribution which of course has a relatively modest import content.</P>
      <P>In the early and mid 1970s the relationship between agriculture and other sectors of the economy was one of shared increasing growth of output and incomes. Gross agricultural output increased by some 11.5 per cent between 1975 and 1978.  Over the same period family farm incomes increased by some 75 per cent in nominal terms and by over 20 per cent in real terms.</P>
      <P>However, the year 1979 brought a halt to the upward trend and there was a reverse in the fortunes of the agricultural sector with the rapid growth of output and incomes being replaced by decline. In volume terms gross agricultural output declined marginally in 1979 and remained virtually unchanged in 1980 while falling further in 1981.  This reflected primarily the fortunes of the cattle and dairy sectors. Cattle output, in volume terms, fell by 4 per cent in 1979, 5 per cent in 1980 and nearly 6 per cent in 1981.  While the output of milk continued its upward trend in 1979, it fell by about one per cent in volume terms in 1980 and 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These adverse movements in the volume of output were aggravated by adverse movements in the relationship <Col N="2044" /> between the cost of the farmer's inputs and the output prices received.  While the agricultural output price index showed and increase of 3 per cent over the period 1978 to 1980, the input price showed a 29 per cent increase.  As a result, farm incomes fell sharply and the farming sector came under severe pressure from which it has not yet recovered fully.  The relationship between input costs and output prices improved in 1981 but although farm incomes per head increased by 14 per cent in nominal terms they again fell slightly in real terms.</P>
    <P>Last year the picture showed a welcome change and we had some recovery following three poor years.  Output of milk increased by some 9 per cent and that of cereals by 5 per cent, while the output of sugar beet set an all-time record.  Because of these favourable developments gross agricultural output was up by some 3 per cent in volume terms.  As a result of some fall in the level of inputs used by farmers, net agricultural output increased by about 6 per cent. Family farm incomes per head grew by over 20 per cent in nominal terms which included the rate of inflation and gave a small but encouraging rise in real incomes.</P>
    <P>The outlook for the current year's performance is one of continued growth in farm output and incomes, but at a somewhat lower rate than that recorded last year.  Unfortunately, weather conditions for part of this year have not been as favourable as they might have been.  As a result farmers have had to incur extra expenditure on inputs and this will have an impact in the rate of growth.  However, with inflation continuing to decline the growth in nominal farm incomes should be reflected in some improvement also in real terms.</P>
    <P>A major element in the returns to farmers for this year should be the higher prices for all the major commodities arising from the satisfactory outcome to this year's EEC farm price negotiations.  In real terms the package is the best for some years.  The increases in the support prices taken in conjunction with the green pound revaluations represent an average rise in Irish prices of 9½ per cent. <Col N="2045" /> The price agreement also provides for an increase of 3.3 per cent in the buying-in co-efficients for our intervention beef, the continuation of the calf premium of £23 per head for livestock producers, the special additional FEOGA financing for suckler cows and the continuation of the AI and lime subsidies for a further year. It is estimated that the Irish farm sector will benefit from the package to the extent of £255 million in a full year.  This impressive income boost will benefit not only the farmers themselves but also the entire national economy.</P>
    <P>It will not surprise Deputies to hear me say that the Common Agricultural Policy has been meeting with serious difficulties. In one sense the problems are those of success, not those of failure.  While food shortages still persist in much of the world and even in some parts of Europe, supplies in the Community have out-run effective demand in a number of important sectors, and persistent surpluses have developed with consequent financial difficulties for the Community. Imports from countries outside the Community also play a part, as do trade distortions arising from arrangements in force in some member states.  The depressed conditions on world markets have made matters worse.</P>
    <P>In that regard, I am distinctly unhappy with the operation of the variable premium system in relation to beef as it is at present being utilised by Britain.  We have let it be known on numerous occasions at the Council of Agriculture Ministers that we object to what we consider to be an unfair trading advantage as a result of the operation of this subsidy, which was originally brought in to keep meat prices in Britain down but which now has been manipulated to provide subsidies for beef exports from Britain to fellow members in the EEC and also to third countries.  At present we are having discussions with the British Ministry of Agriculture in the hope that they will agree to eliminate this subsidy.  If those discussions are not fruitful, I will be taking further action through the Commission.</P>
    <P>We are unhappy about the manner in which the Milk Marketing Board in Britain <Col N="2046" /> are carrying out their operations to the detriment of the milk industry here. The degree of cost subsidisation whereby milk products such as butter and cheese are produced at relatively low prices is against the spirit of the Community, and I am glad to see that the Commission have issued a reasoned opinion on this subject, declaring that the activities of the British Milk Marketing Board are contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  I hope due cognisance of that reasoned opinion will be taken by the British Government.  If not, we, together with An Bord Bainne will take the necessary action, and I hope the British will agree without having to be forced to do it by the European Court.</P>
    <P>Another important contributory factor to the difficulties in regard to milk products has been the depressed condition of world markets and the intervention of the US into world markets, in particular a number of markets which were being supplied by An Bord Bainne. We have learned that the Americans are giving inducements to countries which were our customers to buy their products. I hope some agreement can be reached between the EEC and the US so that we will not have to enter into a price war, from which neither of us would gain.  It is a disturbing trend.  We have lost a number of very valuable markets in the Carribbean area and in Central and South America.  However, I am delighted to see that An Bord Bainne have won some very useful markets in Russia and Algeria which will earn us a considerable amount of money.</P>
    <P>The Common Agricultural Policy has provided very substantial benefits to this country, by way of price and market supports for our farm products.  But to my mind the most important benefit of all has been free access to the markets of other member states.  Agriculture is still of far greater significance in Ireland than in much of the rest of the Community. We have throughout regarded the maintenance of the basic principles of the Common Agricultural Policy as a major policy aim.  It is gratifying that the recent European Council in Stuttgart reasserted the Community's support for those principles. <Col N="2047" /> It is precisely because the CAP is so important to us that we must participate actively at Community level in dealing with the problems of market balance that have emerged.</P>
    <P>One of the decisions made at Stuttgart was that all the existing Community policies would be examined over the following six months, with particular attention to the CAP.  I would like to stress that the examination will not be directed solely towards making savings.  It is also to aim at modernising the various policies and making them more effective. Clearly, the existence of market imbalances will be a major element in the examination of the CAP.  The Community must show itself capable not only of solving that problem but of solving it in an equitable and sensible way.  We will do everything in our power to ensure that farm income requirements are taken into account, that internal distortions between member states are properly dealt with and that any burdens imposed on Community producers are shared by suppliers outside the Community.  I will be adopting a very firm stand where imports from third countries are affecting markets for Irish agricultural produce. We must do that if this attempt to interfere with the Common Agricultural Policy is pursued by certain member states who are benefiting from these imports from third countries.  We will of course, attach special importance to ensuring that adjustments or modifications or any new arrangements will allow Irish agriculture the opportunity of improving its productivity and of exploiting its potential.</P>
    <P>The concrete decisions to be taken at the end of this year or in 1984 will be decisions by member states.  It would be naive to assume that nothing in the detailed CAP arrangements would change or that any member state could totally avoid playing its part in restoring market balance.  But given the importance of agriculture to our whole economy and the contribution which increased agricultural production can make to national progress, it is essential for us that we should continue to have <Col N="2048" /> the scope and opportunities that will enable this major sector of our economy to expand.  I am confident, however, that with the support of some other member states we will at the end of the day reach solutions that will be both effective and equitable.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be over-optimistic in that regard.  The whole future financing of the EEC must give rise to great concern in this country because there obviously is a concerted attempt by some of the major states within the EEC to see that spending in agriculture is reduced or at the very least stabilised.  This is diametrically opposed to our interests and we will have to be very vigilant to see that this type of attitude does not succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should now like to say something about the cattle and milk sectors which are the basis of the whole agricultural industry.  On the one hand, whereas cattle prices have remained at reasonably good levels, on the other hand many of our meat plants are working at well below their capacity.  The industry is, therefore, somewhat unbalanced and to remedy this we need a significant rise in cattle numbers.  We have gone to considerable lengths to try to increase numbers by providing a whole series of incentives which in essence give a person in a disadvantaged area subsidies to the extent of £169 for a cow and calf and in the other areas £118.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the recent EEC price negotiations we got a continuation of the calf premium and the cow suckler premium and more <Col N="2049" /> important is the fact that we secured a valuable improvement in the buying-in price for beef.  It means that the increase for beef in the current year will be in excess of 14 per cent, which is a substantial figure.  There is a general appreciation among the farming community that it is a very generous increase and it has done a lot of good for our cattle and beef trade.</P>
    <P>Beef is a highly export-oriented industry. In fact we export over 80 per cent of our total output.  That is very significant because repeatedly in recent weeks people have been saying: &ldquo;Why do you not stop the import of potatoes, vegetables and what not?&rdquo;.  We export three times as much agricultural produce as we import.  If we were to interfere with fellow members of the Community exporting agricultural produce to this country we could suffer very severely by retaliatory measures.  We export three times as much as we import.  Eighty per cent of our beef production is exported.</P>
    <P>The Government are fully committed to the concept of maximising beef processing, thereby creating greater employment and reducing the balance of payments through greater exports of addedvalue products.  Over the years successive Governments have worked &mdash; do not say I did not give you credit &mdash; to ensure that the detailed EEC arrangements for beef are as favourable as possible to exports in processed form.  Considerable success has been achieved in this and we are continuing to work on a small number of remaining problems.  I consider that in the review of the CAP to which I have already referred, it is most desirable that consideration should be given to how best the Community can ensure that encouragement is given to the processing of agricultural products within the Community. Export refunds should, in my view, be so adjusted that employment is provided within the EEC and not in third countries.</P>
    <P>Last year saw an increase of about 8.5 per cent in creamery milk deliveries. Deliveries in the first six months of this year increased by over 10 per cent and it now looks as if the increase for the year as a whole will be 6 per cent or 7 per cent or even more.  Given the very bad <Col N="2050" /> weather in the late spring and early summer this is a remarkable performance, which testifies to the technical abilities and renewed confidence of Irish dairy farmers.  Nevertheless the increased volume of deliveries allied to the reasonable EEC price settlements and the lower level of inflation should result in a further real increase in dairy farmers' incomes this year.</P>
    <P>While the rise in milk production is very encouraging, developments in the milk sector generally are a cause of some concern.  Rising production virtually everywhere, increasing stocks and the economic recession have seriously depressed the world market.  Increasing deliveries of milk are therefore leading to a huge build-up of intervention stocks which have consequential and substantial budgetary implications for future years. In this regard I would like to say that we must get away from the traditional milk processing techniques adopted in this country if we are to get away from intervention. We must diversify.  Our partners in Europe are getting considerably better prices for their milk produce and have much more success in selling their products because they have diversified on such a large scale.  We badly need to do it.  There is need for more imagination and investment by our processors.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that intervention surpluses are building up.  The more they build up the more pressure there comes from some of the other member states of the Community to cut back on prices.  The only answer to that is for us to be able to sell products other than through intervention. The only way to do that is by diversification.  I am glad to note that some processors have entered into very costly campaigns to do just that, to sell other products on the larger European markets.  However, I am not happy that sufficient processors are becoming involved in such diversification.  In those circumstances it is certain that we will be faced with further proposals aimed at moderating the rate of increase in milk deliveries and at limiting the cost of the EEC milk policy.  The Government will be pressing to ensure that, whatever action is taken, will not prevent our <Col N="2051" /> industry from developing to its full potential. There is a gap between our level of development and that which is normal in the Community.  We must continue to reiterate that when we are seeking special terms for our agricultural industry, that our industry should not be compared with some of what are almost factory-farm type industries on the Continent.</P>
    <P>Over the past few months feed grain has been scarce and expensive.  As part of the prices negotiations, I am glad to say that we have been able to get 50,000 tonnes of intervention wheat from Germany.  This has now come on the market as animal feed and is being sold at prices between £12 and £15 a tonne cheaper than those prevailing for feed wheat up to recently.  Because of our island situation, because of our normal lack of any great surplus in cereal production, our consequent need for imports and our lack of port facilities to take in very large shipments, we tend not to be competitive by comparison with other member states both in regard to prices for animal feed and for cereals for human consumption.  This was brought home to us very vividly in the past year or two with the problems encountered in the flour milling industry.</P>
    <P>The result of our lack of competitiveness is also demonstrated in other ways. I should like to emphasise our need to produce more cereals to meet all our needs both for humans and animals and also the need for competitiveness in production. Our milling industry has done quite a bit in that regard and a number of them are now very competitive.  They have faced up very courageously to the challenge posed by imports.</P>
    <P>In the horticultural sector, Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, and I have had talks with a number of interested groups with a view to improving the competitiveness and marketing efficiency of our industry.  Deputy Haughey deplored the fact that our food processing industry was in such a state.  That industry is not in a deplorable state because we have been in Government for the past six months. That has built up over the past 20 years. Unfortunately the Sugar Company's venture <Col N="2052" /> into the food processing sector was a distinct failure.  We must look at it again and that is what we are doing.  Therefore, let us not be unreasonable, blaming people for failures which occurred 20 years ago.  The whole structure of that industry was such as not to be competitive. We shall just have to become competitive. It is up to private individuals and companies to enter into that area.  We, as a Government, will give them every possible assistance.</P>

      <P>We are starting off on the right foot in setting up horticultural groups so that, in conjunction with the farming organisations and private individuals who wish to enter into the processing sector, we can take on these foreign imports.  We hope that we can compete but it will not be an overnight success story.  It will take time.  It will be a matter of years rather than days, weeks or months.  However, we are giving every possible assistance to the setting up of producer groups.</P>
      <P>I have stated publicly that I would like to see the utilisation of Kinsale natural gas for the glasshouse industry, particularly in North County Dublin where it is intensified.  It can and should be done. I have asked horticultural interests for their views on this.  I shall be strongly advocating to the Government that such gas should be made available to allow growers in that area to compete with their counterparts on the Continent.</P>
      <P>To deal now with the disease eradication programmes, I might say that the Brucellosis Eradication Scheme has been a real success.  Perhaps the TB scheme has not had the same spectacular success. But I think we are on the verge of a real breakthrough, as I illustrated recently in the House during Question Time, when I gave figures showing that the incidence of TB in cattle is showing a significant decline, which is very heartening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, I should like to refer briefly to land policy.  For many decades the primary aim of Land Commission policy has been the enlargement of undersized holdings. <Col N="2053" /> A complementary aim has been the rearrangement of intermixed and fragmented holdings into compact workable units.  In the operation of this policy it was necessary to reconcile the purely economic aim of maximising agricultural production with the social aim of protecting and improving the fabric of rural society.  Because of increasing legal constraints and of soaring land prices, the operation of this traditional policy has encountered mounting difficulties in recent years and the annual amount of land being acquired has declined steadily. At the same time there has been a demand for a reappraisal of a land policy. It has been widely claimed that not only was the traditional aim of the relief of congestion not being achieved but that the aim itself was not an appropriate one for the agriculture of today.  How much time do I have left?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Agriculture can make its optimum contribution to the economy only if all our productive land is fully exploited.  Various studies have shown that structural conditions significantly affect the potential for growth.  One-third of our agricultural land is occupied by farms on which the household and labour situation are such that growth in output is unlikely to take place.  The owner-occupier system tends to be inflexible and accounts for our exceptionally low rate of mobility and structural change.  By far the bulk of land transfers are within families, only a very small percentage reaching the open market.  The solution is to increase our rate of mobility so that the more enterprising farmer will have access to the pool of under-utilised land.</P>
      <P>I have, therefore, determined on a change of emphasis in land policy from the traditional aim of the relief of congestion towards one calculated to create the conditions which will stimulate the optimum rate of structural change &mdash; that is, to get land into the hands of those willing and able to develop it to its full potential.</P>
      <P>In implementing such a policy I am changing the basic role of the Land Commission. Rather than being a body directly involved in the acquisition and distribution of land, it will function as a development agency which will provide a positive and constructive service to people who want help in solving their land problems.  In this I have in mind such tasks as the encouragement of groups of farmers to get together to purchase land, and the rearrangement into more compact units of scattered and intermixed holdings.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the negligible area on open sale each year and, at the same time, wishing to preserve the traditional right of the Irish farmer to ownership of his land, I have for some time been interested in encouraging leasing.  As a land management system this will separate the concepts of ownership and use, and will allow those needing land to have access to it while the rights of the owner are&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I would like to clear up some fears which the Opposition spokesman has voiced about leasing.  He seems to envisage a situation in which companies will put up farms with a view to leasing them to tenants, thus recreating the old landlord system.  Let me assure him that nothing has happened to change the position as it has existed since 1965. All companies, whether Irish or foreign, require the consent of the Land Commission to purchase agricultural land.  These controls will continue to be exercised as in the past.  The Opposition spokesman also wished me to impose the controls proposed in his party's White Paper.  The simple fact is that the PLV system, on which these controls were to be based, has been declared unconstitutional.  Any further consideration of the controls must await adoption of an alternative system of valuation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not see fit to observe what I thought to be a gentleman's agreement between the Whips.  I await instructions from my Whip as to what the position is now.  I thought that, in the interest of accommodating as many speakers as possible from both sides, an agreement had been reached not to have <Col N="2057" /> 45 minutes speeches but 30 minute contributions after the two main speakers.</P>
      <P>I will not go into detail about the comments of the Minister for Agriculture; I will leave that to Deputy Noonan.  This ill-fated Coalition Government are creaking earlier and more noisily than any of their predecessors.  We have seen a difficult economic situation worsening with little or no light on the horizon for the thousands who are unemployed and those who left school in recent weeks. The central theme of my contribution will be unemployment because it is the most serious problem facing us.  It is a topic that must be given attention by all sides in this debate.</P>
      <P>Earlier this week we were told that 189,000 were unemployed but, according to this morning's issue of the <i>Irish Independent,</i> an EEC study has put the number of our jobless at 210,000.  The Minister for Labour anticipates that the figure will rise to 218,000 this year and the EEC study indicates that the figure issued this week is conservative.  We have not had any response from the Government other than to be told that a task force of Government Ministers had been set up and would be making major announcements shortly.  After eight months in office the Government have not taken any action to improve the unemployment situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation has taken a serious setback from that which obtained when a motion of no confidence was tabled by the parties now in Government in November last.  I suggest that the press should inform themselves of the situation rather than allowing themselves to be fed by a strong group of public relations people attached to the Government.  The debate of 3 and 4 November last year makes interesting reading and must be causing embarrassment, particularly for the Ministers and Ministers of State.  At that time Fianna Fáil produced a document, <i>The Way Forward</i>.  Within a matter of weeks we had produced the Estimates for 1983 and, were it not for the collapse of our Government, they would have been discussed here.  There has been a drastic cutback on those Estimates since, and this morning we heard a Minister <Col N="2058" /> saying that £200 million was cut from our Estimates on the capital side.  That culminated in higher unemployment. The Labour Party have accepted all those monetarist decisions and efforts at financial rectitude by the Minister for Finance and the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>The term of office of the Coalition followed immediately on seven months of an irresponsible Opposition during which we had the leaders of the Opposition parties &mdash; one has since been absorbed by the major party &mdash; making all sorts of attacks on our Government. I should like to compare the position that applied to the public service pay discussions last year with what took place this year.  The then leader of the major party in Opposition ended his holiday in France suddenly and, amid a glare of publicity, made a beeline home to, as he said, rescue the industrial chaos our Government were creating.  To his eternal discredit he was trying to disrupt the progress being made in those talks, which were difficult for the trade unions and the Government. Last week I paid tribute to the civil servants who worked on my side in those talks and I omitted to pay tribute to those who worked opposite me in the effort to reach a solution in the national interest. An effort was made to undermine that solution by the leader of the major party in Opposition for a mean political purpose and that purpose was closely protected from the press by the packaging of his handlers.  Those handlers now decide whether or not the Taoiseach should take the Order of Business here or whether he should appear on an RTE chat show. Yesterday, because of his badly tarnished image, they decided that he should not attend here, although it is the most important week of the Dáil session because we are about to go into recess. They decided instead that it would be better for his image to be on the radio chat show.  Some of his most diligent and loyal supporters in the media up to now have described his participation on the chat show as a dismal failure.  Obviously his handlers will have to think again.</P>
    <P>I want to compare our approach to the public sector pay talks with that of the Taoiseach.  I was anxious that the talks <Col N="2059" /> should continue but the statements emanating from Government saying that there should be no increase were not helpful to the Minister for the Public Service.  There are people in the public service who have a strong commitment and who work very hard, for instance, in education; and on the law scene the gardaí work very efficiently.  Many members in the public service are diligent in their work and they deserve to be treated fairly no matter how difficult the times. The only way forward was a negotiated package and an agreement being reached.  I hope that the package that has been worked out by the negotiators will be accepted in the national interest.</P>
    <P>However, it must be stated that the Minister for Finance in his budget, the Taoiseach in his many public utterances and the Minister for the Public Service in some of his comments did not make the task of negotiating that package any easier.  Obviously the amount of money needed will be of major concern to us. People in public life do not have holidays. The Dáil may be in recess but much work remains to be done.  We will be listening carefully to the Government's proposals. Last Sunday the Minister for Finance stated that further cuts would be necessary and this has also been indicated in the media.  If this Government have succeeded in out-shining any of their predecessors it is in the sphere of public relations.  I often charged the Government of which Deputy Kelly was Chief Whip with being experts in that field&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>They were not expert enough to win the 1977 election.  Their public relations did not do them as much good as the manifesto did for Fianna Fáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>However, their expertise pales into insignificance when compared with the performance of the present regime.  That is the only thing they have going for them, but that kind of public relations and public exposure is no substitute for commitment, dedication, vision and hard work at a time when they are so badly needed in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2060" /> We supported the efforts on both sides on the question of public service pay.  The major difficulty facing the country is unemployment &mdash; a figure of perhaps 210,000 and one that is increasing.  However, there has been nothing from the Government but attacks on State bodies and this morning the Minister for Agriculture continued that attack.  It is more or less indicated now that it is almost an offence to be associated with or employed by a State-sponsored body. That points a finger at my area &mdash; Cork &mdash; where there are major industries in which the State is involved that are going through difficult times.  Despite the very high unemployment level in that area as well as in others, the attacks are continuing on State-sponsored bodies and the indications are that there is a serious possibility of further job losses in many of the industries.</P>
    <P>In this connection I refer to Irish Steel and announcements during the week that future decisions had been postponed until December.  A decision was taken in June to continue until December but the decision after that will be taken in Europe.  I say to the Government that we will not accept any decision from them other than that Irish Steel will continue. Not only are they a major employer but they are vital for strategic purposes to industrial development and construction work.</P>
    <P>Verolme were discussed in this House some weeks ago, but other than negotiations regarding redundancy for 400 workers there has been no progress in the placing of shipping orders.  I warn the Government that we will watch the situation very closely.  Unless orders are placed as a matter of urgency there is little point in the Minister for Industry and Energy saying to the company to pick up what they can in a depressed market and the Government will subsidise them. That may be all right in the long-term but in the short-term there is need for one or two orders that have been discussed for quite some time.</P>
    <P>The Irish Refining Company have been referred to this morning in the debate.  In my opinion they have been unfairly attacked because of the power of some of <Col N="2061" /> the multi-nationals and their investment in creating good public relations.  In the past the Irish Refining Company have made a valuable contribution in the hands of the multi-nationals and since they reopened last year under the INPC. There has been considerable progress in this area and the people concerned are quite happy.  The orchestrated attacks that have been made on the company are of no help.  Government spokesmen should have explained the true position. The project is a valuable industry not only in the employment it gives in the Cork harbour area and the extra activity generated but also because of its strategic importance to our economic and industrial development.</P>
    <P>In the media last week we learned that CIE will have major lay-offs, that there will be a curtailment of their services and that they will have to live within a certain amount of money.  We have not been given any details in the House but I expect that during this debate the Minister for Transport will spell out what is involved.  There should be an honest approach to this matter.  Whether one takes the figure of 210,000 or 190,000 as the correct one in respect of the unemployed, it is obvious the matter is serious. That must be our top priority.</P>
    <P>Because of a certain allegiance by the Taoiseach to the British Prime Minister, an impression that he likes to model himself on her performance, he may be tempted to think he can succeed in emulating her performance in the recent British election.  The Taoiseach would be well advised to discard any ideas he has on that point.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the commitment of this party to a &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign. Because of our efforts with regard to import substitution it was estimated that over £100 million additional money went to Irish manufacturers in 1980-81. For the information of the House I should like to quote from this week's edition of the publication <i>The Phoenix</i>.  While I cannot vouch for its accuracy, the Government should at least investigate to see if the story is true.  It is headed &ldquo;A Kerry Joke&rdquo; and reads as follows:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2062" /> Here's one that Dick Spring might care to look into.  A few weeks ago, his Environment department gave a massive grant to the new library in Tralee. As one might expect, Tralee got more money than most of the other libraries in the country put together.  But there was a reason.  Since the library is new, it needs lots of new, expensive equipment like the £100,000 of shelving which has just been erected.  The catch is that the shelving came from Britain, while up in Connacht, Galway Steel Fabrications is closing down due to lack of orders of this kind.  Dear, oh dear.</P>
    <P>I cannot vouch for the above claim but it merits investigation because some Government Departments and State boards are careless in their attitudes to buying Irish.</P>
    <P>Why is there high unemployment in Cork?  Deputy Quinn on 3 November 1982 when referring to the decision of our Government to have An Foras Forbartha decentralised to Cork, cited the case of the Minister for the Environment having ordered An Foras Forbartha to be transferred from Dublin to Cork.  He said it was done without any consultation among the staff and that the Minister had taken this action in order to erect a property development on the quay in Cork. In other words, to make possible a private development, he ordered a Government body to be transferred, at considerable cost, from Dublin to Cork.  The development on the quays in Cork, which Deputy Quinn referred to, was very important to the economic development of Cork and we had hoped there would have been about 1,600 building jobs there lasting for a period of two years.  However, the building industry in Cork is more depressed than it has ever been, even in the bad fifties.  It would have been a fine inner city scheme and would have resulted in a big improvement in the city centre.</P>
    <P>The Coalition Government have mercilessly exposed the empty posturing and political bankruptcy of the Labour Party as has been clear from virtually every <Col N="2063" /> conference of trade unionists.  The Labour Party have lost the confidence of the Labour movement and have no answer to our economic problems.  They are prepared to provide vital support to the implementation of monetarist policies.  Present policies could not be pursued but for the support of Labour Ministers in Government.  Is there any other country in Europe where a Labour and, supposedly, socialist party are collaborating with right wing political forces of a Government that are copying the economic policies of the American and British Governments?  The Labour Party Taoiseach &mdash; I call him that advisedly &mdash; spent most of his time in Stuttgart congratulating Mrs. Thatcher on her victory over the Irish Labour Party's so-called fraternal comrades in Britain.  I wonder if they compared the Irish Labour Party with the British Labour Party.  One need only compare the Fine Gael-Labour programme for Government sold to Labour Party delegates in Limerick with what has happened since to see how the Labour Party have been totally routed by the Fine Gael Party in the main areas of economic policy.  The vital understanding, which was broken almost immediately, was that the Government would not pursue severely deflationary policies and that they would take less money out of the economy than Fianna Fáil did. There was to be £100 million extra provided immediately for urgent construction projects; £200 million was to be provided for a national development corporation and a higher budget deficit was projected.  What has happened to them?  Instead of providing £100 million extra for construction, the capital budget was savagely cut by about £263 million, hence the plight of the building industry to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>It has been disputed whether the budget was really aiming for a higher budget deficit of £900 million.  Some observers think the Minister for Finance may have been aiming at a lower figure although if the economy is wildly deflated he may miss his target completely.</P>
    <P>The construction industry is mainly the responsibility of the Minister for the <Col N="2064" /> Environment.  The Minister and his Minister of State are Labour Party Members and it shows how little clout that party had when they were not even able to implement the single most important commitment of the Limerick document, from their point of view.  In the <i>Official Report</i> of 3 November, 1982, volume 338, column 782, Deputy Quinn said:</P>
    <P>But if you live in a two-roomed flat in Pearse House and you are 79th on the waiting list and they are going to build only 50 houses in your area because of cutbacks, it is not much consolation to learn that the new Minister for the Environment is a very nice, compassionate and concerned individual who will explain to you more gently and with greater sympathy the reason why he can do as little for you as his predecessor did,...</P>

      <P>Deputy Kelly is trying to stop me and the reason I niggled with the Minister for Agriculture was in Deputy Kelly's interest as well as mine. I note an interesting little battle being waged between Deputy Barry and Deputy Bruton on the one side and other Deputies, more closely associated with the building trade, on the other.  I should like to know who is telling the truth about a building project in Cork near Innishannon. On 16th February the Minister for Industry and Energy spoke about a £75 million investment in land, buildings, plant and machinery for that project. Deputy Barry supported that figure.  It was also said that it would give employment to 800 people but we think that figure could not be correct and that the Government are trying to cloud the issue. What is the correct number of jobs which will be provided?  I suggest it is between 250 and 400 jobs but we are entitled to know the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The biggest problems facing the country at present are unemployment and job creation.  The Youth Employment Agency was established with a lot of <Col N="2065" /> pomp and publicity.  It was a product of a Labour Party document prior to the election and the members of the board were named during the February 1982 election campaign.  The chief executive was appointed by the Minister for Labour the day before I assumed office in March 1982.  Mark you, the CEO was a former adviser to the Labour Party Minister for Labour.  Despite that, when a member of the agency kicked up a public fuss I defended that appointment privately and publicly.  It was a good appointment, I thought.  I thought it was above politics and I defended it in the public interest and in the national interest.  Strangely enough, the individual who created the fuss is now an adviser in the Minister of State's office in the Department of Labour and so I begin to wonder was there as much interest in job creation by the Youth Employment Agency as there was in fixing up certain people?</P>
    <P>Now why am I being critical of the agency?  It is because no progress is being made.  We were told in May there would be a new announcement on community involvement and development.  Nothing happened in May.  In June the Minister said it would be launched.  We are now heading into the middle of July and it has not been launched.  Yesterday Deputy Flynn spoke about the food subsidies.  I am glad he did because there should be some protector of the underprivileged.  I add my voice to that of Deputy Flynn and I warn Labour Party Ministers in Government: hands off subsidies.</P>
    <P>What progress has been made by The Youth Employment Agency?  I supported it even when I saw political appointments were being made.  I supported it in the national interest and in the interest of our young people.  Progress has been very limited indeed.  There is some concern about other agencies and, instead of having greater co-ordination, there would seem to be more clashes now than there were prior to the agency being set up.  I will support any move made by the agency but I warn the Government now that young people are becoming disillusioned.  No jobs have been created.  Some training programmes which were already in existence before <Col N="2066" /> the agency started have been supported by it financially and otherwise but I do not know of any new steps being taken by it.</P>
    <P>The present state of industrial relations, the strikes and rumours of strikes are the result of the budgetary policies of the Minister for Finance.  I sympathise to a certain extent with the Minister for Labour who seems prepared to stand back and let everything solve itself.  That is not much help to Deputy Kelly's constituents who are suffering as the result of a strike in Dublin Corporation.  There has been no intervention by the Minister for Labour, by the Tánaiste and, indeed, no word from the Government benches. I was pilloried on many occasions and asked what I was doing about strikes and one of those who pilloried me was Deputy Kelly.  He is keeping very quiet now when his own Ministers are allowing a similar situation to develop.  Let us hear from Deputy Kelly.  Let us hear him tell the Ministers to go and do something.  I spent many weekends in the Department helping by way of intervention when I could, perhaps, have been working in the interests of my constituents.  As Minister one has to accept the responsibilities that go with the office as well as enjoying the benefits.  The central plank in our platform is unemployment and the patent neglect of this Government to do anything about it.  The policies adopted appear to be clearly signalling 250,000 or more unemployed by the year's end.  That situation is the responsibility of this Government.  Stop preaching gloom and doom.  Stop downgrading activity and stop insinuating it is a sin to be associated with or to work in a State-sponsored company.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I heard a good part of Deputy Haughey's speech and all of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's and I hope neither will be unduly offended if I say both speeches radiate staleness and flatness. Both were about as exciting as one's sensations on going into a room in an unoccupied house and finding the only literature with which to while away half an hour is the 1968 Telephone Directory.  I could hear nothing in what I heard of <Col N="2067" /> Deputy Haughey's speech or Deputy Fitzgerald's that could remotely be classified by even the most friendly critic as a new idea.  They said nothing that gave me a second's surprise or stimulation.</P>
      <P>I know it is not easy to produce the answers, and the Opposition have to do their best, but their best on this occasion is pretty much like their best on other occasions and, to be fair to them, I do not suppose a great deal worse than contributions from us when we sat on the Opposition benches.  However, I cannot let Deputy Haughey's contribution go without drawing a contrast between the message of hope he was trying to extract from the Government and the certitude he was anxious to express that there were hundreds of thousands of jobs only waiting to be created.  I cannot help contrasting that with his performance when he was actually in the seat of power itself. When he was there &mdash; I do not regard it as disobliging of me to point out something like this&mdash;nothing happened except that all the economic indicators steadily got worse and everybody knew why they were going to get worse.  It was because he, although having promised to perform, embarked on measures of utter recklessness in the latter part of the 1979 to 1981 period and continued those measures of recklessness during the brief interim when he was here a little over a year ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to all the indicators getting worse, in addition, in other words, to unemployment continually rising&mdash;although he now apparently has the secret of finding hundreds of thousands of jobs at the drop of a hat&mdash;in addition to the State's debt going through the ceiling, in addition to the trade deficit reaching new records every time it was published, we had all that and we had continuous scandals too.  We had grotesque mismanagement of the economy, at least if I am to go by the indicators which were the worst things happening to go by, and bad standards as well as non-stop skulduggery and throat cutting, non-stop intrigue, non-stop headlines which only had the effect in the end of distracting people's minds <Col N="2068" /> from things to which they ought to have been attending.</P>
    <P>We had all that.  We had the recklessness plus the scandals plus the equally reckless mismanagement of the country's external relations in matters, at any rate, concerning the North of Ireland and Britain.  He appeared to go out of his way to leave this country in a worse situation than he found it.  Even when there was no need for him to open his mouth, he appeared to look for a way of leaving us in the doghouse with the British, and not just with the British, which is not difficult, but with most of the rest of the EEC. At the time of the Falklands crisis there was no need for him to go out on a limb about that.  There was no need for him to take up the line he did but that had to be done in order to conciliate the most primitive strata of domestic opinion.  These are the predominant factions with which Fianna Fáil sympathise.  They relentlessly fix their eyes on whatever is primitive and Deputy Haughey says to himself that, if he can get hold of what is primitive, there is a penumbra of about 30 to 35 per cent of the rest of the vote that will be dragged along by a kind of magnetic attraction. That is one of the secrets of Fianna Fáil's success, which I have to salute.</P>
    <P>Looked at as an exercise in electoral politics it has been very successful down the years.  But if we are trying to grow up a bit, if we are trying to pull ourselves out of the village standards that have damned us for the last 60 years, we will have to do better than that and pass up the opportunity to flatter primitive people with primitive ideas.  We will have to resist the urge to be well thought of by the most unreflecting people in the country and the most savage.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Haughey was speaking this morning I distinctly heard him speaking about plastic bullets.  As it happens, I agree with him about them.  But I did not hear him &mdash; at any rate, not in that part of his speech &mdash; say anything about the rally that will take place in Mullaghmore this weekend to commemorate nothing really except the murder of four innocent people, not one of whom, even the best known, ever did the country any harm and the presence of whom in that <Col N="2069" /> place on the day they were murdered had nothing to do with the North of Ireland. Perhaps I should not be so positive as I did not hear all of his speech, but I certainly noticed that while he spoke about the brutality of the British using plastic bullets &mdash; as I say I tend to agree that plastic bullets should be banned &mdash; he did not go out of his way to lend any moral support to the Government in the attitude they have rightly felt obliged to take in regard to this rally.</P>
    <P>It is a scandal and a disgrace.  It shows a new low in the moral sensitivity of the country when not only will groups acknowledge murders, claim murders, but celebrate murders.  I know that ostensibly it is for a different purpose.  But do not tell me that in the whole western or even the north-western seaboard there was nowhere else which might have been used for that purpose.  Do not tell me that there was no decent person somewhere in the ranks of their advisers, down to and including Deputy Blaney, who expressed some reservation about it, who would have said: &ldquo;Wait a moment, there is a kind of level beyond which we ought not to sink if only for public relations purposes&rdquo;.  If that voice existed it was ignored.  I did not hear Deputy Haughey or any of his party add their voice and throw their weight into the moral scale to try to rescue the country from the jungle.</P>
    <P>I am not impressed by the message of hope and all the sunburstary about the hundreds of thousands of jobs from a man and a faction in a party who have caused such misery to the country on the economic scene and on every other scene.  Before I leave the subject of Deputy Haughey, I want to say that when he pleaded we should not always be blaming his party for things that have gone wrong, I am inclined to sympathise with that too.  The condition the country has reached is one more for sorrow than for anger.  He is right in thinking that more must be expected from a Government than merely finding people to blame for the situation they have to deal with.  But Deputy Haughey is about the last man in Ireland from whom such words can come with any grace or conviction.</P>
    <P>I want to review, as quickly as the time <Col N="2070" /> available to me will allow me, the last seven months during which the Government have been here.  While I heard Deputy Gene Fitzgerald invite me to attack Ministers on the Front Bench for not settling strikes and to contrast my silence in that regard with what he thinks was my loquacity when he was Minister for Labour &mdash; I did not ever make much of a meal out of strikes except the postal strike &mdash; I will have a couple of things to say which may not be very welcome to them, if they bother about them at all, in regard to the Government's performance during the last seven months.  As everybody knows, the Government &mdash; there is no need to be mealy-mouthed about it &mdash; resulted from a political bargain.  I acknowledge that in all bargains it necessarily means that somebody has to forego something in order to gain something. There is no need to be upstage about that.  It has had the result that, so far from the submersion of the Labour Party Deputy Gene Fitzgerald was shedding tears about ten minutes ago, the Government &mdash; the big end, numerically speaking, which still is the Fine Gael Party &mdash; have been committed to at least two measures which have nothing to do with Fine Gael philosophy and which this party, left to themselves would, I believe, never have committed themselves to. Neither of them is insignificant and both of them are of a certain degree of importance. I hope they are not the forerunners of other things to come.</P>
    <P>It has to be acknowledged that they were fairly spelled out as part of the Government's programme when they took office.  I criticised them at that time and I have to criticise them again now. The first one is the provision in the Finance Bill for the residential property tax, about which I said enough on that occasion.  It is a form of taxation with no basis in reason and I believe very little basis in justice.  Alone among my party, I have always defended a wealth tax&mdash;not necessarily in all particulars the wealth tax of 1975&mdash;for reasons.  I will not repeat now.  I do not defend an irrational, ideologically inspired assault on only one visible form of wealth.  It may not even be wealth because in computing liability for <Col N="2071" /> this tax we are not allowed to take into account the equity&mdash;in other words, the extent to which the occupant of the House actually owns it as well.  That measure was wished on us&mdash;I do not want to make a meal of this&mdash;by the Labour Party and wished on the country by the Labour Party.  It is no more outrageous in its way&mdash;to use the word &ldquo;outrageous&rdquo; about it is perhaps to say too much about it&mdash;but it is no more unreasonable in its way than things wished on the country when Fianna Fáil were in office by the even smaller number of Deputies whom they had to conciliate.  I feel I have to keep saying that, when the smoke has cleared away after these deals, whether we are the big end of them or the Fianna Fáil Party, the majority of the people are getting what the majority of them do not want.  If that is democracy it is time we asked ourselves if it does not require a rebore.</P>
    <P>Another measure I am sorry to see the Government having gone along with, although it too was fairly and squarely signalled at the beginning of their term, are the provisions in the Postal and Telecommunications Bill which confer a monoply on the new companies.  If a postal service or a telecommunications service is working properly, I would defend the monoply.  If the service is working properly it is possible to compete with it unfairly by, as the Post Office workers very correctly say, singling out the profitable routes and trying to muscle in on them while not bothering with the unprofitable ones.  That is one reason why I would defend the monopoly of the public service when it actually is functioning and I would defend it also for reasons of order in the sphere of telecommunications. I would not defend it when the service has closed down.  We have succeeded with this Bill in making criminals out of people who propose to offer the public a substitute service, call it a courier service or anything you like, at a time when there may be no postal service in the country, as was the case for five months in 1979.</P>
    <P>I have to obey party discipline and it is not a point so serious as to be one of <Col N="2072" /> conscience.  I will not leave the party over it, vote against it or anything like that.  I want for myself to disclaim and disavow any belief in that dimension of the Postal Bill.  I believe it is constitutionally objectionable. Even if I am wrong about that, it is politically objectionable and it is not the kind of thing the Fine Gael Party are about and I believe it is not the kind of thing the Fianna Fáil Party are about either.</P>
    <P>I want to disavow and disclaim any idea for myself that what comes first in dealing with the public service is the interests of the employees.  That is not true and it is a shame and an abandonment of one's responsibility merely, in order to flatter a powerful union, not to say that clearly. In the operation of a public service the interests of the public come first.  The public interest comes first in judging a public service and secondly &mdash; although it may be a close second, it may be a very good second &mdash; and only secondly comes the interests of the employees.  I consider that to incorporate in legislation a provision which will put their interests uppermost in order to prevent competition, even when they have decided to close the service down, is something which this State is not all about, this party is not all about and the big party on the other side is not all about either.  I do not need to emphasise, because I am sure it will be done from the Opposition benches.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I need hardly stress that the crime situation is a matter of the greatest concern to me and to the Government and that the tackling of the problem is one of my priorities.  Unfortunately, we are living in an era when, in common with countries the world over, the incidence of crime has greatly increased.  It is clear that there are very many factors involved in the growth of crime and that there is no easy or complete answer to the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would not be possible in the course of a reply to parliamentary questions to set out in any detail the various measures to tackle the crime problem which are being taken or which are proposed or are under consideration.  I would refer the <Col N="2074" /> Deputy to my reply to the debate in the House on 4 May 1983 on the Second Stage of the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill.  The recent debate on the Estimates for my Department provided an additional opportunity for a full exposition of these matters.  In brief, specific measures being taken at present include increases in Garda manpower, improved deployment, improvement of Garda operating procedures and the provision of more modern equipment for the Garda, the further development of Garda community relations and the provision of additional prison accommodation. On the legislative front there is the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill to which I have referred and this is being followed by a further Criminal Justice Bill which I hope will be published at an early date and which will contain a number of measures that will strengthen the powers of the Garda in dealing with serious crime.</P>
    <P>With regard to the questions in relation to housebreaking and the mugging of citizens, the various measures which I have mentioned are relevant.  The Garda are fully conscious of the incidence of these particular offences and are constantly seeking ways and means of controlling the situation by altering manning levels and by changing patterns of patrolling. The general intention is to have an increased Garda presence in our cities and towns and already there has been a noticeable increase in the number of gardaí on the beat patrol duties.  I might add that the public could make a considerable contribution to crime prevention by exercising more care in the protection of their property.</P>
    <P>With regard to the setting up of a Dáil committee on crime, as proposed by Deputy Mitchell, the House agreed yesterday that such a committee be established with the terms of reference as set out on yesterday's Order Paper.</P>
    <P>As regards the newspaper report referred to by Deputy Mitchell, I am informed that subsequent to the report a person was charged in connection with this matter and that the case is at present before the courts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy has raised a number of inter-connected points and I will deal with them as follows.  First, the new commissioner has decided to employ more gardaí in uniform on the beat on foot than was hitherto the practice.  There is evidence of this now especially in our cities, and communities have gardaí regularly on foot patrol.  Traditional relationships which existed between individuals and communities and gardaí are being developed and strengthened by this.  Two other aspects are relevant.  Many of the extra gardaí now being deployed in the Dublin area are young and have recently been passed out of Templemore.  Consequently, it was quite clear earlier in the year that there was a need for sergeants to guide, encourage and organise these young gardaí who will be new to the job and in some cases new to the city.  The Minister for Finance has sanctioned the appointment of 100 sergeants, and 50 have been appointed.  Most of that 50 have been appointed to the Dublin area already.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thirdly, in the past there was a practice that gardaí would not be deployed near their home area.  That is changed and major benefits are seen now in the practice of appointing new gardaí who pass out from Templemore to areas near their own place of birth and near where they were schooled.  This will be of great benefit in Dublin.  Increasing numbers of young men and women in Dublin are applying for entry into the Garda and the practice now is as far as possible to deploy them in Dublin.  These people have experience of an urban background and many of their friends and relatives are living in the urban area.  Consequently, they know the scene and also they are in a better position to establish the close kind of community relationships which the Deputy has requested.  I am considering other initiatives to deal with the second point he has made about the relationships between members of the Garda and the general public.  I am aware of the importance of this as I have said on a number of occasions.  A rather trite statistic which is trotted out in support of <Col N="2077" /> various arguments is that half of our population is under 25 years of age: we should remember that when we are thinking in terms of community relationships with the Garda.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to Question No. 4: what plans has the Minister to deal with the question of housebreaking in urban and suburban communities?  How would the package relate to that?  The Minister has mentioned various aspects of community relations, but there is a great problem of insecurity in homes at present.  What measures has the Minister in mind or is he implementing at present to deal with that situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> In any area of crime there is first of all the detection of crime and then the prevention of crime.  The detection of housebreaking or burglary is carried out by the Detective Division of the Garda Síochána.  The deployment policy now of providing many extra uniformed gardaí on the beat will lead to the prevention of housebreaking and burglary.  That is a response to that problem and obviously, the response to other problems also.</P>
      <P>Another emerging situation is that many communities now as communities are organising to co-operate with the Garda and the idea of a community watch, which has been successful in the US and Britain, is being practised here in communities in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  Co-operation should exist between the Garda and communities, but there may be the difficulty of transferring the crime to an adjacent area certainly in the case of burglary and housebreaking.  Communities could help here by identifying the people involved in their community so that the names of those operating outside are known to the Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to Question No. 3, I thank the Minister for accepting my suggestion in regard to setting up a crime committee.  Will he ensure that this committee will review legislation as well as the use of Garda resources, and will he assure the House that the committee will receive the full co-operation <Col N="2078" /> of all the authorities involved and will be given the full assistance and any necessary back-up in carrying out their investigations and operations in the area of crime prevention?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The formal terms of reference of the committee were set out on yesterday's Order Paper, which I have not got to hand.  The Deputy can take it that anything which the members of the committee think appropriate to discuss and are worth while discussing can be discussed by them whether the matter is administrative or legislative. They are quite free to discuss legislation, certainly informally.  The Department and I as Minister can go beyond the terms of reference and be as helpful as we possibly can.  I see the committee as a very important sounding board of parliamentarians which will be of great benefit to me as Minister to give me a very accurate account of how communities and individual constituents perceive the various problems which we all admit are in this area at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has our full co-operation in an objective and constructive way in the work to be undertaken by that committee the setting up of which, as the Minister knows, we proposed. We welcome his setting up of this committee.  In relation to the last question on housebreaking, I am sorry to have to dwell on this but this is a very urgent problem, particularly in many of our suburban areas at present.  I accept that the Minister has said that extra gardaí will be on the beat and he has mentioned that some <i>ad hoc</i> home watch experiments will be carried out by communities.  Will he undertake to get some real support from the Garda for these home watch experiments?  I appreciate that they are being carried out on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, but surely the position at present is so urgent that we should have something more vigorous by way of experiment and back-up for these undertakings.  The problem is the question of bringing a package together that will get the kind of results we want.  I accept the points the Minister is making and I ask him to look urgently <Col N="2079" /> at the need for a package involving legislation, gardaí on the beat, support for the Garda and relations with the community so that they can be brought together in a practical way with a view to overcoming this problem.  Will he give an undertaking that during the recess he will have some attention brought to this problem?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree with the fundamental point that a package is necessary to deal with the problems as I perceive them now.  Maybe &ldquo;package&rdquo; is the wrong metaphor.  Perhaps we can talk about parts of a jigsaw which can be slotted in at various times over the coming months.  The Deputy is aware that the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Bill passed through the Seanad today.  This is a significant part of the picture.  Extra gardaí are a significant part; the deployment of the gardaí is significant; extra sergeants are significant; the Criminal Justice Bill which I will be introducing next session will be very significant. I accept that it is necessary to formalise the work of communities in association with the Garda.  The community watch idea is being discussed on the basis, unfortunately, of limited knowledge. There is the difficulty that what might solve the problem in one community might transfer the problem to an adjacent community, which has been the experience abroad.</P>
      <P>I take the point the Deputy has made and I am considering what approach can be made to achieving the result he has suggested.  The Garda are very much aware of the problem of community relations. We have appointed a chief superintendent specifically in charge of relations between the Garda and the community, but of course each individual garda in uniform must be the ombudsman for the force, and in the final analysis it is the personal relationships the individual garda on the beat builds up that will be most important, even more important than any structures we may come up with subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryHarney" hpid="Miss Harney Miss Harney">
      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to hear the <Col N="2080" /> Minister say he will have extra gardaí on the beat, but does he agree that it is desirable in large centres of population that each Garda station would have at least one female garda on duty at all times?  That being the case, would he ensure that in the foreseeable future all large Garda stations &mdash; in the Tallaght area, for example, where we have more than 60 gardaí there is not a female garda at the moment &mdash; will have a female garda?  Specific crimes related to women are causing great concern and indeed are causing a breakdown in the way law and order are being looked after in the area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I agree in general with what the Deputy has said. The deployment of ban-ghardaí to major Garda stations is very important for a variety of reasons, apart from community relations.  I will have a look at the situation in Tallaght.</P>

      <P>As many children are coming on to drugs at school, will the Minister consider providing protection for school-children even though it might mean moving gardaí from banks which contain only money which is not destroying people's lives?  Would the Minister also consider that the political will must be there to tackle and to solve the crime problem? Can he tell us when the junior Ministers' report on the drugs problem which has been undertaken in the last few months will be available?  Would he consider either meeting the Dublin Deputies or doing a special study of the drugs problem in the Dublin area where the problem is more serious than elsewhere?  Would he undertake to examine the efficiency of the Garda, regardless of the numbers patrolling the streets?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A special Ministerial task force on drug abuse have virtually completed their work and the report is available to the Government.  I suggest this might be an appropriate report for the new Select Committee to discuss at an early date.  I will be looking at the specific recommendations in that report in so far as they relate to my Department. <Col N="2081" /> On the question of protection for schoolchildren, I am not clear about the kind of protection the Deputy has in mind.  Obviously, in any caring community children should be protected by the entire adult community from exploitation and abuse, and if there is evidence of schoolgoing children being exploited by drug pushers, the recommendations in the report of the Ministerial task force will contribute to the solution of that problem.</P>
      <P>The deployment of gardaí is a matter for the Commissioner.  I approve of the changes he has made in deployment.  The efficiency of the Garda concerns us all.  I share the views of Deputies that we should try for maximum efficiency in the Garda.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the Garda are not being used to the maximum advantage of the community? Is it not a fact that gardaí must carry out work for the Central Statistics Office, going into farms, counting animals, mainly pigs, and surely this is a disgraceful situation?  Does the Minister agree that some of the offenders being released from our prisons have committed serious crimes?  We are keeping our prisons for cases of contempt of court while serious offenders are being released.  Is there not a big imbalance there?  Does the Minister not agree that the priorities for releases are not helpful to the common good or to helping community relations?</P>

      <P>In regard to the supplementary on prisons, there are numerous questions down on that subject and because this is probably the last day that Deputies will have an opportunity to raise it before October, and because we may not reach the questions, I should like to make a statement on the matter, with the Chair's permission.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Whereas the Minister for Justice has general power to mitigate sentences, he does not have any such power in cases of contempt of court.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Many submissions have been made at different times to the Department on the general idea of community policing.  Today I gave some of my views on the matter.  I pointed out that a chief superintendent has been appointed to concentrate on this area. The decision to employ gardaí on the beat in uniform is another way to try to establish a stronger community relationship. On the question of vigilante groups, in so far as they exist it is a rather limited problem but I deplore it.  It is outrageous that any group should set themselves up as enforcers of law and order.  There is one Garda force here and they only are <Col N="2083" /> responsible for law and order.  That is the way it will remain.  On the other hand, there is a strong case to be made for community groups to be involved in a type of community watch operation. They would in a formalised way establish relationships between a local community and the Garda and would, in effect, answer the appeal which has frequently been made by the Garda for the co-operation of the public.  That is interpreted quite frequently as the co-operation of individual citizens and I suggest that there is room for a response at community level also.</P>

      <P>In relation to Question No. 6, the question of very serious crime in the north city centre area, where a recent survey has shown that 12 per cent of teenagers are addicted to heroin, would the Minister tell us exactly what the position is now in relation to the Drugs Squad?  He made a statement on it in his Estimates speech which I took to mean that the Drugs Squad had been downgraded, that the chief superintendent we had put in to co-ordinate the activity in this area had been removed and that it had been amalgamated with the serious crime section and under a detective superindendent in that section.  Would the Minister tell us exactly what the position is because this is an extremely important area?  I am a bit concerned about the Minister saying someone has suggested that if problems are tackled too vigorously in one area they will be transferred to another area.  I would ask the Minister not to let himself be deterred in any way by that suggestion.  If necessary there must be a similar pursuit in the other areas so that ultimately people know there is no hiding place for them and that they will end up in jail if they persist with the housebreaking and other activities that are taking place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy obviously misunderstood me on the Estimates speech.  There is no question whatever of downgrading the Drugs Squad.  Indeed, the whole idea is to <Col N="2084" /> upgrade it.  The problem of drugs cannot be dealt with in isolation and drugs, organised crime and various other criminal activities are interlinked.  It is quite appropriate that serious crime and the problem of drugs should be interlinked at the top of the pyramid.  There is a great awareness of the need for an efficient and effective Drugs Squad in this city.  Recommendations will be emerging from the ministerial report on the drugs problem. One thing that is quite clear to me even without reading the report is that we cannot deal with the problem of drugs in isolation simply as a law and order issue. It is a wider issue than that, and even within the justice area and the area of policing it also ties in strongly with serious crime.  Because of the cost of drugs on the streets people who are addicted get involved in criminal activity to acquire the money to pay for the drugs which they need to satisfy their addiction. I can assure the Deputy and the House that, far from downgrading the Drugs Squad, we appreciate their work and they are being upgraded if anything.  Their organisation has been seriously looked at, some changes have been made in their deployment, but I would suggest that it will benefit the situation.  I think the Deputy just misunderstood what I said on the Estimate.</P>
      <P>As regards transferring crime, the point I was making is that if a community watch is organised in an individual housing estate it will be very effective in preventing crime in that housing estate but that it may have the effect that the minority of criminals resident in that housing estate will operate in a neighbouring one where such a community watch system is not organised.  The difficulty is that I do not see a solution if crime is merely transferred from one part of the city to another.  In looking at the whole idea of community relationships with the Garda, if it is to be formalised it will have to be implemented over a wide area rather than in one particular section of a county, a city or a town.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 12, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities <Col N="2086" /> that they carried out a detailed examination of these problems some months ago.  As a result they introduced a number of measures, such as the deployment of more suitable cars to the areas concerned, which they expect will help to control the situation.  They are considering other proposals as well.  However, I could not give details of the various measures that have been taken and that are being considered because, as Deputies will appreciate the publication of such measures would militate against their effectiveness, something that has in fact been mentioned in this context by the Garda themselves.</P>
    <P>With regard to penalties, the penalty for the larceny of a car if the charge is tried on indictment is imprisonment for up to five years and up to ten years in the case of a second offence.  If the charge is tried summarily under the Criminal Justice Act, 1951, the penalty is a fine not exceeding £100 or imprisonment not exceeding 12 months, or both such fine and such imprisonment.  A conviction for larceny requires proof of an intention to deprive the owner permanently of the car.  The most usual provable offence is unauthorised taking under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended. A person who contravenes this section is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding £50 or to imprisonment for up to six months, or to both such fine and imprisonment.  The unauthorised taking of a car invariably involves for the driver, as with stealing, the offence of driving without insurance for which the penalty is a fine of up to £100 or imprisonment for up to six months, or both.  In addition there could also be offences relating to the actual driving of the car.  I might add that it is open to the District Court to impose consecutive sentences and that the generally accepted view that an overall maximum penalty of up to 12 months may be imposed for summary offences.</P>
    <P>The view could reasonably be taken that at least in respect of some of the offences in question the penalties are adequate.  However, I am reviewing the level of penalties for these offences in so far as I am concerned.  A revision of <Col N="2087" /> penalties under the Road Traffic Acts would be a matter for the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>As regards Question No. 11, the position is that the law allows the Garda Síochána to use equipment such as spiked chains in relation to certain serious offences, as defined in section 8 of the Criminal Law Act, but the Garda authorities have consistently taken the view &mdash; for what seems to me to be understandable reasons &mdash; that the use of spikes or similar equipment, except in exceptional circumstances, could give rise to more serious problems than it would solve.  I should add that in general I am not prepared to disclose whether particular topics have been the subject of discussion between the Commissioner and myself, as I must reserve the right to talk to the Commissioner from time to time about matters of mutual interest on a confidential basis.  It is clear from what I have said earlier that the Garda authorities have been consulted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the measures that are being taken at present are just not working satisfactorily? How can the Minister bring the various kinds of measures together to get a higher success rate?  There are sentences available but people who have been sentenced and are out on bail are stealing cars again.  There is virtually no safe place to have a car around this city or in other cities to a large extent.  What measures specifically can the Minister see being introduced to get some improvement in this situation, which at present is horrific and is leading to deaths?  Has the Minister drafted in the Task Force to support the local Garda in special cases and are there any measures which he sees as being likely to get on top of this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It is difficult to prove that the intention of somebody taking a car to joy-ride was to hold the car and keep it permanently.  If you cannot prove that you cannot charge the person with larceny.  What happens then is that the charge is taking the car without the owner's consent.  The level of the <Col N="2088" /> sanctions here, the fines and imprisonment, is something that I am having examined.  One could argue that they are not adequate.  Certainly the statistics on the taking of cars without owners' consent are fairly horrifying.  I am aware of the subsequent dangers to life and limb, the possibility of accidents involving stolen cars and so on.  Many of the people who take these cars are extremely young and have little experience of driving.</P>
      <P>There is one point I should like to make &mdash; I might well have made it earlier also &mdash; that it surprises me that people will pay £60,000, £70,000 and £80,000 for a house and take very few precautions to make it burglar-proof when a small additional investment could help quite a lot.  It also surprises me that people are so casual about cars for which they have paid perhaps £10,000, £11,000 and £12,000 when the problem is so serious. I am in no way trying to put the onus on the people who are in effect the injured parties in these cases, but the whole area of prevention of crime involves more than the Garda and will have to involve individuals as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the very serious concern among the general public at the ease with which these young car thieves, vandals &mdash; describe them as you will &mdash; are driving to Garda stations, particularly on the north side, openly and deliberately taunting the gardaí, inviting a chase?  On a number of occasions it has happened &mdash; in the case of Coolock Garda Station &mdash; that four squad cars and three patrol vans have been damaged and put out of action on the same evening, all within 90 minutes. In view of the widespread concern this type of action causes surely the time has come for some measures to be taken to eliminate this problem.  It is not good enough for the Minister to say that the situation is being examined.  Can the Minister say when we can expect such measures as will help in eliminating this problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am aware of the specific incidents to which the Deputy referred.  Certainly they were <Col N="2089" /> discussed and talked about when the original questions were put down some months ago.  The situation has improved somewhat recently.  I do not think we can isolate one area of lawlessness, crime or vandalism, from all other areas.  As Deputy Woods rightly said earlier, we need an overall package.  I do not think specific measures to deal with one particular problem necessarily constitute the correct approach.  We must continuously examine the effectiveness of the Garda on the ground, the relationships between the Garda and the community, the laws required, and if the sanctions imposed by those laws are a sufficient deterrent to bring about a solution.</P>
      <P>In the case of cars being stolen for joy-riding purposes &mdash; which is the main problem &mdash; rather than larceny of cars, the responsibility of the Minister for Justice extends to people of 16 years and upwards.  Under 16 years of age the treatment of offenders is really a matter for the Department of Education.  I understand that the Minister for Health, in his Children Bill, will be examining various issues which arise here.</P>
      <P>I am not trying to evade the seriousness of the point the Deputy raised, but I do not think it is possible to succeed if we approach specific problems with a specific solution which is not related to the overall problem.  I would prefer to see how we proceed on an approach which involves a whole package of measures to attack the problem globally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Whilst I appreciate what the Minister has said in relation to the overall package, I would suggest to him that, when there is an on-going very high concentration of joy-riding in a particular area &mdash; to which Deputy Woods and Deputy V. Brady referred &mdash; such as that part of the north side of the city area about which we jointly make representations, then I would suggest to the Minister that there must be a very serious look taken at the short-term as well as long-term measures.  Might I ask the Minister to address himself to a couple of questions.  What are his views in relation to the present measures whereby Garda patrol cars pursue joy-riders?  From my information there seems to be a difference of opinion within the Garda Force on that procedure.  Indeed I should like to put on record that I am very impressed with their continuous commitment to deal with it.  That is one point to which I should like the Minister to address himself. Also, because we are dealing with juveniles, with young people in the main, what significance does the Minister think an extension of the juvenile liaison scheme would have in helping to combat that problem?  From my experience of it, in the inner city, I feel it would have a significant contribution to make.  I understand that, in the Coolock Garda Station there are only two members of the juvenile liaison scheme operating at present, which I consider totally inadequate for such a large, young population, bearing in mind the implications of the socio-economic groupings in that area.  Perhaps the Minister would also address himself to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has made two points <Col N="2091" /> already in relation to questions that have arisen.  One was with regard to the spiked chains.  There is a question mark over the pursuit of joy-riders by Garda patrol cars. Could the Minister comment at greater length on the apprehension felt among the Garda Force about the use of spiked chains?  Secondly, could the Minister comment at greater length on the penalties? I am not satisfied that the penalties obtaining for unauthorised taking or stealing of cars are in any way adequate. Does the Minister agree that these need to be more severe?</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> To take the last point first, I outlined what were the penalties for the two offences which are akin to the taking of cars, whether it be taking them permanently, larceny, or unauthorised taking.  I have said already that in so far as they relate to my Department I will undertake to look at the adequacy of those penalties.</P>
      <P>On the question of the spiked chains, I should say that the equipment is available to the Garda but they have taken a decision at present not to use such equipment. I agree with that decision because there would be subsidiary dangers associated with their use which, in certain circumstances, would make it very difficult to justify their use.  I understand the particular type of chain Deputies have in mind is something that can be placed across a road, which, rather than physically stopping a car, punctures the four tyres simultaneously.  At the speed at which certain joy-riders drive stolen cars I am sure Deputies are aware of the danger of a simultaneous blow-out of four tyres in a city street situation.  Therefore there are practical difficulties.  I am quite sure that the Garda will be examining the problem again but there are real, practical difficulties and I do not think a solution lies there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have examined the suggestion with regard to the juvenile liaison scheme, in particular with regard to the Coolock Garda Station the Deputy mentioned. There is scope for expansion of the scheme and anything which places the emphasis on prevention rather than <Col N="2092" /> detection of crime in present circumstances should be very carefully examined. Of course, when children steal cars and drive them at high speed through cities, it must be remembered that they do have parents, and I suggest that parents have a responsibility in this regard also.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Dublin Corporation will provide £11 million for malicious damages this year, a lot of such damage caused by the stealing of cars.  In view of that, would the Minister consider contacting the car assembly companies or reviewing the legislation in this area to ensure that these cars, some of them very expensive and fast-moving, are properly secured, in other words, that anti-theft devices are properly fitted to them?  The Minister might bear in mind the fact that car assembly in Ireland need not continue beyond the year 1985, which would strengthen the Minister's hand.  Would the Minister examine this area and consider contacting car assembly companies or examining the legislation in this area?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not aware of the statistical information given by the Deputy or the proportion of that which is due to damage to cars or caused by stolen cars.  I take the point the Deputy has made and, indeed, I have made it already.  Certainly the individual owners of cars, for their own security and considering the valuable asset a car is, should look at the possibility of installing anti-theft devices such as burglar alarms and so on.  I will examine the suggestion to see if it would be appropriate for me to contact the manufacturing companies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Justice whether he has any proposals to modify the rule of <i>in camera</i> hearings in family law cases so as to permit the press, with due regard for the non-disclosure of the parties' identities, to report and comment on the administration of justice in this context; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> As the Deputy is aware, the position is that in some family law cases, for instance, cases under the Family Law (Maintenance of <Col N="2098" /> Spouses and Children) Act, 1976, the law requires that the proceedings be heard otherwise than in public whereas in other cases the court has discretion to exclude the public.</P>
      <P>I recognise &mdash; as indeed did my predecessors &mdash; that this can create a problem. Each individual exclusion can be justified by reference to the intrusion into personal and family privacy that hearings in public would entail, an intrusion the risk of which could deter people from seeking legal remedies to which they are entitled.  On the other hand the cumulative effect of exclusions could be that we would have a situation where, in a considerable area of application of the civil law, justice was not being administered in public.</P>
      <P>While recognising that there is at least potentially a problem, I have not received from any source evidence that would suggest that the situation has developed to the point where the balance of public interest calls for a change.  If a change were to be made, I accept that the Deputy's proposal would be one of the options to be considered but I am not sure that it would be the right option or that it would not give rise to more problems than it would solve.</P>
      <P>At this stage all I can do is to undertake to keep the matter under consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Minister's caution but would he not agree that from time to time every Deputy gets grumbles from individuals in regard to the functioning of the first category of court he mentioned and that the only way to allay such grumbles is to afford some limited access, under appropriate safeguards for the legitimate privacy of the people involved, to those courts so that the quality and style of their administration of justice can be observed and the spirit of the Constitution in Article 34 &mdash; even if not the letter in this case &mdash; can be respected?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The difficulty is in balancing the privacy of individuals in family matters against the public interest that justice should be seen to be done, and to be done in public.  The <Col N="2099" /> solution suggested by the Deputy would give access to the press and perhaps to a junior reporter &mdash; which might be no harm at all &mdash; without serious journalistic intent, but, at the same time, it would deny a seriously interested politician, an academic or a social worker access to the same court.  If we were providing access it would have to be done on a wider scale. At the moment the balance is in favour of not changing, but I will keep the matter under consideration.</P>

There is concern on both sides.  It is a question of balance.  At the moment I tend towards the position that we should not change now, but I will keep the matter under consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will intervene immediately in the strike of Dublin County Council water inspectors which is resulting in (a) pollution of beaches, (b) poor water pressure with a consequent danger of disasters by fire and (c) inconvenience to homes and business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am, of course, deeply concerned with the effects of the industrial action on the community generally.  My Department have maintained regular and close contact with Dublin County Council in this matter.  The county council have been making every effort to discharge their responsibilities in a difficult situation.  Serious incidents such as those which have led to interruptions of water supply to substantial numbers of houses have been successfully tackled.  I should like to make it clear that I have the assurance of the local authority that where there is interruption of water supply special precautions are taken in relation to fire hazard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation which has arisen in places such as Malahide, where there have been overflows of raw sewage, is a most unfortunate one particularly at this time of year.  The council have been endeavouring to meet the situation.  The problem in Malahide was due to a breakdown in an electrical pump that could not be repaired because of the unwillingness of the contractors who normally carry out repairs to pass the pickets.  However, the council today have been successful in having an alternative pumping arrangement <Col N="2101" /> made and this is now operating successfully.</P>
    <P>As to the dispute itself, the position was outlined in my reply to a Private Notice Question on 21 June 1983.  Since then the issue has been considered by the monitoring committee of the public service pay agreement and further talks have taken place under the chairmanship of a Labour Court conciliation officer, without, however, progress having been made towards securing a return to work. The issue has now been referred to a full Labour Court hearing.  This will take place on Wednesday next, 13 July.  I am informed this is the earliest practical date on which the hearing can take place.  So far as this aspect of the matter is concerned it would be neither helpful nor appropriate for me to intervene in this process.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I find it most disappointing that even at this stage, when the strike has been going on for nearly a month, that the Minister is not prepared to intervene in the dispute and to use his good offices, not only as Minister for the Environment but also as leader of the Labour Party, with the trade union involved and with the council.  All he can say is that he and his Department have been keeping in close contact with the county council.  This is not good enough.</P>
      <P>At the moment there is pollution of our beaches.  The Minister referred to Malahide and he takes credit for the council taking some action today.  But for the fact that there was a court injunction taken against the council this morning they would not have tackled even the Malahide beach.  The Portmarnock beach is also affected and it is getting worse by the hour.  I ask the Minister to comment on the action that is necessary to cope with the Portmarnock beach situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy was correct in saying that action was taken this morning. There was a court hearing at 10.30 a.m. in relation to the proposed injunction. With regard to Portmarnock, at the moment the council are trying to get to the source of the electrical fault.  There are certain difficulties because the council <Col N="2102" /> do not have their own electrical staff and there are difficulties in relation to the private contractors who normally carry out the work for the council.  In my last contact with the council a few minutes ago they assured me they are making every effort to tackle the problem in Portmarnock, the same as has been done in Malahide.</P>

      <P>I admire the way they appear to be willing to stand up better than any Government in the last few years to the unpopularity which none of them, as politicians, welcomes or seeks but which they will draw on themselves if they do their jobs properly.  Every member of the Government would much prefer to be spreading sweetness and light, opening roads and schools and so on by the new time.  We would all like to be doing that, but it can no longer be done.  It is not substantially the fault of the Government or of the two parties which compose it and they are manfully, within the constricting parameters imposed by the attempt to fuse two parties of different ideologies, trying to face those difficulties and showing a good deal of courage in the process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing from the other side of the House except ritual complaints about the state of affairs regarding unemployment figures, which are undoubtedly very bad; and when somebody on the far side suspects that a move is about to be made to contain State expenditure, a whole series of Pavlovian cries go up, most <Col N="2393" /> recently from Deputy Flynn in regard to Thatcherism.  Mrs. Thatcher's name is bandied around more frequently in this House than in the House of Commons. That, unhappily, is the dimension of our Paddy complex.  I am not going to complain about it now.  I have done it too often before but, since I am being obliged by Deputy Flynn to consider Mrs. Thatcher and to accept from him the currency, the legal tender of her name as a term of abuse, something which must automatically attract hatred and contempt, let me say this to Deputy Flynn: whatever her faults may be and however little I feel myself in affinity with her party &mdash; and I do not feel I have any affinity with them at all &mdash; it has to be said for her that she is to be thanked for the fact that the buses crossing the Border with shoppers are travelling from South to North and not from North to South. The reason?  Why does the Deputy over there think that people even from his own constituency are travelling up by the bus-load &mdash; and the only reason they do not go by train is because there are no trains &mdash; across the Border to buy not just manufactured goods but sides of mutton to bring back down for their deep freeze? It is worth it to them to do that.  That is what containing inflation means and the cumulative effect of the inflation rate over the last three, four or five years here and what it has been in Britain since Mrs. Thatcher got in.  That difference now is so large that an Irish citizen in the Republic will travel up 100 miles into a supermarket in a town that he barely had heard of before, let alone visited, because he can save £20 or £30 on a week's housekeeping by doing so.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn, before he talks too much about Mrs. Thatcher, should take this into account.  Had Deputy Haughey been a Thatcher in 1979 it is in the opposite direction the buses would be running and the shopkeepers of Westport and Ballina would not be crying about the trade being taken off them by people in Coleraine and Portadown.  It is the people up there who would be doing the crying and they would have to have an extra set of traffic wardens in Castlebar to control the Northern crowds.  That is <Col N="2394" /> the reality of Thatcherism; and anyone like Deputy Flynn foolish enough to use it as a term of abuse, at least in an economic sphere whatever significance it may have in a purely political one, is neglecting these sore realities about which we hear so much in this House particularly from Deputies whose constituencies are on the Border.  The person to thank from the British point of view, and to blame from the view of Deputy Harte, Deputy Kirk and other Deputies in the Border area is the same Mrs. Thatcher and, had we been able to turn out somebody so singleminded in attacking inflation, we would be reaping the same benefit as her people are.</P>
    <P>Having said that in defence of the Government who, I think, are showing great courage &mdash; even though they handicapped themselves at the outset &mdash; in facing the job they have been elected to do, I want to say two things before I finish.  One of them is the consequence of continuing crises, continuing hard times, continuing problems, some of them connected with security, some in the North of Ireland, and all kinds of other things which keep the Government permanently distracted, permanently anxious to get through the day or the week, permanently anxious to stagger through, if you like, to the end of the session in one piece, without any damage done and with, perhaps, a few small problems solved.  The result of that atmosphere which surrounded all Governments in the 1970s and 1980s is that the longer term problems, the deep-seated underlying so-called structural problems of the Irish economy and the Irish society are not confronted.  Occasionally people salute them when they recognise their existence but they do not confront them.</P>
    <P>It is not today or yesterday that anybody adverted to the fact that Irish people, particularly the young people who are still adaptable and intelligent enough to learn things quickly, are insufficiently oriented to enterprise, insufficiently plugged into business.  They know very little about it.  They are not spiritually predisposed to take risks, to try to make two blades of grass grow where one only formerly grew, to go out <Col N="2395" /> and try to sell something to someone. They are not plugged into that.  The plug is into security and to a certain moderate standard.  I do not despise that.  The Irish people had it very hard for a long time and nobody would fault them for a very natural reaction from the insecurity which was so long their lot and which still is the lot of those who have not got jobs. But everyone knows they are not plugged into enterprise, into industry, into industrial techniques, into industrial perfection of design.  They are not oriented towards the things on which we are vitally dependent to sell our goods in the rest of the world &mdash; in other words, to survive with the standard of living to which we aspire.</P>
    <P>We all know that but pitifully little is done to change it.  It is not beyond the wit of man to turn a population around &mdash; not certainly in the course of a year, not certainly even in the course of a normal Government's term, but in the course of ten or 20 years it is possible; and very active populations on the face of this earth, by nature formerly not necessarily any more adaptable than we are, have done that.  The people of the Far East have done it, every one of them.  Populations in Europe which formerly did nothing except raise hens and grow lemons in the far south-east of Europe are into enterprises now &mdash; under the compulsion, if you like, of Communism &mdash; of which their grandfathers could not have dreamed.  Perhaps manipulated, if you wish, but I do not suppose that in every respect you have to go out with a machine gun in order to instigate Bulgarians to fish in the deep seas off the western coast of Ireland, an enterprise those Bulgarians' grandparents would have thought widely beyond their capacity, widely outside their range of interest or technical skills or orientation.  That has been done under the iron system, if you like, of Communism.</P>
    <P>It does not have to be like that.  It can be done here through incentive or under proper educational planning.  Everybody has been giving out year after year about the inadequate orientation of Irish people in marketing.  In order to sell <Col N="2396" /> goods the first thing you have to do is talk the language, in both senses of the word, of the people you try to sell to.  The standard of marketing technique here &mdash; though there have been some improvements with various professional bodies and an increasing interest in the third level structure and in the teaching of modern languages, whether European or non-European &mdash; is lamentable.  It is pitiable.  The people who live in Taiwan or South Korea do not think there is anything strange in their children being asked to learn some European language, which it is just as difficult for them to learn as it is for us to learn Korean.  Think of the horse laugh we would get in this House if we were to recommend, as I do now recommend, that the Minister for Education &mdash; who incidentally is sitting in front of me &mdash; should turn her mind to finding out how we can by hook or by crook turn out a population in ten years' time some of whom at any rate will be competent to go and sell our goods in markets where they formerly never appeared where, if we now turn up in the role of salesmen, we are obliged to ask the people to speak English.</P>
    <P>I remember when I was in Government ten years ago meeting a deputation of Japanese and, when we were complaining about the approach of Japanese commerce, one of them said: &ldquo;Take the very first step in selling things and talk the other people's language&rdquo;.  With the inscrutable politeness of the oriental he did not make it sound as offensive as perhaps I do, but he said: &ldquo;Your people come to Japan but they cannot speak our language.  They think we are off our heads if we suggest they might learn it. We have to learn your language in order to buy your goods from you&rdquo;.  If anyone thinks that is the right way to approach the world, if you depend on selling about half of your gross national product, one will not do it with one's feet on the ground.  If that is his attitude he is half way to leprechaun land.  We all know these things and no Government here has ever said: &ldquo;Look, if we do nothing else we will turn this situation around.  We are going to make a start towards reversing the orientation of school-leavers here in <Col N="2397" /> such a way that certainly not now or next year will cure unemployment but in the long term will leave us in a better situation and a better condition for facing the world&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>These are the large-scale substructures &mdash; I have not by any means finished mentioning all of them &mdash; that we have not faced because Governments are too distracted by day-to-day exigencies.  There is a list of other ones as long as my arm, which are slightly shorter term, that I am tired hearing about for the last 20 years, and no Government ever seems to sit down and say, if we do nothing else, if we are to be remembered for nothing else, we will take this problem by the scruff of the neck and choke it out.  What we will leave behind us will not be a problem.  Take the farm ownership structure and the farming mobility we were hearing about this morning.  We are tired hearing about that.  When I was in Government 15 years ago an inter-departmental committee was set up. What happened?  The Minister for Agriculture was sitting here this morning and I have to say, although I admire him in a lot of ways, his proposal does not seem to be more exciting than what I was hearing about ten years ago.  We want some action here.  Everybody knows the trade unions are the most potent source of industrial unrest.  We have been hearing about that for the last 50 years.  The Government of Mr. de Valera in 1941 actually brought in a Bill to control the growth of unions and effectively to restrict unions to one per trade or one per industrial sector.  It was shot down by the Supreme Court, very wrongly in my opinion, and it was one of the worst judgments they ever put out, four or five years later.  No effort has been made since then except of a very tentative kind, basically no more than persuasion, to try to control a situation so ludicrous that the CIE management with a work force of only a little over 20,000, have to deal with 28 different unions to represent the work force in what is by world standards a two penny halfpenny bus company.</P>
    <P>The question of public service numbers, the question of the waste of public <Col N="2398" /> money on self-indulgent things like excessive use of ministerial or other public transport, excessive use of entertainment or travel industries, the planning disaster that is all around us that Deputy Molloy and a few other western Deputies were so excited about are all matters which should be discussed.  Their recipe is to attack An Taisce.  Where would we be without bodies like An Taisce who without making any money out of it, for no other reward than being described as the blue rinse brigade by the like of Deputy Molloy, give up their free time in order to defend the amenities of the country?</P>
    <P>The best solution the Deputy has for protecting the country is to damn An Taisce with personal allegations which turn out to be untrue about individual members of that organisation.  I am a member of it.  I never did anything much for them one way or the other and I most certainly never did anything improper or never brought influence to bear &mdash; whatever influence I have &mdash; in a sense which I would be ashamed to let the House know about.  The House would say we are damned if we hear a body with statutory support, who have no other function than to defend amenities, being damned and blackened by the like of Deputy Molloy and Deputy Denis Gallagher on the other side yesterday.  Naturally in their counties there are vistas which are disappearing.  How proud is Deputy Molloy of Bóthar Cois Fhairrge these days?  When did he last drive with open eyes from Galway to Carraroe and ask himself what has been happening to that country?</P>
    <P>We are always hearing about the scandal of uninsured driving.  When was that problem taken by the throat?  Surely we could look forward to a day when people might say to one another &ldquo;Do you remember the day when the country was full of uninsured drivers?&rdquo; That problem should not be beyond the wit of man to solve.  We should be able to deal with it and finish with it but it rolls on from year to year, adjournment debate in, adjournment debate out.  I do not want to minimise the itinerant problem.  I do not <Col N="2399" /> know where I would begin to solve it if I had that job.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  All those problems, the long-term and the short-term ones which make up the awful burden of problems weighing on a modern Government and which are so difficult to solve are, of course, compounded by the awful, low grade polemics that the two big parties here carry on.  We are back on every issue let it be even the clearest one.  Try to prevent people from poaching salmon, from using illegal nets, and we are back to the dreary old bump and grind again. We have Deputies rising up on the other side talking about harassing the fishermen. These are fishermen who will not allow the forces of law and order to take a look at their boats, as a matter of policy.</P>
      <P>There are an increasing number of people in the country who think that application of the law to themselves should be optional, that obedience to the law is optional, that if anything is not acceptable, that if there has not been consultation, in other words 100 per cent surrender on the other side, then they are entitled to make up their minds whether to obey the law.  What support do a Government get &mdash; I do not care what party supply the Government &mdash; from the far side?  The most recent incident we had was the farmers spoiling foreign vegetables, which the Irish housewife prefers to buy &mdash; I am sorry about that &mdash; rather than buy what is available at home.  That is miles outside the law but how many people on the far side rose up to encourage the Government to do their job and make sure the law was obeyed?  This is the awful Punch and Judy show which we think the people should be pleased to pay for.  That makes the solution of all these problems trebly difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember when we were in Opposition there were occasions when the Leader of our party would step out in front and offer the support of this party as, for example, anything to do with law and <Col N="2400" /> order in the North of Ireland, to the Government over here.  Unfortunately, I do not notice that so much now.  Every Government, no matter what colour they are confronting, have to look over their shoulders if they feel they are dealing with an Opposition who are not responsible and who see every political issue only as a source of cheap votes for themselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We are indeed grateful for Deputy Kelly's contribution today.  It was long on a lot of the problems which confront the nation today, and, typical of the same Deputy, it was short on any way of resolving the problems.  He started his submission by saying that Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's contribution was a predictable one but his was not that in any way. Before lunch he found it necessary to castigate his own party for joining with the Labour Party and bringing in such measures as the residential tax and other matters concerning the Post and Telecommunications Bill.  He must have been well fortified during lunch time by the good pork on offer today in the restaurant because he came back and obviously had been spoken to outside and told it was the more proper thing to attack the Opposition.  He consequently spent the remaining part of his very entertaining contribution telling us about how we had gone astray in various aspects.  We are grateful to the good Deputy John Kelly for one thing, that is that he condones smuggling and he also makes it somehow respectable to be involved in smuggling. I intend to take up that matter later on. It is ungracious and unnecessary for Deputy Kelly to make that kind of contribution in the House, seeing that it results in such an enormous loss of revenue to his Government.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Leas-Cheann Comhairle say that.  We are also very grateful to Deputy Kelly for his reference to Thatcherism.  I would like to <Col N="2402" /> point out to Deputy Kelly and his colleagues on the other side that the reality of Thatcherism is uncontrolled unemployment. That has been the effect of that type of monetarist attitude and policies in another jurisdiction.  I am glad to know that at least now it is out in the open as far as the Fine Gael Party are concerned, that Deputy Kelly obviously is a supporter of those types of monetarist policies and that there are others who support his attitude in that regard as well. It also gives us a good clear indication of the type of ultra-conservatism from the Fine Gael Party.  It is a great indictment of his party for the way they have been carrying on and not providing us with the kind of Government we have been accustomed to and which the people require at this time.  It is difficult to understand how the Labour Party can adjust to that kind of policy.</P>
      <P>While Deputy Kelly's speech was not predictable, the Taoiseach's speech was another wolf-at-the-door kind of speech, the kind we got from Deputy FitzGerald in the 1981-82 period.  The Taoiseach's was a most uninspired contribution and a great disappointment to the quarter of a million unemployed people who were hoping that even in his last contribution to this House before the summer recess, the Taoiseach in a state of the nation speech would outline the Government's intentions for the next three or four months.  The main thrust of our contribution relates to unemployment.  Deputy Dr. FitzGerald's speech was a return to the old style rhetoric we had when he was previously in office.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach went down the well worn trail of the jungle of economic morass.  It is unfortunate that after six months in government the Taoiseach could not come up with something substantial to offer hope to the unemployed people.  The Taoiseach is just setting the stage for another dose of basic monetarism which will come about after the next sit-in in Barrettstown Castle.  We must look back on a very poor legislative programme from the Coalition during this session, especially when one considers that most of the legislation moved was the left-overs of the last administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2403" /> All we got from this administration was a couple of pieces of legislation to appease the Labour Party and other interested and sectional groups outside the House so as to fulfil election promises.</P>
    <P>I referred to the possibility of the removal of the food subsidies and I was told that a decision had not yet been taken.  However, it is an option which the Government are considering.  Deputies Cluskey and Barry Desmond made it clear to the Government recently that all options must be kept open and that it was not just a matter of public spending cuts that were being considered by the Government.  This Government are contemplating the removal of the food subsidies currently running at about £98 million. I will have achieved my purpose if I can succeed in getting the Government to say here that they have no intention of reducing the food subsidies.  The Government could not find even one spokesman to do duty against me on an RTE programme in relation to food subsidies, because obviously they are considering that option in their next round of public spending cuts.</P>
    <P>In relation to unemployment, for the month of June there has been an increase of 1,500 on the unemployment register. June is a period when one would expect the numbers to reduce.  What will be the situation next October?  Who will pay the in excess of £400 million necessary to make social welfare payments this year? With only one in five of our population actually working where will the money come from?  There is not a single statement by the Taoiseach this morning that would give hope to the thousands of unemployed people.  We should not trot out the figure of 190,000 people unemployed because when one takes into account the people who cannot qualify for unemployment benefit because of the archaic system of assessing board and lodgings, the figure would be in excess of 200,000 unemployed.  Will the Government tell the people what they can expect in the next instalment of cuts that will take place as soon as this House rises?</P>
    <P>It is a scandal that the Taoiseach should <Col N="2404" /> come here today with a litany of protestations about what might have been and what should be done.  It is too much to swallow when Deputy Kelly follows the Taoiseach by suggesting to all and sundry that the only thing the Irish people should do is learn Japanese so that they might sell some souvenirs made in the west of Ireland.  It is naive to expect people to accept that.  I put it to the Minister that an alternative was open to the Government in relation to investment.  The public capital programme is expected to fall by 10 per cent this year and the biggest fall will be in the construction industry. Do the Government realise how serious that is, and are they satisfied that the construction industry does not require aid from a public capital programme situation? It is not good enough to say that plans will be produced in the future to deal with unemployment.  The time for those plans is now.  We were waiting for some indication from the Taoiseach today.</P>
    <P>It is no use for the Taoiseach to tell us about competitiveness; we all know about that.  Domestic costs have been rising quicker here than they have been rising in the competing countries.  Last year our domestic costs rose 6 per cent faster than those in our international competitors' countries.  These are things the Government should have controlled. If we are to succeed, profitability will have to be sufficient to absorb increased costs.</P>
    <P>How can that be brought about without a strategy for industry?  No strategy has yet been outlined by the Government. All we have heard about is the killing of any incentive or initiative in the private sector and we have put the load back on the public sector, over burdened as they have been for many years.  We are all being chastised and being told the public sector will have to be further cut to provide the necessary funding to keep the Government's monetarist policies on target. The Government are only concerned that by 31 December this year their budget deficit will be on target and they will hold that up as the answer to all out ills, irrespective of the unemployment situation. We all know about wage <Col N="2405" /> restraint, but we cannot expect trade unions and workers to accept wage restraint when their disposable income is being cut so that they cannot make ends meet.  It has been made clear to the Government that the vast majority of people are not just hard up but are up to their eyes in debt.</P>
    <P>When manufacturers are forced to accept higher costs they must increase producitivity to maintain their unit cost of production.  But the essential costs such as interest rates, petrol and diesel costs, postal charges and ESB costs are under the direct control of the Government. Control has not been exercised since the beginning of this year in this area.  That is why there is a continual closure of factories running at three a week.  There will be no percentage growth in the economy this year.  We need not blame the recession.  We must blame Government policy which has given no incentive to business to create new jobs.</P>
    <P>It is no use suggesting that we are working on inflation, that getting it down is the be all and end all of Government policy and that if we can achieve that we will be able to hold up in Thatcherite fashion the fact that we have reduced our inflation rate and all is well.  What about the employment situation?  It did not matter in the other jurisdiction.  Obviously the Government have taken a leaf from that book in the hope that it will have the same effect and when the next general election comes they can say that they had good example across the water where the Conservatives had a landslide victory because they followed those monstrous policies.  I suggest to the Minister that we are dealing with a different type of economy, a different type of people and a different kind of unemployment and the sooner they wake up to that, change their tactics and get back to the type of investment programmes outlined in <i>The Way Forward</i> the better; and if they cannot devise a plan for themselves we will not accuse them of plagiarism.</P>
    <P>A growing fear here in recent times is that innovation is set to guarantee lasting unemployment, but we on this side of the House welcome new technology and we <Col N="2406" /> welcome also high investment in maintaining and improving that technology. The only recipe that I can see for rising living standards and low unemployment is to spend more money on investment in the productive sector, and if that is to include investing in new technology so be it.  The Government have a duty to exploit new avenues to bring about a reduction in unemployment figures.  I am afraid that innovation demands adjustment, but it also promises opportunity. The first adjustment required is in Government thinking, and we have not had that.  We have had promises that these measures would be brought forward before the Summer Recess and we waited with bated breath this morning hoping that the Taoiseach would enunciate a whole litany of new initiatives that he and his hard-pressed Minister were to take during the recess.  What did we get?  We got the usual clap-trap and a plethora of what might have been and would have been but for Fianna Fáil being in office in the recent past.  It is about time that that one was passed aside.  Just as the Fine Gael Party through their publicity manager have moved the Taoiseach from centre stage in the publicity arena, perhaps they could move some of the Ministers from their centre stage and bring in some people with a little innovation in their minds as well as in their activities.</P>
    <P>We must prepare in this country for the robot revolution which is obvious in every other economy in the world.  There is no point in saying that it will not happen. We must learn to identify the adjustments necessary in both our educational policies and our industrial training policies to deal with that revolution, which is a fact of life in the more developed countries and is coming along rapidly here.  Rising productivity in that area leads to a real rise in incomes for both the individual and the country.  However, the contrary is being trotted out by the Government spokesmen: that we must move away from these new developments in the hope that somebody somewhere will come up with some strategy that will develop an employment situation that will take us out of our crisis.  We will not <Col N="2407" /> get out of that crisis of unemployment until we take new initiatives and risks in government, in the public sector and in the private sector.</P>
    <P>More people are now on the unemployment register for longer periods than heretofore.  This should concern the Minister for Education particularly.  These people are not getting the opportunities that they not just wish for but will soon demand to give them an experience in working and using in the national interest their talents and the expensive education provided by this State.  Long-term unemployment leads to much greater difficulty in finding job outlets.  The incidence of exit from the unemployment register decreases with age because employers take a negative attitude to young people who have been on the register for a long time.</P>
    <P>It is necessary to do something for our young unemployed as soon as they come on to that register after leaving school. We see the diminishing skills and the diminishing confidence of those young people and the diminishing motivation to work at all, which is probably the greatest difficulty that we will have to deal with in the years to come.  Young people will have got out of the habit of applying themselves to anything, study or work, and consequently they will not be in a position to take up gainful employment should it become available to them.</P>
    <P>We have developed an attitude of mind in the recent past that unemployment will become endemic here and that for some reason there should be some acceptable level of unemployment on a national scale.  This cannot be so.  That is throwing in the towel, and any government who suggest that that will be the situation in the next few years do not deserve the right to govern this country.  Long-term unemployment is just a proxy for structural unemployment, and that is the danger that the country is moving into.  We must provide the structure whereby young people will be given an opportunity, whether it be in a great national employment scheme or in some new scheme of training that will encompass all of those interested in availing of it and <Col N="2408" /> their skills, and money must be found to do it.</P>
    <P>The usual trick of the Government is to ask where they will get the money. The Government will have to take issue on the enormous sum of money being utilised to fund the social welfare fund. If it is in excess of £400 million I am sure a method could be devised to transfer at least £100 million of that and use it gainfully in the interest of those signing on the live register.  It is not possible for the PAYE sector and the business sector to continue paying in excess of £400 million without getting an answer as to why.  We have adopted a callous attitude towards unemployment and those who are unfortunate enough to have to deal with continuing long-term unemployment.  We must give at least some hope by an outline of policy by the Government to deal with it.  Let us take some new measures, irrespective of whether they cause a change in the strategy and structure of unemployment benefit as it has applied for the last 50 years.  We will not break out of the stranglehold unless we can do that.</P>
    <P>We are importing each year £1,500 million worth of commodities that can be made and provided here.  That is a staggering figure.  When we were in Government we had a policy of import substitution and we were doing something about it.  For some reason that policy of identification of products that could be made here has been abandoned by the present Administration.  Why, when you consider that £20,000 is the equivalent of one job and that £1,500 million in its entirety represents 50,000 jobs?  Taken at its worst, half of that &mdash; 25,000 jobs &mdash; could be provided producing goods that can be manufactured here if the right framework or structure were developed in identifying and bringing out the entrepreneurs in middle management in many manufacturing industries.  We do not hear about that now, despite the fact that in the building industry alone the best part of £400 million is being sent out of this country each year to buy the products that can be manufactured here.  Some products could never be produced here, but many could and it is time that somebody paid special attention to that.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2409" /> Government and semi-State bodies every year spend hundreds of millions of pounds on products made in foreign parts.  Imagine our own Government and semi-State agencies buying foreign products.  It should not be allowed.  There should be an overall damper put on it, and the sooner it is done the better.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly spoke about cross-Border smuggling, for some unknown reason, and I will take issue with him on it.  It is of considerable importance at present and I regret that Deputy Kelly, by something he said in this House, might lend credence to the cavalier attitude being adopted by some people, which is not in the national interest.  It is not right for Deputy Kelly to come in here to suggest that people involved are doing the right thing or that they are doing the proper thing.  That is only backing up people in the media who suggest &ldquo;If you get it cheaper, no matter where you get it go and get it&rdquo;.  It does not matter what it does to the economy or who it puts out of work.  That is not the attitude that should be adopted by either the media or people like Deputy Kelly, a senior member of Fine Gael.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>An enormous quantity of goods, and I particularly refer to electrical goods, are being brought across the Border each week and consequently there has been a disastrous drop in sales north of the line between Dublin and Galway.  A large number of shopkeepers are going out of business with resultant considerable unemployment and a considerable loss of revenue to the State.  It has been a progressing disaster since 1981.  There is no use in the Minister for Finance saying that measures have been taken to deal with it.  All that has happened are a few additional advertisements in the national newspapers pointing out certain things to the general public.  That is not an adequate response to something that is causing severe hardship in the electrical field here.</P>
      <P>I make a special plea to the Government in so far as the smuggling of electrical goods is concerned, both by commercial and private smugglers, the day trippers.  The costs are enormous and it has an all-Ireland effect.  People in the electrical business here are feeling the full brunt of this smuggling.  If one appreciates that the Government's take from one colour TV or one video is about £200 each one will realise the kind of money being lost in revenue to the State.  It is estimated that those two items, and kitchen appliances, work out at a loss of about £12 million last year.  The reason is that the Government have no intention of taking corrective measures.</P>
      <P>Sooner or later they will have to do it. A few advertisements and a few leaflets handed out to people in buses on certain routes is not good enough.  The interception ratio of vehicles at the Border should be one to six for Irish registered cars and one in ten for foreign cars.  These ratios are not being complied with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a recent spot check at the Border, on 5 July this year, 145 vehicles traversed the roads across the Border and only four were stopped.  That is not a serious effort by customs officials under directions of the Department.  There have been no <Col N="2412" /> worthwhile efforts to deal with this matter. The customs personnel serving on Border duty have been reduced substantially in the past five years.  There is a constant stream of traffic, of commercial and private smugglers, using the Border roads each day, breaking the law, and nothing is being done about it.  Customs personnel have been reduced, their equipment is archaic.  They have neither radio communications nor transport. They have no back-up and until such time as the Government authorise an increase in personnel and their equipment there will not be any reduction in the level of smuggling.</P>
    <P>The checking of vehicles is far too erratic.  I am not talking about petty smuggling, which has been going on over the years.  The smuggling is organised and the Minister has admitted it is on a serious scale.  What is the overall cost to the Exchequer from colour TVs, videos and kitchen appliances?  When you take petrol and meat and other commodities into consideration the loss must be about £100 million per year.  What is the cost in job losses because of this smuggling?  One statistic will prove that this is not talk off the top of the head.  According to the CSO, there has been a reduction from 90,000 TV sets imported legally in 1981 to 68,000 in 1982, a reduction of 24 per cent.  It is commonly believed that the number of sets smuggled in last year was 15,000 TV sets and 10,000 video units.  If they entered illegally I guarantee that they are not licensed.  That means there is a fall-out effect because of lost excise duty and VAT.  It is reckoned that seven out of ten houses in Border areas have at least some smuggled article.</P>
    <P>We should not take a cavalier attitude on this.  People say it is all right if you get away with it.  It is not all right because it is causing unemployment here, but the Government are not taking the action necessary to deal with it.  The Minister must bring that to the notice of the Government and I might be able to recommend the action that should be taken.</P>

      <P>I would have finished if I had not been interrupted by that side of the House.  It is necessary to have a proper publicity campaign, a publicity campaign of consequnce, not just a few casual advertisements and a few leaflets handed out along the roads leading to the North.  There is need for an increased number of personnel for customs duty. They would need to be given the right kind of equipment to deal with what is a professional smuggling racket at this time.  There would need to be an updating of the penalties and prosecutions in dealing with it and not have it a big laugh and if caught a minor offence and a minor penalty.  That is not the way to deal with something which has caused hardship to hundreds of shopkeepers in this country, which is putting the rental service in jeopardy and which has caused enormous hardship to many individuals.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach's speech was a great disappointment to this country today.  It was a huge disappointment particularly to the quarter of a million young people who were expecting some kind of initiative, some new start along the road to gainful employment.  That was not given this morning and the Government and the Taoiseach deserve the criticism that has been poured on them.</P>

      <P>I should like to make a few remarks on the Adjournment which will be in direct contrast to some of the pessimistic assessments of the state of the nation which have emanated from the Opposition today. It is important that in contrast to their assertions, beginning with Deputy Haughey, we should strike a positive note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a great deal going for us in <Col N="2414" /> this country.  Opportunities are there to be grasped, if we are prepared to put our shoulders to the wheel.

      <P>It is time that we as a nation had more confidence in our future. It is time too that as a people we believed in ourselves and in the great potentialities that are there to be exploited.  But we must work for them.  There is no point in sitting around and waiting for things to happen.  We must be up and doing.</P>
      <P>When we talk about recession it is important to remind ourselves that recession is a relative thing.  The standard of living and the style of life which we enjoy today, recession or no recession, is far in advance of what our parents knew or even hoped for.  No one travelling around Ireland today can fail to be impressed by the fine modern housing which is everywhere in evidence and the fine modern schools which we are providing for our burgeoning young population.  Herein lies our hope, that our bright young people, well fed, well clothed and well educated may take full advantage of the natural assets of our country and exploit their potential to carry us handsomely into the next millenium, now only a few short years away.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at our advantages.  We have a fertile land that can produce the best food in Europe if we use in properly.  The rich harvest of the sea lies all around our shores from the Irish Sea to the great Atlantic.  Membership of the European Community provides us with a readymade market of over two hundred million people.  There is only one way to go, and that is forward.  Our tourism, although buffeted by many vicissitudes, is buoyant and will remain so because, in our <Col N="2415" /> scenery and in the unique demeanour of our people, we have a combination that will continue to attract visitors in increasing numbers.</P>
    <P>We are situated at the centre of world communications.  Our technological communications industry forms a significant and growing segment of our export production. Our knowledge of the English language which is now the generally accepted medium of international communication provides us with an inbuilt advantage in this area.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be misunderstood in this particular connection.  We must continue to foster our national language and traditions, oral, literary and musical and all that makes us the distinctive people we are.  To do otherwise would be to deny our past and maim our future.  Nevertheless, it would be less than candid if we did not acknowledge the advantage which our knowledge of English confers upon us on the world scene.  We have made our own of English; we have produced giants of literature in English; we have stamped our authority on the English language and our reputation world-wide has largely been achieved through its medium.  I take the point that Deputy Kelly made about our deficiency in some of the major trading languages in the world.  My major effort at the moment in the language area is concentrated on trying to bring our teaching and learning of modern continental languages up to a high point of development.  Then I expect I will begin to think about Japanese.</P>
    <P>Internationally, we enjoy a standing and a prestige way beyond what a small nation normally aspires to.  We are respected among the nations of the world.  The respect on the world stage we have earned is due to a number of factors not least to the ability and dynamism of some great Ministers for Foreign Affairs. A name that immediately comes to mind is that of the late Frank Aiken who played such a vital role in bringing us into the community of nations &mdash; the UN.  His deep attachment to the ideals of the UN Charter and his constant participation in <Col N="2416" /> UN affairs ensured our high place among the nations.</P>
    <P>Our Taoiseach, Deputy Garret FitzGerald, made a deep imprint as Foreign Minister, particularly on the European scene.  His contribution in the early years of our participation in the EEC and his dynamic involvement in foreign affairs generally left a lasting impression among world statesmen.  Our present Minister, Deputy Peter Barry, is ably following in the footsteps of these great Ministers.</P>
    <P>Now I want to turn to the positive economic factors that are going for our country.  Inflation has fallen to single figures for the first time in over four years. The wholesale price index has been increasing at a much more moderated rate; our balance of payments deficit will this year show a major decline and should be of the order of £400 million.  Interest rates have fallen.  The recently negotiated public sector wage agreement will, if accepted, provide industrial peace and give further impetus to bringing down inflation.  External economic indicators are also favourable.  Oil prices look as if they will be stabilised for some time.  The major world economies are picking up and confidence is being restored.</P>
    <P>The future prospects of the Irish economy are bright provided, as a community, we make sensible economic and social decisions designed to increase economic growth, while at the same time ensuring the protection of the less privileged members of our society.  The remedy for our economic ills is largely in our own hands.  But the results to be attained and the possibilities to be realised are there before us to strengthen our resolve and to encourage our efforts.</P>
    <P>When we talk about employment we must talk about real jobs which will last. We must aim for steady progress which will attract and encourage domestic and foreign investment which will provide industry that will be able to compete successfully worldwide and ensure the lasting stability of those jobs.</P>
    <P>A small society and economy such as ours cannot achieve all its aims and aspirations at once.  Choices must be made between spending and investment; <Col N="2417" /> between high nominal incomes in the short run and low real incomes in the long run; between essential and inessential public services; and above all between a society which is just and compassionate and one which neglects and fails to lift the poor and the under-privileged from intolerable conditions to the level of society as a whole.  Let us ensure that as a society we make the correct choices needed to attain the prospects which lie before us.</P>
    <P>Essentially, we need all the factors that are going for us to be moulded together. We need leadership and example.  No interest group in our society &mdash; politicians, trade unions and management &mdash; should be afraid to give that leadership to their own.  There are signs, and strong signs, that people will respond to leadership. Difficult decisions lie ahead for us.  Let us have the courage and the moral fibre to stand up and be counted.  Those of us in authority &mdash; and I include everybody on all sides of this House &mdash; must be prepared to exercise that authority.  It is quite clear that Irish people are crying out for strong, decisive leadership, for clear signposts, and that they respond to straight talking.  All we need on all sides of this House is the courage of our convictions.</P>
    <P>Since becoming Minister for Education, I have had the great pleasure of meeting many of our young people.  My frequent association and mingling with young people has been the greatest joy of my ministry.  Only this week I met a further 250 of them participating with great enthusiasm in the Youth Science Week at the Royal Dublin Society.  This has been not only a source of great pleasure but a source of inspiration.  We have a vibrant, stimulating and fascinating young population &mdash; eager to play their role in the social and economic development of our country.  They are generous and compassionate, caring and concerned, bubbling over with vitality and anxious to have their talents and potentialities harnessed for the betterment of the community.  They are waiting to be asked to help and co-operate.  Let us not fail them.  Let us give them leadership and inspiration.  By our belief and hope <Col N="2418" /> for the future, let us inspire them to do great things.  To the young all things are possible.  We have a serious responsibility in this Parliament not to be the ones to disillusion them.  Let the message go out from here that together, and in unity, we are on the march towards the bright horizon that awaits us.  May all our young people become what they are capable of becoming.</P>
    <P>Our future depends absolutely on the energy and enterprise of our youth.  Our responsibility is to give them the education and the training which will direct their energy and enterprise to the occupations and vocations which assure the modern small state the capacity to grow economically and socially.  We also have a responsibility to provide jobs for our school-leavers.  Let us not fall prey to any economic doctrine which makes unemployment the price of economic progress. That price is too high to pay.  It need not and will not be paid and this Government have no intention of paying it.  It is worth repeating that we should not spread the gospel of despondency.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to some matters in the education area.  We are on the threshold of significant changes in our education system.  An <i>ad-hoc</i> Curriculum Board will be established by the end of the year.  New assessment procedures will be examined.  Oral language examinations will be introduced.  A drive to redress the sex discrimination in education is under way.  The new technology and the provision of computer education is being widely applied.  Curricular innovation and change is taking place in a number of schools.  A programme for action in education is being prepared in my Department which will chart educational policy over the next four years.  A very positive aspect of this work is the generous and comprehensive input of parents, teachers and management in all the discussions, which augurs well for the final outcome of the process.</P>
    <P>I do not want to underestimate the difficulties facing us in education. Resources are going to be scarce.  Let us be clear about that.  It is an economic truism that wealth must be created before it can be distributed.  More is the pity that <Col N="2419" /> the former Administration did not realise and accept that dictum before they embarked on the spending spree which had to be financed by foreign borrowing to the extent that is now costing us dearly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no crock of gold over the rainbow waiting for a Minister for Education to collect it.  I have no magic wand to wave and thereby get all the resources I need.  It may well be the case that improvements in education will have to be self-financing.  But whatever the future holds for us in that regard, it will be my responsibility to ensure that the taxpayer is getting the best possible value for the money expended on the various education services.  I intend to see that that objective is achieved.  This may mean taking, perhaps unpopular measures.  It will certainly mean that choices between competing interests and demands will have to be made.  In choosing to fund one kind of education service, we do so at the expense of another, perhaps equally desirable service.  In the context of scarce resources, the concept of priority must prevail all the more.  The main priority must be the education of those in compulsory schooling &mdash; 6 to 15 years.  Of course allied with that priority, must be the positive discrimination in favour of the disadvantaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have mentioned the need to ensure that the best possible value is obtained for the taxpayers' money.  This value for money or, to put it another way, the need for greater productivity is not only a concern for the Minister for Education.  In these difficult economic times, it is essential that all engaged in the educational process, teachers and managers included, should be prepared to make a great effort and do whatever is possible.  After all, the conditions of service of our teachers are not unduly onerous &mdash; particularly in relation to the length of the school day and the school year compared with what is generally required of teachers in most EEC countries.  Such special efforts from any sector of the population will <Col N="2420" /> deservedly earn the gratitude and goodwill of all the Irish community.</P>
    <P>I have no illusions about the financial problems facing me in education.  Neither have I any illusions about the overall fiscal problems facing the Government. There are constraints in relation to the growth of GNP which many people ignore.  We have a large number of young people in full-time education and a relatively large number of old people who are no longer in the labour force.  I believe the House should have some statistics on these elements.  In 1980-81 the latest year for which statistics are available Ireland had, at 26.6 per cent of the population, the highest number of pupils and students in full-time education of any other country in the EEC.  Luxembourg at 16 per cent had the lowest; the UK had 20.1 per cent and West Germany 20.2 per cent.  Our dependency rate is the highest of the EEC countries.  The percentage of our working population is the lowest in the Community.  The figures for 1981 show that 38.2 per cent of our population is in the labour force, compared with 50.9 per cent for Denmark, the highest in the EEC.  The UK and 46.3 per cent in the labour force.  Of course when members of the Opposition talk about the inadequacy of funding for education, or in any other area they never refer to this constraint.</P>
    <P>Despite all this my Government's record of commitment to education is excellent.  This year the education services have been given more favourable treatment than a number of the other State services.  Let me illustrate the point. The budget for the Education group of Votes this year represents 15.54 per cent of the total provision in all Votes.  The comparable figure for 1982 was 15.17 per cent.</P>
    <P>We must not overlook the extent to which money is being spent on education at the present difficult time.  The total provision of almost £900 million is no mean provision.  Of course, we would all wish to be able to spend more.  It gives me no joy nor any other Minister to have to make economies.  But it is important to keep things in perspective.  For instance, an ordinary taxpayer with three <Col N="2421" /> children receiving full-time education, two at post-primary level and one at university, will be receiving an annual State funding from current expenditure of the order of £3,900.  This is excluding any higher education grant which may be payable. A subsidy of this magnitude is likely to exceed that person's total annual tax bill.  Put another way, those who receive a full course of primary and post-primary education will have received State funding in excess of £7,500 and will receive as much again if he or she proceeds to take a full third-level course.</P>
    <P>The House may recall that on the occasion of the debate on the Estimates for my Department on 17 June last I was not afforded the opportunity of replying to Deputy O'Rourke, the Opposition spokesperson on education.  I now wish to avail myself of this opportunity to put on the record of the House some of the points I would have made that day.  For six months now I have watched Deputy O'Rourke operating her brief on education. I have listened to her time and time again as her heart bleeds for the young people of Ireland.  Not alone does her heart bleed but, to use her own words, her &ldquo;blood boils&rdquo; and she gets &ldquo;very angry&rdquo;.  She objects to being accused of exaggeration and hyperbole.  Let any person read objectively her speech on the Estimates for Education and form their own conclusions.  She is indeed the great crusader.  She has already claimed that she embarked successfully on a crusade and I quote &ldquo;against the harshness of the measures introduced in the school transport arrangements&rdquo;.  Her own party, when in power, introduced all the harsh measures relating to school transport. Now, when out of office, she claims that as a result of her crusade my Government made changes.  How naïve can one be?</P>
    <P>Now she has given notice that she is embarking on a new crusade regarding the level of attainment for the award of scholarships in regional technical colleges. I will come back to this point in a moment as well as another matter raised by Deputy O'Rourke relating to the increase in fees in the regional technical colleges.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2422" /> Deputy O'Rourke has said several times in the House that she is proud of her impeccable pedigree coming from a tradition in education of over 120 years. It is important to point out that the area of education is the most represented area in this House.  But despite her tradition in education, her contribution to the ongoing debate on educational issues indicates that she has learned nothing.  She demands that more and more money be spent on educational services.  Her blood boils at every economy that has to be made, but she ignores the fact that services cost money and the money must be provided by the taxpayer.  Above all &mdash; and this blindness is common to all in Fianna Fáil &mdash; she ignores the fact that the difficulties of today have arisen because of the misguided and shortsighted financial and political decisions made between 1977 and 1981 by people who were both unwilling and unable to face the responsibilities of real leadership. During the past six months, I have waited for one concrete suggestion or sensible solution from the opposite benches to the economic difficulties facing the country but I have waited in vain.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the contribution from Deputy Flynn has not enlightened us any further.  Unusually for him he was floundering and sinking.  The only politics he appears to know are the politics of big spending and the spending must be foreign money because Fianna Fáil are afraid of taxation.</P>

      <P>Deputy Flynn advocated higher inflation and higher borrowing but he also praised <i>The Way Forward</i> which had as its target the cutting of the current budget deficit to £750 million this year.  It is difficult to understand how Deputy Flynn can expect to be taken seriously, but perhaps he does not expect to be taken seriously.</P>
      <P>In discussing Deputy O'Rourke's new crusade regarding the regional technical colleges scholarship requirements, it is necessary to place the following facts and considerations before the House.</P>
      <P>First, it is not unreasonable that the standard of attainment required for vocational education scholarships at technological colleges should be at least two Cs. The position regarding the higher education grants scheme which assists eligible students pursuing degree-level courses is that in the ordinary way a candidate should have grade C in at least four subjects at the leaving certificate.</P>
      <P>Attention has been drawn recently to the high drop-out rate in the regional technical colleges particularly in the first year.  One of the factors in this situation &mdash; there are, of course, others &mdash; is that the standard on entry was not adequate to enable the students concerned to benefit properly from courses at that level.  It must also be borne in mind that the change in the scholarship scheme does not affect the 2,300 renewal scholarships for these entering the second or third year of their courses in the autumn.  Neither does it affect the 4,000 students who are expected to have European Social Fund grants in 1983-84.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>According to Deputy O'Rourke, pupils in Athlone informed her that they could not go to Athlone Regional Technical College next September because they had not done the honours course. The Deputy should get her facts right. The position is that grade Cs in a common paper equate with grade Cs in the higher paper.  Common level papers are set in building construction, technical drawing <Col N="2424" /> and engineering workshop.  The important factor, however, is that the students from Athlone need have no worry about not going to the regional technical college because there is no change in the basis of attainment to qualify for an ESF grant. Any student who obtains a pass in five subjects at the leaving certificate will be eligible for an ESF grant.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increases in fee levels for the regional technical colleges, a Minister for Education, as I remarked in a recent Adjournment Debate in Seanad Éireann, is never happy to announce increases.  However, technical and technological colleges are expensive places to run, even when all due effort is made to have them operate as economically as possible.  In the present climate, when total State expenditure is at a high level and there is need to examine carefully how the money is being spent, the level of the State's commitment to the funding of the colleges cannot escape attention.  On the basis of last year's income from fees of £2.7 million, only about 6 per cent of the cost of running the colleges would have been met from the students' fees were these not increased for the coming year.</P>
    <P>There are wide variations in fee levels ranging, in the case of technician and higher technician courses, from as little, by way of course fees, as £80 per annum at present, up to £160 per annum.  In general, students in these categories will, even with the fee increases announced, be paying in course fees scarcely 10 per cent of the cost of providing these courses for them.</P>
    <P>A particular case arises in relation to the comparison of some of the higher level courses in the colleges with the fees for similar courses in the universities. Fees for degree level courses in the colleges in a particular year have ranged from a low of just over £100 a year to £315 a year.  Yet the fees, for example, in University College, Dublin, for Arts or Commerce are above £500, in the current year, while those for science and engineering are £700.</P>
    <P>Concern has been expressed in some quarters that the increase in fees will affect particularly those who are less well <Col N="2425" /> off.  I should here draw attention to the fact that almost two out of three students in the colleges have their fees paid for them either out of VEC scholarships or, in the case of degree courses, higher education grants or else by way of European Social Fund grants.  It is worth remembering that the taxpayer funds the education system.</P>
    <P>It would be remiss of me as the first woman to occupy the office of Minister for Education if I were not to refer to the cause of women which is dear to my heart and to reaffirm my commitment to continue to strive for improvement generally of women's affairs.  It is extremely important that the very positive attitude of this Government towards women should be placed on record by a series of measures that have been taken including, most importantly, the appointment of the first Minister of State for Women's Affairs. Women are a strong group in the Dáil but we are still too small in number and I commit myself to undertake an active study of the educational system to ensure that the educational process will be truly equal for both sexes &mdash; equal in accessibility and equal in participation.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to place on the record of the House the final in a long list of positive factors which should encourage all of us to anticipate a strong recovery for this country.  It is the fact that at long last the country has a Government who are prepared to govern and to take difficult decisions when necessary in the overall interests of the country.  We have had two long years of instability in politics.  This Government are a stable Government and are prepared to stick to their task of governing in these difficult times.  We may not like the decisions that have to be made from time to time but the guiding principle underlying governmental decisions is the best interests of the country.  That will continue to be the touchstone for our decisions and in a debate on the Adjournment it is important that these things be said.</P>

      <P>The Minister has made a nice speech saying all the right things but she has done nothing.  She has indicated all the factors that are needed in Government such as leadership and commitment.  However, this Government have not given any leadership and neither has the Taoiseach.  His speech this morning was one of the most inept given in an Adjournment Debate by any Taoiseach.  He listed the targets and what was required of Government.  Their strategy, on taking office, was clear and directly related to solving our problems. He said that our capacity to stop the growth in unemployment was impaired and had to be restored.  They had not got a strategy for full employment, just for stopping the growth in unemployment, and he listed nine areas in which they will take action.  However, when he tries to give answers he does not mention unemployment again.  He said they have stabilised our runaway economy, started to control our indebtedness, created an improved environment for industrial development and begun to halt the decline in competitiveness.  Those answers are part of the monetarist and book-keeping approach of the Government with which they have been obsessed since they came to office.  They have been managing the country like a huckster's shop and even making a bad job of that as the shortfall of £75 million showed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Taoiseach specifically rejected the suggestion that they were paranoid or over-emphasising the bookkeeping aspect of Government.  Nevertheless, the speech indicates that that is so, because he referred repeatedly to aspects of our financial problems.  One of <Col N="2427" /> his excuses was that we have the highest population growth in Europe and that this is the reason for high unemployment. He gives no indication that he has any policy to deal with this.  He said that another cause of our high unemployment is our lack of competitiveness and he repeats this on a number of occasions, saying that by increasing our incomes at a rate far beyond that obtaining in other countries with which we compete we have steadily reduced our competitiveness in price terms.  He said we put the price of goods up because of people demanding higher pay, but this reduces our competitiveness and causes people to lose jobs. Later on he comes back to that theme.</P>
    <P>This is wrong.  The major causes of our lack of competitiveness have been bad management, bad plant, no reinvestment in industry and hopeless marketing of our products.  These have been referred to repeatedly by economists and by surveys done in Europe, because we have the lowest wage rate in the EEC.  If that is so, why are we not more competitive. How is it we cannot compete with countries who have almost double our labour costs?  Other countries in Europe are more competitive than us because they have put more investment into their industry.  They have better productivity because of superior plant and machinery and not necessarily better productivity from their workforce, They also have far better marketing of their products and they are in a higher wage economy than we are.  We are in competition with the developing countries of the Third World because of their lower wage rates.  We should be getting into the higher technology and wage rate areas and competing with better products, better marketing, better management, better technology, plant and machinery.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, in dealing with the book-keeping question, referred to the problems of national morale, which, naturally, goes down if people are told that we can never recover from our book-keeping problems, that we will never have full employment again, that our young population is growing too rapidly to be absorbed in the labour market and <Col N="2428" /> that we have no money for education. There are no plans for jobs or the economy in the Taoiseach's adjournment speech.  He said that our problem of low national morale arises very largely from our economic and financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>This is not correct.  We have had economic and financial difficulties before.  It arises very largely from lack of leadership from the Government or the Taoiseach or any indication from him that he has the capacity to get over these problems. Everybody recognises that we have financial difficulties, but they also recognise our great capacity to deal with them if we had a Government who were capable of putting any initiatives before us.  That is why this sense of hopelessness and despair is entering into the minds of our young people because, especially over the last six months, we have had no indication whatsoever that the Government were in touch with the major problems which face young people.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said a few weeks ago that no class in society had taken as severe a cut in their living standards as the farmers.  There are about 160,000 farmers but there are 189,000 unemployed, according to the Taoiseach's figures, although according to EEC figures there are 210,000 unemployed.  The unemployed have taken a far more severe cut in their living standards than anybody else, in many cases as much as a two-thirds cut and a majority have taken a 50 per cent cut.  I do not think the Taoiseach understands the effect that has on the unemployed or on those involved with them.  It means that nearly a million people are affected by unemployment. The Taoiseach does not understand that that is creating despair, hopelessness and rebelliousness among young people. There are about 30,000 people seeking housing throughout the country &mdash; 7,500 of them in the city of Dublin, yet 40,000 building workers are out of work.  There is no plan to employ those 40,000 building workers to provide those houses, at very little cost to the State when one takes into account the cost of unemployment benefits and the return to the Exchequer from taxation on workers, PAYE, PRSI and so on.  There will be an addition to <Col N="2429" /> the wealth of the country created by the production of houses.  There will be a return from the infrastructures.  Roads throughout the country have deteriorated and yet the subvention to local authorities has been cut back by the Government.  Here is an opportunity to create jobs while at the same time taking advantage of the ending of the recession in the next year or two.</P>
    <P>At relatively low cost to the State the injection of money into the construction industry could put thousands of people back into lucrative employment.  There is too the provision of water and sewerage facilities the lack of which at the moment is preventing the development of industrial estates.  These are areas the Government should be developing.  They are areas in which the Government should be taking initiatives.  There is no such programme.  The Taoiseach referred to the National Planning Board.  We heard a good deal about this over the last six months.  He talked about a small effective National Planning Board.  He said:</P>
    <P>In the early part of next year the board will produce its proposals for a medium-term plan upon which the recover of our economy will be based.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the board will produce a medium-term plan upon which recovery will be based.  What kind of national planning board is that?  What an extraordinary statement from the Taoiseach and his Government which has been in office now for eight months?  A small effective national planning board will not produce any plan at all for a year and then the plan will be a medium-term plan upon which recovery will be based.  There is no indication of urgency.  He goes on to say:</P>
    <P>In the meantime this national planning board has been working actively in the three months since its appointment on proposals for a budgetary and financial strategy in the short-run, to be undertaken within the framework of its preliminary ideas about the mid-term.</P>
    <P>Presumably that budgetary strategy was produced in Barrettstown House last week or the week before.  The only work <Col N="2430" /> done by the National Planning Board has been to produce a short-term budgetary strategy.  No increase in taxation.  Unfortunately those who pay PAYE cannot be taxed any more.  They will be held as they are.  We will not impose any more taxation. We will cut back instead.  That is the programme from Barrettstown House.  The cutbacks emanating from the National Planning Board provoked Minister Cluskey to come out with a statement protecting the public sector within a couple of days.  I believe the cutbacks will affect NET, the Irish Sugar Company, CIE and even the ESB and so on right through the public sector as well as, of course, further cuts in Minister Hussey's Department of Education, in local authority planning and so on.</P>
    <P>Next year will bring a further 40,000 or 50,000 unemployed on to the dole queue. That is the plan for which the Taoiseach is so grateful to the National Planning Board.  That is the type of thinking designed to show that this will reduce inflation.  That would be very nice.  We might nearly catch up with Thatcher by bringing inflation down to six, seven or even five per cent.  That would be marvellous with another 50,000 or 60,000 people unemployed.  That would be a marvellous achievement in the present mood of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>These cutbacks would lead to a further reduction of the budget deficit and the balance of payments at the expense of people who are now working but who will be unemployed next year, finished for life.  Last year and the year before 30, 40 and 50 year olds were finished for life. They have accepted that in a state of absolute despair and dejection.  What drives them even deeper into despair is the fact that their 10, 12 and 14 year old children have no hope of employment in the future.  The recognition of that is worse than the loss of their own jobs. The Taoiseach intends that that will be the fate of another 60,000 people next year in order to balance the books and produce nice figures on inflation and so on.</P>
    <P>With regard to the task force on employment the Taoiseach devoted just one paragraph of 14 lines to it.  He says <Col N="2431" /> they are examining ways in which existing employment policies can be improved to make them more effective and he says the process requires a review of some of the systems of incentives that exist.  I was looking forward to the Taoiseach sweeping into action, armed to the teeth, ready to tackle the problem.  Here I find a paragraph of absolute waffle.  And the following paragraph on youth employment is also dreadful stuff.</P>
    <P>When the Government came into office they made specific promises and pledges and entered into certain commitments. Tax derived from PAYE and wages and salaries would be reduced. The reverse has occurred.  The tax has been increased and there is an additional 1 per cent levy, a most iniquitous tax, on workers' wages.  The previous Government had a 1 per cent youth employment levy and, though it was inequitable, it was accepted as a device to collect money for youth employment.  But this 1 per cent levy is solely for the purpose of getting more money for the Exchequer, a typical Fine Gael-Labour tactic.</P>
    <P>That was a complete reversal of what the specific Fine Gael-Labour Joint Programme said.  They further said an extra £100 million would be raised in capital taxation by 1984.  They do not have much time to do it.  Capital taxation has been steadily reduced since 1974 when it was 11.2 per cent of all taxation to 1982 when 4.7 per cent of all taxation is capital tax. In 1983 we see that 4.7 per cent even further reduced.  They could easily double and should in fact treble the rate of capital tax to bring it up to the UK level where just over 30 per cent of all tax is capital taxation.  There is almost three times the level of our capital taxation in Britain.  There is ample scope for doing it but it has not been done.</P>
    <P>In the Joint Programme for Government the Labour Party failed to get again the commitment from Fine Gael to actually do what they promised to do, unemployment and disability benefit to be kept in line with take home pay.  The budget did not do that.  There is an overall loss in this year's budget.  Furthermore, all welfare benefits were delayed for a <Col N="2432" /> further three months which further reduced the actual amount they got in the end.  A Garda authority will be set up. The Minister now says he has changed his mind on that.  This was part of the Fine Gael-Labour Joint Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>The reform of marriage laws will be examined.  A committee was set up yesterday to do that.  It was to be done by the end of 1983 but the committee which has been set up are not to report for 12 months and they do not have to make any recomendation.  That is not adhering to that commitment.</P>
    <P>There were very specific pledges.  For instance, the Government will set up an employment task force of key economic Ministers.  I read out the paragraph but I do not see what it is doing or where it is going.  A National Development Corporation would be established as an early priority.  That has been referred to time and time again but nobody knows if it exists or, if it does, what its job is.  I do not believe it exists.  It has been referred to on numerous occasions but it has not been established.</P>
    <P>Tax credits will be substituted for tax allowances.  That is scrubbed.  There will be a review of discretionary trusts to eliminate the use of these as tax avoidance. That is scrubbed.  An annual 10 per cent tax on derelict sites was to be levied.  That has not been levied.  Immediate action was to be taken to end compensation loopholes in the existing planning laws. We had a Planning Bill, which was passed yesterday, but it is only changing the board.  It did not do anything about closing the loopholes in existing planning laws.  That could easily have been done but it has not been done.</P>
    <P>A commission on social welfare was to be established.  There is a reference to that in the Taoiseach's speech.  An anti-poverty plan would be drawn up and implemented.  We have not heard a word about that.  Hospital boards would be restructured and made more democratic. We have not heard anything about that yet.  Negotiations with a view to changing the fee per item to a capitation system in the GMS would be commenced and the National Development Corporation <Col N="2433" /> would be given the task of establishing a viable national drugs company.</P>
    <P>The present use of State cars would be reviewed.  They will probably decide to keep them.  Last January the Taoiseach at least gave the public the impression that the State cars for junior Ministers were being scrubbed but this has not happened. There was also a commitment for the introduction of a national scheme for adult and continuing education.  Unfortunately the Minister is not here now. There has been a cutback in adult education just as in all other areas of education. This is a highly dangerous area for cutbacks.  A national scheme for adult education was to be developed.  The cutbacks are entirely dangerous because that is an area which can assist in eliminating quite a lot of vandalism and the development of young people into lawlessness of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>There were many promises, pledges and commitments given by the Government on coming into office but they have not been kept.  There has been a very notable absence from the Taoiseach's speech about the most controversial and longest debated legislation which went through the House in the last six months. I refer to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill.  The Taoiseach did not once refer to that legislation.  Is he ashamed to mention it?  If he did not think it was important why was it brought in?  Why did the Minister for Justice spend so much time in the House putting it through?  Is it because it is Fianna Fáil legislation which the Coalition Government, through their ineptness, stupidity and cowardice, put through against their will?</P>
    <P>The recent opinion poll showed that the Members of this Dáil were at the bottom of the list in relation to any significant influences on the lives of our young people.  The charade of the Constitution Bill was a significant cause of this.  The majority of the people do not want the proposed amendment to the Constitution.  In politics, law and philosophy this amendment to the Constitution can only drag the Dáil lower in the esteem of an increasing number of disillusioned people.  It is extraordinary <Col N="2434" /> that the Taoiseach did not consider it worth while to refer to it as a useful piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>The greatest indictment of the Government &mdash; to my mind they have only brought in one Bill of their own since they came into power, that is the Planning Bill this week &mdash; is that within six months the fortunes of Fianna Fáil have been miraculously restored by no efforts of their own but by the ineptness and the harshness of the Government in their Social Welfare Bill and their Finance Bill, which also has not been referred to by the Taoiseach.  The Bill of the Minister for the Environment putting tax on water supplies, the significance of which has not yet been felt by the people, together with the other two Bills I have referred to, are the things which will be remembered by the people.  There is not one constructive piece of legislation ot indication that there is one constructive thought in the Cabinet about dealing with the increasing problem of unemployment and lack of jobs particularly for our young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Education in her comments spent almost 25 per cent of her time condemning Deputy Mary O'Rourke from this side of the House.  It is poor form that in an Adjournment Debate any Minister would use time, which should be spent in the interests of the nation, decrying the activities of a Deputy from this side of the House.  Is it because her Department or she are so poverty stricken she felt she had to do this?  The following quotation from her speech will prove adequately what I am trying to say:</P>
      <P>It is time that we as a nation had more confidence in our future.  It is time too that as a people we believed in ourselves and in the great potentialities that are there to be exploited but we must work for them.  There is no point in sitting around and waiting for things to happen.  We must be up and doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is lovely stuff but there is little else contained in this paper.  After listening to it and searching through the speech afterwards <Col N="2435" /> I find little confidence in the future or hope for anybody.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that to the young all things were possible.  How can she say that in this day and age after her own performance in Government?  The Minister claimed that her Government's record on their commitment to education is excellent.  The Minister should not have spent a quarter of her time here condemning Deputy O'Rourke.  She should not have come into the Chamber at all judging by her performance here.</P>
    <P>With the end of the session in sight it is important to look over the performance of the Government and at the state of the economy to consider whether the direction we are taking will improve our economy.  If the population were asked about that they would be unanimous in saying that the Government were a disaster. The past seven months would have been difficult for any Government but this Government have totally misjudged the scene and have introduced shortsighted fragmented plans, a &ldquo;balance-the-books-quickly&rdquo; campaign which has proved to be an utter disaster.  This has been evident in the last few days when the predictions of the Minister for Finance have gone haywire.  What will things be like by the end of the year? Unemployment levels are impossibly high and are increasing at an enormous rate.  It is worrying that even during the summer, when seasonal employment should reduce the dole queues, unemployment is rising.  Having listened to both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture in this debate there is little hope of a change for the better.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's grasp of agriculture is pathetic.  It was difficult to find one sentence in the Taoiseach's contribution that would give hope to farmers.  About three paragraphs in the Taoiseach's script were devoted to agriculture but not one word was said about the local scene.  The Taoiseach talked about what should happen in Europe but he has said nothing to the Irish farmer.  The Taoiseach says that he spoke at length recently on the economic and social importance of a prosperous agricultural industry.  I was present at <Col N="2436" /> Inch, County Wexford, when the Taoiseach opened a new yogurt plant.  I listened with disbelief to his deliberations on agriculture.  The Taoiseach in typical political fashion said what the farmers would like to hear and he accurately identified the problems.  On the other hand the Government have exacerbated the problems by the withdrawal of finance, displaying a complete ignorance of the industry and its potential.  The Taoiseach in his speech said:</P>
    <P>The extent of the real income drop of farmers in recent years has had a severe impact not only on farm families but on the many other families whose incomes depend directly or indirectly on a prosperous agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>On the other hand referring to the EEC farm price negotiations the Minister for Agriculture said:</P>
    <P>.... it is deemed that the Irish farm sector will benefit from the package to the extent of £255 million in a full year. This impressive input will benefit not only farmers but also the entire national economy.</P>
    <P>These contradictory statements are the cause of the division between town and country to which the Taoiseach referred this morning.  To suggest that farmers will get £255 million this year is misleading. I challenge the Minister for Agriculture through the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, to tell the House by how much the farmers will benefit from this package.  I would ask the Minister of State to also ask the Taoiseach to ensure that he gets a look at the Minister for Agriculture's script in future before he talks so that they will not come here making contradictory statements.</P>

      <P>Deputy Deasy departed from his script to tell us that during the past four weeks at Question Time those on the Fianna Fáil benches offered no suggestions as to how the agricultural scene might be improved or as to how employment might be created.  The Mintifie <Col N="2437" /> ister must be ignorant about the agricultural industry if he could not see scope for improvement and the creation of jobs in our supplementary questions and suggestions. This type of political point scoring is typical of the Government.  Their only excuse for bad direction in the economy is that it is Fianna Fáil's fault. Before they came to power these people had all the answers.  Now the answers are scarce and very hollow.</P>
      <P>I look forward to the day when agriculture will be recognised by this Government as their biggest industry and as the industry with the greatest potential for the creation of employment.  Because a healthy agriculture means a healthy economy, every pound invested in the industry is a pound well spent.  Since the coming to office of this Government there have been several attacks on the farming sector and there have been enormous job losses in the industry and a subsequent loss of confidence.  The services industries supplying agricultural needs have gone to the wall over a short period.  Can the Government not see that this foolish direction can only lengthen the dole queues which have already increased by 50,000 since they came into office?  Can they not recognise that in the agricultural industry employment could be created almost overnight in building firms, haulage firms, drainage and agricultural contractual firms and in the services industries?  It is estimated that 6,000 job losses have occurred in the industry since this Government assumed power.  What kind of commitment is that to industry?  Can the Government not recognise that here are a section of people who, even when in bad circumstances such as exist today, work from dawn to dusk seven days a week for a low income and whose natural commitment to the industry is 100 per cent?  The Government's performance in relation to agriculture is dismal.  It has caused grave dissatisfaction and a loss of confidence throughout the industry with resultant lessening of production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture said today that the increase in agricultural output would be 6 per cent this year even taking into account the bad weather. <Col N="2438" /> What would it be under a Fianna Fáil Government?  A farmer myself, in the business since I was born, having grown up on a farm, having a reasonable though not adequate agricultural education and with 20 years' experience as a farmer, I consider the Minister's predictions today typical of the Department of Agriculture with statistics given to suit an occasion and no base whatsoever apart from guesswork. Book farming is not the best type of farming.  I appeal to the Minister that in any future speeches he might make he will try not to mislead the farmers and not give the urban population the impression that farm incomes will increase by percentages that are just not on.  I suggest that during the summer recess the Minister spend time on a farm so that he may be educated in the practicalities of farming and come to understand its difficulties.</P>

      <P>The Minister said this morning that we offered no help at Question Time in the recent past.  We took every opportunity presented to us to offer good, constructive advice.  I would like to take him to task about a statement he made this morning in relation to exports and imports.  During the past three weeks enormous quantities of Italian and Dutch potatoes have been imported into this country and as a result Irish potato growers are being put out of business.  It is possible that some of them may never produce potatoes again because the profit margins have almost disappeared. Irish potato growers have produced a top quality early potato but because of imports of vast tonnages from the countries I have mentioned and because of the manipulation by merchants here, the potato industry is dying.  If the Minister does not take this business seriously he will find it difficult to procure Irish potatoes.</P>

      <P>Far greater quantities have been imported this year than in any other year.  The Minister said this morning that calls for interference by the Government in the importation of potatoes were coming from the Fianna Fáil benches and that this could not be done because 75 per cent of our exports are agricultural and if other EEC countries adopted the same approach many of our exports could be blocked.  This nonsense is typical of one who does not recognise the importance of the potato industry or the agricultural industry as a whole. Fianna Fáil believe in our people, in this instance the farmers.  Farmers can produce a product better than that which is imported.  This industry must be protected against foreign imports.  Our own producers should come first and in this respect Fianna Fáil have adopted a very responsible approach.  Italy and Holland have been dumping potatoes on the Irish market for the past three weeks and I ask the Minister of State to ask his Minister about the legality of such a practice. These imports are coming in by way of container lorries with no inspection whatsoever at the point of entry and only the occasional spot check at the market.  It is a long way from Rosslare to Dublin and there is many a slip 'twixt the cup and the lip.  Officials in the Department of Agriculture and officials from An Foras Talúntais have told me that ring rot, a disease of the potato crop which is very difficult to control and which could wipe out the entire crop for one year, is very prevalent in Canada.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State should listen and then he will be well educated.  It is well known that the Italians import their seed potatoes from Canada. We are importing potatoes from Italy which might have had their origin in Canada and it is possible that because of the Government's negligence we are allowing ring rot into this country.  Successive Governments have been successful in keeping the Colorado beetle out of the country.  Everybody knows the devastating effect the Colorado beetle would have if it came in here.  When we import potatoes in containers there is a reasonable prospect that the Colorado beetle may also be imported inadvertently.  That is another reason why we must carry out strict inspections.  Recently in a County Wicklow port a Colorado beetle was found in a ship's hold.  The agricultural industry must not be allowed to die because of carelessness.  I ask the Minister for Agriculture to ensure that every container of potatoes is inspected at least twice.  That would alleviate some of the problems and the Irish potato industry and the jobs it provides will survive.  The early and main crops generate an enormous amount of employment in weed control, picking and so forth from sowing time until the potato arrives on the market. Are we about to throw the jobs to the wind and give them to the Dutch and the Italians?  I cannot understand why the Government insist on refusing to impose their own standards in regard to the importation of potatoes and other produce. In many ways we can block imports.  This is generally accepted in the House but we are all too gentlemanly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recently in County Wexford, Springs of Wexford had to let off 20 people for the same reason.  Steel springs were being manufactured for CIE buses, but now they are being dumped on our market by some of our European partners because there is an oversupply in Europe. The result is job losses.  The Irish product is far superior but because the foreign product comes from outside it seems to <Col N="2441" /> be more acceptable &mdash; we do not have a belief in our own products.  The Government should take positive sides in this and protect the jobs of our people.</P>
    <P>Our potato merchants have been manipulating the market to suit themselves over a number of years.  On the Dublin market recently Italian and Dutch potatoes were on display at £9 per 25 kilos, but Irish potatoes, of superior quality, were being offered at £5 and displayed less conspicuously.  The Government should not be allowing this type of unfair trading.  There is a greater profit for the merchants in foreign potatoes. That is the simple answer.  Do the Government intend to allow this unfair trading to continue at the expense of the Irish industry?</P>
    <P>Questions were asked in recent weeks about the importation of fillers such as tapioca.  Today we had the Minister for Agriculture telling us he would insist on having as much native grain grown as possible.  On the other hand he continues to allow cheap fillers to be imported.  His speech was a nice one for the day but what will his action be?  I cannot see any evidence of positive action on his part.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme, now suspended, helped to increase our output by 11.5 per cent.  That target was achieved between 1975 and 1978, according to the Minister today, but he said it was necessary to suspend the scheme in order to have a look at it.  Such a suggestion, and Deputy Donnellan will understand this, is similar to suggesting that an entire football team would be taken off the field to decide whether one of the players should be replaced.  That is what happened to the farm modernisation scheme &mdash; it was scrapped in order to look at it even though it had been successful in getting the land of 600 farmers for young, more progressive men.  This suggestion that schemes should be scrapped to have a look at them is not believed by anybody any more.</P>
    <P>The farm modernisation scheme suspension meant that 22 small building firms in Wexford, Waterford, Wicklow, Carlow and South Tipperary have gone to the wall.  I was in touch with ACOT officers in Wexford this morning and I <Col N="2442" /> was told that there is no building whatever being done in that county.  The same applies to drainage contractors.  By their activities the Government are putting many more people on the dole.  This type of thing typifies the present Government.</P>
    <P>I hope that during the recess the Government will have a rethink on their policy of book balancing and come forward with a commonsense approach in order to keep the ship afloat so that when the recession ends there will be somebody left to pick up the trail.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are being starved of money.  Would it not be sensible to transfer moneys from social welfare to the local authorities to help them to look after their roads, hedges and environmental amenities and to maintain the schemes introduced by Fianna Fáil in 1977?  Since then I had hoped that such schemes would be encouraged.  The jobs are not there for the people but the work is there if we would only look for it. Having listened to all of the Government speakers &mdash; the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Education &mdash; I did not hear one glimmer of hope for the future.  All we heard was what was and what might have been. There was no reference whatever to the future.  I am sure the people of the country will be as desperately disappointed as I am.  I appeal to the Government to lead us to believe in our country.  Let us believe that we can succeed and let us get on with the job of governing and have less crying.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we inherited a legacy <Col N="2443" /> of debt and the country was on the verge of bankruptcy.  There was no drive in any industry.  They were sliding downhill. The country had not survived the effects of the 1977 manifesto which was sold from every platform in Ireland to gain a 20 seat majority for Fianna Fáil. That manifesto promised abolition of rates and tax on cars, manna from heaven.  Everyone in the country was supposed to get his share of that manna in the decades to come.</P>
      <P>Alas, the manna did not fall for very long.  We had to come back to reality. We had to face facts and we had to build up the international prestige that this country had enjoyed for years before that downward trend.  We had to put the country on an even keel.  Just because a few spineless people had not the courage or the guts to stand up to true facts we again found ourselves on the Opposition benches in November 1982.  The country again suffered from February 1982 until the last days of November 1982 when the Coalition Government were returned to office to pick up the traces and to take up the challenge that we had so manfully assumed in 1981.  When we came back we found that the ship of State had drifted hopelessly again.</P>

In a couple of years £4 billion was borrowed for completely unproductive purposes. Surely then the time had come for common sense?  It is about time the people on the Opposition benches sat back and realised where the country stood when we assumed office at the beginning of this year.  People may say the recovery should come faster, but it is far better to see a slow recovery than a fast recovery followed by a plummeting to the depths of despair perhaps overnight. Everything our Ministers have done in the past session they have done for the betterment of this nation, to ensure that this nation will survive and that the future will be brighter than the past 20 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have today the youngest population in western Europe.  The Irish nation faces a number of daunting challenges over the next decade or so.  At the end of this century it is expected that the population will have increased by one million. To cater for this increase 0.5 to 0.7 million new jobs will be required.  We are told that up to 75 per cent of the population will live in urban areas with 40 per cent of the total four million living in the eastern region.  We will need 0.6 to 0.7 million new houses together with the necessary shops, schools, hospitals, recreational facilities and so on.  New and <Col N="2445" /> improved roads will be required to accommodate a twofold increase in the number of motor vehicles.  There will be a twofold increase in telephone and energy requirements.  If we have the luck to see Deputy John Donnellan as Minister in charge of telecommunications I have no doubt he will rise to the occasion and make sure that people will not have to wait five, seven and ten years for a telephone.</P>

They did not give us even one mile of national primary road from Cork to Mizen Head or from Cork to the Dursey Sound.  They sabotaged our railways, sold them to the blacks out in Mozambique or somewhere else.  We were told that was in order to streamline CIE, to put them back on the road to paying their own way.  Thirty years later they are still not paying their way, but the people of west Cork have to put up with roads unmatched in any other part of the country.</P>

Remember that when the last litre of oil and gas will have been drawn from our gas and oil wells agriculture will still have the same potential and perhaps even more.</P>

      <P>The creation of a new job in industry outside of agriculture costs £15,000.  It must be remembered that to keep a man from leaving agriculture, fisheries and forestry costs the State £270 only per annum.  I have seen industries mushrooming all over the place, receiving large State grants at the expense of an already overburdened taxpayer.  But a lot of them appear to open in January and close in September.  Is there any monitoring of those foreign tycoons who come in here to make a few extra millions and take the next plane back?  They come here because they think the Irish are soft prey and they are receiving special terms. For years we fooled ourselves with the idea that industry would constitute the hub of success here but it has transpired to be a dismal failure as far as our balance of payments is concerned.  We must realise that were it not for agricultural exports this country would have foundered long ago.  It is an absolute necessity that the farming industry here be assisted.</P>

      <P>I spoke yesterday on fisheries and I shall not repeat my remarks today.  But side by side with the farmer the small fisherman was the salt of the earth.  He kept the small shopkeeper going in his area, probably he kept the small bar going in his area when he would have a few drinks coming from Mass or from a funeral.  He enjoyed a few drinks provided he had sufficient money in his pocket to do so.  A man like this kept the economy going in his area.  I listened to the Minister for Education when she spoke.  What did Fianna Fáil do for education when they were in Government? They closed all the one-teacher and two-teacher schools in the west and they transported the children in dilapidated buses to other schools.  They did not even replace the buses when it was obvious they needed replacement.</P>

      <P>When Fianna Fáil closed the one-and two-teacher national schools in rural Ireland they ruined the economy of the areas.  I am glad that there has been a change in that policy but I am afraid it has come too late.  Throughout rural Ireland today one can see fine, stone-built schoolhouses, now the property of foreigners and used by them as holiday homes.  In many cases they bought the buildings for trivial sums of money and where the premises have not been sold one can see rooks making nests in the rafters.  It is a sad reflection on a party whom I thought were concerned about rural Ireland.</P>
      <P>It is well known that many intelligent people were educated in national schools in rural areas.  I am proud to say that I was educated in a humble little school in rural Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to all our people to play their part in putting our country on the right <Col N="2450" /> road.  A nation of our size cannot achieve significant economic expansion without a sustained effort which must embrace all elements of the community.  There cannot be any guarantee of success but if we are dedicated to the task of helping our country we will achieve that success.  It is time for a united effort.  I appeal to the Opposition to unite with us in our efforts to restore sanity and prosperity to the nation.  Bickering and scoring political points will not achieve anything.  We need a common approach to solve the problems that confront us and we need people with enough backbone to deal with the many difficulties that face us.</P>
    <P>We must insist on law and order and we must insist that the economy be put on a proper footing.  We cannot stick our heads in the sand and forget about our problems.  The sooner they are dealt with the better for the country.  A little restraint is called for on the part of all our people in order to put the country back on the road to prosperity.  We have one of the best countries in the world if it got half a chance&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with Deputy Sheehan that we need a common approach and less vilification, innuendo and challenge. <Col N="2451" /> I should like him to have a word with his Taoiseach about that and perhaps he might get him to adjust the speech he made this morning.  Deputy Sheehan has given us a strong, personal view of the need to do something worthwhile.</P>
      <P>At the time of the Adjournment of the Dáil one assesses the situation, catches up on constituency work and makes plans for the new session.  It is an important time in that respect.  When one is in Opposition one should be able to do that without too much worry about the economic situation, but unfortunately in the present circumstances we go into recess with great fear about the situation that will face the country when the Dáil resumes.  It is obvious that the situation is deteriorating rapidly but the Government have no plans to deal with it.  I hope that when the Minister for Finance is speaking tomorrow he will tell us when he will produce the Estimates.  As the House knows, we produced the Estimates for 1983 in mid-October 1982 and we had them available then so that they could be discussed and considered.  The Minister for Finance said the Estimates would be ready in September and I should like to know his plans with regard to this matter.  Once the House adjourns presumably the Government will get down to the job of dealing with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not going to dwell on criticisms of the Coalition Government.  We could spend a long time criticising what they have done since they came to office. Their actions have departed very much from what they said they would do.  They have forgotten about the poor.  They made great paly of the poor and weaker sections of the community before achieving office.  The PR machine used them for their own ends and then cast them aside.  There is no doubt now in the minds of the elderly, the handicapped and those genuinely in need that that was done.  We have no differences with the Government in regard to cutting down on waste and those who are not genuinely poor and in need, but the position of the poor has greatly worsened.  The Government have shown no concern for the less well off. Their policies in that respect have been <Col N="2452" /> surprisingly inhuman and their principal characteristic is remote bureaucracy. They have shown little concern for the realities of life at basic level.  When you speak to elderly people who have to pay for food, heating and transport, you understand their difficulties.</P>
    <P>Another group who are doing very badly since this Government took office are families.  They find it almost impossible to manage on the average take-home pay.  I have heard people say that mincemeat is a luxury.  Perhaps that is a joke to some people, but unfortunately for others it is true.  The famous family roast is gone because the family breadwinner's money has been reduced despite all the promises about PAYE and net take home pay.  Prices have been increased directly since the budget came into operation.  There has been no increase in children's allowances and the double week's pay will not be given to families in need in September when the Dáil is in recess.  Dependants of lower income people were given a double week in September and again in December. That has now been abolished, so going back to school this September will create great hardship for them.  We now hear also that food subsidies are under very critical examination and may be partly reduced.</P>
    <P>There is no need to concentrate on other expenses which arise for families. Education costs are soaring and public transport is becoming a luxury.  The cost of paying bus fares for three or four school-going children is almost prohibitive. When we started our famous jogging campaign some years ago it was to get people out and to improve their health.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition followed by myself.  We thought that this was very important from a health point of view.  Now it is obvious that people may need to keep it up because of the high cost of transport.  I find it incomprehensible that the Labour Party should participate in this systematic reduction of the incomes of the poor and elderly in the way in which it is being <Col N="2453" /> done by the Coalition.  All the principles have been set aside and the Labour Party have allowed themselves to be swamped by the right-wing, conservative policies of Fine Gael.</P>
      <P>Worst of all is the attitude to employment and investment.  We pointed out that unemployment would accelerate as a result of the budget.  When Fianna Fáil were in Government we did our utmost to stem the rising tide of unemployment, which although very greatly affected by international factors is also under our own control.  When this Government came into office they said that for the first couple of years they would make no effort to stem this tide and that they would let it flow.  We are now seeing the early results of that policy.  Unfortunately, these are only initial results.  This is the best time of year for employment but the Coalition have set a new record of 189,120 unemployed and rising.  This means that over 14 per cent of the population are unemployed.</P>
      <P>There was a study carried out in the Bonnybrook area in conjunction with the AnCO training centre in Baldoyle.  The survey showed that the level of unemployment there is 27 per cent and rising rapidly.  A very striking aspect of the study is the desire of people, especially the young, to get work of any kind and to be involved in society.  The policies of the Government led to this inevitable rise in unemployment.  They are obviously not perturbed, their heads are in the sand and when they study the unemployment figures they must do something to change their strategy.  If not, what will it be like in November, December and January next?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, the Government are continuing their own war of words without regard for the realities of today.  The Taoiseach in his speech talked about probity and made innuendoes about leadership. He adopted a holier than thou attitude but offered nothing in practical terms.  What are the realities of today? There are drug pushers roaming the streets, cars are being stolen at will, criminals are flouting the law, jail birds are on enforced holidays, judges are frustrated by the Government's lack of commitment, <Col N="2454" /> the morale of the Garda is being undermined by convicted criminals walking about and decent, law-abiding citizens fear for their lives and property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Taoiseach said:</P>
      <P>Allied to the recent provision of new prison accommodation, this will help to expand the capacity of our system to cope with convictions.</P>
      <P>What utter rubbish from the Taoiseach. He took £6 million from the capital programme this year.  It was £17 million and it is now reduced to £11 million.  That is what he did for the provision of prison accommodation.  Let us talk about facts. If these problems are tackled now the Government will have our full and active support.  Do not come in with documents like this for the purpose of casting more innuendoes across the floor of the House.  There has to be another way.  The basic strategy of this Coalition is wrong and the Government should admit that now.  We are all agreed we must keep a tight set of books.  Do not keep running back to 1977 or 1950.  What about 1979 when we had the biggest oil price increase ever experienced, 28 dollars a barrel? Start at that point when talking about our economic situation.</P>
      <P>The limits have been reached in our borrowing capacity but that does not prevent us carrying on with the job.  We are coming very close to the point now, and this is one of the real dangers &mdash; and here I am talking from experience presently listening to people in substantial industries &mdash; where major industries will soon have to make critical decisions, decisions irrevocable for periods of 10 to 15 years ahead.  We will enter a long-term cycle of depression if we are not careful now. That is the important thing, not the damage this year but the damage a long period ahead and one does not reverse the damage once one puts investment off.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It does not have to be that way.  We <Col N="2455" /> can give hope to our people, especially our young people.  We must believe in our young people and in Ireland itself and its future.  We must recognise that our greatest asset is our youth and our will to work.  We must be prepared to invest.  For that we need a national development programme based on our assets, concentrating on agriculture, industrial exports, marketing and so on.  We must concentrate on the productive side of our economy.  We need that kind of programme urgently.  We need to invest in it and, if we do that, we have the people who will meet the requirements of the situation.</P>
    <P>One of the Bills passed recently dealt with the pro-life amendment.  When the text of the proposed amendment was first published it received widespread approval from virtually all sections.  It was only after political pressure had been built up by some Fine Gael and Labour Deputies, assisted by an outside pressure group, that the divisions within the Coalition Government gave rise to the Government's opposition to a positive pro-life amendment in any form.  That opposition has led to a deliberate attempt to mislead and confuse some people as to the value of the proposed amendment.</P>
    <P>The amendment simply extends to the life of the unborn the same protection in the same terms that has existed for over forty years for other fundamental rights such as the right to liberty and the right to life of the citizen.  Under the Constitution the State already guarantees to protect the right to life of the mother and is bound to defend it.  The State is also bound by the Constitution to protect the mother's life from &ldquo;unjust attack&rdquo;.  The proposed amendment does not alter these constitutional guarantees of a mother's right to life in any respect.  The amendment is a positive caring proposal which will give constitutional protection to unborn life just as other rights, such as the right to liberty, to free speech, to freedom from inhuman treatment, are protected.</P>
    <P>It is important to note that the proposed amendment specifically requires the Dáil and the Courts, when legislating <Col N="2456" /> for or considering the right to life of the unborn, to have due regard to the mother's constitutional right.  In fact that provision precedes the protection given to the life of the unborn.  Further, under the terms of the proposed amendment, the State is only bound to defend the right to life of the unborn in so far as this is practicable.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to suggest that the human life of the child is intrinsically more worthy or less worhty than other human life.  It would be contrary to the spirit and letter of the Constitution if one fundamental human right was specified as being superior or inferior to others. This does not mean that any such right, such as the right to life of the unborn, is absolute.  It is well established and our courts have recognised that none of the rights protected by the Constitution are absolute rights.  Neither are the protections afforded by the Constitution absolute ones.  As I have already pointed out, the amendment requires the State to defend the life of the unborn &ldquo;as far as practicable&rdquo;.  In deciding what is practicable the State must have due regard to the mother's right.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the amendment will not affect existing medical practice where the mother is entitled to appropriate medical treatment where her life is under threat even if such treatment would result in the loss of the child in the womb.  Neither would the existing law of 1861 be affected, but the value which society places on the right to life of the unborn will be reflected in our Constitution along with the other values or fundamental rights already provided for.</P>
    <P>It is mischievous and misleading to suggest that either the Oireachtas or the courts in having regard to the constitutional rights of the mother, and in defending the right of the unborn only as far as practicable, would in some way outlaw the accepted medical practices which have existed in our society and under our law for 200 years or more.  There is nothing in the proposed amendment which restricts either the courts, the Legislature or the medical profession from exercising their power, duty or discretion to protect <Col N="2457" /> the right to life of the mother where her life is threatened.</P>
    <P>Many statements have been made by groups and individuals which are designed to sow confusion in the minds of some members of the public and play on their fears.  These emanate mostly from sources that are opposed to any form of positive constitutional protection for the unborn and are made primarily for this purpose.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Criminal Justice Bill, the Taoiseach says the Bill is coming shortly.  It is particularly urgent.  A draft Bill was available when the Government took office and their credibility must now be questioned because of the delay in introducing such an urgent measure.  The Bill will deal with many aspects of crime and lawlessness.  The matter is very urgent.  I accept what the Taoiseach said but I regret the Bill was not introduced as it should have been in this session.  I also welcome the new Dáil select committee on crime, lawlessness and vandalism and I assure the Minister he will have our constructive support in all these matters.</P>
    <P>We have heard a great deal about the crackdown on drugs.  I am slightly concerned because the Minister has amalgamated the drug squad with the serious crime division.  We specifically established last year a special project co-ordinator here as a chief superintendent for very good reasons.  We believed the problem was so serious that we needed this kind of action in a separate and very specialised way.  I have serious doubts about the wisdom of amalgamation.  The Minister means well but I doubt the wisdom of absorbing it into the general crime division at a moment particularly when emergency action is required.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the committees on marriage breakdown and generally on family law reform.  I assure the Minister we will co-operate in the work undertaken over the recess and into the autumn.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I am quite serious when I say to the Government that they should revise their strategy now and look to the creation of employment in productive areas so that our rising unemployment <Col N="2458" /> may be somewhat curtailed and those who are depending on us for their future will see from this House and the Government an interest and an investment in their interests.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(d) Any licence granted for the purpose of this section shall not be subject to duties, licence fees or other charges for the purpose of raising money for the Exchequer.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that any licences granted under this section will not be subject to licence duties or fees or in any way be used for the purpose of raising money for the Exchequer.  We are naturally aware that it is probably difficult to make this kind of amendment to the section in view of the fact that there may well be a system whereby any licences which may be granted by the Minister will at least have to cover registration costs or something else and there may be difficulty in showing that a licence granted by the Minister would not have some charge or duty levied on the issue of it.  We fear there will be a certain amount of bureaucracy here and there may be need for people to apply for licences which may eventually be granted.  As this provision in section 3 covers Irish registered boats generally we feel that a section which does not provide that there will be no charges or licence duties and especially as we have no indication of what the nature of those licence fees or duties may be, we feel we cannot agree to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister recognises that the fishing industry generally has gone through a very bad patch over the last few years and they have had the enormous difficulties of rising interest charges, poor fishing, poor fish prices and <Col N="2460" /> many other things.  As this is something which is really meant to regulate events and keep an accurate record of what the situation will be, we feel it is undesirable to have this provision here unless the Minister can give some indication that the section will not be used to impose any charges except nominal ones.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I allay the fears of the Deputy and the industry by saying that it is not the intention to make a charge for licences.  As there is no specific provision in the Bill for making such a charge it cannot be made.  We would have to provide for the raising of a charge in the Bill in order to do so.  The fact that there is no provision in the Bill for that purpose means that it cannot be done.  I assure the Deputy of that.  I am sure that assurance will be sufficient for the Deputy to withdraw the amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

I fully appreciate what the Minister says, that as far as he is concerned we can rest assured that there will not be any licence fee or duty.  We also have to accept the fact that this Minister will not always be Minister for Fisheries.

      <P>I assure the Deputy, as <Col N="2461" /> far as I am concerned, that I am speaking in good faith.  I am speaking from a purely legal position in relation to what I have said, that because there is no provision there I cannot provide for a charge.  So far as speaking for the Deputy is concerned, if he found himself over here I do not know what he might do to get around the legal position.  That is his business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>

      <P>I would like to get some explanation from the Minister, in relation to the provision in subsection (5) (b) (ii), of the reason why that provision has been included in this section.  It states:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>While it is the intention to prescribe 75 per cent as the minimum level of crewing in the regulations it would be unwise to restrict the Minister. If for any reason 75 per cent was unworkable or inadequate and if it were in the Bill we would have to amend the Bill and as Deputies know that would take some time.  The idea of introducing this provision by regulation is to enable us to act swiftly at any given time.  This seems to be the more sensible and expeditious way of dealing with problems that might arise. We can amend by regulation with 24 hours if necessary whereas if we were trying to plug a hole through this House, as Deputies well know, a lot of water would have gone down before we could provide a plug.  The 75 per cent would be written into the regulation as a minimum requirement although it would not be in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding of section 2 was that it referred only to Irish boats. Therefore I am anxious to know why we need that paragraph in that section when what we are concerned about is the question of boats from third countries and member states of the Community.  We would be adamant about boats from third countries in relation to the 75 per cent issue and that is why we are not anxious to move the amendments on the other <Col N="2463" /> sections now.  We thought this section was to deal with the registration of Irish boats and we felt that this type of situation would not arise in that case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it will not arise in the case of Irish boats.  At the moment, as the Deputy knows, nine ex-Spanish boats are registered here and Irish boats flying the Irish flag could also take on third country crews.  There is also no reason to believe that because an Irish boat is Irish they would not indulge in this kind of activity if it suited them to do so.  The nine ex-Spanish boats registered here flying the Irish flag but not having the requisite proportion of Irish crew membership are dealt with under this section, which is there for that sort of situation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have a <i>de facto</i> situation at the moment in which we have Irish boats not falling within the ambit of this provision when it is made a regulation. This approach is sure to solve that problem.  In the future we do not know what might happen in relation to Irish boats.  They could carry on a certain type of fishing activity that traditional crewmen might not participate in because of the size of the boat, the length of time at sea or for some other reason, and these boats might resort to third country crewmen who would be prepared to work under different conditions.  The bottom line in all this is that in drafting the Bill the Minister gets expert advice from the relevant person who in this case is the Attorney General and he strongly advised that this provision should be included in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the concern of Deputies Daly and Gallagher but the <Col N="2464" /> kernel of the problem is that we are looking for 75 per cent control of the crew level in relation to EEC nationals and others but the companies who bring in these boats are more important than the boats and they seem to be getting off scot-free.  These companies are just fronts for the Spanish Government.  I would like to know if the Spanish Government have made representations to the Minister in the distant past about the activities of these Spanish trawlers off the west coast, whether they are flying a flag of convenience or a Spanish flag.  This is a much more serious matter.  The boats would not exist if the companies were not there and in this legislation we are letting the companies off scot-free.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.  I appreciate the concern of Deputy Daly and Deputy Gallagher but I see a situation where perhaps 75 per cent of the crew could be Greeks and there could be an Irish skipper and then we would all be caught out.  It would be better to have this covered by regulation so that the Minister could move in to close off a loophole that might arise.  The omission here is that the companies and the Spanish Government are getting off scot-free.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Begley said that probably in most cases a fronting situation arises here.  Authorities elsewhere are sending those people in here and providing the boats.  There are companies and boats.  You can have any companies you like at the end of the day but when this Bill is passed the boats will not be able to come in.  You cannot have boats without companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to representations from the Spanish authorities recently, representations have also been made in the past at regular intervals, I am quite sure.  The sources from which I heard utterances in relation to a case being made for fishing activity by the Spanish fleet in our waters <Col N="2465" /> were not at all enamoured of the recent proposals for the west of Ireland because they felt that they were being exploited by entrepreneurs who had nothing to do with the authentic fishing industry in Spain except to use our fish and their market to make money.</P>
    <P>Apart from all that, the implementation of a regulation arising from this Bill will put an end to exploitation of our stocks be it by authentic Spanish interests or other interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have flushed out the Spanish principle of improving their catches before they join the EEC.  That is the main exercise.  They will have reached a certain quota of fish caught off the west of Ireland and when Spain joins the EEC they can put their cards on the table and say that they caught so much when they were not in the EEC and now surely they can improve their position when they are in the EEC.  At what level were those representations made?  Were they made from the Spanish Government to the Irish Government or at ambassador level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me to say.  Representations were made to me from people in high authority or whom I assumed to be in high authority who were annoyed by the exploitation by others of their position.  That did not sway me one iota in favour of the case being made.  The point being made by the Deputy in relation to the Spaniards building up catch quotas for themselves is acceptable to me as a reason for what they are doing and it is self-evident. Nobody can deny that and they, I am sure, would not be so naive as to deny it, but they, or any third country, will not do that at our expense.  That is what this Bill is trying to avoid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>In the event of this being withdrawn and accepting what the Minister says, how would he propose to introduce it or what yardstick would he use in order to decide on a percentage? Would this percentage in general pertain to that country or to that size of boat or <Col N="2466" /> could there be a different percentage for each boat?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The advantage of having restrictions introduced in the form of regulation is that you can change to suit the occasion.  We were told in reply to inquiries made by us that the 75 per cent ratio or proportion of a crew operating in the UK is working very effectively.  At present I have no reason to believe that it would work any less effectively for us, but examples can be given of circumstances where it might not be sufficient.  That is the advantage of applying a regulation approach rather than having it written into the Bill itself.  You can act quickly and home in on a problem by regulation. If you do it through the Bill you must amend the Bill by amending legislation in this House with all the attendant delays entailed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We are prepared to accept the situation as outlined by the Minister in relation to section 2 and that is why I was anxious not to move the other amendment to section 3 because I fear that under the conditions there we cannot leave it loose as it is at present.  I understand the Minister's dilemma; nevertheless our fears would be that in this type of situation where you have regulations that can be changed and brought in gradually or phased in or not brought in at all, once efforts are made, communication is established and landings take place, then perhaps a right is not established but some claim is made by these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am thinking of the boat which came in recently to Cappagh and unloaded a huge consignment of fish there.  At a later stage these people could claim the type of privilege that would be available under this section to, say, the operations at present in Castletownbere.  If we go ahead with regulations under section 2 the operation at Castletownbere would be illegal.  Is that the case?  The views expressed here from both sides of the House have been that they should not be closed down, in other words some provision for phasing in the operation at Castletownbere must be provided for under the legislation, and if that is the <Col N="2467" /> case other operations of a similar nature will claim a similar privilege.  While we could accept the situation in relation to section 2 and recognise that, where you want to initiate joint ventures or to expand and experiment in new areas, you might need this type of provision which would enable a loose arrangement which you could regulate by regulation.  We cannot accept this in relation to the operations which have been planned for here. Certain operations are established here. We may not be too happy about them but at least they are there and nobody wants to close them down.  We must provide for them in some way by phasing in the regulations under the legislation here and because of that something similar could be claimed by others who are now trying to establish rights here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is aware from his experience as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry and his dealings at EEC level that the establishment of rights and so on is not as easy as he would seem to indicate.  There is no need for any woolly thinking or confusion here.  There is a strict differentiation.  Demarcation lines are there.  This Bill applies not only to fishing but to landing and trans-shipment. This section applies immediately to fishing boats other than Irish registered fishing boats.  I think we are all agreed that the axe should not fall tomorrow morning on the operation at Castletownbere. It was put there, it was grant-aided, and expectations which have not been realised to the full were raised on the basis of its being put there.  There is high investment there and they should be given a chance.  Yesterday evening when this matter was raised I said that I felt that the 12-month period would be reasonable and sufficient for them to come within the provisions of the Bill if they so wished.  At the end of 12 months if they had not done so for some reason &mdash; it might be a very good reason &mdash; it will be unfortunate that they will find themselves outside the law.  We must hope that this will ensure that they will apply so that they will be within the regulations. Twelve months is a fair time. <Col N="2468" /> Questions have been asked about other people.  There are only two sorts, Irish registered boats and third country boats. We were talking about the Castletownbere operation.  That is in the Irish boat sector and there should not be any confusion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>How, in practice, does the Minister visualise the licensing of boats?  Will the licences be issued on an annual basis?  Will they hold for a certain period?  Suppose a fisherman or a skipper says that he has been fishing in Irish waters for 20 years and he would not bother to get a licence.  How will the licences be issued?  Perhaps this thing has not been worked out and I am therefore not tying the Minister down for an answer, but fishermen are asking such questions as these and answers must be forthcoming quickly.  What will be the conditions when the Department or the Minister find it necessary to revoke a licence?  What will the Minister consider to be an illegality in relation to revocation? These questions are all being asked.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>My officers are working out the best and the simplest system.  We are not creating a complicated bureaucracy which would be applied to fishermen. The licensing provision is not directed at fishermen for any subtle or furtive reason.  It is in the interests of the fishermen, and all the Irish fishermen will have to do is to fill in a form annually.  It will be simple once we get a register built up.  Of course, there will not be a charge. If there is a change of ownership it will be worked out like the situation in relation to cars.  There will not be a charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>Sin ceist eile.  As far as I am concerned, there are no provisions in the section for the imposition of charges. The form will be simple.  If a fisherman on the west coast says he has been fishing <Col N="2470" /> for 20 years and that he had never filled a document in his life and that he will not sign one now, my answer is that I am not too clear about it, but the thing will be so simple that it would be ludicrous for a fisherman, in his own interests, to refuse to fill in a form.  We are trying to ensure that the people who fish will be licence holders so that we will not have people fishing who should not be fishing and so that we will not have people coming in the back door.</P>

No matter what circuitous route a licence takes on its way to me or to my Department, we must have some system of checking back to ensure that X is not Y and Y is not Z.  We have fishery officers around the coast.  We have a system on the ground.  For the simple reason that we are collecting no fee on this, the Deputy can take it there will not be any big bureaucracy built up.  It will be done in a simple way, in the most efficient way possible, causing the least trouble to the fishermen.</P>

I would see it applying to all boats except for exempted classes of boats &mdash; very small boats and boats used for specific purposes.  We could have a regulation for boats over 50 foot but we would need to make sure that whatever minimum size we set we would get the people we wished to be caught in the net. That is the important thing here.  There is no point in applying a size regulation through which the very people we are trying to prevent coming can.</P>

The Minister seemed to think that an Irish skipper would not get a non-EEC crew in this country at present.

There would be absolute chaos if there was one regulation for one applicant and a different regulation for another.  We must apply a uniform provision across the board.  I am saying that if you find it is not sufficient, you scrap the 75 per cent or whatever and you apply a new regulation. That can be done overnight, without waiting for the resumption of this House.</P>

      <P>We are satisfied with the explanation we have got from the Minister in relation to this problem.  In regard to the navy and the protection services and their ability to effectively protect our interests, we are quite satisfied that the <Col N="2473" /> navy now have the ability and the capacity to deal very effectively with foreign boats.  Anyone who has been studying events recently will see how successful they have been in apprehending some of these.  While I was Minister I had occasion to go on the fishery protection vessels, the <i>Aisling,</i> the <i>Emer</i> and the surveillance plane, the Beechcraft, when I was most impressed by their level of expertise and the knowledge and experience they had of dealing with this very complex situation which relates to a number of countries with different rights and different zones for different species of fish.  Indeed it was an education for me to see their level of expertise and their handling of the situation.  But the more we hear from the Minister of the details of the Bill the more fishy it becomes. While we are prepared to withdraw this amendment to section 2 we must be worried about section 3 and we will talk about that when we come to that stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few questions about the methods which will be used by the Minister for determining classification. <Col N="2474" /> We raised yesterday on the Second Stage debate the issue of whether or not a fairly sizeable boat &mdash; which would be used, say, for angling competitions, deep sea fishing competitions, that type of activity &mdash; would come under the provisions of section 2.  We raised the question of whether the requirements in relation to those boats would have to be fulfilled under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;of the boats.  Under the section the Minister must differentiate between small and large boats.  I am sure the Minister would not expect rowing boats, punts and small salmon fishing boats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A Minister can, but the Deputy can take it that any Minister would have a bit of common sense and be practical about this.  For example, there would be no point in applying this to currachs, rowing boats, that kind of craft.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated earlier that possibly the regulation would stipulate 75 per cent of the crew being Irish.  In that classification area can he give us some indication of the size of boat which must apply for a licence before it can commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because this is something we must discuss in the next week. We have to correlate our information on what kinds of boats are likely to intrude in our waters.  within our jurisdiction, and ensure that whatever length is set that that particular class of boat would be caught by the registration.  I could give the Deputy a figure now that may or may not turn out to be the figure that would do the job we expect it to do.  I would ask <Col N="2475" /> the Deputy to leave it with me.  He can be assured that I am as concerned as he to ensure that the people we want to keep out are kept out and that that figure will be pegged at that level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to bear in mind that there are many small fishing boats around our coasts and perhaps he would consider exempting them.  Indeed it is unfortunate that we are not discussing this Bill next week, when the Minister would then be in a position to correlate all of this.  But we are passing a Bill here today when even the Minister himself is not fully <i>au fait</i> with all that is necessary.  He must wait until the Bill is passed and then next week he will decide after he has correlated all of this.  It is unfortunate that we do not have some indication at this point.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister to consider all of the traditional boats which fish along our coast, that is from the 65ft. downwards. Perhaps he would consider exempting those boats together with all of the boats which are involved in angling and indeed the smaller type boats, the punts or currachs which do not necessarily have to be registered unless one is applying for a grant for a punt from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, when I understand that is the only time they need be registered.</P>
      <P>We want to know precisely what we are talking about with regard to the licence.  For example, will there be any restrictions attached thereto?  The example I would have in mind is that if there is a quota in a particular area, such as the Celtic Sea, or a quota of 5,180 tonnes, then it is not practical for all of the boats around the coast to go in there overnight and ensure that they take out only that quantity.  My fear is that the licence might not be a clearcut one.  We would request the Minister not to restrict it in any way. Can the Minister give the House that assurance, that there will be no restriction on the licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The idea of restricting a licence to a quota in the Celtic Sea, that kind of example, is just not practical <Col N="2476" /> when one looks at the quotas applicable in the Celtic Sea, for example, in 1981, in 1982, when it was closed and in 1983. One just could not see ahead at the beginning of a year because the quotas in different species change.  There are non-quota and quota species of fish under our common fisheries policy within the EEC and that kind of thing would not be practical. There is a fear expressed, possibly justifiably, about the kind of licence that might emanate from my Department.</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of this Bill the Minister has powers to provide for certain conditions or indeed any conditions he wishes for that matter, in a regulation. The Deputy will have to rely on the common sense of any Minister, no matter from what side of the House he comes, to provide for freedom to give a licence and to ensure that he allows the industry operate in its natural way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that one of the conditions of a licence would be that a boat would be obliged to maintain a certain quota of fish, that a quota system is applied under these conditions? Is the Minister saying that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I was just pointing out the impracticality of applying something like a quota to a particular licence or a boat.  One just could not, because quotas change, as the Deputy knows from his time as Minister, from year to year.  One just could not apply that kind of condition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in an attempt to control the over-fishing of any particular species, for instance, mackerel, it was decided to apply a quota under those conditions to a particular boat, if the boat was to exceed that quota and it was known to the Department or the licensing authority, whoever that might be, that the boat had exceeded its quota in that year, would it be possible for the Minister the following year to refuse the licence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>A completely different mechanism would be used.  The Deputy is aware of restrictions being applied in <Col N="2477" /> the Celtic Sea in the case of herring fishing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not implying that. When there were no licensing requirements the Deputy had to use a certain mechanism.  I am not saying that same mechanism would apply elsewhere if the situation was repeated but there is a mechanism that would apply above and beyond the licensing requirement in relation to a species being overfished or where fisheries were closed for certain periods.  The Deputy operated at a time when this requirement was not in existence and he used a certain approach.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>From what we have heard it appears that the situation is not as clear-cut as appeared from the Bill. Perhaps it was wrong of me to use the word &ldquo;quota&rdquo; because that could be used as a red herring.  Is there not a stock management control within the Department? We hope the Minister will be in a position next week to bring back a quota of 80,000 tonnes plus.  At the moment there is a condition where boats of a certain size can land only a certain tonnage each week: boats of 90 feet plus can land only 500 tonnes.  I am worried that the 500 tonnes may be related to a quota of 55,000 tonnes.  There is no doubt that with a much higher quota there will be a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the landings per boat per week.  In the event of substantial quantities of cod being available, would <Col N="2478" /> the Minister consider attaching a condition to a licence stating that boats must fish for cod only?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think there is a certain amount of confusion here.  I said the Minister of the day has power to apply conditions to the licence we are talking about.  At the moment there is a licensing scheme in operation for mackerel but the same figure was used last year without any mention of a licence.  What we are talking about here is the drawing up of a register of boats.  There are other mechanisms such as those applied by the Deputy in the case of herring and what we used in the case of mackerel.  In the absence of a licensing system other mechanisms would have to be applied in the case of overfishing or the closure of fisheries.  I think Deputies are overstating their fear as regards the licence but I am glad of the opportunity to allay any fears they may have on this matter.  During the years we have adopted certain approaches to dealing with matters such as a drop in stock. We applied conditions to the catching of juvenile fish and to mackerel catches.  All of this is not based on 55,000 tonnes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the licensing of boats is merely to draw up a register of boats.  Is there no co-ordination between the Department of Fisheries and the Register of Shipping? Possibly there are more boats on that register than will require a licence from the Department.  There is more information available to the Registrar of Shipping without getting involved in more paperwork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a register held by the Department of Transport in relation to ships.  What we are forgetting is that we are still zoning in on the problem of unwelcome additions to our fleet that would in the normal way get registration through the Department of Transport.  I am trying to prevent what might be unwelcome additions to our fleet and in such cases I will not grant a licence.  It is purely a protective mechanism and it also builds up for our information a full register of boats engaged in the fishing industry. <Col N="2479" /> It is as simple as that.  The next question I will be asked is whether we will make contact with the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I have no intention of doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The more we go on the more worried I become.  The Minister has said we do not want unwelcome additions to our fleet.  What is the position where a person wishes to buy a boat? Will a fisherman have to ask the Minister if he will give him a licence before he buys a boat?  From what the Minister has said it appears one must first obtain a licence and I think this will be a major deterrent.  The Minister must accept that a person will not buy a boat unless he is sure he will get a licence.  In addition, it will create difficulties for BIM.  I hope I am wrong but from what the Minister has said it appears a fisherman will not know if his boat will be licensed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is completely overstating the dangers.  To say it will prove a deterrent and will cause problems for BIM is going beyond the bounds of commonsense or possibility. Any Minister who applied this provision in that manner would not be worthy to be a Minister and would do an injustice to the fishing industry.  In the case of regulations a Minister has freedom to do many things.  Over the years legislation was introduced in this House which was followed by regulations; and I do not recall any scandal, scares or serious consequences from provisions brought in by regulations by Ministers from any side of the House, because they had freedom to act irresponsibly if they so wished.  That is not what we are there to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to answer the first part of the question.  Must a person buy a boat first and then apply to the Minister for a licence? I am not trying to be difficult and I fully appreciate that the Minister, like former Ministers, would put the interest of the industry first.  We do not want to tie the Minister's hands.  That is important because we do not want to have a <Col N="2480" /> position that if someone wants to apply for a grant to BIM they cannot first seek a licence or a decision to grant a licence when the boat is completed, like planning permission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very simple answer.  Anybody who wants to buy a boat knows how he will crew it and what it will be used for.  It is very simple for him to walk into Merrion Street and present his plans.  If he complies with the normal regulations he will get a licence. It is very easy to establish whether he will get a licence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give any information concerning foreign ships who are purchasing mackerel in Lough Swilly and have been for the last three years?  They are being fished by Irish registered vessels but they are being trans-shipped in Lough Swilly to third country shop owners.  Does this Bill cover that or does the <i>status quo</i> remain?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no specific proposals to deal with that.  The Deputy is speaking about people, other than Irish fishermen, who are taking fish on board in Lough Swilly from Irish fishermen and trans-shipping it elsewhere.  Irish fishermen catch the fish and they may dispose of it in any way they wish.  We do not want to tie Irish fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very important issue in relation to mackerel stocks and conservation, which we will be talking about later.  I am very doubtful about the quantities recorded as being caught because I do not think there is a proper monitoring system and it may well be that other ships are using the facility to dispose of the mackerel which are being caught in the open sea.  I am surprised that this Bill does not take that situation into account because we have a vast mackerel stock being fished and disposed of to foreign factory ships which are coming from the Eastern bloc who were able to obtain a foreign market for them and this is to our detriment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The EEC regulations <Col N="2481" /> concerning technical measures for conservation are there.  The legislation enabling the Naval Service to enforce the provisions are inadequate.  Existing legislation has also proved inadequate for the control of freezer vessels and there is a proposal now to amend EEC regulations to tighten control.  Freezer vessels have been operating in Irish waters in recent years and this section will permit control measures for these vessels.  In the past technical measures under EEC legislation have been inadequate because there was no control on the transfer of catches.  I am not that concerned about Irish fishermen's catches being transshipped to fishermen in Irish waters, but I am concerned about people who have no right to be fishing in our waters transferring their catches to freezer ships and then trans-shipping them without anybody knowing where they came from or where they were caught.  Section 4 deals with the tightening up of this aspect of fishing so that matters should now improve.  There are problems and there is no point in my telling the House that everything will be perfect in future. Because of the nature of things, it will not.  I know Deputy Conaghan has a specific problem in relation to Lough Swilly and I hope this Bill will remove the problem for that area.  It will move the problem a few miles further out, perhaps not as blatantly as that, but I am afraid that trying to ensure it is not done at all is going beyond the bounds of our capacity.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6.</P>
      <P>In page 5, to delete all words from and including &ldquo;boat, or of&rdquo; in line 25 down to and including &ldquo;specified,&rdquo; in line 27 and substitute &ldquo;boat, shall be seventy-five per cent or more nationals of Member States of the European Communities,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We discussed this matter fairly fully and this would be a more suitable section from every point of view, especially from the point of view of the text as it stands. <Col N="2482" /> It would be a far better section if our amendment were accepted.  The amendment would make it more clear-cut and definite.  There would be no ambiguity. There are problems in regard to section 2 but there is no problem whatever here and the Minister should accept our amendment.  It would strengthen his position.  There would be no loopholes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy said, we discussed this in great detail on section 2. I do not see any great difference between what the Deputy and his colleagues agreed to on amendment No. 3 and what is here.  The same thing can be done here as we propose to do in section 2.  The effect would be the same.  The Deputy can take my word that the regulation will provide for the amendment he is seeking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it not possible to incorporate what will be done by regulation in the actual Bill?  Any undue delays could lead to a very unsatisfactory situation because boats will try to establish quotas and seek to have concessions made.  They would have to get the facilities we do not want to give them.  Unless the law is clear-cut and incisive it will not be as effective as it could be.  The British regulation came in almost simultaneously with the Act and there must have been a good and valid reason why the British did that.  The Minister may argue there is a good and valid reason to keep it separate from the Bill and do it by regulation, but seeing the regulation is designed to secure the same result, surely it would get the message across more effectively if it were incorporated in the Bill.  These people are very conscious that we are legislating here and they are monitoring what is happening here.  If they find any loophole and there are undue delays in making the regulations we shall leave ourselves open to difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy uses expressions like &ldquo;phasing in&rdquo; and &ldquo;establishing rights&rdquo;.  No rights can be established and the phasing to be done is phasing out. We can actually count the number of vessels involved in that phasing out. There is no question of phasing in or <Col N="2483" /> establishing rights beyond what are there already.</P>
      <P>This Bill will hopefully be passed by the Seanad next week and, following on its passage, the regulations will be brought in.  They are actually in course of preparation.  The Deputy need have no worries about a time lag or the danger of anybody establishing rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>It is recognised that backdoor methods can be used very effectively and the British had to amend their legislation recently when loopholes were found.  The legal situation has been very carefully monitored by people seeking to get access here who now find it more difficult to get access under British legislation.  I am convinced that if they find loopholes they will test those in the courts and that is why it is imperative we lock the doors very firmly.  Let them take on the British Government if they want to.  I think they will do that and we should not make things easier for them here by letting them know in advance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The approach by legislation has been adopted because these people are monitoring the situation.  If they should find a loophole or try to enter by some back door we would not hesitate to bring in amending legislation.  Actually the British used their heads and adopted the regulation approach to give them flexibility so that they could act quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should seriously consider accepting this amendment. It is quite clear that it is 75 per cent or more and there is no reason why the Minister cannot bring in a regulation at a later stage and make it 100 per cent.  At the moment the loophole is there and it is left to the Minister to reduce it from 75 per cent.  We want to close this loophole. We are very worried about this and about the influx of Spaniards and other boats from third countries coming in here.  We must show them that we are very serious in what we are doing.  The Minister should seriously consider accepting our amendment, particularly as he can introduce a regulation at any time to increase <Col N="2484" /> that.  If the Minister can give some good, valid reason for suggesting that it should be under 75 per cent, we could consider it but I believe that would be difficult.</P>
      <P>It is important that this Bill is enacted very soon because, despite what the Minister says, that there are only nine Spanish boats involved at the moment, there is absolutely no reason why many, if not all, of the 62 UK-Spanish boats could not, in the interim period come in here and that they would also be included with the nine in this phasing-out period.  What guarantees have we that as of this week the UK-Spanish have not made application to do what the other nine have already done?  We are accepting the fact that there are nine there but the Spaniards knew many months ago that legislation like that introduced in the UK last March would be introduced here.  Those clever business people more than likely have initiated this and possibly have submitted applications.  What is the situation in relation to those boats?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>They can make any application they wish.  The regulation can define exactly to whom it applies and to whom it does not apply.  We are back again to people coming in back doors, side doors and under cover of night.  I cannot see any problem if the Deputies are prepared to accept from me that I will introduce regulations governing the 75 per cent under amendment No. 2, which the Deputies have withdrawn.  What is the difference between that and accepting my word under the provisions in relation to section 3?  There is none whatever and, as far as I am concerned, there is no doubt in my mind at the moment that the 75 per cent would be a fair level at which to take this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are times when it could possibly be more suitable to have 75 per cent plus. I cannot visualise any circumstances that would bring this about but if you had written in 75 per cent or more and you discovered for some very good reason that 70 per cent would be more appropriate you were stuck with the Bill at that stage.  I am looking for the freedom to apply flexibility to meet the demands of the day.  I do not need anything else.  I am <Col N="2485" /> not looking for any concessions and there is nothing underhand about this.  I hope the Deputies will accept this.  They have withdrawn their other amendment and, while this is not exactly the same thing, the same principle applies in that the Deputies would also expect me to introduce regulations governing section 3.  I am prepared to give the undertaking that I will do that.</P>

      <P>There is no great similarity between amendment No. 3 and amendment No. 6 except the wording of it.  Amendment No. 3 to section 2 referred to Irish boats whereas amendment No. 6 to section 3 refers to third country boats.  The Minister, in what he has just stated has borne out what I have said, that he might want to increase it over and above the 75 per cent.  Our amendment has left that option open to him.  He has suggested making it necessary to reduce it to 70 per cent or maybe even less.  Could the Minister tell us what in his estimate would make that more beneficial to the Irish?  We must look after ourselves first because the Europeans will not.  I cannot see any valid reason why the Minister will not accept this amendment of 75 per cent or more.  We are leaving that open to him as well.</P>
      <P>Could the Minister not reduce this by way of regulation from 75 per cent?  He is satisfied that there are only nine Spaniards involved.  He can only satisfy us by telling us tonight that this legislation will be retrospective if there are to be no more than nine.  I believe many of the 62 UK-Spanish boats have commenced proceedings to become affiliated to others in this country.  The Minister will satisfy us if he tells us that this Bill will be retrospective.</P>

There is not phasing in as far as I am concerned.  I am only in this Department for the past six months but I am there long enough and I am long enough in the House to know that, in relation to this particular amendment, <Col N="2486" /> even if there was a valid reason for accepting it, it would be very foolish of me to accept the wording the way it is framed without having it brought to the notice of the Attorney General's office and consulting with his officials first.  I cannot advise Deputy Daly and Deputy P. Gallagher that the wording of the amendment would stand up.  When I say &ldquo;stand up&rdquo; I mean that it will do what it is meant to do.  After accepting something, and having written it into the Bill, one would be in a serious position.  We are here dealing with non-Irish situations which would come under the aegis of the EEC.  This would make me much more wary of the consequences of finding something illegal with the wording.  Even if there were valid reasons for accepting the amendment put down by the Opposition Members I have to say that, in the form in which it is put, I would prefer to have it scrutinised in detail.</P>

The Minister is saying that he is working on the regulation and that it will be the same as what we are asking.  The Minister will also have the power to make a further regulation if he finds that the section here needs to be regulated further.  We are providing the Minister with a simplified method which will provide for what both we and the Minister want to provide for.  This is not similar to the section 2 amendment which we put forward.  We appreciated the difference there and withdrew that.

Section 3 in relation to this provision will mean a regulation. All I am saying is that for the most part this is an enabling Bill for which flexibility is being sought to introduce regulations to meet the needs of the Bill. I would be much happier if Deputies did not press this amendment.  I have not had time to seek the advice I would need to be absolutely sure.

      <P>There are already provisions covering the certification of skippers and second hands of fishing vessels. These regulations under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, requires skippers and second hands to carry certificates of competency which in practice can only be <Col N="2489" /> held by Irish or British citizens.  It would not be appropriate to include in this Bill the provision proposed as it would be in conflict with general legislation dealing with certification.  As worded it would be deemed to be discriminatory and, therefore, contrary to the Treaty of Rome. The Deputy can see that there are problems in relation to that kind of proposal in his amendment.  For the reasons given I would ask that he consider the consequences of his proposal before pressing the amendment.</P>

I said that under the Merchant Shipping Act, 1894, certificates of competency can be held in relation to our situation only by British or Irish citizens.  By the way, a reciprocal arrangement is provided for between ourselves and Britain.  Irish people can hold certificates of competency in relation to British boats.  The Deputy knows, when he seeks conclusive proof from me in relation to the Treaty of Rome regulations, that I have expressed a view held that more than likely &mdash; that is as far as I or anybody else can go until one would have gone through the whole European Court system to establish the situation &mdash; we would be putting ourselves in grave danger of being told that we are or would find ourselves in breach of the Treaty of Rome on the basis of a discriminatory practice.  It is a judgement which one must make for oneself in seeking to prove conclusively beyond any shadow of doubt.

The Minister seemed to be suggesting implications of one kind or another.  Nothing has been implied in anything that was said on this side of the House.  We appreciate the difficulties in the industry and that this legislation is intended to prevent foreign or third country boats coming into the country.  The Minister has co-operated with us already and I thank him for that.  He has nodded his head in confirmation that he will introduce a regulation next week when the Bill is enacted that 75 per cent of the crew will be Irish.  We are asking for only one slight change here and I think there should be no difficulty of problems of discrimination arising.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 8:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 3, to delete &ldquo;£100,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£200,000&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment gives the Minister more money.  In relation to this legislation and in particular in relation to breaches of the law by third country boats, perhaps boats of member states, it is essential to have a realistic level of fines and also the authority to forfeit boats.  This is why we are proposing to increase the maximum level of fine from £100,000 to £200,000. In amendment No. 9 we are making provision for the confiscation of a boat as well as fish and gear.  We are also proposing that Irish boats be exempt from forfeiture.</P>
      <P>It is well known that a pooling system is in operation for the payment of fines and there is not sufficient penalty on boat owners from third countries who are breaking the law.  We must make it easier for the protection services to deal with these illegal activities which are taking place almost daily.  The record of the protection service shows that there is hardly a day when third country boats are not taken into Rossaveal of Castletownbere and other places along the west coast.  Widespread illegal activity must be taking place in areas where boats have a limited licence to fish and are extending the powers given to them.  The impositions we are suggesting would make it easier for the protection services and would represent a greater deterrent for foreign boats operating illegally here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The maximum fine under the Fisheries Acts is at present £100,000 and this applies in cases of illegal fishing by foreign trawlers.  Up to 1978 the maximum fine was only £500 and fishing gear was automatically forfeited.  The maximum fine is never imposed and the normal fine would be between £20,000 and £30,000, plus the forfeiture of fishing gear valued at about the same amount.  A fine of £200,000 would be out of line with the normal level of fishery fines.  While my own inclination would be to increase the maximum level permissible, it probably <Col N="2493" /> would not make one iota of difference because the same people would be trying the same offences and probably applying the same level of fines, regardless of the ceiling allowable.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 9 would involve forfeiture of a boat for a first offence and this seems somewhat unreasonable.  The effect of amendment No. 12 would be to exempt Irish fishing boats from liability to foreiture under any section of the Fisheries Acts, even where such provisions already apply.  Let us be quite clear that they do apply.  Apart from that, the amendment would be discriminatory and its acceptance would involve changing the 1978 Act.  Section 7 mentions ten sections of the 1978 Act and under all except three, forfeiture applies.  The whole tenor of our legislation would have to be changed.</P>
      <P>The level of fines is open to review and I am not opposed to having a look at it later this year and amending through further legislation the maximum levels which may be imposed.  We will consider it carefully and make sure they are in line with what we are doing elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to refer to amendment No. 8 which increases the maximum fine from £100,000 to £200,000 in the case of foreign boats in breach of the Act.  I totally disagree with the Minister on this matter.  The evidence is that decisions on the amount of fine are almost invariably based on what the maximum is.  Newspaper reports of cases show that the justice always asks what the maximum level is.  I am not an expert in this area but looking at cases which have been disposed of over the last number of years, by and large the decision has been to impose the maximum fine provided for in the Bill.  A judge will decide on the evidence before him what the fine should be.  The general fine in this area has been £20,000 or £30,000.  By doubling the amount here we would set a base line. This would enable judges to increase the fine to a more realistic figure.  The fines have not been changed since 1978 despite the fact that inflation has increased considerably since then.  Look at the way the price of boats has increased since that <Col N="2494" /> time.  There is a vast difference between what a boat would have fetched on the market at that time and what it would fetch now.  A sum of £200,000 would be a more realistic figure and would impose severe penalties on those committing this type of offence.</P>

      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that he intends to amend the existing legislation in relation to fines and so on?  This Bill is an ideal opportunity for him to do something about that.  I do not know if there is a legal difficulty in having a minimum fine rather than a maximum one.  The law as it operates in relation to foreigners who are caught is a bit of a joke.</P>
      <P>In relation to the forfeiture of gear what happens is that it is auctioned off practically straight away.  The gear is so sophisticated that it would be of no practical use to our fishermen.  What happens is that some local person buys it on behalf of the foreign fishermen.  The same can be said about large catches of fish.  I am glad the Minister will amend the legislation but I wonder why he did not do it in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I see no reason why the Minister will not increase the fine to £200,000.  I accept that they have been in the region of £25,000 to £30,000 but no doubt judges have taken into account the maximum fine set by this House.</P>
      <P>I fully endorse what Deputies Daly and Gallagher said, that this will be used as a base and judges might consider increasing the fines on a <i>pro rata</i> basis.  The Minister mentioned confiscation of gear which is normally worth about £20,000 to the skipper.  However, in practical terms, it is of no real value to us since we do not use this type of gear.  The only sure deterrent we have is to impose a fine.  Perhaps we should have put down an amendment for £500,000 if the courts normally inpose about one-third of what we recommend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the round robin financial system which operates in Europe and third countries.  While I appreciate and fully commend the Naval Service for catching foreign boats and confiscating their gear and catches, other <Col N="2495" /> foreign boats are given an opportunity to come in.  The boat owner is not paying the fine because it is coming from this insurance system.  This is something which is happening in a hidden way. When the Naval Service are busy with some foreign boats, others come in.  Boat owners pay into this pool each year depending on the size of the boat and their catch for the previous year.</P>
    <P>We are giving the Minister our full support.  If he wants to introduce a regulation later to increase the fine he will have our full support.  We must show that we are not prepared to accept the system which operates and we will have to do something to deter boats from coming in.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the level of the fines, I support the amendment to encourage the Minister to increase all fines which apply to foreign vessels fishing illegally in our waters.  Having been Minister for Defence with responsibility for the Naval Service I offer the comment here that had the Naval Service been large enough to continuously patrol our waters I would be correct in claiming that they could catch a Spaniard every day of the week.  They are fishing illegally all the time.  The reason why more of these do not appear before our courts is that we do not have a sufficiently large naval service to consistently patrol our waters. With a small naval service, men have to return to port and the Spaniards know this well.  Despite the assistance of spotter planes and the number of new vessels which we have obtained, our service is still a very limited one, when one considers the extent of the waters to which we have exclusive rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is sad that the Spaniards can exploit our fisheries and consistently carry on illegal fishing.  On the other hand, they are presenting their case for membership of the EEC as a country prepared to accept all the rules and regulations which apply therein, but they are not prepared to live by these rules now.  The pool system referred to by our spokesman, Deputy Daly, enables them to risk being caught because so few are going to be caught and the fines which have been <Col N="2496" /> imposed by the courts are so small by comparison with the wealth which they are extracting that it is of very little consequence to the Spaniards and no deterrent. Our judges have a lot to answer for in not giving due recognition to the wishes of this House when the £100,000 maximum fine was introduced.  They have not been imposing fines of that size. When that fine was introduced in 1978, it was hoped that our courts would impose fines of that size, or close to it.  It is sad that the average fine is only in the region of £20,000 to £30,000, which is not a deterrent to the Spaniards.  They continue blatantly to illegally exploit our fisheries.</P>
    <P>I would certainly encourage the Minister to increase all the fines to the figure suggested here, or even higher.  He should convey, through the appropriate channel, to the Judiciary who decide on these cases that it is the wish of the Irish people and the Government that when these fishermen are caught the maximum fine should apply, otherwise they will continue to ignore the legislation being passed here and at EEC level.  I encourage the Minister to proceed along the lines suggested by the Fianna Fáil spokesman and to introduce much more serious and effective deterrents to stop this illegal exploitation in the face of all international agreements.  These people should not be dealt with as leniently as heretofore.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what has been said in relation to the ineffectiveness of the level of fines being applied.  Deputy Gallagher mentioned minimum fines, but I understand that the courts do not like that type of restriction.  We have a flexible, independent judicial system, the members of which apply their minds to specific cases on their merits.  The independence of that arm should be left with them.  While I would like, as Deputy Molloy and everybody else would, to see deterrents which would stop people from exploiting our fisheries as they are at the moment, the independence of our judicial system is also of paramount importance.</P>

    <P>Deputy Daly mentioned a maximum <Col N="2497" /> fine being applied.  He may be confusing the application of a bond to the extent of the maximum fine being sought.  That is the normal practice.  The fine is applied and the bond is also sought to the level of the maximum fine which can be imposed but is not normally.</P>
    <P>We all agree that there should be stronger deterrents.  I have no objection in principle to increasing the fine.  The only problem is trying to harmonise the different legislation.  Basically, I have no objection to accepting the amendment. I could point out that alterations in the overall position will have to come later. What I had in mind was looking at the overall position of penalties by the end of this year and applying across the board an upwards levelling off of penalties to make them more realistic.  That would be a tidier approach.  If the Members on the opposite side insist on my accepting their amendment in this case, I would have no objection.  I would like to point out that the same penalty would apply to illegal fishing, together with illegal entry into our waters.  That may be a salutary thought.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is an important part of the Bill as it deals with conservation.  Conservation must be an uppermost thought in the mind of everybody concerned with the fishery industry if that industry is to survive.  We may pass all the laws in this House but their enactment is another matter.  That was very well brought out by Deputy Molloy in relation to the matter of fines.</P>
      <P>Section 4 states:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) The Minister may, as he shall think proper, by order prescribe and adopt either or both of the following measures, namely, measures of conservation of fish stocks and measures of rational exploitation of fisheries.</P>
      <P>In his speech on Second Stage the Minister said:</P>
      <P>This new wording will also enable me to apply controls to boats connected with the fishing industry, such as transporters and vessels which carry out processing operations on board. The need for such controls has become evident from recent experiences with expanded mackerel fishery where much of the processing has taken place on floating factories.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mackerel fishing has been a very important industry for Donegal fishermen.  We have had factory ships in Lough Swilly buying their fish.  What conditions does the Minister think he will bring in in relation to factory ships?  If measures against them were brought in, they would move out to the ocean, perhaps to the Scottish coast, and we would lose the trade on the home front and lose control over mackerel fishing.  That would be a grave loss to the industry because it is the only channel Donegal fishermen have for selling their mackerel.  We must be very <Col N="2499" /> careful about this to ensure that regulations to be brought in would not have that effect.</P>
    <P>In relation to salmon conservation, there are grave anomalies in the North of Ireland because of the existence of two fishery organisations, the Foyle and the Swilly.  Fishing in those areas is controlled by two different sets of regulations.  The Minister should be considering this matter in an effort to bring uniformity so that proper conservation measures could be introduced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to mackerel trans-shipment, the section concerns any boats other than fishing boats, and there is a provision in relation to what the Deputy is seeking.  He spoke about the danger of the factory ships going, for example, to the west coast of Scotland, outside our jurisdiction.  The provision could have that effect, but to put it mildly, we cannot have our loaf and eat it.</P>
      <P>In relation to factory ships <i>per se,</i> I am not opposed to them because they provide an outlet for certain types of fish, and at certain times in the year, without them many Donegal fishermen would find it difficult to dispose of their catches. They are therefore a very welcome sight in certain areas of Donegal at certain times of the year.  The problem is to get recordings of catches sold to freezers, not simply by Irish boats but particularly by foreigners.  Foreign boats catch fish in our waters and transfer them to freezers. There is no record of these catches and we, of course, are the losers.  An Irishman would have the benefit of the price of his catch.  It is a question of surveillance and recording the transfers of fish.</P>
      <P>It also involves the problem of loss of employment on shore.  We cannot have local factories left without fish while freezers can get their full complement at sea and can steam away to their mother countries to deliver their cargoes there. That is what would flow from unabated and uncontrolled fishing and transferring.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of regulations in respect of salmon fishing, there is an <Col N="2500" /> international convention that prohibits fishing for salmon outside our 12-mile limit.  There was a legal doubt about the capacity and the jurisdiction of our navy outside that limit.  Now, according to the convention, anybody found fishing for salmon outside the 12-mile limit is in breach of the convention and can be apprehended by our naval vessels.  There has been reference to the activities of the Faroese and the Greenlanders who are reputed to have absolute freedom of the high seas in relation to salmon.  That is not so, in fact, and we have been at the forefront at EEC level in demands for restrictions on the activities of the Faroese and the Greenlanders.  So far as I can ascertain these efforts have been successful and both nationalities have accepted the necessity for conservation of salmon stock.  Indeed, at the moment in the Faroes salmon fishing is being carried on under the watchful eye of our scientific research people, ICES, and conservation measures are being applied by both the Faroese and the Greenlanders.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conaghan mentioned the salmon fishing in the Letterkenny district and in the Foyle area.  Our representatives on the Foyle Fisheries Commission endeavour to achieve uniformity.  They may at times have to accept terms that are somewhat out of line with arrangements made on this side, but normally we catch up or they catch up with us.  There is always an effort made to have as little difference as possible between the two sides.  Since I became Minister I recall doing that balancing act in this House with our regulations.  At present there should be no great difference between the two jurisdictions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughConaghan" hpid="Mr. Conaghan Mr. Conaghan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with most of what the Minister has said but there have been reports recently of Norwegians using the longline system for fishing salmon and making a fair kill.  While we may be applying all the regulations and all the laws in order to conserve salmon it is where they originate that the real damage can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At one time salmon was exclusively an inshore fisherman's fish.  It is unfortunate <Col N="2501" /> that at present the inshore fishermen are the people who bear most of the brunt of the law.  There is no excuse for the breaking of the law and the regulations but the way in which some regulations have been handed down is leading to many of the problems of the fishing industry.  It is an area that must be looked at seriously.  If we are serious about conservation we must tackle it where it is really being abused and that is out beyond the 12-mile limit.</P>
    <P>Uniformity of regulations between the two fishery boards that operate in Donegal is important.  Some fishermen are on both sides of the divide and they can be legally fishing on one side of the line and illegally fishing on the other side.</P>
    <P>In relation to the mackerel industry does the Minister think that under the present regulations he has reasonable control over it and is in a position to monitor the situation?  We must ensure that the opportunities that have been there for the fishermen over the last three or four years will continue to be there.  I agree that conservation must be uppermost in the Minister's mind but whatever he does he must ensure it will not be to the detriment of the livelihood of the fishermen who have been fishing within the legal limits.</P>

      <P>The illegal fishing of salmon is a problem and I am glad to know the Deputy endorses my stance and does not condone illegal fishing.  We are all agreed on that.  He made the point that the surveillance people are more concerned with the inland fishermen than they are with the more destructive types who are operating at much greater depths.  The problem here is that at the moment with the limited resources at our disposal for protection purposes they are taken up with illegal fishing in the shallower waters.  It would be great if they could turn their backs and go out to the nether regions to get what are alleged to <Col N="2502" /> be the really destructive fishermen, many of them not Irish of course.</P>
      <P>In relation to mackerel the Deputy will be aware that we are operating under an EEC quota system.  Along with that we have a licensing scheme here also.  The Deputy can be assured that so far as I am concerned if for no other reason or higher ideal than self-preservation I will do my utmost to ensure that both the salmon and mackerel stocks are preserved for the benefit of our fishermen and their children and hopefully their great-great-grandchildren. That is the job I am entrusted with and I will endeavour to do that to the best of my ability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it quite clear that there is nobody on this side of the House who in any way condones any type of illegal activity.  The Minister can be assured of our support in this regard.  This has been a useful and worthwhile debate if only to clear up some of the anxieties in the industry and to highlight some of the prospects for the future.  That was in sharp contrast to a leading article in one of today's newspapers and the assertion that there was a lot of rubbish spoken here yesterday, this from some ignorant commentator who obviously was not here.  Certainly I have seen a lot more rubbish in relation to fisheries published in newspapers in recent times than I heard here yesterday on this debate.  I say that as one who has been involved in fisheries and served on a fisheries conservation board for a long time.  I thought the level of debate here was excellent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to impress on the Minister the importance of maintaining vigilance within the Community in relation to the activities of the Faroese, the Greenlanders and indeed of the Norwegians &mdash; this is covered in section 4 &mdash; in relation to the exploitation of salmon in that area. It is a vital area for the future of salmon. If the Greenlanders, the Norwegians and the Faroese continue to plunder the salmon fisheries there &mdash; and these are Irish salmon from Irish rivers &mdash; they will do immense damage to the stocks, certainly more damage than any pollution, disease or netting in our own waters could do.  There must be vigilance maintained <Col N="2503" /> there to ensure that, in so far as can be established, the regulations there to curtail the activities of the Greenlanders and Faroese are enforced.</P>
    <P>I noted that the Minister said &ldquo;as far as could be ascertained.&rdquo;  I should like to know the extent to which we could ascertain what is actually taking place there, whether we could be satisfied as to the operation of ICES there and what action can be taken if it is found that the limited fishing activity for salmon allowed to the Foroese is not controlled; in other words to ascertain that that regulation is being enforced.  I am not so sure that it can be ascertained fully from the evidence available now.  It must be ascertained whether or not these controlling conservation measures are being enforced, whose purpose it is to control the Faroese salmon fishing, where there was never a traditional salmon fishery until recent times and where there are now probably something like 60 or 70 licensed boats.  We need to be adamant in the Community and, to use the Community to bring pressure to bear in that area in order to safeguard our salmon stocks in that locality. I should like an assurance from the Minister that efforts are being made within the Community to further curtail and, if necessary, phase out the activities of the Faroese and keep a very close eye on the Norwegians who would like not alone to get the salmon but to come in and clear up blue whiting and anything else they can get.  Yet they would not join the Community when they had the opportunity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that neither the Faroese nor the Greenlanders are any longer members of the Community &mdash; this is the problem &mdash; and neither are the Norwegians, as he said.  However, there are third country agreements being entered into.  I have full confidence in the ICES scientific people who are overseeing the operation of conservation in the Faroese fisheries. It is important for us that there is conservation both there and in Greenland for the sake of our stocks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a few observations, first in relation to salmon. I also want to make it clear that, like other Members of this House, I cannot condone illegal activities.  We must look also at the question of the income of traditional fishermen.  We cannot condone any individual or any Government who would take from traditional salmon fishermen their only livelihood, obtained in a short four weeks.  I might refer also to a leading article in a paper some days ago.  It was highly irresponsible to suggest, indeed state, that there were certain fishermen in the country making £80,000 a year.  It is no wonder the vast majority of people believe firmly that these small fishermen are very rich.  The true facts show that that leading article was not true at all.  I agree with Deputy Daly that the suggested waffle that was spoken in this House did not deserve the publicity it received in that paper.  Anybody should report accurately, though they may have views of their own.  While various people in the industry were interviewed they were given very little cover.  The facts were there to be borne out.</P>
      <P>Before I conclude on salmon I must agree with my colleague, Deputy Conaghan, that it is a worry for us if we are to be confined to 12 miles because very few salmon run that close to the shore. We spoke some time ago about not being able to have one's loaf and eat it.  If this is implemented, it will mean there will be no loaf at all to be eaten.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of freezer vessels, many years ago before I came into this House I took an opportunity publicly to state that the freezer vessels were even then &mdash; and still are &mdash; an integral part of our mackerel fisheries.  Those who are in competition with these people on shore appreciate that we must live with these people and that we require these freezer vessels, particularly in times of glut. Despite the fact that we have a reasonably high capacity for freezing purposes it is necessary to have these freezer vessels. I would ask that the Minister and his officials maintain a particularly keen eye &mdash; and I have no doubt that he will &mdash; at times when landings are low and below the freezing capacity ashore to ensure <Col N="2505" /> then that the processors ashore are given priority.  I know it is difficult to draw it up in black and white but I think the Minister will accept what I maintain.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I wish to put on record <Col N="2506" /> my appreciation of the co-operation which has been forthcoming from the Opposition in facilitating the passage, at very short notice, of this Bill today&mdash;the last but one sitting day prior to the Summer recess.</P>
    <P>This is a short Bill to amend the Building Societies Acts in one respect only.  It is necessitated by a judgment of the High Court delivered on 24 June 1983 which has immediate and far-reaching implications for building societies.</P>
    <P>Section 80 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, provides that a building society shall not make a loan on the security of a freehold or leasehold estate which is subject to a prior mortgage unless the prior mortgage is in favour of the society.  In this context a &ldquo;mortgage&rdquo; is defined to include a charge.  The Act further provides that, where a loan is made in contravention of any requirement of the Act, the directors of the society who authorised the loan are liable for any loss occasioned by the society.</P>
    <P>The particular case before the court related to a house, the title to which commenced with a lease subject to a rent and to certain covenants including a covenant to build houses on the land.  The house in question was assigned to a purchaser subject to an apportioned part of the rent and indemnified against the balance, the purchaser convenanting to pay his portion, to comply with the covenants in the lease and to indemnify the vendor against any claims arising from failure to pay the rent or from breach of covenant The assignment charged the house with any moneys that might become payable under the covenants of indemnity.  The High Court decided that this charge constituted a prior mortgage under section 80 of the Building Societies Act, 1976, and that as a result a building society was precluded from advancing a loan on the property.</P>
    <P>The implications of this recent judgment have been discussed with representatives of the principal building societies and their legal advisers and with the Registrar of Building Societies.  It is clear that the law as it now stands after the judgment is unsatisfactory in that it <Col N="2507" /> would lead to a hold-up in new loan issues for certain properties and raise questions about the validity of a number of existing mortgages.  Many solicitors were refusing to authorise loan approvals because of the interpretation of the law and the High Court decision.  It also has implications for directors of building societies on account of the personal liability which they carry and to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>In his judgment, Mr. Justice Murphy acknowledged that it would be in the public interest generally to uphold the validity of the argument that a charge of the kind at issue in the particular case did not prevent the building society from making a loan as it did not reduce the value of the leasehold interest.  However, he did not believe that the accepted canons of construction would permit him to support that view.  He also referred to the far-reaching effects of his interpretation and directed that a copy of the judgment be sent to me and to the Registrar of Building Societies in case an amendment to the legislation would be thought desirable.</P>
    <P>The Bill seeks to do no more than restore the position to what, in general practice, it was considered to be prior to the judgment.  Its purpose is to ensure that the reference to a &ldquo;prior mortgage&rdquo; in section 80 of the 1976 Act does not include a charge to secure the payment of a rent or to secure payment of money arising from the non-performance or breach of a covenant in a lease or fee farm grant.  Other types of charge, which might have the effect of diminishing the value of the security, are not affected by this measure and are still caught by section 80.  Within the statutory framework, it is, of course, always a matter for the societies to satisfy themselves that the security for any loan is adequate.</P>
    <P>Enactment of the Bill will enable building societies to continue the approval and issue of loans in respect of the properties affected which, the societies inform me, are significant in number.  Since this provision is being given retrospective effect, it will also remove any doubts about the validity of loans already advanced on <Col N="2508" /> properties subject to the type of charge in question.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to over-emphasise the importance of the building society to the national housing programme.  This year they will provide about £340 million in mortgage finance which represents almost 70 per cent of total mortgage funds.  For this reason and in view of the acutely difficult situation that would otherwise affect the societies, remedial action could not await the resumption of the House in the autumn because many house loan applications would have been frozen until the legislative doubt was clarified. I regret that events have transpired in such a way that more time is not available to Deputies to consider the measure but I would hope that its relative brevity and straightforwardness make this less of a disadvantage than might otherwise be the case.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The difficulty that has arisen following the High Court judgement is one we would not wish to see continue and which would introduce an anomaly into the operations of the building societies.  We recognise the important role they play in providing much-needed finance for couples and others who are seeking to purchase homes.  We are anxious that anything that would interfere with the availability of loans to needy applicants be cleared up as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Minister has given a clear explanation of the difficulty that has arisen following the new interpretation of section 80.  We trust that the Bill will deal adequately with that situation so that such charges will not in future be deemed to be prior mortgages and thus debar the issue of loans in the type of case that came before the court recently.  We are very happy to support the Bill.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to put on record my appreciation and that of the Government of the co-operation we got from various Members of Fianna Fáil and, in particular, the party spokesperson for the Environment. Without that co-operation it would not have been possible for us to move the Bill in the House tonight.  I think it is a recognition of the importance of the issues involved in this Bill that it is being taken in this fashion.  I regret very much that we were forced by pressure of time to deal with this legislation in such a hurried way.  It is certainly not desirable to rush any legislation through, but in this particular instance I would point out that this Bill deals with an area which has been subject of much debate in the Dáil and Seanad over the past year and I do <Col N="2515" /> not think there is any serious disagreement on the principles involved or the need for the changes for which the Bill makes provision.</P>
    <P>During the debates on the Housing (Private Rented Dwellings) Act, 1982, last summer it was commented on all sides that the District Court was not the best forum for dealing with disputes between landlord and tenant concerning the terms of tenancy of formerly controlled dwellings.  It was agreed that it would be highly desirable to set up some alternative mechanism and that this should be done as quickly as possible. The purpose of this Bill is to provide this alternative mechanism.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the proposals under this Bill I would like to comment briefly on the operation of the 1982 Act. I would not like anything I said today or what I said in the Seanad to suggest that I am criticising the courts in the way they have operated the Act.  I recognise that they had a very difficult job to do.  The issues involved, and especially the criteria to be used in fixing rents, are highly complex.  At the same time the persons coming before District Justices were often unaware of their rights, not properly represented, scared and anxious about the procedures used and of the threat to their homes.  The courts did the best they could in these difficult circumstances but there was no way in which they could change the formal and adversary nature of the proceedings which, as every Deputy knows, was of such concern to the often elderly persons who had to appear before them.  It is my belief that the proposals contained in the Bill will overcome many of the problems for landlords and tenants coming before the courts and that the structures set up will provide a more suitable forum for the determination of the rents of the dwellings in question.</P>
    <P>The main proposals in this Bill related to the establishment, in the first instance, of a Rent Tribunal to determine the terms of tenancies of formerly controlled dwellings. An alternative mechanism whereby rent officers appointed by housing authorities would determine such cases is <Col N="2516" /> also being provided for.  Under the alternative mechanism the tribunal would operate as an appeals body from the decisions of rent officers.  The advantages of both of these systems is that they will be able to incorporate in their procedures a much greater degree of informality than is possible under a court system.  The tribunal will in reaching decisions have the benefit of expert valuing advice from its own members and this kind of impartial advice should be most useful in arriving at correct decisions.</P>
    <P>I would hope that not just the procedures but the general manner in which cases are brought will be different under the tribunal or rent officer systems.  A highly adversary situation exists in the courts, with teams of legal and valuing experts representing the landlord and the tenant and often vigorously cross-examining the opposing parties and any party who has to take the oath in the witness box.  I would hope that this kind of situation would not prevail when the tribunal is sitting.  Every effort will be made in the regulations setting out the procedures for use by rent officers and the tribunal to ensure that the requirements on landlords and tenants in applying to have a rent fixed are as simple and straightforward as possible and are not intimidating. In my opinion the new systems being proposed will have the very strong advantages of being less formal than the courts, less expensive, and lead to the determination of cases more quickly.</P>
    <P>However, I would not like anyone to think that I am claiming this Bill solves all the problems of the private rented sector.  It clearly does not.  It is a limited measure designed to achieve a particular purpose: that of setting up new adjudication procedures in cases of dispute in relation to determination of rent and terms of tenancy.  The criteria in use under the 1982 Act for the fixing of rents will still govern the actions of the tribunal and rent officers.  In this we are bound by the Constitution and the interpretation of it as set out in Supreme Court decisions on previous legislation in this area.  This is something which was discussed at length during the passage of the 1982 Act through the Dáil and Seanad.  No amendment <Col N="2517" /> to these criteria is being proposed, although a declaratory statement is being added making it clear that in fixing a rent the means of the tenant is to include only the actual means of the tenant.  This was clearly the intention of the 1982 Act, but it would appear that some confusion exists as to whether the eligibility for rent allowances should be included as part of the tenant's means.  This declaratory statement makes it clear that under the 1982 Act only the actual means of the tenant should be taken into account. Apart from this statement, which merely clarifies the existing law, the system to be operated by the tribunal and the rent officers remains basically unchanged in so far as the criteria for the assessment of rent and terms of tenancy are concerned.</P>
    <P>During the debate in the Seanad yesterday it was clear from comments made by Senators that certain points in the Bill were causing concern.  I would like to refer to them now and thereby hopefully anticipate some of the questions of Deputies.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes that, where a person has applied to the District Court to have his case determined and the case has not been determined at the time of the commencement of the Act, he or she should have the right to withdraw the case, with the consent of the other party, and transfer it for hearing before the tribunal. Consideration was given to providing for the automatic transfer of such cases to the tribunal and we wanted to do so, but we have been advised by the Attorney General that such action would be unconstitutional. Similarly, the tribunal could not be given the power to review cases already heard by the District Court except in so far as the cases come up for review in the normal fashion after the five year period had elapsed.  At the same time, I expect that landlords if they look at the new legislative provisions carefully, will realise that there are many advantages to both the landlord and tenant in having cases dealt with by the tribunal.  They will have the advantage of a more expeditious and less cumbersome hearing of their applications and have the positive advantage that the costs of appearing before the tribunal should be <Col N="2518" /> substantially less than that of appearing before the District Court.  It is clearly to the landlord's advantage that many who now have cases listed in the District Court &mdash; and there are approximately 900 in the Dublin area &mdash; should transfer them to the tribunal.  It is obvious the tenant will consent to that transfer.</P>
    <P>A second point to which I would like to refer relates to the provisions in the Bill for the setting up of a rent officer service.  Many Senators yesterday expressed a preference for the dual system, of rent officer and appeals tribunal, to the single tribunal system.  I would tend to agree generally with this view but there are good reasons why at this stage the Rent Tribunal has to be set up on its own.  The first reason is that we are anxious to bring this Act into operation as soon as possible.  We expect to be in a position to have the tribunal in operation within a few months but we would not be able to set up the rent officer service within the same time scale.  The second and more substantial reason, is that in this area we are faced with many uncertainties. We have as yet no accurate figures for the number of rent controlled dwellings in the country or of the number likely to require their rents to be fixed under this Bill.  We also need more information on the distribution of these cases throughout the country.  Other imponderables include the likely attitude of landlords towards the tribunal and the number of cases that will be transferred from the District Court lists, the likely number of appeals, the speed with which cases can be determined by the tribunal and so on.  In dealing with so many uncertainties it seems prudent to allow for alternative mechanisms for determining rents but unwise to commit oneself to a particular course of action without knowing all the facts.  I can, however, assure Deputies that if, having seen how the tribunal system operates on its own, it becomes clear that a better service can be provided by the dual system involving rent officers then such a system will be established without delay in consultation with the local authorities and the public service unions.</P>
    <P>I consider the Bill to be an important <Col N="2519" /> step towards dealing with the problems which landlords and tenants of formerly controlled dwellings have faced since the Supreme Court decision last year.  I hope and believe that the structures being provided for in the Bill will endure and that it will be a long time before further legislation in this particular area will be required.  I recognise that the mere passing of laws does not of itself remove the problems faced by landlords and tenants but I believe that the new structures will be found by both sides to be much more satisfactory than the present arrangements. On this basis I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party give a wholehearted welcome to this Bill.  The Minister need not offer an apology for the short period allowed for the debate. We recognise the time restrictions on the Minister and we thank him for having ensured that this legislation was finally brought before the Dáil in this session.  It would have been a great tragedy if the Dáil had risen without this legislation being brought before it and enacted before the Summer Recess because otherwise the present very unsatisfactory situation would have continued up into next October-November.  If there is any issue which has given more concern to Deputies and occupied their minds more during this session it has certainly been the plight in which many, many people have found themsleves in having to present themselves before the District Court to have their rents reviewed.  The decisions made in many cases have caused a great deal of anguish and distress to many people.  As Fianna Fáil spokesman on the Environment I have had occasion to meet some of those affected.  I should like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank the committees in Dublin, Cork and other areas formed in order to bring pressure to bear on the Government to introduce this legislation as quickly as possible.  I congratulate those concerned citizens for the good work they did and the service they gave to many tenants and, in some cases, to landlords who are also badly affected. They are to be thanked publicly here.  I <Col N="2520" /> congratulate each and every one of them, particularly the Dublin action committee who were in the forefront of the campaign to have this legislation brought forward.</P>
      <P>The original Bill, which we are now amending, to establish that rents could be reviewed in the District Court was introduced by Fianna Fáil in Government. The reason why it was done and the way it was done was because the then Minister and the Government were advised in the light of Supreme Court decisions that it was imperative to establish immediately a procedure as otherwise a much worse situation would develop and the only procedures which could be availed of immediately was the District Court.  It is important it should be put on record here that it was never the intention of the Fianna Fáil Party that the District Court should continue to be a forum where rent decisions would be made in relation to formerly controlled dwellings.  It was our policy to establish as soon as possible a rents tribunal.  We recognised that the adversary situation which existed in the courts, as the Minister rightly said, would not be at all a suitable environment for the many tenants involved, most of whom were elderly and would never have had experienced the trauma of a courtroom or judicial procedures which they would find very strange indeed.  As we know, they were a cause of great distress to many and it was imperative that what had been provided, which was introduced as an emergency, would operate for only the shortest possible time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must confess I find it difficult to understand why it should have taken so long to bring this Bill before the House. We, in Fianna Fáil, have consistently raised this issue here by way of parliamentary question, by Private Notice Question and special motions as well as representations to the Minister and, indeed, to several Members of the Government other than the Minister directly involved.  When one examines the Bill and sees the procedures in it one is somewhat disconcerted to find that the Minister is admitting it will take him some months to establish the tribunal and one <Col N="2521" /> finds it difficult to understand why it should have taken so long to introduce a Bill which on the face of it appears to be a very simple Bill.  It is even more disconcerting to discover that we shall now have to wait for some months before the tribunals are established.  The short Bill taken just before this one should be a sufficient indication that where there is a will there is a way.  A court decision made late in June affecting the granting of loans by building societies raised a difficulty which this House has very quickly resolved within a matter of a few weeks. The difficulties which those residing in rent controlled dwellings have been suffering were well recognised a long time ago and I am sure those concerned must wonder why the Department and the Government have taken so long to prepare a Bill which does not appear to us on this side to be very complicated.  I do not wish to be over-critical and, having said that, I would urge the Minister to do his utmost to ensure the tribunals are in operation as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>There are some points we will deal with when we reach the Committee Stage if there is time.  It is not our intention to make any long contribution to the debate but we would hope the Minister might tease out some of the sections in greater detail.  Having perhaps carped a little over the delay from December until July in the introduction of the Bill I would thank the Minister and the Minister of State and I congratulate them both.  I hope the tribunal and the rent officer procedures to be established will prove successful.  It is a great pity that the cases already decided cannot be transferred. Those who have had their cases decided have had to suffer the consequences.  Had the Bill been introduced earlier they might have been able to take advantage of these new procedures.  It is a tragedy which can only be solved in the event of an appeal but unfortunately a period of five years must elapse before that appeal can take place.</P>
    <P>In regard to allowances, it seems extraordinary that any court would seek to include allowances paid by the Minister for Social Welfare as part of a person's income at the time the person stood <Col N="2522" /> before the court.  That is an extraordinary interpretation and it is one which acts to the detriment of the tenant.  It is unfortunate that, despite the great faith and trust people have in the independence and fairmindedness of the Judiciary, in many cases there was utter astonishment at the manner in which they were dealt with and at the decisions arrived at.  The increases granted were considered excessive by many Deputies in many cases. They seemed to bear no relationship whatsoever to the means of the tenant or the tenant's capacity to pay.  The latter seemed to play a very small part in the judgment.  I hope a much more humane approach will operate under the new tribunal and rent officer system.  On my first reading of the Bill and the Explanatory Memorandum I took it that both procedures would come into operation as quickly as possible and I thought both would be available to either landlord or tenant immediately on the passing of this Bill.  I regret the tone of the Minister's speech where he seemed to indicate that he intends to proceed immediately only with the establishment of the tribunal and at a later stage set up the other system whereby rent officers will be available to hear cases.</P>
    <P>I would like to welcome the proposal to have the dual system.  It came as a very pleasant surprise and I congratulate the Minister on the initiative shown in proposing the dual system.  I encourage him to proceed with it.  It is an excellent idea because the rent officers will be available throughout the country in a very broad spread in every local authority area.  If it is difficult to establish even yet, from what the Minister has said, the number of rent controlled dwellings and the number of tenants affected, obviously one could not plan the thing with any great accuracy.  If it is possible to appoint rent officers in areas where appeals may be coming forward I am sure they will deal with the cases adequately.  The appeal procedure to the tribunal would seem to me to be very satisfactory.  The general tenure of the Bill is excellent and one to which we can give our wholehearted support.</P>
    <P>I would like to thank the Minister for <Col N="2523" /> responding to the many urgings he got from this side of the House and from the concerned citizen's committees outside. Even if we had an acrimonious discussion on environmental issues during the earlier part of this week we have no difficulty in readily agreeing with the Minister on this measure which shows the positive attitude which we in Opposition will take to issues as they come before us. We encourage the Minister to come forward with legislation of this kind in other areas where there is a great social need for improvement in legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill is, unfortunately, another fire brigade action in an area which saw another fire brigade action a day before the recess in 1982.  It attempts to fill in the gap in the Bill brought in in 1982.  I cannot for the life of me see why it took from early last year until now to introduce this Bill.  The blame for the delay does not lie totally on the shoulders of this Government. The previous Government were in power until November last year and, following repeated promptings from me, we were informed on numerous occasions that the tribunals were ready, nearly ready or in the process of being ready just as the Coalition Government have, from time to time, told us they were in the process of being prepared and so forth.  We are now told, despite the fact that this Bill is being brought in, that it could be the end of the year before the tribunals actually become effective.  If that is the case this Bill, in effect, will be a joke because there is no landlord who will switch from the courts to the tribunals.  It may be possible to argue that they would switch from the courts to a tribunal if the only reason they wanted to do so was to enable the tenants to have an easier atmosphere to operate in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe the general consensus would be that the rents tribunal would attempt to set the fair rent which was set in the Bill originally when the courts at present are establishing what are termed market rents.  That is the key to the problem which most tenants face when they go before the courts.  The courts are setting market rents and that is the big complaint. <Col N="2524" /> Many tenants are upset with the trappings of the courts, the cross-questioning and so forth.  It is important to get rid of that.  That is one of the advantages of a tribunal or housing officers.  The key factor is the rents that are being set by the courts at present.  I can see that any landlord who is anxious to get increases in rent will certainly have his applications in before the end of this year.  As the Bill stands there is no way those cases can be transferred from the courts to the tribunals unless the landlord agrees.  I cannot see that any savings he might make in relation to legal costs between the courts and the tribunal will be attractive enough to overcome what could be a substantial loss in terms of the rent he might get between the courts and the tribunal.</P>
    <P>The original Act was introduced as a result of a High Court action by private landlords on the basis that they felt discriminated against because rent restrictions only affected a small number of people and under the Constitution they were being discriminated against because 90 per cent of private rented housing was free of control.  That is the basis on which the Rent Restrictions Act was struck down.  In effect, the failure by the House to introduce rent restrictions and security of tenure for all private rent tenants was the cause of the Rent Restrictions Act being struck down by the courts.  Promises to introduce total rent control have been made on numerous occasions over the years by the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and they have failed to do it to date.  Still, as I said, we are faced again with fire brigade action tonight to introduce tribunals which should have been introduced 12 months ago.  As the Minister said that it will not be possible to have them effective before the end of this year this Bill in my view will end up as a joke.  There will be no protection for the tenants who are presently faced with increases in rent.</P>
    <P>The other serious dereliction of duty, as far as I am concerned, on the part of this Minister for the Environment and the previous Minister for the Environment is the failure to introduce the regulations under section 26.  I have raised that matter on numerous occasions in the <Col N="2525" /> House and I have been told they are in the process of being discussed with various interests and that they will be ready quite soon.  This also has a great bearing on the rents that are being set in the courts.  Those rents are being set on the basis that the landlords have complied with the agreements in relation to repairs, that all the repairs necessary have been carried out.  Once the rents are set the tenants have no power until these regulations under section 26 are brought into effect to force the landlords to comply with the Act and to carry out the necessary repairs to bring the houses up to standard.</P>
    <P>The landlords are getting rents on the basis that these houses are marketable commodities.  The rents are being set on the basis that they are up to standard, that they have all modern conveniences, that they have toilets and running water. Many of them have not got these facilities but the rents are being set on the basis that they have them.  Still the tenants have no right to force the landlords to carry out the repairs.  The Minister of State who is present in the House at the moment, was very scathing when we introduced a series of amendments last year changing &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;, requiring that these regulations be made mandatory on the Minister, that the Minister must introduce these regulations.  The regulations have still not been brought in.  If a constitutional case was taken in the morning I believe the Minister would be found to be in dereliction of his duty for not bringing in those regulations.  He has failed to implement the Act passed in July 1982.  That is a serious dereliction of duty, not only to this House but to the thousands of tenants who have come before the courts and who will come before the courts over the next six to seven months.</P>
    <P>While this is a welcome move even at this late date it is not enough.  It may even be too late for most of the tenants faced with these landlords.  It is interesting to note a letter which appeared recently in <i>The Irish Press</i> where the leader of the private rented tenants association offered to withhold their money from the banks if any farmers are evicted because they <Col N="2526" /> do not pay their loans.  I wait for the day when these landlords withdraw their money from the banks in protest when one of their tenants is evicted for not paying the rent.  I doubt if we will see that day.  It is interesting to see the class alliance appearing between the landlords and the big farmers.</P>
    <P>The main defect of the Bill is that the tenants will not have the right to withdraw cases which are brought before the courts and place them before the tribunals unless they get the OK from the landlords. I cannot see any landlord in his right mind agreeing to a switch from the courts and having the rents being set at the moment put before the tribunal.  I will be interested to hear the Minister of State telling us the latest date that he can make effective this legislation before us. I would like him also to explain the constitutional grounds, which he states the Attorney General has indicated, which would prevent the switch from the courts to the tribunal at the tenant's request.</P>
    <P>The rent officers proposal in this Bill is a good one.  The Minister of State is committed to establishing rent control right across the board for all private rented dwellings and I hope that in the very near future he will bring in similar rent legislation and similar rent officers to control the disgraceful exploitation by landlords of young people in particular in this city and towns all over this country when no standards whatsoever are set and rent increases can be demanded five times a week.  There is no limit whatsoever and the tenants have no security of tenure.</P>
    <P>This legislation is limited.  The Bill effectively will expire in 19 years.  If, as I predict, most landlords enter their applications for rent increases before this tribunal sees the light of day the tribunal effectively will be dealing with rent reviews every five years, and after 19 years when this legislation expires, unless the Minister acts, we will have no control whatsoever on private rented accommodation. I appeal to him while he is in his present position to introduce long-promised reform in the area of private rented accommodation.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to see what steps can be taken to ensure that <Col N="2527" /> this legislation becomes effective immediately. Under section 26, whether it is the courts or the tribunal who will adjudicate on the rents, the regulations are essential if justice is to be done in regard to the thousands of tenants who find themselves in the hands of these landlords.</P>

      <P>I welcome the Bill and I am sincere in saying that I wish to co-operate in every way in having it passed. At times when legislation is introduced here in the House we remark that it is very important legislation, but this is one of the most important measures ever to come before the House.  I compliment the Minister and Minister of State on introducing it.  I regret very much that it has taken so long to come in.  I appreciate that a number of Deputies wish to speak on this and I hope we will co-operate with the Ceann Comhairle so that we will be able to have discussions on sections of the Bill on Committee Stage.  A number of the sections are of the utmost importance to everybody, both landlords and tenants.  I hope that when the tribunals are set up they will act in a fair way.  Some sections in the Bill could be very sensitive and will require co-operation from everybody if the best is to be achieved by the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill is very necessary.  Deputy De Rossa touched on something of concern to everybody, particularly people in Dublin looking for housing accommodation <Col N="2528" /> and living in flats.  I refer to insecurity of tenure.  I hope we will discuss this on Committee Stage.  I hope this Bill will receive the co-operation of everybody here tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that the time at our disposal is short.  As a member of the Labour Party I am happy that the Minister of State, also a member of my party, has introduced this Bill tonight. He gave an undertaking earlier in the year that it would be in before the summer recess.  Even at this late hour it is to be welcomed.</P>
      <P>Old people particularly have undergone hardship and trauma as a result of the recent Supreme Court decision. People who all their lives had paid their rent without fail found themselves in the surroundings of a courthouse and they could not come to terms with this.  That no longer applies.  I regret very much that the Constitution did not permit of some appeals mechanism which would give the tenant the right to appear before a tribunal or an officer of the Department. Deputy De Rossa referred to something of a rather sensitive nature, that is the market value of rented houses.  In Cork two separate groups were extremely active in the field on behalf of tenants and one point of great concern to them was the market value applied to certain houses many of which were little more than botháns when people took possession of them originally and many of them had earthen floors.  People spent their savings of years in up-dating these houses and making them more comfortable. Then the landlords would demand outlandish rents, something in excess of 800 per cent of what they had been paying. That is the type of demand confronting people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was a little easy on the courts system where very little attention seems to have been given to the question of whether the title to these properties was in order.  Some of them were very much in doubt.  People who wanted to purchase these houses were told they were not for sale but good reasons were never given and I suspect that in many cases the title may have been faulty.  The <Col N="2529" /> courts did not take due cognisance to this matter.</P>
    <P>Section 17 gives the right to enter and inspect dwellings and this will allay to some extent the concern expressed by Deputy De Rossa about the valuation of buildings.  The members of the tribunal can go and inspect a building and I hope they will do so in order to assess the real value of the premises and the appropriate level of rent.  It is not possible to apply market values to things which are not in the market place.  Some of these properties are in obscure areas of Cork and the same criteria are being applied as in the more fashionable parts of the city.</P>
    <P>I would question the qualifications of some of the people who have been valuing properties.  Values have varied considerably depending on which side the valuer was representing and this caused a lot of confusion among older citizens.</P>
    <P>I am happy that the Minister of State was instrumental in introducing this measure.  There has been some criticism about the time scale and I will not attempt to measure my experience against that of Deputy Molloy who was for many years a senior Government Minister.  He must know the legalities surrounding the introduction of any legislation and the time involved in drafting it.  The Bill shows the commitment of the Minister of State who, prior to his appointment, pioneered many of the ideas contained in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  Its introduction at an earlier stage would, however, have eliminated much anxiety among older people and those living alone who have been dragged through the courts by merciless landlords whose main concern was to increase their personal incomes at the expense of people living almost on the breadline.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was good enough recently to receive a deputation of Cork representatives from all parties.  Many tenants in that city were being threatened by landlords with exorbitant rent increases or eviction and they eventually brought many unfortunate people before the courts.  This was the practice in some cases in Cork and the Deputies decided to meet the Minister in order to expedite <Col N="2530" /> the introduction of the Bill.  This was a major social problem in my constituency, affecting not only the old but also young married couples with children on whom exorbitant demands were made.  For many of them the worst aspect was the thought of being dragged through the courts.  The setting up of the rents tribunal will be a more humane approach for both landlords and tenants.</P>
    <P>I do not know what powers the Minister will have in regard to cases pending court hearings.  I believe it would be an infringment of constitutional rights if the Minister were to interfere at this stage. Nevertheless there are complaints from the courts about the enormous backlog of cases and I see no reason why the Minister should not have the matter examined and direct that these cases be removed from the courts and passed to the tribunals.  I have no doubt that he is aware of the backlog.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with appeals by the landlord or the tenant to the High Court. If the landlord takes the case to the High Court the tenant will be at a disadvantage because of court costs.  The Minister should try to clarify the matter further. He can refer a matter to the High Court but can he also refuse to do so?</P>
    <P>It is important that the operation of this legislation should be properly monitored and if there are difficulties the Minister should not hesitate to come back to the House and amend it.  He will have our total co-operation in this matter.  I ask him to avoid any unnecessary delay in its implementation so as to prevent people rushing to the courts before the establishment of the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy referred to the many groups set up to defend people whose rights were being infringed by landlords. I thank the legal advisers who made their services available without cost.  This proved that they too were aware of the need to protect some unfortunate people. I also thank the Minister for receiving us on a number of occasions, enabling him to bring various problems to his attention.</P>

      <P>The number of Cork Deputies here tonight shows the effect of the <Col N="2531" /> Supreme Court decision on a large number of families in the Cork area.  Since the time is limited I will be brief and formally welcome the Bill.  The Minister has been true to his word in bringing this legislation before the Dáil during this session.  I spent a number of days in the Cork District Court listening to cases being dealt with.  The fear and anguish of many of the tenants who were brought before the court depressed me.  They were strangers to the legal system and found the whole procedure a formidable experience.  That convinced me of the need for a tribunal.</P>
      <P>It worries me that district justices seem to be ignoring the provisions of the Bill and seem to split the difference between the landlord and tenant valuations.  They do not take into consideration the circumstances of the landlord or the tenant. This gives rise to anxiety.  Members of the legal profession have expressed their concern to me about this matter.</P>
      <P>District justices are not above the law themselves and should implement the law as it is written and not as they feel they should interpret it.  I know people have the right of appeal to a higher court but most of the people brought before the courts have no resources.  They are inexperienced in legal procedures and are just glad to have the whole thing over.  I hope that some of the decisions will be contested. They have not been to date.  If any of them had been, the rate at which the cases were pushed through Cork District Court with indecent haste would have been much slower.  There would have been many cases left to be heard by the tribunal when it is set up.  Unfortunately many cases in the Cork area have been heard and I am disappointed that they cannot be referred back to the tribunal. I accept that the Minister has received the advice of the Attorney General in the matter and that nothing can be done about it.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will help people who are still waiting to have their cases heard.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>I welcome the Bill.  When <Col N="2532" /> the business of the House was arranged last week I was disappointed that it was not on the Order Paper.  I hope that we will get through it before midnight.  I thank the Minister for bringing it before us.</P>
      <P>Deputies from Cork had a motion on the Adjournment recently regarding the problem in Cork.  I was the speaker on behalf of Fianna Fáil on that occasion.  I outlined the situation as it prevailed in Cork at that time.  I am glad the Minister has said that the courts are not the answer to the problem.  The decisions reached by the courts have been more in favour of the landlord than the tenant.  Tenants have no recourse open to them.</P>
      <P>I attended Cork District Court and what the elderly people had to go through was an indictment on each and everyone of us.  I am concerned about the decision reached by the courts.  All matters must be taken into consideration by the tribunal. In some cases people had spent a lot of money on houses which they occupied for 50 or 60 years but this was not taken into consideration by the court in reaching its decision.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that it will take a few months before the tribunal is set up. Surely we can get off our knees and tackle the problem.  By the time the tribunal is set up there will probably not be any cases left to be heard.  As Deputy Allen said, the majority of them have been dealt with in Cork because the landlords went to the courts.  It is not good enough that we should have to wait for a few months before the Bill comes into operation. We have co-operated in trying to get the Bill through before the Recess. We do not want to give the impression that we are anti-landlord or anti-tenant. We are for the good of the people.  I thank the Minister for bringing the measure before the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. MacGiolla Mr. MacGiolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacGiolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but should like to reinforce the points made by the last two Deputies.  It is unfortunate that this Bill has taken so long to come before us and that the decisions reached by the courts have been unjust.  They have not been based on the law.  There is no doubt about that.  Sections 13 and 26 <Col N="2533" /> were not taken into account by the courts when making their decisions.  Why those decisions cannot be appealed to the rent tribunal I do not understand.</P>
      <P>What redress have tenants for wrong, faulty and unjust decisions?  In section 13 it specifically states that the means of the landlord, the means of the tenant, the date of purchase of the dwelling, the amount paid by the landlord for the dwelling, the length of the tenant's occupancy, the number and ages of the tenant's family must be taken into account. It further states that the gross rent should be reduced by an allowance for any improvements made.</P>
      <P>I am aware of a case pending on Friday week in which the tenants have been under the same landlord family for about 140 years.  The present landlord is 86 years of age.  No improvements were ever carried out by the landlord in the memory of the tenants.  The tenants' parents and grandparents lived in the dwelling before then.  All improvements made had been carried out by the tenants.  They know that when they go to court the landlord's valuer will value the house based on the improvement made by the tenants.  They know that the terms of the Bill will not be implemented by the courts.  They have seen other people in exactly the same position as they are and they are well aware of this.  This Bill will not be signed by the President by tomorrow week. What redress have these tenants?  Why can they not appeal to have their cases brought before the tribunal if the Bill has been passed by this House and by the Seanad even though it may not be law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister ensure once this Bill becomes law that at least the cases pending be withdrawn from the courts and brought to the tribunals?  That is only just and fair and every Deputy will see the need for this action.  Some lawyers may say that it is unconstitutional, but it is difficult for any Deputy to see how something is unconstitutional which ensures that there is no discrimination against one group of tenants compared with others and whose cases just happened to be pending within the next few weeks or months before this Bill is passed.  Why should something which <Col N="2534" /> ensures justice for them be unconstitutional? The Minister should ask his advisers to agree some formula which ensures that the provisions in the Bill allow for all cases pending from midnight tonight be withdrawn from the courts and brought before the tribunals?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the other Deputies who have spoken, I welcome this Bill to amend the 1982 Act.  Over a period of time and during the term of office of a couple of Governments, there has been great co-operation on legislation introduced here.  Because of my interest in this matter and because of the constituency which I represent, I have contributed to every debate on this subject and the records will show that.</P>
      <P>On 31 March 1982, when contributing to the Bill then before the House, I expressed the reservations which many have expressed since and it was not that I was looking into a crystal ball.  I said at that time that the District Courts were not the places to have rents decided.  That was not a criticism of the Judiciary or the court system.  There is only one person for the Army and that is the soldier.  On rents matters the people proposed in this Bill are the correct people to take these decisions.  That is why at that time we encouraged the setting up of rents tribunals. We expressed reservations then and now about taking people moving into the autumn years of their lives to courts in which they had never previously been. They did not want to have anything to do with courts and had a fear of them.  We all realised that.  The then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Raphael Burke, said &mdash; and I am paraphrasing &mdash; that as soon as the controlled elements of rents had been sorted out in an Act that was acceptable and seen to be constitutional, he would proceed as expeditiously as possible with the setting up of the rents tribunals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like other Deputies, I am dissatisfied that it has taken so long to have legislation passed for the appointment of rents officers and the establishment of the tribunals to take the place of the District Courts.  In practice many cases have been heard in these courts and many of the <Col N="2535" /> reasons given in the House why the District Courts were not the places to hear these cases have been borne out by some of the decisions which have been taken there.  Mar adeirimid as Gaeilge, más maith is mithid and that the setting up of the tribunals has taken far too long is my only criticism.  Each Deputy went through the trauma of the previous Act and the continuance Bills and, more importantly, the trauma experienced by the people concerned was unbelievable. I must pay tribute to the associations which formed <i>ad hoc</i> in my constituency and other places around the country to keep us public representatives and Dáil Deputies acquainted with what was happening so that we, in turn, could put all the pressure possible on the Government of the day.  I compliment the Minister of State in taking a Private Members' Motion from the Deputies in Cork of all parties for which we nominated speakers to impress on the Minister and, through him, the Government the necessity of setting up these tribunals and appointing these rents officers.</P>
    <P>The Bill mentions that any applications which have been made to the courts will be heard by the courts.  I regret this decision of the Attorney General.  I hope that as from tonight any case which has not been heard will not be heard in the District Court.  It is a pity that that cannot be done for the people who have waited so long and so anxiously for this legislation and they may be beaten at the eleventh hour.  I regret that we could not say to those people that as soon as this Bill is passed through the House and signed by the President all cases not heard will be referred to the rents officers and the tribunals. If that is not possible, it should be made abundantly clear to everybody that from midnight tonight, 7 July 1983, no further applications for decisions in the District Courts be received or noted and that as from now these cases will be dealt with in the manner suggested by this legislation.</P>
    <P>I also hope that the precedent set in the hearing of these cases in the District Courts will not be taken as a guideline by the tribunals.  If that is allowed to happen <Col N="2536" /> this legislation will have no effect.  We will see to it that the decisions of the District Courts will not be the guideline for future decisions in the tribunals or by rents officers.</P>
    <P>Everybody is in such agreement that to say more would be superfluous, but had we the time, we would have had much more to say.  We have been keeping up to date on events.  Other speakers wish to contribute and I will conclude by complimenting the Minister for bringing in this legislation.  Better late than never.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, I wish to repeat what I said during the Planning Bill debate here last week.  This Bill is the most socially desirable legislation. I am glad the Minister of State has beaten the deadline before the Recess to introduce the legislation and I share his viewpoint.  However, welcome though it is and helpful though it may be, it does not solve the problems or rid us of the difficulties and hardships caused to so many people in the categories mentioned because of the Supreme Court decision. The fear of the consequences of a court-case and the financial hardship it might impose has caused much mental anguish and suffering to many of our older citizens, and it is not always confined to older people.  The interest of Cork Deputies shows what a problem it is on the Cork scene.  It is also a problem in Dublin, Galway, Waterford and elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said they expect to be in a position to have the tribunal in operation within a few months.  I do not accept that.  Why not have it in operation by 1 August?  The personnel of the tribunal have to be appointed.  I welcome the way in which these appointments are to be made.  I am glad the Minister of State has had a late conversion.  These people will be appointed by the Minister.  It is important that the personnel should be kind, considerate people.  I see no reason why they should not be appointed immediately. Staff from the Department could be seconded on a temporary basis until permanent staff are available.  There is no difficulty about accommodation.  It <Col N="2537" /> can be found in the schools which are closed at the moment.</P>
    <P>I do not always agree with Deputy Mac Giolla, but he said that from midnight tonight every case should be withdrawn from the courts, if one party so wishes, and transferred to the tribunal.  The tribunal could work throughout August when the courts are not sitting.  Some of the court decisions have caused hardship. If saying that means that I am being critical of the courts I am sorry, but it has to be said.  There have been 14-fold, 20-fold and 24-fold rent increases.  I hope the tribunal will take all the circumstances into consideration because the pendulum has swung very sharply since the Supreme Court decision.</P>
    <P>This legislation is needed urgently.  We are co-operating in facilitating its passage through the House.  There may be little pitfalls in legislation which is rushed through the House but we want to get this through quickly.  I always respect the advice of the Attorney General.  As legislators we must realise that there are problems and hardships which must be faced up to.  I welcome the Bill with reservations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of why existing cases cannot be transferred to the tribunal, the advice from the Attorney General is that no Government can knowingly introduce or promote legislation which they believe to be unconstitutional.  In effect the Constitution states that once a law enacted by the Oireachtas confers rights on any citizen, be he landlord or tenant, that citizen has a right to avail of the provisions of that law.  In this instance the 1982 Act enabled a landlord or a tenant to apply to the District Court to have a rent fixed. We cannot take away that right once it has been given.  This is a legal opinion based on a considerable number of precedents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the President of the District Court and the President of the High Court will take into account the unanimous view of all Members of the House and that the courts will co-operate as far as possible in attempting to encourage <Col N="2538" /> landlords to transfer their cases.  I presume that in the main it will be landlords who will be resisting such transfers.  It is our obligation to establish a climate in which the landlords will see it is in their interests to transfer.</P>
    <P>There is one good reason why it will be in their interests.  Under the 1982 Act, in addition to having the rent increased, the landlord can look for compensation.  If the landlord applied two months ago to the District Court and the court does not take that case until late December of this year or January of next year the new rent fixed by the court will be payable only after all the requirements of the legislation have been met, including registration.</P>
    <P>There is provision in law &mdash; but so far the courts have not granted it yet &mdash; that a landlord may be entitled to compensation from the time his application went into the court to such time as the court made the decision.  To our knowledge no District Court judgment has granted any such compensation.  Landlords who are waiting in the queue are unlikely &mdash; it would appear from our knowledge to date of the operation of the courts' system &mdash; to get the benefit of compensation for increases in rent retrospectively.  That is another advantage which I hope the landlords will avail of for transfer to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>I have listened carefully to all the comments made by Deputies in regard to the urgency to establish the tribunal. Because of the experience of Deputy Fitzgerald, a former Minister for Finance and for the Public Service, I will take on board the spirit of his sense of urgency. We have already begun to explore the possibilities and the constraints.</P>
    <P>On the question of why it took so long to get to this stage &mdash; it has taken a long time &mdash; there are three reasons.  First, the change of Government did not facilitate matters.  We had the benefit of some preparatory work, indeed a considerable degree of it, which had been initiated by the previous Administration, but the change of Government and the pyramid structure of decision making in a cabinet system meant that this went to the bottom of the queue.  The formulation of a <Col N="2539" /> budget and the fiscal policy surrounding it preoccupied cabinet time.  And third, there was the necessity for the Attorney General, because of the constitutional claims that had been made on the two previous Acts &mdash; this Bill was an addendum to those &mdash; to have a full look, more than would normally have been the case, at this legislation.  That scrutiny went on not so much in secret but in the confines of the civil service, acting in a traditional manner.</P>
    <P>In view of the way Deputies have responded to this, and Senators yesterday, if we had the legislative committee which will be set up in the near future, this legislation and queries in regard to its constitutionality could have been teased out.  That could have been done earlier if such a committee had been in existence and in such circumstances we would not have been caught in the queue. As Deputies will recall, the Attorney General had to agonise over a constitutional amendment for a long time earlier this year.</P>

      <P>Concern has been expressed here about the commencement <Col N="2540" /> date of the Act and I should like the Minister to tell us what will happen in the meantime.  Could he give some indication of when the Act will be commenced and when the present situation will cease to operate &mdash; in other words, when will this Bill become law and when can appeals be lodged under the new Act?  It would be the wish of everyone in the House that it would become law immediately and that all cases that at present stand for hearing in the District Court, on the commencement of this Act would be transferred to the tribunal.</P>
      <P>I have circulated an amendment to that effect which we will be pressing the Minister to accept.  It was stated clearly during the debate that many cases have been rushed to the court, particularly by landlords anxious to beat this Bill.  We were very disappointed to hear the Minister say that it will be several months before the tribunal will be established. That is unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>I cannot accept the excuse the Minister give for the delay up to now.  He said the change of Government did not help matters. That should not have mattered because there was consensus of opinion on both sides of the House before the last election that a rents tribunal should be established, so the change of Government should not have interfered in any way with the preparatory work in the Department of the Environment.  That work proceeded even with an election taking place.  No matter how many elections were held, no matter how many Minister from both sides of the House were appointed, the civil service were there in continuity.  Therefore that is not an acceptable excuse.  There was no difference in policy between Fianna Fáil and the Coalition parties on this.  We all agreed there is urgency about bringing legislation before the House to set up the tribunal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said this legislation had been put at the end of a queue.  I was more than surprised to hear that.  We regarded it as being very urgent and I am disappointed to hear that the Government now in office did not give it the same urgency.  I do not know if the Minister meant to create that impression.  It <Col N="2541" /> was a surprising form of words to use about a Bill which had to do with the relief of great hardship being caused in the courts while a lot of the Attorney General's time was wasted over the words of the pro-life issue.  The poor tenants are the ones who will suffer because of the to-ing and fro-ing of the Taoiseach and the Attorney General on the referendum issue.  It is a very sad day for a small vulnerable section of the community, caused by the prevarication of the Taoiseach on the referendum issue.  The economy in general has suffered because the Taoiseach devoted so much of his time to that issue.  So did employment and the entire economy which has been sliding from under his feet during all that period.</P>
    <P>We are critical of the fact that it has taken so long to bring this Bill forward. We will not be too critical tonight because we realise the short time left.  We would have been very upset if the Bill had not come before the House this week.  We want to get to section 10 quickly.</P>

      <P>I have been listening to the urgency of the Deputies' speeches.  The advice I got is that it could take a number of months because of all the factors involved.  I am saying now that I will do everything possible to establish the tribunal with the minimum amount of delay.  I do not want to mislead the House.  It would be very easy for me to respond to Deputy Fitzgerald and say that the tribunal would be there by 1 August.  I am not sure at this stage if we would be able to do all of the things required between now and 1 August. However, I give an unequivocal commitment, and leave myself open to sanction <Col N="2542" /> by the House at a later date, to have it done as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>What is the great difficulty? At the moment the cases are heard by a district justice.  All the Minister has to do is to appoint people to the tribunal to have the cases heard.  Surely the tribunal members could be selected from people who have similar experience and knowledge in this area as district justices. Indeed we are not very happy with many of the decisions of district justices.  That is why we are urging the Minister to get on with the tribunal.  This is not something new.  The procedures are already established.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was the case it could be done, but we are not just trying to replace the District Court; we are actually trying to change the process by which the District Courts took the decisions. The District Court system is an adversary one with the landlord's team on one side and the tenant's on the other, two people competing against each other. The procedures of the District Courts are in existence already for the rules of evidence and so on.</P>
      <P>In this instance not only do we have to appoint the members of the Rents Tribunal &mdash; which probably is the easiest part of the exercise now required &mdash; but under the regulations which we must draw up there are procedures to be established, forms and so on.  We want to reach a situation in which a tenant can come down to a rent officer with his or her son or daughter, or daughter or son-in-law, fill in a clear, fairly straightforward form, submitting all the details of their income, all the facts, the kinds of things about which Deputy Mac Giolla was talking &mdash; how long they had lived in the place, all of the eight factors set out originally in section 13, quantifying the kind of repairs they had carried out, the number of times a landlord in a particular case did not undertake work he was supposed to do&mdash;so that the rent officer could examine the whole matter, adjudicate and make a recommendation in relation to rent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is more involved than just nominating <Col N="2543" /> a chariman, four or five vice-chairmen and a panel of 20 to 30 people. I could quite easily give a commitment that we could have that done by 1 August. That is the easiest side of establishing the Rents Tribunal.  What will take some time is the preparation of the procedures to get away from the adversary system of the District Courts.  But, subject to that constraint, I am giving the House an undertaking that it will be weeks rather than months in relation to my thinking on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can landlords still make application to the courts until such time as the provisions of this Bill are implemented, until the Rents Tribunal is established? Can the landlords continue the flow to the District Courts?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is essential that that the Bill be brought into force immediately, that the Rents Tribunal be established. If there is then a delay in dealing with cases at tribunal level I am sure all of us would accept that that would be reasonable enough.  But, once the Rents Tribunal is established, it will stop the flow to the District Court and will divert all future applications on these matters to the Rents Tribunal.  If the Rents Tribunal is not ready and prepared to deal with a big flow of work, nobody will complain about that &mdash; it can delay dealing with applications &mdash; but at least the applications will be going in the direction of the Rents Tribunal and it will stop them going on to the District Court, which is what everybody is objecting to.</P>
      <P>It is obvious from what the Minister says that very little work has been done on section 15 &mdash; in other words, in preparing the regulations detailed in great number in that section.  Can the Minister very quickly give an indication of how much work has been done on the regulations which would be necessary to facilitate the procedures to be adopted by the Rents Tribunal?</P>

      <P>There are two amendments to section 10, one in the names of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa, which was handed in first, and another in the name of Deputy Molloy. They are alternative amendments and both may be discussed together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 7, line 23, to delete &ldquo;the applicant may, if the other party consents&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the landlord or tenant may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have no objection to the two amendments being discussed together.  The purpose of our amendment is to seek to allow the landlord or tenant to withdraw an application from the court.  The Minister has indicated that he has been advised by the Attorney General that that is unconstitutional. The information we have &mdash; and again I should like the Minister's comments on it &mdash; is that at present the Director of Public Prosecutions has the power to switch cases from the jurisdiction of one court to that of another and that this right has been tested in the High Court or the Supreme Court, I am not sure which, and found to be good law.  I should like to know from the Minister if that does not apply in this instance as well.  Not being a lawyer I am not in a position to enter into a judgment on that. <Col N="2545" /> Perhaps the Minister or some of his advisers can put us straight on that point.</P>
    <P>The amendment is essential if this Bill is to have any worthwhile effect on the situation obtaining.  A number of speakers have made the point already that the courts are not taking fully into account section 13 of the 1982 Act.  The factors which are not being taken into account in particular in determining a fair rent are the means of the landlord, the means of the tenant, the age and condition of the dwelling, the date of purchase and the amount paid by the landlord on purchase. My information is that those who are processing cases through the courts are of the opinion that the legislation is operating in such a way that at least 80 per cent of market rents are being established, that a sort of rule of thumb has developed whereby the claim by the landlord is counterbalanced against that of the tenant, the difference being split between them.  This means in effect that the fair rental, which was the intent of this House when the legislation was passed last year, is not being implemented, rather that it is the market rent that obtains.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would reply to the point I made in relation to the power of the Director of Public Prosecutions to switch cases from one court to another. Though not a lawyer it seems to me there are grounds for hope in regard to that.</P>

      <P>These time restrictions are of great inconvenience.  I will not delay the House on this amendment.  It has been put down for the purpose of having all cases standing before the District Court at present transferred to the proposed new Rents Tribunal.  It is clear that that is the wish of the Oireachtas, that everybody here is expressing the same view.  I think we would all be prepared to see it challenged wherever it needs.  If the Minister's advice is that it is unconstitutional perhaps that advice must be accepted by him.  But we are all conscious of the differing opinions emanating from legal quarters at different times, that what may be one man's view tomorrow.  Surely not be another's view tomorrow.  Surely the will of the Oireachtas should be <Col N="2546" /> supreme in this matter?  I hope the Minister will come forward with some positive response, as he has been co-operative so far this evening.  I am sure the Minister wishes to see this Bill express the will of the Oireachtas in regard to the Rent Tribunal with particular regard to the cases at present standing before the District Court.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's response.</P>

      <P>I want to put it to the Minister that there is some constitutional or legal problem &mdash; that if a landlord or tenant applies to the court to have a case withdrawn, the decision is then in the hands of the justice to allow the case be withdrawn from the court.  Surely that would not be unconstitutional?  Surely the District Court judge can decide &mdash; both are applicants, the landlord and the tenant, and have equal rights before the court in a landlord/tenant case.  The court is making a decision as between the two. Our amendment is simply to allow either the landlord or the tenant to apply to the court for permission to withdraw the case and then to take that case to the tribunal. It is within the powers of the district justice to do this and would not constitute interference with the courts.</P>
      <P>I take it the Seanad could sit in the morning if that were necessary to deal with the amendment.  This is an important matter.  If we are told our amendment cannot be accepted because the Seanad is not meeting, then we are wasting our time.  I should like clarification on whether the Seanad would be able to deal with our amendment in the morning.  It is most important.  We are the lawmakers and surely we can make a law to do what we want to do?  Otherwise we are wasting our time here.</P>

In relation to the point made by Deputy De Rossa regarding the DPP, he has the power to direct a case from one court to another court, although in this instance it is not a court but a tribunal.  We are trying to get away from the whole court procedure.  It must not be forgotten that the Supreme Court adjudicated on one matter only, namely, with regard to rent. My views and those of my party are well known with regard to private property rights.  It is our view that the balance is wrong between the common good and private property rights as interpreted in previous court decisions.  What the Legislature wants and what the courts decide are dictated by the Constitution.  While I would like to accommodate Deputies, I am constrained from the constitutional point of view.  Here I am acting on behalf of the Government and the Minister for the Environment and I cannot promote legislation if I believe it to be unconstitutional.

      <P>All Deputies are trying to achieve the same objective from different viewpoints.  In Dublin the District Courts are grossly over-burdened with these cases.  I merely point out that district justices have considerable influence.  If an applicant is told by the district justice that it would be preferable for him to take his business elsewhere, in this case <Col N="2549" /> to a tribunal, and if that person persists in getting his case heard in court it is obvious that he is not approaching the bench in a way that will get the best response from his point of view.  I am sure this is a consideration that will be taken into account by a landlord.  We wish that these cases will be transferred to the tribunals as soon as possible.  I would like to make that mandatory but the legal advice is that I cannot do such a thing.  While I should like to accept what the Deputies are proposing, I caution the House against pressing this amendment.

      <P>The United States of America first disposed of nuclear waste in 1946, followed closely by Britain in 1949 and afterwards by at least seven other countries.  However, by the early seventies only the United Kingdom, Belgium, Switzerland and Holland were still dumping at sea. Holland have recently announced that they will no longer continue to dump at sea and Britain are now dumping 90 per cent of the total amount dumped at sea either dumping from a ship or from land-based sources.  They still remain the major exponent of the practice owing to their numerous power installations, weapon manufacture facilities and reprocessing ambitions at Windscale.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first generation of nuclear reactors are now approaching the end of their life span and will have to be disposed of shortly.  Meanwhile, over the last few years a large and wide ranging body of critical analysis has cast serious doubt on the wisdom of continuing the practice of sea disposal because of the exposure to ocean currents and the fear that nuclear particles can ultimately enter the food chain.  There is definite scientific evidence available to indicate that the operation at present taking place in the North Atlantic is dangerous and I should like to refer the Minister to a publication prepared by W. Jackson Davis, Professor of Biology and Environmental Studies, University of Calfornia, entitled <i>The Valuation of Oceanic Radioactive Dumping Programmes.</i><Col N="2552" /> This paper has raised many serious questions and I am satisfied that the British Government are in contravention of the London Dumping Convention, 1972, on the prevention of pollution of the seas from ships.  At that convention it was agreed that safety factors involved in dumping be examined and that a closer monitoring of the dumping sites should take place.  To date, the British nuclear industry have refused to monitor the site off the south-west coast of Ireland; they have not investigated fully the possibility of using land-based alternative sites and there has been no detailed environmental assessment of the effects of dumping.</P>
    <P>I am pleased at the stance taken by our Government at the London Dumping Convention.  A number of concerned and interested parties were surprised and gratified at Ireland's stand when we supported a Spanish resolution the purpose of which is to bring pressure on those countries, which are at present dumping to discontinue the practice pending the report of the expert group on the scientific implications of the dumping. Disappointingly, this resolution was not binding and the British Government still persist in their dumping operations.</P>
    <P>It is hard to obtain accurate information but I have been reliably informed that Britain commenced a new programme of nuclear waste dumping this week; that they commenced loading nuclear waste at Sharpness on the Bristol Channel on 4 July; that dumping will commence on 11 July and will be completed by 16 July; that Britain will be dumping 50 per cent more nuclear waste this year than the total amount dumped in 1982 and that they have re-converted their main dumping vessel <i>Atlantic Fisher</i> to allow nuclear waste to be disposed of directly through the hull.</P>
    <P>Debate here is often sterile and, at times, fruitless.  However, I ask the Minister to make a substantial contribution if he or any Government Department have made any approaches to Britain on this new dumping programme.  I should like to remind him that he is entitled to do so in accordance with the Paris and London conventions.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the London <Col N="2553" /> Convention.  I should like to deal now with the Paris Convention which was held recently in Berlin and which discussed the question of the dumping of nuclear waste from land-based sources.  I tabled a question in May and I was obliged, because of the backlog of answers, to seek a written reply, which I received on 30 June, dealing with the recent Paris Convention.  In his reply, the Minister said that a full report on the outcome of the Paris Convention would be circulated by the secretariat in about a month's time.  However, the Minister indicated that our representatives requested the Commission to initiate further scientific studies with the object of determining more precisely the measures to be adopted to deal with radioactive discharges. He indicated that the Commission decided to refer specific questions relating to such discharges to the Nuclear Energy Agency for further consideration. I find this decision unsatisfactory as sufficient information is available and positive action is now needed.  I was also amazed and disappointed to read in the Minister's reply that no bilateral discussions had taken place between the Irish and UK Governments on the question of dumping nuclear waste from land-based sources.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister here tonight to ask the Minister for the Environment to immediately open discussions with Britain on the overall problem.  Britain must realise that the oceans belong to everyone and must be protected from depredation. Britain no longer rules the waves and should be reminded of this.  Britain, in continuing the dumping of nuclear waste in the Atlantic and in continuing the discharge of nuclear waste from Windscale into the Irish Sea, is acting totally irresponsibly, especially in view of a report published in April 1983 called The Impact of Nuclear Waste Disposals to the Marine Environment.  That report states that most of the high-risk category people are coastal fishermen and some of the pollution affects people in Ireland and northern Europe who have no benefit from Windscale.</P>
    <P>Another report published in 1978 called The International Commission for <Col N="2554" /> Radiological Protection estimates that the 1978 discharge from Windscale led to three cancer deaths, three non-fatal cancers and, perhaps, further genetic defects.  Other estimates indicate higher fatalities.  This problem is a serious international one affecting every country, and it has not been aired adequately by this House.  I am appealing to the Minister to give a full debate to this in the new session.  However, I feel before we can resolve this problem with Britain we must also resolve our own problems concerning the disposal of toxic waste.  I know Britain is facilitating us with this at present. Until such time as we put our own house in order in relation to toxic waste I feel we have compromised and cannot take a firm stand with Britain.</P>

It was like going from Billy to Jack to try to find out which Department were prepared to deal with the problem.

    <P>I would like to state emphically that the particular issue which I raised for the fourth and now for the fifth time, is the nation's lack of preparedness to deal with an accident caused by radioactive fallout or maritime pollution.  It was not on the same line as I have been grouped in with here this evening when I have to try to make a hurried statement within six or seven minutes.  We realise that, being an island, this country is susceptible to maritime pollution.  I would like to bring to the attention of the House the fact that at present, literally within 115 miles from where we are debating this important issue tonight, is a nuclear cesspit, a nuclear discharge going on continually into the Irish Sea, which now has become the most radioactive polluted sea in Europe.  It is beyond me that we could <Col N="2555" /> devote time and energy to the pollution of our beaches earlier today and not attach significance to major contamination of this kind.</P>
    <P>I would like to put directly to the Minister tonight the action that can be taken in the case of a calamity.  We have no programme to cope with an emergency. I received a totally inadequate reply to Question No. 737 from the Minister for Defence last Tuesday in relation to a radioactive calamity in this country, admitting that the monitoring equipment is not suitable or updated to cope with the problem.  We have got to think seriously about fallout shelters.  In European countries it is obligatory that new buildings are equipped with fallout shelters which can be used as car parks.  This is the type of action which should be taken in our cities.  One accident with a ship on its way to Windscale or a dust explosion with the wind carrying nuclear activity over the country and we are inadequately able to cope with it.  The first step that should be taken is to cope with something like that.</P>
    <P>The second step is to increase public awareness to the problem.  People do not realise when they are bathing in the Irish Sea, that they are bathing in radioactive waters.  The Government should create a public awareness and educational programmes should be undertaken in schools.  We should also have an early warning system.  Our monitoring information should be adequate.  What happened in this House over the last few days is an indication of the absolute confusion in this regard.  Atmospheric discharge is controversial enough but dumping and direct pollution into the sea is a total disregard to public health.  It is very necessary that the Government take immediate steps to do something about this.  I would like, if the Chair would remind me in time so that Deputy Durkan can make his two minutes contribution.</P>
    <P>There is a nuclear dustbin on our door step where the cancer producing plutonium is being discharged right into the Irish Sea, which is a shallow sea.  There is whispering about the contamination of <Col N="2556" /> fish in the Irish Sea not to talk about the cancer effect this can have on the people. Serious accidents occurred in 1976, 1978 and 1981.  What will we do if there is an emergency?  Will we run around in confusion without any balanced programme put before the nation?  We are totally oblivious at the moment of what is actually happening in the seas around the country.  The fact that this ship is about to discharge its nuclear dumping into, I am sure the Minister will say, a designated area of the Irish Sea &mdash; we often hear that term &mdash; 500 miles off the south west coast is totally unsatisfactory, a ship which will sneak out and drop its deadly waste within the ship itself not over the side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have been notified by the Nuclear Energy Agency of the OECD that the UK authorities propose to carry out a sea-dumping operation in the North East Atlantic dumpsite in the next week or so.</P>
      <P>The disposal of all types of waste in international waters is governed by the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, drawn up at a Conference in London in 1972.  The Convention was ratified by this country in February 1982 following the enactment by the Oireachtas of the Dumping at Sea Act, 1981.  The Convention prohibits, <i>inter alia,</i> the dumping of high level radioactive wastes but permits the dumping of low level radioactive waste on stringent conditions based on recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency and subject to licensing by the competent authority of the country undertaking the dumping.</P>
      <P>The dumping of low radioactive wastes in the Atlantic Ocean is subject to further control by the provisions of a multilateral consultation and surveillance mechanism established in 1977 and operated through the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Some 18 countries, including Ireland, are participating in the mechanism to ensure that any dumping is done in a safe manner and is subject to international control and inspection.  An officer of the Irish Nuclear Energy Board acted as inspector at the dumpings in 1976, 1977, 1978 and 1982.</P>
      <P>The dumping site is 740 kilometres south-west of Mizen Head, County Cork, and is approximately equidistant from Ireland, Spain, France and Britain.  It has an average depth of 4,400 metres and is well clear of shipping lanes, undersea cables, fishing grounds and known currents which approach our coasts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The material being dumped by Britain which is of a low level of radioactivity is packaged in metal drums and concrete containers prior to the dumping operation. The quantity being dumped is greater than the amounts disposed of by <Col N="2559" /> Britain in 1982 but the amount remains well below the agreed limits adopted by the Nuclear Energy Agency.</P>
    <P>At the recent London Dumping Convention in February 1983 a resolution was adopted by the majority of the signatories to the Convention calling for a two-year moratorium on dumping to analyse the effects of dumping at sea of radioactive waste material.  Ireland supported this resolution.  Unfortunately, this resolution does not have binding effect and the UK authorities are not obliged to cease dumping operations.</P>
    <P>I would like to assure the Deputy that Ireland is opposed in principle to dumping and desires an end to this practice as soon as is practicable.  As the Deputy will appreciate, Ireland has no control over international waters.  The London Dumping Convention which I have already referred to is considered to be the most satisfactory arrangement available at present for the control of dumping in international waters.  The alternative to the present arrangements is that the UK could be free to dump its waste indiscriminately and this country would be in no position to prevent such activities except within the territorial seas of the State.  Successive Governments have been advised by our own Nuclear Energy Board on a continuing basis that studies which have been carried out by international experts have concluded that if the amounts of radioactivity currently discharged in the Atlantic remain at present levels in the future they will have no harmful effects on man or his environment.</P>
    <P>I would like to add that the UK authorities have drawn up a contingency plan in case the planned dumping operation goes wrong.  Our own Civil Defence have drawn up a programme for dealing with nuclear fallout in conjunction with the Department of Defence.  This matter was raised by Deputy Brady.  All nuclear power stations are run under extremely secure regulations governing safety matters. I am not aware of any deaths which can be attributed 100 per cent and without any doubt to a nuclear accident in Europe.</P>

      <P>I am advised that the UK authorities, that is the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment have laid down limits on the quantities of radioactivity which may be discharged.  I say this particularly in relation to Windscale in Cumbria. These limits conform with recommendations of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the requirements of the EEC Directive laying down the basic safety standards for the health of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionizing radiation.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the concentration of plutonium in sea water has decreased rapidly and is at a very low level.  I am advised by the Nuclear Energy Board that these levels are of negligible significance and are most certainly of no danger to life or the environment.</P>
      <P>I reiterate that it is important when discussing nuclear energy and matters relating to it that the debate be conducted in rational terms based on facts, not based on rumour and hysteria&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Following on the transfer of the 12-16 year-old boys to Trinity House, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin, the new secure school built and staffed by the Department of Education, arrangements have been made to use Loughan House as a centre to accommodate a considerable number of prisoners, perhaps more than 100 in due course.  The first group of prisoners was transferred there on 17 May last and 60 prisoners are now detained at the centre.</P>
      <P>Broadly speaking, those accommodated in Loughan House are young adult male prisoners considered suitable, having regard to their offence, length of sentence and so on for the more open conditions there as compared with St. Patrick's or the closed prisons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The need for the services of the domestic staff who had been employed temporarily while Loughan House was being run as a special school ceased with the change of usage (for example, domestic chores are now carried out by prisoners) and they were declared redundant.  The presence in the institution at all times of a qualified nurse was thought desirable while Loughan House was being run as a special school particularly as boys were often committed directly from the courts without having had any prior medical examination or attention.  In the present circumstances at Loughan House all prisoners transferred there will have spent some time in either Cork, Mountjoy or St. Patrick's and will have been medically screened before transfer. Appropriate counselling will, of course, <Col N="2107" /> continue to be provided.  I should like to place on record my appreciation of the contribution made by the temporary staff to Loughan House while it was a special school.</P>
    <P>The present usage of Loughan House was discussed with staff representatives on several occasions.</P>
    <P>No difficulty has been encountered in identifying prisoners suitable for transfer to Loughan.  The other open centres, Shelton Abbey and Shanganagh Castle, are fully utilised at all times.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Installing a car radio set, instead of a special motorcycle set, on a Garda motor cycle will result in a saving of approximately £450 per installation and the number of motor cycles used by the force is approximately 275.  It is proposed to install car sets on 50 motor cycles in the immediate future and to install further car sets as existing motor cycle sets need to be replaced.  Accordingly, it is expected that savings of at least £22,500 will arise in the near future and that ultimately further savings in the region of £100,000 will be realised over the next four or five years.  In addition, it is expected that the car sets will have a longer life and will require less maintenance than sets provided hitherto but it is as yet not possible to quantify savings under these headings.</P>
      <P>I might add that a number of people, each in his own way, contributed to the development of this idea which was suggested by experience in other countries. The savings are largely the result of excellent team effort on the part of personnel engaged in the Garda Radio Service.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): The review of judicial procedures is one of the matters appropriate for consideration by the Committee on Court Practice and Procedure.

As well as making litigation in these matters more locally accessible and cheaper, the aim of these changes is to simplify procedures &mdash; and thus save time &mdash; in two main ways: first, because procedures in the lower courts are less complex than High Court procedures; and secondly, by reorganising the jurisdictions of the courts so <Col N="2109" /> that several remedies, which might otherwise have required separate applications to different courts, may be taken together.</P>

      <P>The abuse of drugs appears to be a growing problem in this and other societies and this is reflected in the numbers of offenders being committed to prison who are addicted to or abuse drugs.  Prisons are not the most appropriate place for such offenders but the courts sometimes consider that imprisonment is the only choice open to them for some offenders who have a drug problem.  The treatments and programmes available to drug abusers in the prisons are being developed so far as available resources allow.  Methadone detoxification is available for drug abusers who enter prison while still physically addicted.  The services of psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers are also available to those who seek individual counselling for their addiction problem.  A weekly group therapy session is run by a psychiatrist and a psychologist in St. Patrick's Institution and a drugs information programme is run by the Probation and Welfare Service in Mountjoy women's prison.  In Mountjoy men's prison a special temporary release programme is in operation for drug abusers who appear to be capable of benefiting from it.  Under it offenders are allowed temporary release under supervision and are helped to keep themselves drug-free in the community.</P>
      <P>A research survey on drug abusers in Mountjoy Prison and St. Patrick's Institution has been conducted jointly by the Probation and Welfare Service and the Psychological Service of my Department. A report on the survey has been published recently.</P>
      <P>I might add that the provision and designation of custodial treatment centres to which drug abusers might be committed by the courts under section 28 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1977, are not matters for the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 to 53 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>May I emphasise at the outset that while the number or strength of the drug squads is of course a relevant factor, it is misleading to speak or think of the drug squads as the primary arm of the Garda Síochána in their dealings with drug offences.  The drug squads are support units but all members of the force have a role to play in dealing with drug offences as part of their ordinary Garda <Col N="2119" /> duties and a large number have been specially trained in the more difficult or complex investigation of drug abuse.</P>
    <P>The allocation of Garda manpower to specialised units like the drug squads is a matter for decision by the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs and having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.  I am informed that on 1 November 1982, two inspectors, eight sergeants and 36 gardaí were engaged full time in the prevention and control of drug abuse and the corresponding strength on 1 June 1983 was two inspectors, eight sergeants and 36 gardaí.  The current operational strength of the permanent units of the drug squads is forty-four and the Garda authorities say that this strength is considered reasonable having regard to the number of members throughout the force who have been and are being given intensive training in the detection and prevention of drug abuse, and the fact that all members of the force have a responsibility in the matter as part of their general duties.  The situation is, however, kept under constant review and the tactical approach may be changed from time to time.</P>
    <P>Following a recent review of resources aimed at making better use of existing manpower, the drug squad unit based at Dublin Castle and the operational drug unit formerly based at Garda headquarters have been amalgamated under the control of a detective superintendent at Dublin Castle, who also has responsibility for the serious crime squad and it is intended that the amalgamated drug unit and the serious crime squad will in future work more closely together in a combined effort to combat drug offences and other drug-related serious crime.</P>
    <P>As I have indicated already the fact that the strength of the drug squad is not being increased does not mean that additional Garda resources are not being made available to tackle the drug problem. Drug abuse is included as part of the standard induction training of every member of the force and all members are regarded as preventive officers in this respect.  Furthermore, for the past two <Col N="2120" /> years an intensive training programme has been in operation in the force to ensure that each Garda division has a substantial number of members specially trained in the prevention and detection of drug abuse and working in close co-operation with the drug squads.  Already a total of approximately 850 members have completed this training course.</P>
    <P>Members of the Garda Síochána do not attend drugs training courses under the Health Education Bureau; the Garda authorities operate their own training programme which is structured to meet Garda needs.</P>
    <P>I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise that, while the Garda clearly have a substantial role to play in controlling drug abuse, the problem is in large measure a social one, an effective approach to which depends on the co-operation of a variety of interests including parents, educational authorities, the health and social services and the general public.  Deputies will be aware that a Special Task Force on Drug Abuse under the chairmanship of the Minister for Health, which was established by the Government at the end of April, has been reviewing the drugs situation with particular reference to the inner city area of Dublin.</P>

      <P>The taking of such precautions as may be possible to minimise the risk of loss of life is primarily a matter within the competence of the Garda force itself.  I have been informed by the Commissioner that such matters are kept under constant review but that he would not consider it helpful or appropriate to disclose any details of steps that might be taken from time to time to ensure the safety of members of the force.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The latest figures available relate to the year 1982.  In that year in the Dublin city and county areas, two Garda vehicles were the subject of unauthorised taking, although none was stolen in the legal sense.  429 vehicles, including one of the two taken, were destroyed or damaged.  Of these 429 vehicles, 311 were destroyed or damaged as a result of traffic accidents, and 118 as a result of malicious damage, including 57 arising from ramming incidents.</P>
      <P>The cost of repairing or replacing 427 of the vehicles, including 117 cases of malicious damage, amounted to £186,000 approximately.  The cost of repairing or replacing the remaining two has not yet been finalised.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> It is a matter for the President of the High Court to arrange for the distribution of the business of the High Court, including family law business, among the judges assigned to it.  As far as the Circuit Court and the District Court are concerned it is a matter for the Presidents of these courts to arrange for the distribution of business in Dublin among judges and justices.</P>
      <P>Outside Dublin specific distribution of family law business does not arise since family law cases are dealt with by the locally assigned judges and justices as part of the normal performance of their judicial functions.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, only in Dublin would it be open to the Presidents to assign business in a way which would involve particular judges or justices dealing exclusively with family law cases.  The present position as I understand it, is that one High Court Judge and one Justice of the District Court are engaged full-time on family law business and one High Court judge is engaged on a part-time basis.  The practice is to rotate the work among available judges and justices.  In the Circuit Court, so far, family law cases do not call for the employment of a judge on a full-time basis and the President conducts the business himself on a part-time basis.</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in view of the impending importation, a number of special measures were taken on that day.  Based on previous experience, the gardaí had no reason to expect that any protest at the importation in question would be other than peaceful or that large numbers would be involved. In the event about 400 persons took part in an angry protest which included the destruction of potatoes.  The Garda considered that it would have been highly dangerous to attempt to remove protesters forcibly having regard to the particular circumstances.  They also considered that the sending in of a large force of gardaí would not have been a solution to the problem.</P>

An Examiner of Titles has been redeployed from other work to deal with applications of the kind referred to and the procedures followed have been improved to enable cases to be dealt with more quickly.</P>
      <P>However, it must be accepted that, irrespective of any staffing problems, section 49 applications are likely to take some time.  They represent about 4 per cent of the total number of applications for registration dealt with annually by the Land Registry.  Relating as they do to applications for title based on possession, they are usually complex cases which involve detailed examination of title, necessitating extensive correspondence and the issue of statutory notices to interested parties, with the result that registration cannot be effected quickly.  One cause of delay has been the incompleteness of the information supplied in some cases by solicitors.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 to 69, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position is that use of the courtroom in Cavan Courthouse was discontinued in October 1982 because of concern about the condition of the ceiling, and arrangements were made to hold sittings of the District Court in the Protestant Hall, Farnham Street, Cavan, and to transfer sittings of the Circuit Court and of the High Court on Circuit, due to be held at Cavan Courthouse, to the Courthouse, Bailieboro.  Cavan County Council commissioned consultant architects to carry out a detailed survey of the courthouse roof, which was thought to be <Col N="2129" /> defective, and to recommend remedial action.  The consultants established that wet rot is rampant in the roof timbers and ceiling laths and they recommended some temporary safety measures to be effected until such time as they could formulate their final report.  I understand that the county council has carried out all the recommended safety measures and are satisfied that these will be effective.</P>
    <P>The consultants' final report will not be available for a further month or so as they are currently investigating the position regarding wet and dry rot elsewhere in the structure of the building.  Until that report becomes available it will not be possible to say exactly what repairs will be required, how long it will take to carry them out or the likely cost but I understand that preliminary estimates suggest that a sum in the region of £720,000 will be involved.</P>
    <P>Since the county council appear to be dealing with the problem in a competent and responsible manner the question of issuing directions to them does not arise.</P>
    <P>With regard to jury service I accept that there may be undue hardship involved for persons residing in certain areas of County Cavan who are summoned to jury service at Bailieboro, following the temporary abandonment of Cavan Courthouse as a Circuit Court venue.  However, section 5 (2) of the Juries Act, 1976, provides that the Minister for Justice may by order divide a county into two or more jury districts or limit a jury district to a part or parts of a county and I am considering the making of an order which would meet the situation which now exists in County Cavan. I would hope that the order will be in force before jurors are summoned for the next sittings of the Circuit Court in Bailieboro, which are due in October.</P>

Under the Solicitors' Acts, 1954-1960, all disciplinary powers in relation to solicitors are vested in the Incorporated Law Society and the High Court.</P>
      <P>In so far as the reported statement raises a general question as to the circumstances in which accused persons are granted legal aid, I am having the position examined to see what changes may be needed in the present arrangements for providing legal aid under the Criminal Justice (Legal Aid) Act, 1962 and the regulations under it.</P>

The cost of providing this particular service is not separately compiled.  It would be extremely difficult and time-consuming to establish the cost of such escorts over the past ten years and it would be wasteful of scarce Garda resources to attempt to do so.</P>
      <P>The Government decided some years ago that certain large movements of cash should have the benefit of a Garda/Army escort to prevent such sums of money falling into the hands of subversives and well-organised criminal elements.  This service was not sought by banks or other financial institutions; it was imposed by the Government in the public interest. Moreover many of these large cash movements include substantial sums of cash consignments for post offices for the payment of a variety of social welfare benefits. This is often the case even when the moneys are being moved from one bank premises to another.  The cost of the Garda of providing this latter service was separately compiled for the years 1979 and 1981.  The figures were £326,000 and £363,000 respectively.</P>

The abuse of &ldquo;hard&rdquo; drugs has not come to the notice of the Garda in the area.</P>

      <P>Candidates for the grants must be first-time job seekers who are registered with the National Manpower Service and must not be more than 25 years of age.  If successful, they are awarded grants to cover the cost of maintenance and tuition fees.</P>

      <P>The amount to be recouped from the Social Fund includes the cost of grants to individual students who attend the specified courses.

    <P>2.  Applicants may be required to take a suitability test and to attend an interview.</P>
    <P>Suitability tests will be held in September unless otherwise notified.  Applicants required to undertake this test will be notified during the week preceding the testing.  Those applicants who are successful in the test will be called to interview. Programmes will, in most instances, commence Monday 22nd September.</P>
    <P>3.  Applicants may only apply to the institution concerned for the programmes proposed by that institution. (Please refer to the appropriate newspaper advertisement).  While every effort will be made to run the programmes advertised, circumstances may arise which will not permit the running of some of the proposed programmes.</P>
    <P>4.  Applicants must complete:</P>
    <P>(a)  The National Manpower Service Job Seekers Card.</P>
    <P>(b)  The Application Form for the Special Training Programmes.</P>
    <P>(c)  Any documents or forms required by the individual college.</P>
    <P>(a) and (b) will be used for selection purposes only.</P>
    <P>5.  In the event of the Leaving Certificate 1982 results not being published in sufficient time to allow applicants to meet the closing date for applications, applicants awaiting those results should return the Job Seekers Card by the closing date and the application form immediately after the Leaving Certificate results have been obtained.</P>
    <P>6.  Trainees will not be required to pay tuition fees.  A flat rate grant of £27.77 per week will be paid only during attendance at the institution (including Christmas and Easter breaks).  For one year courses the grant will be for 36 weeks and <Col N="2141" /> for two year courses for 36 weeks in each of the two years.</P>
    <P>7.  Grants will only be awarded at the start of a one- or two-year course, and not later than four weeks from the commencement of the course.</P>
    <P>8.  Trainees will be responsible for arranging their own accommodation etc. The authorities of the institution running the programmes will, however, assist where possible.  There is no special or separate grant for board, lodgings, travel etc.</P>
    <P>9.  Trainees will be subject to the normal disciplines of the institutions running the programmes and must provide themselves with such text books, equipment, etc. as required and to pay such deposits or bonds as may be required by the authorities of the institution.</P>
    <P>10.  Trainees who are unpunctual or irregular in their attendance will have their grants reduced.  A grant may be discontinued in the case of a trainee whose record in this regard is deemed unsatisfactory.  A grant may not be paid for a period of absence from training due to illness.</P>
    <P>11.  Trainees will be required to undergo such tests as may be required from time to time.  Trainees who do not show sufficient progress in their training may be dismissed from the programme.</P>
    <P>12.  Trainees who successfully complete the programme will be awarded appropriate certificates.</P>

In this connection I would draw attention to the pilot study by the NCEA of wastage rates in full-time national certificate courses.</P>

      <P>The preparatory work necessary for the introduction of full-scale oral tests in modern languages as an essential part of the leaving certificate examination had not reached the stage where it would be feasible to hold such tests in 1985.  I have, however, instructed my Department to undertake the necessary preparations as a matter of urgency so that oral tests can be introduced as soon as possible.  In the meantime I have had revised syllabi incorporating listening comprehension tests introduced in modern languages for examination in 1985 as a step towards the introduction of full oral tests.</P>
      <P>While the question of financial outlay has always to be borne in mind, there were other considerations which, as I have indicated, irrespective of financial cost, precluded the introduction of full scale oral tests in 1985.</P>

      <P>The subsidy in question was a general subsidy which enabled pupils who would not be eligible for transport under the school transport schemes to travel on CIE scheduled services at less than the normal child's fare while making their way to and from school.  It was necessary to withdraw the subsidy as part of the measures required to make up the short-fall in the funds available to operate the school transport service in 1983.</P>

The information requested in relation to numbers of applications for house improvement grants rejected because of the applicants' failure to comply with the prior inspection requirement is not readily available in my Department.  Records of rejected applications are not segregated on the basis of the grounds for rejection and, with the available staff resources, it would not be possible to have this information extracted without seriously affecting the processing of day-to-day work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prior inspection requirement is an integral part of the scheme and cannot be dispensed with in an individual case irrespective of the circumstances.  The <Col N="2183" /> requirement was widely publicised in the media on the introduction of the scheme and is prominently adverted to in the explanatory leaflet made available to anybody interested in the scheme.</P>

      <P>Responsibility for the operation and the on-going review of the Housing Finance Agency Scheme rests in the first instance with the board of the agency. Following a review by the board of the agency, a number of changes in the scheme were introduced by the agency, the main one being an increase in the income eligibility limit from £9,000 to £10,000 for applications received on or after 6 April 1983.  Since its inception in March 1982, the scheme has proved very popular with house purchasers many of whom have been attracted by the income-related repayments and the opportunity to obtain a loan of up to 90 per cent of the value of a house.</P>
      <P>Some 2,249 loans were approved in 1982 and a further 1,246 in the first five months of this year.  A total of 773 loans valued £15.6 million were paid in 1982 and a further 1,077 loans valued £20.6 million have been paid by 31 May this year.  The agency's allocation for 1983 is £50 million which is expected to fund up to 2,500 house loans.</P>
      <P>On the evidence of the agency's bond issues to date, it is apparent that it has succeeded in tapping an important new source of finance for house purchasers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The amount of grant payable by a housing authority under the disabled persons grants scheme can be up to two-thirds of the approved cost of the work but in practice local authorities generally base the amounts of their grants on the level of recoupment by the Department. The latter, which was fixed at £1,200 in 1977, was revised to £2,000 in April 1981. In practice this ensures that a maximum grant of not less than £4,000 is available to an applicant under the scheme.  A housing authority is empowered to pay up to the full approved cost in respect of works to a local authority dwelling.</P>
      <P>A revision of the present level of recoupment is not contemplated at present. The grants payable under the disabled persons scheme are more favourable than those under the normal house improvement grants scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme for the removal of slurry from the Lough Sheelin catchment area will continue during 1983 and a provision of £50,000 has been made in my Department's estimates for the purpose on the basis of an average rate of subsidy of £1.50 per 1,000 gallons of slurry.</P>
      <P>I understand that the operation of the subsidy scheme has brought about a major improvement in the quality of the lake water.  This serves to underline, if there was any doubt about it, the direct link between the previous deterioration in the lake quality and the disposal of slurry in the catchment area.  It is the responsibility of the slurry producers to see to the proper disposal of the waste and the public cannot be expected to subsidise the cost of this indefinitely.  The polluter pays principle should apply to agricultural waste no less than in other sectors of economic activity.  It is, therefore, proposed that State involvement in the scheme should be phased out and Cavan County Council and the relevant farming and fishing interests have been so informed.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of Regulation No. 1820/80, which governs the implementation of the western package, assistance amounting to £19 million approximately over a ten-year period is available towards the cost of improving farm roads and agricultural roads.  In accordance with a programme submitted by the Government to the EEC and approved by that body, approximately £0.78 million annually is available for farm roads and £0.72 million for county roads used mainly for agriculture and forestry.  A further £0.4 million is available for on-farm and forestry roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To fulfil this programme the local improvements scheme was adapted in 1981 under which the benefiting counties are required to spend specific sums on eligible farm road projects.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 231 and 274 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the existence of the report referred to and understand that it suggested that vegetables grown in a number of areas in the United Kingdom were contaminated by lead pollution from vehicle exhausts.  Responsibility for monitoring the levels of lead in vegetables rests under the Health (Arsenic and Lead in Food) Regulations, 1972, with my colleague, the Minister for Health.  I understand from his Department that samples of vegetables are taken regularly by personnel of the health boards for the purposes of ensuring compliance with the regulations and that none of these have revealed levels of lead in vegetables being sold for human consumption in excess of the levels permitted in the Regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of the recent decision of the British Government in regard to the level of lead in petrol.  This matter is <Col N="2194" /> regulated by an EEC Directive of 29 June 1978 with which this country fully complies. The development of Community policy in this area was discussed at a Council of Environment Ministers held in Luxembourg on 16 June.  At that meeting I indicated that on environmental and health grounds Ireland welcomed any initiative designed ultimately to achieve the total elimination of lead from petrol sold in the Community.  I stated that I recognised the importance of developing Community policy on a matter which has undoubtedly become a source of major public disquiet and that I was happy to support in principle a policy of lead free petrol.  In line with this I assured my colleagues that Ireland would adopt a positive attitude towards detailed proposals which would take into account, in a realistic way, the technical and economic implications of such a policy.</P>
    <P>I further stated that as Ireland has relatively little involvement in the design and manufacture of motor vehicles, and as over 60 per cent of our petrol is at present imported, any major changes in policy on lead in petrol in this country would be affected substantially by developments in other countries.  I also noted that the practical realities of the situation were that it would take a considerable time for the motor industry, the oil industry and petrol retailers, as well as the ordinary motorist, to adapt to a situation where only unleaded petrol could be used.</P>
    <P>The Council of Environment Ministers agreed that all member states would try to reduce as much as possible the amount of lead used in petrol, ending up perhaps with the use of unleaded petrol, and it asked the Commission to submit appropriate proposals for this purpose.  The Council will be examining an interim report on the matter at its next meeting with a view to detailed examination of the Commission's proposals which are to be presented around mid-April 1984.</P>

    <P>While the Exchequer does not contribute directly to the costs of maintenance of main and county roads, it influences to a large degree the level of the annual programme of works through the agricultural grant and the domestic rate relief grant.  The extra £31.5 million provided for these grants compared with the provision made by the previous administration <Col N="2199" /> as recently as last November will certainly improve the state of local finances and allow them a much wider range of discretionary expenditure.

      <P>The block grant allows county councils a wide discretion in the determination of their annual programme of works on main and country roads.  It replaced four separate grants and initially it was related to the total of those grants which in turn had been determined, <i>inter <Col N="2205" /> alia</i>, by the open ended discretionary expenditure of councils on the maintenance of main roads.  The grants in any year are determined primarily by the total Exchequer provision for roads purposes and to the relative needs and the overall level of activity in each area.</P>

      <P>A certificate of competency was issued on 8 September 1981 to a person having a similar surname but an address different to that mentioned in the question. This certificate, together with a current provisional licence, would have allowed an application by the person for a full driving licence until 8 March 1983. The person's provisional licence expired on 23 August 1982 and the relevant licensing authority, Wexford County Council, have no record of an application either for a further provisional or a full driving licence.  The certificate of competency would therefore have ceased to be valid on 8 March 1983.  There is no record in my Department of the loss of the certificate being reported during the period of its validity or of a duplicate being requested.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 260 and 261 together.  Subject to what <Col N="2208" /> follows, I will note these suggestions for consideration in the examination of this whole area which the Government are now carrying out.</P>
      <P>The concept of felony is not appropriate to modern legislation.  The present maximum penalty under the Road Traffic Acts for unauthorised taking of a mechanically propelled vehicle stands at a £50 fine and/or six months imprisonment. This penalty is already substantial in its custodial aspect, although higher penalties exist for some other summary offences.  Dangerous driving can be associated with the offence of taking a vehicle without authority.  Where such driving causes death or serious bodily harm to another person, these Acts already provide for a maximum penalty, on indictment, of a fine of £500 and/or five years penal servitude.</P>
      <P>The concept of public place is widely defined in these Acts so as to include any place to which the public have access with vehicles whether as of right or by permission. It would not be appropriate for road traffic legislation to regulate beyond this sphere.</P>
      <P>As to interference with vehicles, section 113 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, already makes it an offence to interfere with the mechanism of a mechanically propelled vehicle or to attempt to get into the vehicle while it is stationary in a public place.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>The local improvements scheme partly replaced schemes of grants provided for under the former Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote from which the &ldquo;western&rdquo; counties benefited the most.  Accordingly, it has been the practice down the years to allocate the major share of funds available under the local improvements scheme to these counties.  Since 1981, when the scheme was adapted to take account of EEC aid available under the western package for farm road projects, it has been considered desirable to ensure that sufficient funds are devoted to eligible farm road projects in the &ldquo;western&rdquo; counties so that the EEC aid is fully taken up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subject to the foregoing considerations, and within the limits of the annual Vote provision for the scheme, the allocations to county councils are generally <Col N="2210" /> decided on the basis of a broad assessment of needs and the extent of dependence on the scheme over the years.</P>

The Department subsequently became aware that information given earlier by the applicant about the source of his mortgage was not correct and that he had previously received a low rise mortgage from Dublin County Council.  Persons who received low rise mortgages are not entitled to mortgage subsidy because this would represent a double subsidy on a mortgage.  The applicant was informed accordingly and asked to refund the amount that had already been paid.  If the applicant contacts my Department, sympathetic consideration will be given to accepting a refund in instalments if it is considered that the immediate repayment <Col N="2213" /> of the full amount would cause unnecessary hardship.</P>

      <P>This year's road grant allocation of £25.5 million for maintenance of roads generally represents an increase of 18.6 per cent relative to 1982.  The extra £31.5 million provided in rates support grants compared with the provision made by the previous administration last November has allowed local authorities a wider range of discertionaly expenditure.  The Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No.2) Bill, 1983 will also give local authorities power to raise additional revenues. The authorities will, I am sure, direct a fair share of this finance to the maintenance of regional and county roads.</P>

The decision to close the cross-Border roads to County Leitrim including Kiltyclogher was taken by the British authorities on the basis of security considerations as they saw them and the roads can only be reopened with their agreement.  My Department recently raised the question of reopening the roads to County Leitrim with the British authorities but their position is that for the present these roads will remain closed.</P>
      <P>While the decision whether or not to reopen the roads is ultimately a matter for the British authorities, I will keep the matter under continuous review and will impress upon them the need to have roads reopened as soon as security considerations allow.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are committed to the implementation of the Erne catchment area study and the relevant Government Departments have been requested to act on the recommendations contained in the study as far as is possible within available resources.  The following measures have been taken with a view to implementing the study's recommendations:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report recommended that a number of manual telephone exchanges be converted to automatic working.  All exchanges named in the report have been <Col N="2224" /> converted except for Clones, which will not be converted until 1984.</P>
    <P>Direct dialling facilities from Northern Ireland to the Republic became available on 29 September 1982.  Direct dialling from the &ldquo;01&rdquo; area to Northern Ireland came into operation on 5 November 1982 and this facility was extended to automatic subscribers outside the &ldquo;01&rdquo; area on 21 December 1982.</P>
    <P>The ESB are at present constructing a smolt-rearing station on the River Erne at Cathleens Falls.  The purpose of this station is to produce smolts for restocking the River Erne and other border rivers. The hatchery is nearing completion.  In the meantime salmon stock are being reared in temporary accommodation and it is expected that the first smolts from eggs laid down in 1981 will be released this year.</P>
    <P>As regards the study's recommendations in respect of arterial drainage, because of the extent of the commitments of the Office of Public Works in the light of the resources available, it has not been possible to make any further progress on this and it is likely that this position will continue for some time.  The Office of Public Works' current programme of drainage in the border areas comprises the design of schemes for the Finn/Lacky rivers (a sub-catchment of the Erne) and the Ulster/Monaghan Blackwaters, jointly with the Northern Ireland Drainage Division.  As regards work on the Ballinamore/Ballyconnell canal, hydrometric data are being collected on a continuing basis and an investigation of the types of clay along the waterway and the feasibility of dredging and maintaining a channel through a number of the lakes has been initiated.</P>
    <P>Regarding the improvement of tourism facilities, grants have been provided as follows: in County Leitrim, a grant was approved for bedroom improvements in one hotel, ten grants for supplementary holiday accommodation, and a grant for self-catering facilities at Carrick-on-Shannon. In County Cavan, one hotel was grant-aided in 1981 and ten grants were provided for supplementary holiday accommodation.  There is also a proposal to construct self-catering holiday chalets <Col N="2225" /> in Killykeen Forest Park.  Design plans for this development have been drawn up by the Office of Public Works which has been commissioned by the Forest and Wildlife Service to carry out this operation. In County Monaghan, bedroom improvements were carried out at one hotel in 1981 and three grants for holiday accommodation were also approved.</P>
    <P>Meetings were held on a regular basis during 1981 between the Northern Ireland Tourist Board and Bord Fáilte with a view to improving co-ordination between the bodies and for discussion of matters of mutual interest.  Arising out of these meetings, two cross-Border tourist brochures were produced, and a third co-operative brochure &ldquo;The Lakelands/Fermanagh&rdquo; is due to be published shortly.  In 1981, access to the Annalee River was improved and Navigation Markers were erected on the River Erne. At Brackley Lake, Bawnboy, Turbet Island, Belturbet, Carrick Bridge, Lisanagh and Dernaferst, picnic sites, parking areas and footpaths were provided and access was improved.  Coarse angling facilities were improved at Lough Oughter.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of road improvements, in 1981, £360,000 was allocated from the Special Border Areas Programme Fund to the five local authorities for the improvement of minor tourist roads.  In 1982, the allocation came to £475,000.</P>
    <P>Road works proposed in 1983 with the aid of state grants provided for a further phase of the improvement of the N3 from Virginia towards Cavan and for works on the N55 between Longford County Boundary and Ballinagh, and for works in the vicinity of Butlersbridge.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;Associate&rdquo; status or &ldquo;Observer&rdquo; status as it is known in the movement, is often a preliminary to full membership and would not be appropriate for a developed Western State.  Moreover, I am not convinced that membership of the NAM would serve to re-emphasise this country's commitment to neutrality, as suggested by the Deputy: amongst the members of the Non-Aligned Movement are many states which are not in any real sense neutral as between the two great power blocs.  None of the Western European neutral states is a member or observer of the Non-Aligned Movement.</P>

When this had been obtained I instructed our Ambassador in London, to make known our views on what Mr. Heseltine had said at a high level in the British Foreign Office.</P>
      <P>The Ambassador met the Permanent Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign Office during the afternoon of 5 May and pointed out that Mr. Heseltine's remarks had caused resentment on the part of public opinion here and that they were unhelpful and unwise in the context of Anglo-Irish relations.  The Ambassador pointed out that friendly States do not normally criticise each other's national security or defence policies and that the fact that Mr. Heseltine had made his remarks during a visit to Northern Ireland would cause particular unease in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that the British Government are fully aware of our view that the remarks of the British Secretary of State for Defence were objectionable in that they related to an issue which falls exclusively within Irish sovereignty.  In this connection it is worth referring to Mr. Prior's remarks of 6 May during a television interview when he said that the <Col N="2231" /> British Government understands and respects Ireland's neutrality.</P>

      <P>The Anglo-Irish Joint Studies were commissioned at a meeting which the then Taoiseach had in December 1980 with the British Prime Minister. These studies were prepared in five board areas which covered institutional structures, citizenship, economic co-operation, measures to encourage mutual understanding, and security.  The studies were completed by senior officials of the two Governments and were published on 11 November 1981 following a meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister on 6 November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Both Governments subsequently agreed that the recommendations in the Joint Studies should be the basis for a programme of co-operation to be undertaken under the ageis of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council established at the Anglo-Irish Summit of 6 November 1981.  The implementation of such a programme is, of course, dependent to a very great extent on the existence of good relations between the two Governments concerned.  Since this Government came into office there have been four meetings at Ministerial level of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Council.  The subjects discussed have included Anglo-Irish relations, the question of supplying Kinsale gas to Northern Ireland and the promotion of the Irish and Welsh languages. <Col N="2234" /> There have been no official-level meetings of the council in the same period, although one will now take place in the near future.</P>

      <P>From the time that this company went into receivership the IDA have been continuously endeavouring, in conjunction with the receiver, to find a suitable purchaser for the assets so that production and employment could be resumed.  To that end, discussions took place with two separate groups.  In that event, however, neither of these groups, for reasons beyond their control and that of the IDA, were able to maintain their interest in acquiring the assets.  A third group of potential purchasers have recently been contacted and, in this case, it is expected that detailed discussions will take place shortly.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to indicate the number of jobs likely to be lost in firms currently supplying and servicing the motor industry if assembly ceases at the end of 1984.</P>
      <P>Very few firms are engaged solely in supplying the Irish motor assembly industry on an original equipment basis.  They also cater for the large replacement market. The vast majority of these engaged in the motor components sector are employed in firms which are export oriented and are unlikely to be materially affected by any cessation of motor assembly here.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, it is not possible to say at this stage whether all the firms at present engaged in motor vehicle assembly will continue until the end of 1984, or, indeed, whether all existing assembly will cease at that date.  Firms currently assembling and who cease operations before the end of 1984 will be required to provide alternatives to assembly in order to continue to qualify for facilities to import fully built up vehicles.</P>
      <P>These alternative arrangements could involve additional purchases from Irish sources which would possibly create additional employment in this sector or at least maintain jobs at the present level.</P>

      <P>Up to 16 June 1983 a total of 71 hydrocarbon exploration wells had been drilled in the Irish offshore.  Three other wells are currently being drilled. Our only discovery to date which has <Col N="2244" /> proved commercial is the Kinsale Head Gas Field.  The field was discovered in 1971 and declared commercial in 1973. Production from the field commenced in 1978 and total recoverable reserves are estimated at 1.353 trillion cubic feet.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Shows&rdquo; or &ldquo;flows&rdquo; of hydrocarbons have been recorded in a large proportion of the other wells.  Of most significance are those wells which have actually flowed oil or gas on test.  These are as follows:</P>
      <P>A well drilled in the Celtic Sea on block 49/13 in 1974 flow tested gas at a daily rate of 119 thousand cubic feet.  A further well on the same structure in block 49/14 in 1975 flow tested gas at a rate of 8.81 million cubic feet per day.  A well drilled on block 48/24 also in the Celtic Sea, in 1974 flowed 780 barrels of oil per day on test and up to 10 million cubic feet of gas per day.  A second well, on the same structure in 1974 flowed oil on test at a rate of 1,550 barrels per day and gas at a rate of 566 thousand cubic feet per day.</P>
      <P>Neither of the accumulations identified in these two structures are considered capable of sustaining commercial production at the present time.  However, the situation is being kept under review within my Department in the light of changes of a technical or economic nature which might alter this.  Of the 21 wells drilled to date in the Porcupine Basin 4 have flowed hydrocarbons on test as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>730 barrels per day from a well drilled in block 35/8 in 1978; 5,589 barrels per day from a well drilled in block 26/28 in 1979; 1,490 barrels per day from a well drilled in 1980 &mdash; also in block 26/28 and 925 barrels per day and 4.8 million cubic feet of gas per day from a second well drilled on block 35/8, in 1981.  The structure identified on block 26/28 has proved to be extremely complex and two further wells drilled there in 1981 found no significant amounts of hydrocarbons. A sophisticated three dimensional seismic survey was shot over block 26/28 in 1982 and the results of this survey, when evaluated, will assist in <Col N="2245" /> determining the location of the next well to be drilled on the block.</P>
    <P>As regards block 35/8 in the Porcupine, further work, including further drilling, will be necessary to determine whether hydrocarbons are present in commercial quantities on this block.  With regard to future prospects, it will be appreciated that it is not possible to speak with any degree of certainly about the possibility of a further commercial discovery until drilling operations have actually identified sufficiently large accumulations of hydrocarbons.  However, the results to date have proved that hydrocarbons do exist in significant quantities in our offshore. We can also take encouragement from the number of wells which have flowed hydrocarbons on test.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, in practice, the most improtant measure of Irish offshore prospects is the willingness of the oil companies to continue to commit funds to exploration here.  In this respect I am very encouraged by the number of oil companies that have taken up acreage in the Celtic Sea. This would indicate that the companies share our own assessment of the area as one of considerable potential.  I am also very pleased that, despite the recent fall in oil prices which has tended to make deepwater areas less attractive, interest in the Porcupine is continuing with four blocks there having been licensed in the Second Round.  Exploration work is also continuing in relation to the Kish, the Fastnet, the Goban Spur and the Slyne Trough.  The number of wells that will be drilled this year together with the level of activity we expect over the next two years should bring us much further in establishing whether additional commercial accumulations of hydrocarbons are present in our offshore.  It is this vital factor of potential commerciality which will determine the long-term prospects for exploration in our offshore areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, the reform of Dáil procedures is an ongoing process.  Progress must be based on worthwhile and viable proposals and <Col N="2250" /> the achievement of consensus in the House on their implementation.  The initial stage of this process took place here in January and February last in the form of a valuable debate on the issue of Dáil reform.</P>
      <P>One of the priorities for reform of Dail procedures specified in the <i>Programme for Government</i> is the extension of our committee system.  As the Deputy will be aware, on 27 May 1983, I announced the first phase of our committee proposals, which essentially involved the re-establishment of five Oireachtas Committees. The second phase in the extension of our committee system was intiated on 21 June 1983 involving the establishment of five completely new Oireachtas Committees.  Of these new committees, the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure has been formally established. Orders establishing the Joint Committee on Legislation and the Joint Committee on small Business were made in the Dáil on 6 July 1983 and motions for similar orders are on today's Seanad Order Paper.  The expediency motions for the remaining two committees (the Joint Committe on Marriage Breakdown and the Joint Committee on Women's Rights) have now been passed by both Houses and motions to establish them appear on today's Dáil Order Paper.</P>
      <P>Two of the new committees, the Public Expenditure and Legislation Committees will, through the medium of public hearings, considerably enhance the perception of the role of the Dáil and Deputies in general and committee work in particular. An open mandate will be given to the Dáil Committee on Public Expenditure to investigate any area of ongoing public expenditure and to recommend cost effective alternatives consistent with Government policy.  The Legislation Committee will, in addition to its primary function of producing a written record of public opinion on Bills or legislative proposals referred to it, also examine the operations of non-commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another priority in the <i>Programme for Government</i> is the reform of procedures for dealing with Estimates in the House. <Col N="2251" /> I am preparing detailed proposals in this area which will, hopefully, lead to a more meaningful debate of Estimates as they come before the House.  I have in mind that the new format of debate will be implemented initially on an experimental basis but it is of course essential that the new format incorporates a revised financial procedure whereby Estimates are debated in this House before, rather than after, the moneys involved are committed or spent.</P>
    <P>In so far as broadcasting of the proceedings of the Oireachtas is concerned, I recently discussed this matter with the Director General of RTE and raised it at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges. It is my intention that work of the new committees should be broadcast in addition to some of the plenary sessions of the Dáil.</P>
    <P>In addition to this, I and the Government Chief Whip, have jointly tabled for discussion at the Committee on Procedure and Privileges a number of procedural reforms which are the subject of ongoing discussions.</P>
    <P>I believe that the measures that I have outlined in the areas of Estimates, public expenditure, legislations, as well as the various procedural items which are before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, represent significant initial progress in dealing with the various concerns which have been expressed by Deputies regarding existing procedures in this House.  I should emphasise, however, that if the Deputy, or indeed any other Deputies in the House, wishes to make further suggestions to me in this area, I will be very pleased to receive them.</P>

      <P>I am concerned that there is overcapacity and that this may not be taken up increased demand for some time.  The contribution which this excess capacity makes to the present high price of electricity is also a matter of serious concern to me.  This factor was one of the reasons why I recently announced the <Col N="2253" /> established of an inquiry into electricity prices.</P>
      <P>While the inquiry will propose its own detailed terms of reference I would envisage that the excess generating capacity of the ESB will be one of the areas which it will examine.  The inquiry will make a report to me within six months of its commencement.</P>
      <P>In relation to new capacity, I am at present examining the case for continuing or deferring part of the 900 Megawatt station which is being constructed at Moneypoint, County Clare.</P>
      <P>The ESB itself is taking steps to reduce its excess capacity.  By the end of this year the board will have decommissioned over 600 MW of old inefficient oil fired plant.</P>
      <P>I should point out that in addition to the generating required to meet peak demand, every electricity utility must have additional capacity in order to provide for sudden breakdowns and for maintenance of plant.  The level of this necessary additional plant can vary from one utility to another depending on interconnection with other utilities, size of individual stations, size of electricity system etc.  It is only when the level of necssary additional plant has been determined that the excess capacity can be quantified.  I would hope that the prices inquiry will be able to propose a norm for the ESB's necessary additional capacity.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the London Convention preclude the dumping of materials clarified as radioactive wastes in shallow waters such as those of the Irish Sea.  It is also highly unlikely that any such dumpings could take place without our knowledge.  There are, however, discharges of low level radioactive effluents to the north-east Irish Sea from the Windscale Works in Cumbria.  These discharges are controlled within limits laid down by the relevant United Kingdom authorities, namely the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of the Environment.  These <Col N="2257" /> limits conform to the recommendation of the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the standards established by a Directive of the European Community.</P>
      <P>The Nuclear Energy Board, with assistance from the Department of Fisheries, undertake an on-going monitoring programme designed to provide information on the distribution of radioactivity in the Irish Sea and on possible exposure of members of the Irish public.

The radioactivity concentrations of seaweeds, sediments and seawater are of no radiological significance.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 371 and 372 together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Youth Employment Agency were unable to accede to the request from the National Executive Council of the Community Games for grant assistance because the proposal did not constitute a scheme to provide employment-related skills or services to young people entering, or in, the labour market.  The statutory objects of the agency, as laid down in the Youth Employment Agency Act, 1981, are to establish, develop, extend, operate, assist, encourage, supervise, co-ordinate and integrate, either directly or indirectly, schemes for the training and employment of young people.</P>
      <P>The National Executive of the Community Games are in receipt of funding from the Department of Education.  In 1982 the organisation received a grant-in-aid of £25,000 from the Annual Grants to Sports Organisations.  In addition, the organisation is in receipt of a grant to assist with the employment of their games development officer which amounted to £5,000 in 1982.  The cost of the post of general secretary and organiser of the community games is being met through an additional grant-in-aid from the Department of Education which amounted to £12,933 in 1982.</P>

The projects relate to a number of areas of intervention; e.g. temporary employment; training, programmes for disadvantaged; enterprise development; job creation potential; community managed programme; schools-industry links.</P>

    <P>In addition, as I indicated in replies to other questions, the agency in 1982 provided funds to local authorities through the Department of the Environment for the full time employment of young persons on environmental improvement works.  The agency also provided funds through the temporary youth employment scheme, then administered by the Department of Education, for the full-time employment of young people on community works.  The allocation of funds in both these cases were additional to the funds received by the bodies in question direct from the Department of Labour Vote.  It is estimated that approximately 1,500 and 500 young persons respectively were employed.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that the Youth Employment Agency does not, as a general rule, directly undertake employment creating projects but supports projects developed by industry, local authorities, voluntary and community bodies and individuals.</P>
    <P>The agency is also involved in the development of a number of long-term programmes at national level e.g. the community and youth enterprise programme, a community managed integrated programme and a loan guarantee scheme for young enterpreneurs.  It is too early to quantify the effects of these programmes.</P>
    <P>The figures which I have given relate only to programmes for youth generated as a result of direct financing by the agency.  They do not take account of the expansion in training, work experience and employment programmes for youth financed directly from the Department of Labour Vote.</P>

      <P>Under Article 70 of their Articles of Association, the Agency are required, before the commencement of each year, to submit their proposed programme of operations for that year for the approval of the Minister for Labour.  As the proposed activities of the agency are, therefore, approved on a yearly basis, the Deputy will appreciate that the information he seeks for years subsequent to 1983 is not available.</P>
      <P>I should, however, like to draw the Deputy's attention to the policy statement entitled &ldquo;A Policy Framework for the Eighties&rdquo; which has been published by the agency.  This document contains some of the main features of the context within which the agency will be working over this decade, together with the main policy directions which the agency will follow in the light of those considerations.</P>

      <P>I understand from the Youth Employment Agency that while a number of inquiries have been received from County Laois, firm proposals have emerged in one instance only.  The agency gave Clonaslee Outdoor Pursuits Centre a grant of £4,000 in 1982 towards materials costs.  However, representatives of the agency met in Athlone on 23 May 1983 with County Development Officers and representatives of the Midland Regional Development Organisation to discuss how best the agency's services can be utilised in the Midlands area, and the agency's role in relation to community development and youth employment projects was outlined at the meeting.</P>
      <P>As far as the youth employment and training programmes operating under the aegis of my Department and its agencies are concerned, the following is the information requested, in respect of the years 1981, 1982 and 1983.</P>

      <P>Grants are made available under the youth employment scheme for the employment of young people on desirable community works of a type which would not otherwise be undertaken in the normal course at the present time. The scheme is intended for voluntary community organisations.</P>
      <P>AnCO's community youth training programme has a similar coverage.  In addition, the programme is designed to provide on-the-job training for the young people involved.  In the case of both the youth employment scheme and the AnCO community youth training programme, all application for assistance from community bodies are considered on their merits.</P>
      <P>The environment works (youth employment) scheme administered by the Department of the Environment provides for the allocation of funds to local authorities for the employment of young people on works designed to effect lasting environmental improvements and to remedy conditions which take from the local environment.  Examples of works undertaken are the provision of parks, open spaces, picnic sites, tree planting etc.</P>
      <P>With regard to the work experience programme, any employing organisations both in the public and private sector may participate in the programme provided that they can offer worthwhile experience that will benefit the young people who participate.</P>
      <P>Both Bord na Móna and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are already participating and have provided programmes for young people in both their Dublin and regional offices.</P>

      <P>The question of restoring redundancy weekly payment entitlements to certain workers has been considered at length in my Department in the light of legal advice on the very complex issues involved and the conclusion was that it would not be appropriate or practicable to propose legislation in the matter.  Having looked at the matter again, I am afraid I would see no justification at this stage for changing that conclusion.  I am sorry, therefore, that I cannot be of assistance in this case.</P>

      <P>The National Manpower Service is concentrating on helping unemployed persons, those on the live register and firsttime job seekers, to find employment, training on work experience.  Where recruitment is done through the National Manpower Service, suitable unemployed persons are given priority in submissions for vacancies.  The decision regarding final selection rests with the employer.</P>
      <P>The only direct employment subsidy scheme in operation in which the Manpower Service is involved is the employment incentive scheme.  The conditions of the scheme provide that&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2282" /> (i) for a weekly premium of £25, the employee must be under 25 years, have been unemployed and registered with the National Manpower Service prior to recruitment.</P>
    <P>(ii) for a weekly premium of £30, the employee must be between the age of 20 and 25 years and have been on the live register for the four weeks immediately preceding recruitment.</P>
    <P>(iii) for a weekly premium of £45, the employee must be over 25 years of age and have been on the live register for the 26 weeks immediately preceding recruitment.</P>
    <P>The live register and registration with the NMS conditions do not apply in the case of persons attending AnCO, CERT, ACOT or other approved training courses or in the case of disabled persons.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service also administers the work experience programme which provides for the placement of young people under 25 years of age with employers for a maximum period of six months to gain work experience which will enhance their prospects of obtaining employment.  A weekly allowance of £30 is paid.  The NMS give priority to persons more than six months unemployed when placing persons on this programme but final acceptance rests with the employer.</P>
    <P>AnCO is a training agency and, as such, does not administer employment subsidy schemes.  However, spare capacity and experience assignment training in firms forms part of AnCO's training schemes for the unemployed.  The criteria applied in selecting organisations to provide spare capacity or experience assignment training are the availability of training expertise, commitment to training unemployed persons, the need for a particular type of skill and the results of previous courses, if appropriate.  At present, priority for AnCO training places is given to persons who have been unemployed for six months.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>AnCO applies the following criteria in engaging outside firms or consultants to provide external training courses:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the competitiveness of the fees they charge;</P>
      <P>&mdash;their particular training expertise, especially as regards training the unemployed;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the training facilities available to them;</P>
      <P>&mdash;their performance and results in respect of previous training undertaken by them;</P>
      <P>&mdash;their ability to operate in locations where training needs exist which cannot be met more efficiently or effectively from other AnCO programmes;</P>
      <P>&mdash;their knowledge of industry's skill needs and their supporting contacts in industry;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the need for a particular skill in the labour market which may not be readily available from within AnCO's other programmes.</P>
      <P>AnCO use outside firms or consultants to run courses on their behalf, to argument and complement the training programmes run by their training centres. By using outside firms and consultants to run courses on their behalf AnCO can maintain a high degree of flexibility in the training of the unemployed and they can meet short-term training needs without incurring the expensive capital investment involved in providing training centres for which a long-term need may not exist.  In addition the widest possible range of industrial and commercial skills can be provided to the unemployed in any part of the country, without any unnecessary duplication.  It will be appreciated, of course, that these criteria must be applied flexibly in order to ensure that the particular training needs identified can be met most appropriately.</P>

      <P>While there is some disappointment among members of An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil at the decision to reduce annual training for 1983 by seven days, I am not aware of grave dissatisfaction as suggested by the Deputy.  The decision, which was taken as part of the Government's programme for achieving reductions in the level of public expenditure, was a very difficult one, and I would be anxious to see the normal annual training restored as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have also decided that, notwithstanding the reduced period of annual training, the gratuity payable to qualified members who complete the maximum permissible period of training in 1983 will be at the full rates, and not <Col N="2287" /> at the reduced rates which would normally apply in respect of attendance for training for the shorter period.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the implication in the question. While the Employment Equality Act, 1977, does not apply to employment in the Defence Forces, the principles of equality enshrined therein are borne in mind in the continuing development of the employment of women in the Defence Forces.  Since 1980, 20 female cadets, four female doctors and 40 female other ranks have joined the Permanent Defence Forces.  As regards apprenticeships, the position is that, because of a shortage of suitable accommodation, it has not been found possible so far to provide for an intake of female apprentices to the Permanent Defence Force.</P>

    <P>In answer to the second part of the question: the Commissioners use the <Col N="2290" /> results of Department of Education examinations as far as possible; for example, for purposes such as eligibility for entry to competitions for various grades. However, the Commissioners are, at present, obliged by statute to hold competitions consisting of at least one competitive test.  Department of Education examination results are expressed in the form of grades rather than marks and are not suited to placing large numbers of candidates in an order of merit.  The Department of Education describe the leaving certificate examination as mainly a test of achievement and they advise employers wishing to use it for selection purposes to institute their own supplementary tests.  This is what the commissioners do in recruiting school-leavers as executive officers when they have an examination of their own (and an interview) in addition to using the leaving certificate results.</P>

      <P>So far as public service pay is concerned, the Government's policy has been to achieve, by agreement, arrangements for pay development which would take into account, on the one hand, the serious economic and financial problems facing the country and, on the other hand, the need to meet, in some degree, legitimate claims by public servants for an increase in pay.  The proposals which the unions' negotiating team has agreed to take back for decision to the Public Services Committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions represent the Government's view of how far it can go to reconcile those two interests.  Briefly the proposals would involve a 15-month agreement consisting of a pay pause of six months, a first phase increase of 4.75 per cent for five months and a second phase increase of 3.25 per cent for four months.  They also provide for the phasing in of special increases in respect of which there were commitments under the last agreement as revised and for the application of phasing to other special increases, including the introduction in most cases of an interval of not less than three years between such special increases.  They also include a provision for giving special recognition to certain categories of low paid workers.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 411 and 412 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Official statistics relating to imports of wood and wood products are complied and published by the Central Statistics Office and, while figures have not yet been published for the current year to date, I understand from other sources <Col N="2296" /> that the value of imported sawn conifers to the end of February last was of the order of £5 million.</P>
    <P>Imported sawn conifers comprise whitewoods and redwoods.  Irish timber is mainly substituted for the former and is estimated to represent about 25 per cent of this current market.  The rate of imporvement in the market share will depend, <i>inter alia,</i> on the degree of availability of mature timber from Irish forests.</P>
    <P>I am glad to say that the acceptability of Irish timber to builders and other users is increasing.  The Department of the Environment, which has overall responsibility for import substitution in regard to building materials including timber, is actively promoting the maximum use of Irish timber and has recently circularised local authorities regarding its quality and suitability.  As the house construction situation improves, significant scope for import substitution can be expected.</P>
    <P>In addition, my Department &mdash; in consultation with the Department of the Environment &mdash; is examining the possibility of greater use of Irish timber in timber framed housing with a view to expanding the market.  Moreover, as the Deputy will be aware, research on various aspects of timber technology by the IIRS on behalf of my Department is continuing. It is my intention to consult with the trade and with Government and commercial agencies regarding the development of higher standards of efficiency in the production, fishing and grading of Irish timber as well as a more aggressive marketing of the finished product.</P>

      <P>This country's annual sawn softwood requirements are estimated to be of the order of 500,000 cubic metres, some 75 per cent of which is accounted for by the construction industry. At present about 80 per cent of the construction sector's needs are met by imported timber and the balance by home-grown timber.  However, it is expected that as the supply of homegrown sawlog increases in the years ahead with the maturing of Irish forests, its share of the construction sector market will increase proportionately.  By the early part of the next decade the country should be nominally self-sufficient in sawn softwood and indeed developing an export trade.  Of course, the need to import special types of timber which can not be produced in Irish forestry conditions will still continue but earnings from export will serve towards offsetting the cost.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the lifeboat from Penlee, Cornwall, the <i>Solomon Browne</i>, which was attempting to rescue the persons on board the <i>Union Star</i>, was also lost on the same occasion.  The British authorities indicated at an early stage that they would hold a formal investigation into the loss of the lifeboat.  In view of the close connection between the loss of the two vessels, and in the interests of comprehensiveness and the avoidance of the duplication of two formal investigations, it was suggested to my predecessor by his counterpart in the British Department of Trade that the two casualties should be covered by the one formal investigation.  My predecessor indicated that he would have no objection to the British formal investigation into the loss <Col N="2310" /> of the <i>Solomon Browne</i> being expanded in scope to cover the loss of the <i>Union Star</i> and that he would be prepared to assist fully in the proceedings.</P>
      <P>The formal investigation, to which my Department was a party, concluded in Penzance on Wednesday, 27 April 1983. The official report of the inquiry was issued on 18 May 1983.  The report found that the loss of the <i>Union Star</i> was caused by:&mdash;(i) the irreparable failure of the ship's engines due to contamination of fuel by sea water while off a dangerous lee shore; (ii) the extreme severity of the weather, wind and sea; and (iii) the capsize of the vessel on or shortly after stranding.  The report also found that the <i>Union Star</i> was properly equipped and properly manned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 442 and 443 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the CIE subvention provision of £86 million for 1983 was settled by the previous Government. When the new Government came into office last December the general Exchequer position left it with no option but to confirm that provision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime the Government have taken the opportunity to review CIE's finances and related matters.  As a result, and bearing in mind that CIE had <Col N="2311" /> recently indicated that the 1983 deficit could go as high as £99 million&mdash;excluding any provision for a general pay increase for CIE employees, it was recognised that the board could not live within the £86 million limit without severe cuts in services.  The Government have decided to accept a maximum deficit corresponding to that projection, that there can be no increase in the subvention of £86 million and, taking account of savings of £2 million&mdash;£3 million which CIE have been directed to achieve, the board's residual deficit should be financed by temporary borrowings.  As a result, it will be necessary for me to seek Oireachtas approval for an increase in the board's statutory borrowing limit and I hope to introduce a Bill for this purpose early in the autumn.  The specific areas and manner in which savings are to be achieved is a matter for the board of CIE.</P>
    <P>The 1983 financial arrangements were settled by the Government in the context of a package of changes in the arrangements for financing CIE for the short term.  The other main features of the package are:&mdash;a formula for the settlement of the CIE subvention which from 1984 will be determined as 50 per cent of CIE revenue or 33? per cent of expenditure, whichever is the lesser;&mdash;the payment of subvention moneys to CIE as revenue i.e. appearing above the line in the CIE accounts;&mdash;a reduction of 12 per cent in expenditure in real terms over five years from 1984 and involving an annual reduction of about 2.5 per cent;&mdash;the establishment of a Permanent Capital Committee to appraise and monitor <Col N="2312" /> CIE's capital expenditure; and&mdash;the extension and clarification of the board's mandate.</P>
    <P>The package is designed to get the financing of CIE under firm control, to set objectives for the board against which their performance can be measured and to create a new environment within CIE where a committee organisation can do an effective job which is publicly recognised.</P>
    <P>Questions Nos. 444 to 447, inclusive, postponed.</P>

      <P>CIE's subvention allocation for 1983 amounts to £86 million and the board's 1983 capital allocation is £60 million, of which £16 million has been allocated for road passenger projects including the acquisition of new buses.  It is the responsibility of the board of CIE to determine the investment in new buses and other road passanger projects within the limit of £16 million.  CIE's capital expenditure is finalised by the board's depreciation provisions, long-term borrowings, Exchequer capital advances and leasing arrangements.</P>

      <P>It is assumed that the Deputy is referring to scheduled road passenger services operated under licences issued in accordance with the Road Transport Act, 1932.  These licences authorise the holder to operate scheduled services over specified routes in accordance with an approved timetable and at fixed maximum fare levels.</P>

      <P>I have no reason to think <Col N="2317" /> that the present system of numbering postal districts, which has been in operation since 1961, is inconvenient to the persons mentioned.  For control and operational purposes delivery areas are attached to particular head post office districts or to the Dublin postal district, which do not necessarily coincide with local authority administration boundaries. It would be undesirable to deviate from this arrangement, which is longestablished and has served the postal service well, unless there were clear advantages to be gained from the postal viewpoint, and there is no evidence to this effect.  I would be reluctant, therefore, to adopt the Deputy's suggestions as general policy but if he gives me details of any particular instances he may have in mind of the postal district numbering scheme being inconvenient to some users of the post, I will have them examined and communicate further with him.</P>

      <P>If the demand for guarantee was discontinued after five years it could result in a substantial subsidy by the Department to these kiosks.  However due recognition is given of improving revenue and the demand for payment under the guarantee scheme reduces as revenue improves.  Ultimately it is discontinued when the revenue reaches the guarantee figure.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <Col N="2323" /> Accordingly it is not proposed to discontinue the demand for payment after the initial five-year period has elapsed.</P>

      <P>I have seen the report of the survey referred to.  It purports to give the results of a survey carried out among 247 foreign companies in business here, all of them from countries in which the telephone system is highly developed.  I can understand that, depending on their location in this country, numbers of them would find the telephone system here less satisfactory than in their parent countries. The object of the current telephone development programme is to bring the quality of the telephone service here up to the level in other EEC countries.  Much has already been achieved and it is expected that the programme will be completed on target by the end of next year.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 502 to 505, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the Associated Banks propose to discontinue the practice of returning paid cheques to customers and that two banks are introducing the new arrangement at two centres on a phased basis.  I regret that neither my Department not the Revenue Commissioners were consulted before this change was announced.  The implications for the proper collection of the revenue are being pursued with the Irish Banks' Standing Committee.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank has informed me that it was consulted and agreed to the new practice after receiving certain assurances from the banks.  These are that all customers' paid cheques, or photocopies, will be retained for at least six years and will be available to customers at bank branches on request and at no extra charge.  In cases of genuine need the banks will arrange for the return of cheques to customers.  The Central Bank has advised me that the introduction of cheque truncation, that is the holding of paid cheqes at the branch of presentation rather than at the customer's branch, does not arise at this stage.  The new cheque retention arrangements are being brought in gradually and will be monitored to ensure they are working satisfactorily, before further developments would be considered.</P>
      <P>The Central Bank has also advised me that it is keeping the general situation under review and has informed the banks that it wishes to be consulted on all future developments.  While I welcome measures aimed at improving efficiency and controlling costs I am concerned that their implementation should not facilitate tax evasion or fraud.  As I have indicated, this aspect is being followed up.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to measure the extent of illegal betting or to estimate the tax revenue lost to the State because of this illegal practice.  However, the Revenue Commissioners are aware of the problem and take all possible steps to deal with it.

    <P>
      <Col N="2335" /> In 1982, the penalties for unlicensed bookmaking and for evasion of betting duty were increased from £500 to £800. The penalty for obstructing an officer of Customs and Excise in the exercise of his powers under betting duty legislation was also increased from £50 to £500.  In addition, the powers of a District Justice to mitigate excise fines were curtailed.  The maximum mitigation now possible would reduce the fine to one half of the statutory penalty; previously it was within the courts' discretion to reduce the fine to one quarter.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 512, 513 and 514 together.</P>
      <P>Studies carried out indicate that it is more cost effective to build than to rent office accommodation and building would accordingly be the preferred option.  Capital for building is, however, in competition with capital for other projects which may give a better return. Where capital cannot be made available for building there may well be no option but to rent to meet the reasonable basic requirements of Government services.</P>
      <P>The policy being pursued by the Commissioners of Public Works in relation to the provision of office accommodation for civil service staffs is to build premises where possible and the commissioners have in operation a building programme for this purpose.  This aim can be achieved only over a period of years and, consequently, it is also necessary to rent space to meet the more pressing requirements of Government Departments. Accordingly there has been no loss incurred in the provision of accommodation.</P>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works do not have responsibility for the provision of accommodation for semi-State bodies.</P>
      <P>With regard to the method of renting accommodation, I am satisfied that the rental etc.  terms obtained by the commissioners through negotiation are at least as favourable as those paid by many business concerns for similar facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are aware of all the speculative developments available for letting and of the terms being sought.  Their aim is to acquire the most suitable property in a particular location to meet the demands on hands on terms which are fair and <Col N="2337" /> reasonable.  This aim could not be met effectively through a process of tendering.</P>

      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works who have statutory responsibility for the protection of national monuments are very concerned at the level of destruction of archaeological sites which has been revealed by their own national archaeological survey and by a number of recent regional surveys which they are funding. This data was available to the Annual <Col N="2338" /> General Meeting of the Irish Association of Professional Archaeologists held in Ballinasloe from 22 to 24 April 1983 and the Deputy is presumably referring to related statements made by the association arising from that meeting.</P>
      <P>A key element in the commissioners' strategy to protect our heritage of monuments and sites is the compilation and publication of sites and monuments inventories on a county by county basis. Work on these inventories is progressing satisfactorily and it is hoped to publish two counties next year.  In addition to their own survey work the commissioners are funding archaeological surveys of Counties Cork and Galway and the Dingle Peninsula.  I am confident that these measures will go some way towards halting the destruction of monuments and sites which is at present taking place.</P>

      <Col N="2343" /> A case has been made that there should be a service over and above the normal accident and emergency services to deal specifically with cardiac cases and there are a small number of such services in other countries.  At present a cardiac ambulance service is provided by the Eastern Health Board in the Dublin area on a trial basis.  The board have specially trained personnel to provide this service. This scheme is being evaluated at present with a view to determining its effectiveness and future policy in relation to such a facility.</P>

The Department of Agriculture were immediately contacted and, on investigation, it was discovered that the potatoes were the produce of Northern Ireland, which, under a scheme operated by the Northern Ireland Ministry of Agriculture, had been withdrawn from the market because of a surplus, and denatured for animal feed by means of dyeing.  These potatoes had been brought illegally from Northern Ireland.</P>

      <P>The unemployment benefit claims of the workers concerned were disallowed on the grounds that their employment was lost by reason of a stoppage of work due to a trade dispute at their place of employment.  The decision was given in the light of evidence furnished by the employers and the employees. At the request of the trade union representing the workers an appeal application form was supplied for the purpose of appealing against the disallowance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While unemployment benefit was not <Col N="2355" /> payable for the duration of the dispute, there is provision under the legislation whereby supplementary welfare allowance may be paid in respect of the dependants of the workers involved.

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare (i) the progress being made in the computerisation of all the employment exchanges and other centres being used for signing-on purposes; (ii) the projected cost of computerisation; and (iii) when the system will be in operation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Plans for the total computerisation of all the employment exchanges and other local offices of the Department are not yet at a formative stage.  Accordingly estimates are not available of the likely total cost involved nor can it be stated when a total computerisation of these offices could be envisaged.  It is evident that due to the many factors involved, the process would have to be a gradual one spread over several years. Nevertheless it is my intention to proceed with the computerisation of all suitable major areas in my Department including the unemployment payment schemes as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the meantime, to meet particular difficulties being experienced in the <Col N="2360" /> Dublin employment exchanges, a simplified computer-aided payments system is in course of preparation.  This will prove of benefit in alleviating the work situation and help in providing a better service for claimants.  It is planned to introduce the system initially in the employment exchange in Gardiner Street and on its successful implementation to extend it to the other major exchanges in Dublin.</P>
    <P>As regards other officers of the Department, it is intended to expand the computerised inquiry service which enables information regarding claimant's insurance records and disability benefit claims to be readily available locally.  To date, visual display terminals giving these facilities have been installed in three of the Department's information offices in Dublin and in the employment exchanges in Cork, Limerick and Waterford. Inquiry terminals will be gradually introduced into the remaining information offices.</P>
    <P>The full co-operation of all staff associations in the areas involved is however a vital factor in the exercise.  This is not at present forthcoming.</P>

      <P>The bus priority programme began in Dublin in April 1981 and in general the buslanes only operate during peak traffic hours.  I am informed by CIE that data on bus usage of the company's Dublin city services is compiled on the basis of passenger journeys rather than passenger miles.  Total passenger journeys on Dublin city services in 1980 and 1982 were 175.4 million and 163.5 million respectively.  Surveys carried out by CIE of daily passenger journeys in the morning peak in November 1980 and November 1982 were 43,700 and 45,600 respectively, an increase of 4.3 per cent.  It is not feasible to provide a breakdown of the foregoing data as between the northside and southside of Dublin.</P>

    <P>Statistics are not kept in such a manner as to enable the number of cases making these tax payments to be provided.  To obtain this information would require an individual examination of all capital gains tax returns for the years in question and such an examination could only be carried out at a disproportionate cost.</P>
    <P>It should be noted that the information given relates only to capital gains tax. Under the Corporation Tax Act, 1976 the chargeable gains of companies arising from disposals made on or after 6 April 1976 are, in general, charged to corporation tax and not to capital gains tax. Statistics are not available which would enable the amount of corporation tax paid or payable on such gains to be given.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will be aware of the provisions of the Restrictive Practices (Groceries) Order, 1981 which is concerned, <i>inter alia</i>, with the problem of below cost selling.  In particular, it prohibits the advertising of grocery goods for sale at a price which is below net invoice price and enables suppliers to withhold grocery goods from wholesalers or retailers who offer such goods for sale at a price which is below net invoice price.  These controls were introduced on foot of recommendations by the Restrictive Practices Commission following its public enquiry into the retail sale of grocery goods below cost price. The Commission recommended against a prohibition of the practice.</P>
      <P>I have received a number of submissions recommending further legislative intervention in the retail grocery sector, including proposals for the prohibition of below cost selling.  I have been consulting with the various groups who are involved in this sector and I will not be in a position to take any final decisions in the matter until I have considered the views of all interested parties.</P>

      <P>Her claim for an old age contributory pension was received on 3 May 1983.  She does not qualify for a contributory pension, however, as she does not satisfy the condition which requires her to have a yearly average of at least 20 qualifying contributions over the required period which, in her case, is from 6 July 1953 to 5 April 1982.  According to the records of the Department, she had a total of only 42 qualifying contributions during this period.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Social Security, Belfast, has been requested to furnish details of her insurance record in Northern Ireland in order that her entitlement to a pro-rata rate old age contributory pension under EEC Regulations can be determined.  She is already in receipt of a Northern Ireland retirement pension.</P>
      <P>In the meantime her entitlement to a non-contributory old age pension was also investigated.  A pension at the rate of £24.45 per week from 3 May 1983, increasing to £28.60 per week, with effect from 1 July 1983, has now been recommended. This is being put into payment on a provisional basis pending consideration of the award by the local pension committee.</P>
