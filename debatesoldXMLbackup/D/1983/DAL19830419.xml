    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if it is his intention to meet a delegation from the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions from Northern Ireland with a view to promoting cross-Border economic co-operation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: In the course of a letter I sent on 11 March to Mr. Colin Lowry, President of the Northern Ireland District Committee of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions, I indicated that I should be glad to meet a delegation from the confederation to hear their views on how North-South economic co-operation, to which the Government are strongly committed, can best be developed.  A response was recently received from the Harland and Wolff Shipbuilding Sub-Committee of the Northern Ireland District Committee indicating that they are anxious for a meeting.  I hope that it will be possible to fix a mutually convenient date for a meeting with a confederation delegation next month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="946" /> In my letter to Mr. Lowry, I also said that both I and the Minister for Industry and Energy were strongly in favour of closer North-South co-operation where engineering companies in Northern Ireland have the capacity to supply needs in this part of the country.  I indicated that in regard to business of interest to Harland and Wolff, it was intended to maintain contacts that had taken place with Mr. Parker, the new chairman and chief executive.  This has been done. Appropriate preparations are also in hand, with Departments and agencies concerned, for the proposed meeting with the trade union delegation and, more generally, to provide a basis for co-ordinated implementation of the Government's policy in this area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: I welcome the Taoiseach's decision to meet this delegation and support the principle of promoting North-South economic co-operation in this way.  When the Taoiseach meets this delegation will he be in a position to explain to them why he permitted the ESB principally to set at naught the efforts which I and my Government had made to ensure very beneficial co-operation whereby Harland and Wolff, Irish Shipping and the ESB would combine together to provide the necessary bulk carrier for the new generating station at Moneypoint, County Clare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: That seems to be a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: Contrary to suggestions in some Northern newspaper reports, clearly based on Opposition briefing that the deal was all but sewn up when the change of Government occurred, very many questions remained unanswered at that time and it was far from clear that any shipping company would be prepared, especially when they had to stand over contract terms, to order a ship in Belfast other than on foot of conditions that would be unacceptable by compelling the ESB to put too many eggs into one basket.  In that connection, the best way of summing up the situation as it was when we took over is to read to <Col N="947" /> the House the concluding paragraph of a letter written by my predecessor to Mr. Colin Lowry on 10 December.  He said:</P>
      <P>The question that must now be decided by the Government here is whether in the light of the facts available it would be justified in pursuing the project and entering into serious inter-governmental negotiations or whether this project should be postponed for some years when hopefully more favourable circumstances will obtain.</P>
      <P>I would like you to understand that the Government have been motivated throughout by a wish to place, if possible, a major order with Harland and Wolff.  We have pursued this project in good faith and with diligence and have brought it to a point where a decision can be made even if it has to be an unfavourable one.</P>
      <P>A gentle let down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although the meeting between the Belfast unions and the former Taoiseach took place on 5 April 1982, the ESB went to tender on 14 April 1982.  As a result of the failure of the former Taoiseach to arrange for any contact with the ESB, the body in whose authority and competence it lay to award the contracts, they were not required to go to tender on the basis of taking account of the Belfast option. Had the matter been pursued in the normal departmental and inter-departmental manner, it probably would have been possible to arrange that the ESB go to tender on two alternative bases, with and without the Belfast option, and the matter could have been pursued in July-August 1982 on the basis of firm quotations over which tendering firms would have had to stand.  The lack of contact with the ESB continued for a lengthy period, with the ESB apparently being brought directly into the matter only on 30 July, although they might possibly have inferred from inquiries in mid-July, three-and-a-half months after the meeting between the Taoiseach and the Belfast unions, that some follow-up to Deputy Haughey's meeting was afoot. There was a failure to pursue the matter <Col N="948" /> in April, May and June 1980 too.</P>
    <P>This is the background against which the matter had to be considered following my Government's assumption of office. With a view to seeing whether the position as it then stood could be retrieved, the Minister for Industry and Energy gave the matter detailed attention and there were further contacts from and with various interested parties, including the responsible British Minister and the new managing director of Harland and Wolff. I regret that ultimately the view had to be taken, foreshadowed by my predecessor's letter, that even following these contacts, the potential financial penalties at that stage &mdash; in view of the way the matter had been handled in placing a contract on the basis of a ship order in Belfast&mdash; appeared too high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is quite clear that the Taoiseach is, in this instance, resorting to a tactic which is now standard with him, that is to try to obscure all important issues and spread confusion by misrepresenting the situation.  Would the Taoiseach not agree that every effort was made by my Government to bring this matter to a successful conclusion and, further, that if he puts all the papers before the House they will disclose that the ESB were prevented by my Government from sabotaging this project as long as we were in office, and that they succeeded immediately we left office in going ahead and placing an order for this ship in Japan at an enormous cost to our Exchequer without any benefit whatsoever? Whatever gloss the Taoiseach may endeavour to put on it he will find when the time comes that as far as the hardheaded work force in Harland and Wolff are concerned, they do trust the Fianna Fáil Government more on this issue than his pathetic attempts in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I cannot agree that every effort was made by my predecessor's Government.  The simple fact is that no effort was made between 5 April 1982 and mid-July to take any action in the matter, <i>vis-à-vis</i> the ESB.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I reiterate that lack of contact with the ESB continued well into July.  The former Taoiseach's letter, as I read it to the House, is clearly a gentle let down.  Because the thing had been muffed, we tried to retrieve it, but the damage had been done and it was too late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach which member of the Government and which Government Department now has responsibility for policy on Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: In accordance with the position over the years, policy on Northern Ireland is primarily the responsibility of the Taoiseach.  In so far as policy affects relations with the British Government it is also, of course, the concern of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the Taoiseach can answer any question these days in simple and direct terms, will he answer my question about who, what member of the Government, is directly and immediately responsible for Northern policy, and what Department has responsibility for administering that policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: As I have said, in accordance with the position over the years policy on Northern Ireland is primarily the responsibility of the Taoiseach. The Department of Foreign Affairs obviously have concern with Northern Ireland matters because these matters relate to our relations with another Government.  Moreover, the Deputy will be aware that the Department discharge operational functions in <Col N="950" /> relation to Northern Ireland matters, such as, for example, contacts in Northern Ireland, publicising the Government's policy on Northern Ireland abroad, presenting policies to other Governments, etc.  As there is such close interaction between policy on Northern Ireland and Irish-British relations, naturally over the years under successive Governments the closest co-operation between the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and their Departments has been maintained.  That position continues, but responsibility for Northern Ireland policy remains with the Taoiseach as it has for as long as I can remember.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Will the Taoiseach acknowledge that all the staff dealing with Northern Ireland policy are now in the Department of Foreign Affairs and that meetings in connection with Northern Ireland are held in the Department of Foreign Affairs and presided over by the Minister for Foreign Affairs? Does this not indicate quite clearly that Northern Ireland affairs now are clearly and directly the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs?  Furthermore, does this not indicate clearly that a number of people in his party and in the Government are not prepared to trust him with the administration of foreign affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: The position is that the responsibility rests with the Taoiseach. As I pointed out, the operational aspects have always been undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  It is true that in the past, under the past administration, a non-civil servant in the Taoiseach's Department played a certain role in these matters which I personally would not regard as constructive.  That is obviously a matter of opinion, though that view was held.  However, the position has been, apart from that, that the operational aspects&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>: Did the Taoiseach refer to a &ldquo;known civil servant&rdquo;?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I specifically said &ldquo;non-civil servant&rdquo;.  The operational <Col N="951" /> aspects always have been undertaken by the Department of Foreign Affairs, as I am well aware from my experience as Minister of the contacts undertaken by that Department.  There has been clear functional delineation between the Taoiseach's responsibility and the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Of course the closest co-operation is maintained between the Taoiseach's Department and the Minister for Foreign Affairs upon which the effective operation of Northern Ireland policy depends.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: Further to my reply of 1 March last to the Deputy's previous question on this subject I wish to state that the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment, Deputy Dick Spring, has now resigned from membership of Tralee Urban District Council.  He intends to resign from Kerry County Council at an early date.</P>
      <P>The Ministers for Labour and Justice have not yet resigned from the local authorities of which they are members but as I have already indicated it is their intention to do so in accordance with the practice normally followed by Governments in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is the Taoiseach aware that he informed the House here on the last occasion when this question was asked that it was the intention of the Minister for the Environment to resign from Kerry County Council, the Minister for Labour to resign from Wicklow County Council and the Minister for Justice to resign from Limerick County Council?  Will the Taoiseach say why the explanation he gave to the House on the earlier date was not correct because it has not been implemented?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I said it is their intention <Col N="952" /> to resign.  I did not give any date or deadline.  Precedents have been set by Fianna Fáil Ministers to stay on as local authority members for much longer than these three Ministers, as I pointed out on the last occasion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: In view of the unsatisfactory and slightly dishonest nature of the reply, I ask the Taoiseach whether he agrees that there is a serious conflict of interests in the Minister for the Environment remaining on as a member of a local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: I do not think that it is in accordance with the dignity of the House to attribute dishonesty.  That is the second or third time it has happened today, and that is why I raise the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: If the rules of the House require me to withdraw the term, I will do so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: There are precedents for Ministers in previous Fianna Fáil Governments remaining on as members for much longer periods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: Does the Taoiseach not consider that there must be a conflict of interests in the Minister for the Environment continuing on as a member of a local authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;for which he has been charged by this House with responsibility? He is responsible for the funding of that local authority.  What kind of standards is the Taoiseach seeking to implement? Has the Minister for the Environment refused to resign or to act on the Taoiseach's request that he resign from Kerry County Council?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: No.  I have indicated that it has been the practice for Ministers to resign from local authorities, and I have indicated to the members of the Government the time-scale within which previous Fianna Fáil Ministers carried out that operation.  I anticipate that the Ministers will resign from local authorities within the time scale precedents set by Fianna Fáil Ministers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have to confirm the contrary.  Consultations have been in progress for a period of quite a number of weeks.  It was with some surprise that <Col N="955" /> I learned this morning that these consultations now require to be translated into a letter to the Leader of the Opposition. I am more than willing to do so.  I regret, however, that the Opposition have taken so long to respond in this regard because it is a matter of urgency to get the committee established.</P>

      <P>: I am sorry a Cheann Comhairle, but some things push me beyond the bounds of reasonably courteous behaviour in this House.

Because the jetty and the plant are complementary one cannot be separated <Col N="964" /> from the other.

At that time the estimated cost was said to be in the region of £348,000.  The South Kerry Survey Team considered that, because of the excessive cost and in the expectation of getting developments under way elsewhere, less expensive works should be undertaken elsewhere, which have been done at Cahirciveen, Knightstown and Portmagee during the years.  This was the recommendation of the survey team. Work has taken place in the area but if the Deputy wishes that a meeting be arranged I will gladly accede to that request.</P>

      <P>My Department have for some time been considering the introduction of a zoning arrangement in respect of our inshore waters but it has not been possible so far to find a sufficient degree of agreement for an arrangement whereby each category of fishermen would enjoy an equitable share of access to available resources of fish.</P>

      <P>: That has been part of the problem.  I could lay down certain regulations on the basis of zoning of areas and so on, but it would be foolish to do so without consultation because of the difficulty in implementing regulations.

The loan agreement provided that interest be charged on the loan until such time as the loan had been <Col N="970" /> repaid and as repayment was made to the board on 8 October 1982, interest totalling IR£1,470.32 was correctly charged in respect of the period 1 August to 30 September 1982.</P>

I ask him to reconsider the situation with a view to correcting what I and, I think, all Members of this House would consider to be an error.

      <P>Full consideration has also been given to a development scheme sought by the local fishermen, comprising the extension of the pier and the raising of the stormwall by six feet.  The substantial expenditure involved in extending the pier could not be justified having regard to the limited amount of fishing from this landing place.  As to the second request, the Department have been advised by the Office of Public Works that the raising of the stormwall by six feet would not prevent heavy seas from breaking over the pier.

While the fishermen appreciated the installation of a crane there which was of great benefit to them, in winter seas lash over the pier and damage boats there.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: Moville Pier is vested in the Harbour Commissioners for the port of Derry.  Work on the present structure was completed in 1976 as part of an improvement scheme carried out for the benefit of local fishermen.  The scheme was financed by a grant from my Department and a contribution from the commissioners.  Following completion of the work the commissioners assumed responsibility for future maintenance of the pier.</P>
      <P>During a storm in 1980 a portion of the outer end of the pier collapsed.  Following investigations by engineers of the Office of Public Works and my Department it emerged that substantial dredging alongside the pier was carried out by the harbour commissioners during the summer of 1979 in order to facilitate the operation of a ferry service between Oban in Scotland and Moville.  The engineers of the Office of Public Works and my Department are in agreement that the dredging led to the collapse of the pier.</P>
      <P>In the light of the foregoing, this Department consider that the repair of the pier is a matter for the harbour commissioners and are in negotiation with them in the matter.</P>

      <P>: Does the Minister accept that this is totally inadequate for the needs of the timber industry for the purpose of supplying the construction industry?

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>: I should point out to the Deputy that all timber sawn in Irish mills is not dried in this manner, that proportion only which is necessary to meet specifications as to moisture content for housebuilding, specialised fencing and so on is subjected to kiln drying.  It constitutes an additional cost factor which generally is avoided unless absolutely necessary.  Therefore, I should point out that it would be wrong of us to take on this extra cost and, by so doing, become less competitive.</P>

It is an extension of what we tried before and the reason for my interjection is to ask for the co-operation of the House because we do not have an agreed list of speakers.  The idea is to permit as many Members as possible participate and in order to do that we appeal to all Members to take into account that others are anxious to contribute.  If Members confined their contributions to approximately 15 minutes it would be a great help to enable as many Members as possible take part.</P>

      <P>: The Finance Bill will be published next week.  It had been, as the House will be aware, our intention to publish in this week but the House will be aware of the volume of representations, primarily from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, but not exclusively, with regard to matters of tax evasion and avoidance.  The Government are anxious to include as many measures as are possible and desirable in the Bill.  That has held up the Bill coming before the Government.  It is now before the Government and being discussed.  The publication will be next week rather than this week with a view to initiating the discussion in the Dáil the following week. We are anxious to ensure that there is adequate time for discussion in the Dáil and we will be taking account, therefore, in fixing the date for the by-election, of the need to do that in a manner that will leave as much time as possible for the Dáil to discuss it, bearing in mind that the Bill will be published rather later than originally intended.</P>

    <Title>Statements on Taxation .</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>: In making time available for this debate the Government are anxious to give the House the opportunity to express its views on an important and topical issue which has become very contentious in recent weeks.  For obvious reasons taxation is of immediate concern to all the community, not least because of its impact on everyday living.  My principal concern this afternoon is to present our taxation arrangements in their proper perspective and to re-emphasise the commitment <Col N="1228" /> of this Government to changes that will lead to a fairer distribution of the tax burden.</P>
      <P>In recent weeks the subject of tax equity has been in the news consistently. The present high rates of taxation have focussed attention on the need for change.  I want to repeat categorically, as I have on many occasions in the last few weeks, that I accept the need for improvement.  In my budget statement on 9 February I announced a package of proposals on tax evasion and avoidance which go well beyond any new measures introduced by Ministers for Finance in recent years.  I see the budget proposals as simply a first step in an extended programme to counter evasion.  I have already outlined in quite some detail in the Oireachtas and elsewhere the problems associated with the collection of taxes and I intend to go over some of this ground again.  There is much that is unsatisfactory in this respect that requires urgent attention.  On the other hand some greatly exaggerated figures about tax outstanding, which give an entirely misleading picture of the situation, have been given considerabe currency.</P>
      <P>Effective action in relation to evasion and collection procedures, which I intend to put into effect without further delay, will bring about a significant improvement. I acknowledge that such action alone will not be enough and that we must go still further if we are to achieve a demonstrably fairer tax system.  I can understand the frustration of PAYE taxpayers who feel that they are being asked to bear an unfair burden.  At the same time, it is only fair to recognise that there are many other taxpayers who also are being heavily taxed and who pay their due share in accordance with the law. The issue is not simply the PAYE taxpayer versus the rest and it would be regrettable if we pursued solutions solely within this framework.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the need to move quickly towards a wider distribution of the tax net and to provide that those who are better off must pay more.  I can give an assurance to the House that these considerations are at the very basis of Government policy on taxation and I feel I can <Col N="1229" /> rightly claim that our actions to date in our short period in office bear witness to this.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the high levels of taxation.  It is this factor, I believe, above all else, which has stirred up the present agitation about equity.  Tax rates are high because public expenditure is high.  This is the uncomfortable equation underlying our present difficulties.  I want to highlight this reality because it is central to the whole discussion about taxation.</P>
    <P>The main purpose of taxation is the necessity to raise adequate revenue to finance Government spending across the whole range of Government activity &mdash; in the social and economic areas, on investment and in all other areas of Government activity.  Over a number of years tax revenue has not been sufficient for this purpose with the consequence that we have accumulated growing deficits and an increasing burden of debt. This increasing burden of debt becomes a further charge to be met by taxation. There is a general acceptance that this situation could not continue further.  It would put at risk all our plans to increase economic activity and provide openings for more employment.  Those who are critical of our high levels of taxation must address themselves to this problem; otherwise they are avoiding the main issue and this only adds to confusion and misinformation.</P>
    <P>We have a young and rapidly growing population.  This is a unique asset and a great benefit to us.  It also, however, brings responsibilities and imposes an extra strain on our finances in the shorter term and we must be ready to pay for this.  Because we have a high dependency ratio, we will inevitably continue to have a rather high expenditure profile.  Our increasing population creates pressure for substantial additional expenditures in certain areas.  Above all else it necessitates a high level of investment to generate further employment.  This investment itself creates an interest burden which must be met from taxation.  Our increasing population requires additional social expenditure.  Because of the extra <Col N="1230" /> demands, the Government must determine priorities.</P>
    <P>These priorities concern both expenditure and taxation.  If we look at only one side of the equaiton, our view will be distorted and we will run a very serious risk of creating new problems for out-selves. The relationship between expenditure and taxation is at the very heart of the problems that we are discussing this afternoon.</P>
    <P>Some will say that the right approach, and indeed the only approach, is to widen the tax base.  This will be done, but it is only a partial solution.  It is unrealistic to believe that we can ignore the problem of expenditure.  Better collection procedures and changes in tax law, which I will bring before this House in the immediate future, will represent a big step forward. On their own they will not be sufficient to bridge the enromous gap between spending and revenue.  There are areas of taxation from which the present yields are insufficient and the Government are paying close attention to these.  But I must caution that there are no huge untapped sources of taxation on a scale which would make an appreciable difference to our problems.</P>
    <P>I would now like to turn to the question of tax collection.  In answer to a parliamentary question in this House on 24 March I gave details of tax outstanding. I indicated that the figure at the end of 1982 was £961.7 million and this related to all tax outstanding for all years up to and including 1981-82.  I emphasised, however, that this included assessments and that the actual true liability is far less. The figure of £961.7 million is an accounting figure and is a function of the assessment and estimating procedures under which amounts assessed or estimated continue to be shown as outstanding until such time as cases are finalised and liability agreed.  This may take a number of years because of the collection processes and system of appeals which we operate. I have said already, and I repeat, that there is need for improvement here and improvements will be made in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that in spite of the detailed explanations contained in the <Col N="1231" /> official source documents the figure of £1,000 million for uncollected taxes has come to be accepted as fact in many quarters.  It is totally misleading.  A large proportion of this will be successfully appealed.  I cannot say how much of the outstanding tax will ultimately be payable because this depends on appeals that have yet to be heard.  The only guideline I can point to is that between mid-1982 and the end of the year the figure reduced by about £250 million.  Of this reduction, some 10 per cent was brought into the Exchequer with the balance discharged as not being properly due.  If this pattern were to continue in respect of the end-year figure, then the balance ultimately paid into the Exchequer would be no more than £90 million to £100 million.</P>
    <P>This balance, I would repeat, is what is found to be the true liability as opposed to the initially assessed liability after all the accounts and other evidence have been presented and examined by the Revenue Commissioners.  I must stress, however, that this calculation could be well wide of the mark because there is no evidence that the previous pattern will be continued.  It would be wrong to use a 10 per cent ratio as a valid figure.  It is quite impossible to predict what ratios will emerge in due course when the whole procedure has been gone through.</P>
    <P>It is said that the Revenue Commissioners add to the confusion by making assessments which bear no relationship to reality.  In many instances the assessments are obviously very high.  In the absence of accounts, the Revenue Commissioners have no choice but to estimate figures for tax due.  It is only to be expected that they will tend to err on the high side and this will encourage the taxpayer to meet his obligations and make proper returns.</P>
    <P>I hope that what I have said will help to bring a greater reality to the discussion about collection and put the figures in proper perspective.  I do not want to convey the impression, however, that all is well with our collection system.  On the contrary, there is an urgent need for improvement.  The system of appeals is far too generous to the taxpayer and the <Col N="1232" /> time allowed for appeals has to be shortened. There are huge and unacceptable backlogs in the area of enforcement. Some changes will require amendments to the law and I will take these on board in the Finance Bill.  Other changes will require administrative action and I can assure the House that I am giving close attention to this.</P>
    <P>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions recently made a submission to the Government on the subject of tax evasion. It listed a total of 41 individual proposals for change.  Some of these have already been mentioned in my budget statement and others are being included in the Finance Bill.  Many of the Congress proposals have considerable merit.  They will be the subject of continuing discussion by the Working Party on Taxation, which is a joint Government-Congress forum for discussing taxation matters, and I have every reason to believe that we will see clear evidence of progress. The next meeting of the working party will take place on Thursday.  I will also be discussing wider issues of taxation with Congress in the near future.</P>
    <P>I welcome the positive approach of Congress to the present situation and I am satisfied that their initiatives can lead to substantial improvements.  This action contrasts with the policy of non-cooperation being pursued by some groups of workers as a means of highlighting their dissatisfaction with the present system. This latter approach is unfortunate and it serves no constructive purpose.  If continued it will only create difficulties for the workers themselves and for their firms.  It would threaten jobs at a time when we can ill afford to lose employment. It will achieve nothing useful because there are no immediate tax giveaways for anybody.  I appeal to the good sense of the workers concerned to abandon this approach because it is leading nowhere.  There are other, and far more effective, ways for them to express their dissatisfaction.</P>
    <P>We all accept &mdash; I believe correctly &mdash; that tax evasion is widespread and that it is on the increase.  Because of its very nature we cannot quantify it, but all the evidence suggests that it is on a large <Col N="1233" /> scale and that we are certainly losing millions of pounds in taxation as a consequence. We are all against evasion in principle.  There are calls for jail sentences and tough monetary penalties.  At the same time, regrettably, some evasion practices have been regarded as socially acceptable and our attitude as a community on this issue is often ambivalent.</P>
    <P>As Minister for Finance, I can propose amendments in the law and I can finetune the administration of the system to make life more difficult for the tax evader. Ultimately, however, we must bring about a change in public attitudes, and until we do this the tax evader will be allowed too much scope.  Just recently there may be hopeful signs of a significant shift in attitudes.  I welcome this and I hope that it will gather momentum.</P>
    <P>Every group in society has a strong tendency to blame other sections of society for evasion.  The experience of the Revenue Commissioners is that evasion is being practised in all walks of society. At a more blatant level there are those who falsify accounts and returns or, on the indirect tax side, engage in smuggling activities.  Then there are many people who are not declaring their full earnings for tax purposes.  This is facilitated by everyone who employs persons of whom there is every reason to believe that they are not paying their fair share of taxes.</P>
    <P>I am giving special consideration to the situation where income is not reported in full.  Apart from legislation, I believe that significant progress can be made by changes in administrative practices and I am looking carefully at this.  In this connection I said in the course of the budget statement that reporting arrangements for payments to individuals and companies by Government Departments and public authorities were under review so that those who benefit directly or indirectly from such payments will pay the appropriate tax on such income.</P>
    <P>There is a reluctance to report individual instances of evasion because, I suppose, this may cast a person in the role of informer or perhaps because it is felt that, if one person is caught, it will make no difference in the overall context.  If we do not face up to the problem in individual <Col N="1234" /> cases I cannot be optimistic about progress in the overall framework.</P>
    <P>The Finance Bill will shortly be circulated to Deputies.  In advance of circulation I am not at liberty to discuss the details.  I can inform the House, however, that it will contain a number of additional measures, over and above the budget proposals, which will be directed specifically against tax evasion.  I expect that these new measures will have an early and significant effect.  I want to stress again that, while the Finance Bill will introduce a substantial number of new anti-evasion measures, which are well overdue, it is by no means the last word on this.  I see scope for further substantial changes and I will pursue these.  What we must realise is that some changes will take time to formulate and implement because of the administrative and other complications which would follow.  The Finance Bill will, however, be a clear indicator of a new determination to counter evasion.</P>
    <P>In our Programme for Government we gave a high profile to equity in our society, including in particular reforms in our taxation system.  We recognised the need for a fairer distribution of tax.  In the four months since we came into office we have already introduced substantial changes which are a clear indication of our commitment in this area.  The Finance Bill will reinforce this.  We cannot deal with all the issues that require attention in a short period but we are well on course. As I have already said, the budget package on tax evasion and avoidance goes well beyond any changes introduced in recent years.  The proof of this is the spirited reaction from the variety of interested parties who will be at the receiving end of these new measures and who have been exerting pressure for modifications.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that there will be further substantial changes which will demonstrate our commitment to greater tax equity.  I am already looking beyond 1983 and to more fundamental improvements. There is a need for substantial change; I recognise this and I am giving it priority.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>: This debate has been <Col N="1235" /> occasioned by an unprecedented concern about the level and incidence of taxation and the burden of the PAYE sector. It has also been generated by divisions created in society as a result of ministerial statements made before today referring to action which would be taken against the self-employed, apparently to accommodate the views of the PAYE sector.  If this was the purpose, what the Minister said will do nothing to allay the concern and frustration of that sector.  Rather it may create further divisions, dissension and apprehension particularly among the self-employed.  Many of them now, perhaps justifiably, feel that that phrase is being used almost as a bad word at a time when above all else we need initiative, incentive and encouragement.</P>
      <P>The Minister would have done well to reflect on whether the bland generalities we heard from him would be appropriate in this debate.  He made some serious mistakes about the content and timing of some of his statements.  What he said today will do very little to allay the concern of those who have been loudest in their protests.  It will only fuel their reaction. The Minister said: &ldquo;In the four months since we came into office, we have already introduced substantial changes which are a clear indication of our commitment in this area&rdquo;.  The commitment is for greater tax equity and to relieve the burden of taxation generally. What have the Government done in their four months in office?  The projected tax revenue in the budget this year represents 36 per cent of GNP by comparison with 34 per cent last year.  Within that 36 per cent, income tax represents 38 per cent of total tax revenue by comparison with 36 per cent last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We hear &ldquo;let me make the point&rdquo; reassurances from the Minister from time to time but this will have little impact on those waiting to hear something significant from the Minister.  The reassurance which the Minister offers in his speech is not for those who have been protesting against the level of taxation.  He said: &ldquo; ...the proof of this is the spirited reaction from the variety of interested parties <Col N="1236" /> who will be at the receiving end of these new measures and who have been exerting pressure for modifications&rdquo;.  If we are to have a degree of equity we must ensure that there will be people at the receiving end and that is why I asked that we should have the Finance Bill as quickly as possible in its published form.  We must protect investment confidence.</P>
    <P>I am in agreement with the Minister on a number of areas particularly in relation to public expenditure.  However, let us look at the genesis of the problem.  What is significant about this tax revolt is that it occurred after the budget whereas previously tax revolts occurred before budgets were introduced and were an indication to the Minister for Finance of the day that adjustments needed to be made. I experienced this in my time as Minister. None of us wish to boast about our achievements as Minister for Finance in terms of popularity &mdash; it is not a place one looks for popularity &mdash; but the Minister would do well to recall that his predecessors adjusted the tax bands to take account of inflation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>As a consequence of the concern felt by married couples, particularly where a wife was working at home, I introduced the principle of the split income allowance. The recent tax revolt is unique in that it occurred after the budget which was meant to be, the Minister would claim, an instrument of equity in taxation. <Col N="1237" /> The impact of the budget this year will add a further 3½ per cent to the CPI. Take the 1 per cent income levy and the decision not to adjust the tax bands.  This will result in £190 million extra this year or £300 million in a full year to the Exchequer.  So much for their commitment to equity in taxation.  The budget has no strategy for employment.  That together with the impact on CPI has given rise to the demonstrations on the streets. The trade union leaders have said that. It is not just about taxation but about the &ldquo;no hope&rdquo; budget in terms of employment and the impact on poorer classes. The Minister would do well to recognise that it is sowing the seeds of unrest in society.</P>
    <P>We have to live with the effects of devaluation.  I warned about it at the time.  We are importing a further 7 per cent or 8 per cent of inflation.  The devaluation was damaging and unnecessary having regard to the trend of currencies, particularly sterling, outside the EMS. What I said at the time has been proved to be true earlier than I expected.</P>
    <P>Sometimes what happens is as a result of the Minister's actions and sometimes as a result of his statements.  There is a time for silence and a time for action. The Minister seems to pick the wrong times.  He gives bland reassurances such as he did today.  He makes statements such as that which he made to the CII, which was bad in its timing and in many ways inflammatory.  In a one sentence dismissal of the reaction of workers he said we could not have any deduction in taxation until we reduced expenditure. We all know this is a fact but to say it from the safe haven of the CII showed extraordinary judgement.  On the same day he fuelled the argument further by saying they were not going to have nonselective cuts in public expenditure.  He mentioned, among other things, the annual increases in social welfare for those who cannot help themselves, the old and the sick, in conjunction with the decision to look at food subsidies.  As a consequence of that, we had a further chapter in the &ldquo;Spring rebukes Dukes&rdquo; saga.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Finance makes <Col N="1238" /> a statement, foreign investors expect it to be an authoritive statement of the Government.  They do not expect it from the Minister for Social Welfare or the Minister for the Environment.  They expect the Minister for Finance to create a climate of stability so that their investments will be secure.  We have seen quite the opposite in this inter-reaction of trying to assuage one group in society by pointing the finger at another and implying that small investors in banks, building societies, post office savings and so on can all run for cover at this stage.  It is not surprising that a former member of the Minister's party, head of a building society, felt the need to make a statement recently to the effect that there was no possibility of disclosure of investors in that society by any action taken by the Government.  That, together with other information from the ACC, building societies and banks, must have signalled to the Minister that statements from Ministers recently are having a deadly effect on the liquidity and the savings deposits of these institutions.  The investment climate is being undermined by the Minister's reaction, rather than positive developments taking place.</P>
    <P>For the first time, the Minister recognised today that figures which he gave here for outstanding tax have further fuelled this whole reaction.  It took almost two pages to explain what was said here by him on 24 March 1982.  He must know that every newspaper report the following day headlined the Minister as indicating the amount of outstanding tax and that there was almost a billion pounds outstanding from the self-employed.  If the Minister had taken the trouble that day to explain the figures in much greater detail, as he has now done, the present frustration might not have built up.  If he had given those figures earlier as a statement of fact, it would have been very helpful and perhaps it would have stopped tax marches on our streets.  This is a matter of very serious concern for the democratic stability of the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the meeting in Barrettstown yesterday.  I note that a number of meetings have taken place in rather palatial splendour in County Kildare <Col N="1239" /> recently.  The Labour Party have found a nice castle as well which is quite appropriate to their recent positions.  We were told yesterday by the Government spokesman that there was no specific discussion on the tax question at the meeting in Barrettstown Castle.  If that is true it is extraordinary.  Neither was there any discussion on last week's marches.  A newspaper report asked was this because of any past or impending crisis.  Apparently, they discussed economic prospects up to 1987, giving the impression that the Government are determined to stay in power until then.  There is not much reassurance for anybody in that.  If they had found time yesterday to discuss the present crisis, to solve it and to publicly state that they were talking about the crisis and were concerned about the dangers to our democratic stability, at least we would have some degree of reassurance. We were issued with a bland statement of generalities which we could have heard from any Minister for Finance over the last five years.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister &mdash; and I said it a week before he did when I addressed a meeting of the junior chamber in Wexford &mdash; that the key to our problems is controlling public expenditure.  Therefore, I could hardly believe my ears when I heard Deputy Spring say in a radio interview that he was in favour of public expenditure.  The real issue is the control of public expenditure but also the target priorities within that public expenditure. Incidentally, one should not assume that the trade union leaders who were demonstrating are in favour of public expenditure. For example, Mr. Des Geraghty, National Group Secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union, called for a reappraisal of the various youth employment schemes and work experience programmes operated by the Department of Labour.  He is talking common sense.</P>
    <P>The Estimate for the Department of Labour grew from £45 million last year to almost £110 million this year.  That is a growth of a size and dimension that is unprecedented in the fiscal and economic experience of this country.  Can these two <Col N="1240" /> parties reconcile themselves to directing public expenditure, which must be controlled, to priority areas instead of watching the uncontrolled growth through all the agencies in which the Government take great pride?  There are employment agencies, equality agencies, who are now co-ordinating their actions by supervising each other.  There is a growth of administrative overseeing swallowing up the taxpayers' money to no particular purpose. If the Minister could explain the 125 per cent growth in one Department we might be reassured as to where this money is going.  He is in a very real sense a trustee of the taxpayers to see that not one penny of public money is wasted. There is training for the sake of training, experience for the sake of experience and so on.  I am not going into it in detail now, We are now told that the National Development Corporation will solve all our problems.  They will supervise what is going on.</P>
    <P>There is another matter which could be looked at in terms of public expenditure control and that is the Department of Health.  There have been enough signals already and perhaps the Minister would look at some of these areas and ensure that priorities in terms of prescription targets in that Department are adhered to.  This would effect quite a significant saving.  I have put this on the record of the House previously and if both Ministers look over my speeches for the last 12 months they will find something to help them.  If we look at public expenditure, these are the areas where we cannot reassure because the public are concerned that the tax that is paid is paid to maximum effect.  Lest I forget, I mention in debating taxation that we have a Commission on Taxation which I myself set up over two years ago.  This Minister has already treated that commission in a very dismissive way.  He has just dismissed whatever they had to say and it is quite clear not only from his words but also from his actions that almost everything he is proposing is running counter to the general trend of what they are suggesting.  There was a time when a summary of these would be brought to the Minister's attention and <Col N="1241" /> but for the short period available to us I could say a great deal more about this. The very introduction to their report, not to mention the terms of reference given to them, are totally and utterly ignored by the Minister and itsy-bitsy impositions are being introduced by him which run counter to the whole trend which the commission obviously are trying to set.  I hope they will not be frustrated and that this will not end up in just another exercise which will not have any considerable impact.

      <P>: I would advise the Minister to be very conscious of two final matters.  The only concern of the taxpayer is his net income and whether it can be undermined further by any further addition to the inflation spiral that we have been experiencing.  We had good news to an extent yesterday in the OECD Report of inflation trends over the six months to February which show that Ireland's inflation fell faster than that of any other of the 23 member states of the OECD.  We had a price rise of just 4.1 <Col N="1242" /> per cent in that time.  However, since February dramatic developments indeed have occurred in terms of the impact on the CPI of the Minister's actions.  Instead of reducing the level of inflation and increasing the value of the real incomes in the workers' pockets, we will see just the opposite in addition to the effects of the Minister's budget actions.  This Minister is the first in recent years to have the benefit of the impact of falling oil prices on our balance of payments and our deficits in every direction.  It is time that he recognised that a budget is not just a bureaucratic book-keeping exercise.  It is time that he recognised that the need to encourage a proper investment climate is at least as important as playing one end off against the other.  It is time that he recognised that incentive and initiative are essential elements in this society and that throwing threats around the place and sending everybody scurrying in every direction is doing nothing to reassure those people out there protesting.</P>
      <P>The Minister has my agreement about control of public expenditure but God knows if we will do it.  It is time that some of the stuff that the Government paraded, such as the reduction in the number of State cars and things of that nature, even as demonstrations, should be acted upon or else they should keep their peace in these areas and not add insult to injury.  I hope we will see a little more effective action and that at least we will not be fuelling further the reaction of the masses outside this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: A great deal of the public debate on the taxation question has centred around the PRSI system, so much so that PRSI and PAYE are synonymous in the public mind.  I want to concentrate on that aspect of our taxation discussion for 15 minutes or thereabouts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is critical that Members of this House, and employers and workers throughout the country, appreciate that PRSI is another form of taxation in effect on a different basis and that it is provided to ensure income maintenance for persons who are not in a position to obtain income due to sickness, unemployment, <Col N="1243" /> old age, widowhood and so on.  Those who are now complaining vociferously about PRSI and all of us must be reminded that we are perhaps the first generation who have brought about a national system of social insurance so that we protect the individual and the family against the contingencies of life in a way which cannot be achieved by the individual himself or by the family and can be done only on a collective basis by employers, by workers and by the State jointly sharing the cost of the provision of PRSI. That first point is of critical importance in understanding an integral part of our general system of taxation and social insurance, because both are directly intertwined.  I stress with great vehemence that when we attack the system of PRSI &mdash; and there have been some sustained attacks from the most unlikely quarters in recent weeks &mdash; we should remember that on a pure insurance basis alone some 88,000 workers who have no jobs at present get unemployment benefit from social insurance, some 67,000 persons in receipt of disability benefit receive benefits from social insurance, some 75,000 persons are in receipt of contributory widows' pensions alone and 103,000 persons are currently in receipt, and will be so for the remainder of their lives, of contributory old-age and retirement pensions.</P>
    <P>PRSI is compulsory.  That is a deliberate decision of the Government.  While one may have varying views about the contribution of William Norton's role in Irish public life, it must be admitted that in 1952-53 he introduced the social insurance system after decades of agitation by the trade union movement.  From a strictly economic point of view any compulsory payment is a form of taxation because it involves a statutory transfer of income towards expenditures which are determined by this House on behalf of the individual for the individual later in life or to meet contingencies he may have to face.  It is of critical importance that we bear that fact in mind.</P>
    <P>PRSI contributions are earmarked for expenditure on which the individual places a high priority and that expenditure <Col N="1244" /> goes to the Social Insurance Fund. This is concrete evidence of the existence of a right to benefit.  It has been argued &mdash; but I do not accept it &mdash; that social insurance should be financed exclusively out of general taxation.  The great advantage of the current system is that the contributions are clearly seen as a deferment of present consumption to provide, for example, for retirement and replacement income if and when the need arises.</P>
    <P>I want to defend the Oireachtas and our system of democracy against what I regard as unfair and eroneous attacks on the PRSI system which have been fomented in recent weeks.  It is very important that we make that defence as trenchant as possible because there are those who wish to dismantle that system. Our present system is in many respects an independent distribution of income from the healthy to the sick, from the employed to the unemployed and retired. As such it is a modern social insurance system and achieves a certain amount &mdash; not as much as I would wish &mdash; of vertical redistribution of income from those with the highest incomes to those with low incomes.</P>
    <P>Up to 1979 contributions had been flat rate.  This meant that all workers, irrespective of earnings, paid the same amount.  That system was very heavily criticised as a regressive system of taxation and social insurance.  It was particularly criticised as being inequitable in the way it affected lower paid workers. Up to 1979 workers who earned £40, £50 or £80 a week paid the same contributions as workers earning £100 or £140.  There was a need to change the system and in April 1979 the pay-related social insurance system was introduced.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that much of the present criticism has come from those in the higher income group.  Under the present PRSI system a fixed percentage of worker's earnings is paid by the employer and the employee.  In April 1983 the employer paid 11.6 per cent and the worker 5.5 per cent for social welfare, part of the PRSI contribution.  In other words, for every £1 PRSI a worker contributes, the employer is obliged to pay £2.  Let the trade union movement and <Col N="1245" /> those who are campaigning against PRSI remember that simple reality.  There is a ceiling of £13,000 for the income tax year from 6 April 1983.  Many progressive socialists argue that that ceiling should be abolished.  This year the income for the PRSI fund will be £1,019 million.  The employers will contribute 52.7 per cent, employees will contribute 25.6 per cent and the Exchequer will contribute 21.7 per cent from general taxation.</P>
    <P>I stress that we have a reasonably well developed system of social insurance, but if we could bring in all the self-employed and those in the farming community we would have a far better system.  At the moment the total number of persons qualifying for benefit each week under the insurance system is about 371,000 persons, to which must be added 285,000 dependants.  This is a major system and a great deal of the mythology about its alleged inequities should be counteracted by every responsible Deputy.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms about the reduced rates of PRSI paid by permanent and pensionable employees in the public sector.  It is important to point out that about 900,000 employees pay the full PRSI contribution rates while about 150,000 civil servants, teachers, gardaí, officers of the Defence Forces and employees of local authorities and other State bodies are covered by a reduced rate of PRSI.  It must be remembered that those paying full rates receive all the benefits under the social insurance system while those paying reduced rates qualify for a very limited range of benefits, namely, widows' and orphans' pensions and deserted wives' benefits.</P>
    <P>The exclusion of public servants from full insurance arises from the fact that when the present system was being established in 1952 the social security needs of these employees were seen to have been provided for under their conditions of service through the then occupational pay and pensions schemes.  I want to emphasise, lest there be public misconceptions about this matter, that the special PRSI tax allowance introduced last year, and retained this year at a slightly reduced rate, does not apply to persons in the public service who pay the lower <Col N="1246" /> rates of contributions.  In that respect there is a differential.</P>
    <P>When I saw a substantial number of teachers marching against paying PRSI and PAYE, it came home to me very forcibly that they pay one-third of the general rate of PRSI.  I am not sure I know what these people are complaining about because they pay only 2.9 per cent as against an 8.5 per cent rate, if one takes the levies into account.</P>
    <P>So one must be careful and ask one's fellow workers, whether on a march, at a meeting or at home: &ldquo;What do you pay?  What rate do you pay?  How much tax do you pay?&rdquo;  I say that as a voluntary contributor paying 6.5 per cent of my salary as a Member of the Oireachtas up to £13,000.  Lest people imagine we get pensions for nothing, I pay 6 per cent of my Oireachtas salary towards my Oireachtas pension.  In addition, I pay 6 per cent of my salary towards whatever prospect of a ministerial pension one might have later &mdash; I have views about that.  One pays and one should therefore always ask fellow workers, &ldquo;What do you pay?&rdquo;  In that way one gets the reality of the position.</P>
    <P>These are aspects which are important in the matter of collection of social insurance contributions.  They are normally collected by the Revenue Commissioners through the PAYE system.  In addition to the collection of PRSI, the PAYE system is also used for the collection of information on the duration of each employee's insurable employment, on which entitlement to flat rate benefits depends.  His reckonable earnings are used to calculate entitlement to pay-related benefits.  The total PRSI contribution is the amount deducted from the employee's pay, plus the amount payable by the employer.  This must be remitted to the Collector General within nine days of the end of each income tax or clendar month.  The moneys collected by way of PRSI are then transferred from the Collector General to the Social Insurance Fund on a regular basis.  I stress that under our legislation the employer is directly responsible for the payment of the entire contributions, but he is entitled <Col N="1247" /> to deduct the employees' share at the point of paying wages.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is in the interests of the employer to make the correct deductions at the proper times.  Otherwise he would be liable to bear the cost of the entire contribution as well as any arrears and, of course, any benefits which might be foregone by a worker in claiming benefits. At the end of the income tax year an employer must send to the Collector General within 25 days of the end of the year a comprehensive statement giving details of the employees' total remuneration in the preceding tax year, the amount of PRSI deducted and the number of contribution weeks in which each worker was in insurable employment.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of serious concern that a small minority of workers in some firms are attempting to disrupt the collection of PRSI contributions.  Lest there be any mistaken belief about that, I do not know of anybody in my party who is advocating that course of the non-payment of the PRSI contributions.  There seems to be some mythology that perhaps Mr. Matt Merrigan is a member of the Labour Party.  Thank God he has not been a member of the Labour Party for years. That is a point I would like to stress.  He has nothing whatsoever to do with the Labour Party, even though his union may be affiliated to the party.  I want to make that clear lest there would be any public misconception on this matter.  His views do not represent the broad views of the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>I again stress that the deliberate non-payment of social insurance contributions not only would deprive the State of revenue essential for the provision of social services but would jeopardise the entitlement of a worker and his family to social welfare benefits.  I can well understand the resentment that has developed in relation to the payment of PRSI contributions, particularly since they reached their present relatively high level, but I emphasise that there has not been an increase this year, none at all, in the actual rate of the contributions: all that has happened is that the contribution rates have been maintained but the ceiling <Col N="1248" /> has gone up from £9,500 to £13,000. It is only those workers who are earning more than £9,500 up to £13,000 who were expected to pay slightly more in PRSI contributions.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are the other levies but they do not go towards the PRSI income system.  Therefore, though I share the concern and the frustration of many PAYE people in regard to tax evasion and uncollected taxes &mdash; this is being dealt with in great measure in the Finance Bill which I am precluded from commenting on because it has not been circulated &mdash; it would be a retrograde step if employees were to indulge, one might say, in the same practice which they have vehemently criticised, namely, non-payment of tax.  It would not be to anybody's advantage, particularly in the matter of benefit entitlements.  It is well known that some employers avoid remitting PAYE tax and PRSI contributions for as long as possible.  That is a practice I have condemned wholeheartedly.  In 1981-82 the total PRSI contributions due to the Social Insurance Fund was £600 million and by the end of the year some £25 million, or 4 per cent, was still unpaid.  About £20 million of that will be collected this year, leaving £5 million, or less than 1 per cent, still outstanding.  In times of recession, with about 86,000 employers in the country, a collection rate of that effectiveness is reasonable. My inspectorate in the Department of Social Welfare have been particularly vigilant in ensuring that contributions are being fully paid.</P>
    <P>It is a policy of the Government to extend the social insurance system and, as I indicated, I intend to introduce a national income-related pension scheme, and therefore the whole question of extending social insurance to the self-employed will arise.  The quicker it will arise the better.  The self-employed, including farmers, represent some 25 per cent of the work force.  The extension of contributory social insurance to the self-employed would make for a more equitable distribution of the cost of social security than is the position under present arrangements.  It would mean that a greater part of the cost of income <Col N="1249" /> maintenance for the self-employed would be borne specifically by that group itself. At present under the non-contributory social assistance schemes the general body of taxpayers, including employees who are already contributing heavily as insured persons to the cost of their own social insurance, bear the total cost.  I will be pressing ahead with this fundamental reform as a matter of urgency.  In other words, I intend to extend the whole system of PRSI contributions to the entire labour force, not just to 75 per cent as at present.  The cost will then be borne on a broad national basis.  That will be a fundamental reform.</P>
    <P>Because the matters of PRSI and PAYE have become so interlocked in the public mind, it is important that we be careful in advising our fellow workers, men and women, about what exactly the system of social insurance is about, and distinguishing it from other aspects of income taxation in our community to ensure that no widespread misconceptions are fostered or allowed to develop. If that were to be so it might destroy or injure irrevocably a feature of Irish social policy, the redistribution of income, which has been built up painfully over the years and has led to a reduction of poverty within our community but which is still widespread.  This system must be developed if poverty is to be eradicated in the eighties.  If we continue that work in Dáil Éireann we will succeed in eradicating poverty, but we must all share in the cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>: I understand that we are to keep within the limits of a certain amount of time, 15 minutes, I think.  I just want to refer to a certain number of what I regard as very pertinent points.  I know the debate relates to taxation but, as the Minister said, you cannot isolate taxation from the other factors involved in the economy such as generating economic activity by private and Government expenditure and, of course, investment which is the all-important generator of economic activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I find it very hard to see how the Minister for Finance can accept a regressive taxation policy side by side with an investment <Col N="1251" /> policy which actively promotes less public capital expenditure and discourages private capital investment.  The only justification for taxation increases of any kind, particularly when they are regressive, is that the economy is being stimulated by way of increased capital investment both public and private in the productive sectors.</P>
    <P>A classic example of this was the major error made by the Government in the budget when £220 million was cut from the proposed capital expenditure budget inherited by this Government, covering basic infrastructure areas such as telecommunications, roads, housing, sanitary services, construction and industry, and mainly affecting the construction industry.  Apart from the fact that the construction industry generates economic activity and, with an increased work force, provides more taxation and a broader spread of taxation, it also has spin-off effects involving the utilisation, in Ireland in particular, of raw materials to the extent of 70 per cent to 80 per cent of inputs into the construction industry. There are also spin-off effects on the cement industry and the furniture industry, to mention only two.  Increased activity in industries like that leads inevitably to a further generating of incomes, further employment and further spin-offs in revenue take to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>That sort of thinking by the Government would justify taxation increases. They can be justified if there is also a positive investment policy.  With a regressive taxation policy side by side with a policy of reduced investment in the public sector and a lack of confidence in private investment particularly in the building and construction industry, there is a loss of confidence by the private sector of the building industry which fits into public sector investment and causes a further reduction in economic activity in the private and public sector of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>That is a pattern which leads to a policy of depression and further disemployment. This policy was adumbrated in the budget statement, which is entirely regressive and negative in all its attitudes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1252" /> It is in contrast with the positive approach taken in the report of the Commission on Taxation which the Government had to hand and which was published last July, practically a year ago.  It is a very formidable document running to 600 pages.  It is a compendium of all the recommendations required by any Government in the fields of taxation and related expenditure and investment, but primarily because of its terms of reference in the taxation field.</P>
    <P>I will go into some of the key conclusions reached by the commission.  Contrary to what was implied by the Minister, representation on the commission was widespread including Donal Nevin of the Congress of Trade Unions, a respected figure in the trade union movement.  The commission made some very important decisions which run counter to what we have in this budget.  This accounts for the dissatisfaction felt by the ordinary taxpayer, and in particular by the PAYE taxpayer, about the inequities in the recent budget and which will be dealt with further in the finance legislation.</P>
    <P>The massive feeling of rejection and frustration against the taxation system and its inequities on the part of the PAYE taxpayers flows from the fact that the Minister for Finance and the Government failed to implement a single recommendation in the commission's report, a single recommendation of any importance relating to the conclusions which I will mention.  I want to quote from page 42 of the report which sets out the key elements.  One is that income tax should be charged at a single rate on all income arising in the personal and corporate sector.</P>
    <P>Another recommendation was that the single rate of income tax should be lower than the current standard rate and should apply to a much more equitable and comprehensive definition of income than at present, including wages, salaries, profits, realised capital gains, lump sum receipts, gifts, inheritances and other windfalls.  The report stated that the extraordinary range of exemptions and deductions from income for tax purposes which narrow the tax base and result in <Col N="1253" /> higher tax rates should be abandoned. Only standard personal allowances given in the form of tax credits should remain. It was stated that the essential redistributive function of the tax and public expenditure systems should be achieved through direct payments at the bottom of the scale, through the choice of a level of personal credit and the tax rate in the middle income range and the imposition of a progressive direct tax on expenditure at the top of the scale.</P>
    <P>There was also another positive recommendation which runs counter to what the Minister for Social Welfare has stated but which is one to which Mr. Donal Nevin has agreed as one of the main people involved in the preparation of the report.  The commission stated that social insurance contributions should be replaced by a social security tax levied at a single rate on all income as we define it, including realised capital gains and taxable gifts and inheritances.  Another recommendation was that the tax system should be adjusted systematically to deal with the distortions arising from inflation through indexation of progressive tax structures and capital-income adjustments to take account of changes in the real value of liabilities and income-producing assets.</P>
    <P>I have referred to only a few of the nine recommendations of the Commission on Taxation, all of which have been completely ignored in the budget.  A short while ago we had what was called a comprehensive address by the Minister for Finance running to ten pages.  However, his speech did not contain a single reference to this report which contains practical, radical recommendations that could be implemented by the Government if they had the will.</P>
    <P>It is not as though something unique was being suggested in the matter of reform of the taxation system.  There is one country in the EEC which has the same type of economic and social structures that we have in Ireland, although on a much larger scale.  I refer to France. Because of the need there to capture a wide range of taxpayers and to provide a greater degree of equity, for a number of years there has existed a single tax system <Col N="1254" /> with definite compensations for the less well off sectors in the form of social welfare. That type of basic system recommended in the report of the Commission on Taxation is the only way forward if we are to make any progress.  The kind of regressive taxation in the budget will not help.  The extra 1 per cent levy across the board to be imposed on income taxpayers, the PRSI system and particularly the system introduced last year in connection with financing the Youth Employment Agency is inequitable and regressive and has been the cause of much of the annoyance felt by PAYE people recently.  They do not make any distinction between contributions and taxation.  They are worried about their take-home pay.  Income tax, PRSI contributions, the 1 per cent youth employment levy and other levies and social welfare contributions are taxes so far as the PAYE workers are concerned. The higher the levy payment in the overall contribution, the higher will be the degree of inequity that arises.  A flat 1 per cent payment on all taxpayers without regard to income creates anomalies and is inequitable.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation came down decisively on levies of this kind. They said they should be removed as quickly as possible from the tax code if any degree of equity was to be established. In order to get by, the Government introduced a 1 per cent rate on all income taxpayers and have persisted with the PRSI system but, at the same time, they have not even bothered to tell the public that they intend to treat seriously the positive recommendations contained in the report of the Commission on Taxation. If the Government are to re-establish their credibility with the tax paying public, they must indicate that they are not just using a patchwork device designed to yield extra millions of pounds, as was blatantly set out in the budget.  The Minister did not put any gloss on it.  He said the 1 per cent levy was strictly a revenue device to secure extra money without having any regard to the obvious inequity of the system which runs counter to the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.</P>
    <P>We must have social stability before <Col N="1255" /> we can have economic and investment stability.  There must be an indication from the Government and from the Minister for Finance that they intend to take seriously reforms in the taxation system which have been spelled out so directly in the excellent report of the Commission on Taxation which was commissioned by a Fianna Fáil Government.  Unless that is done, no progress can be made within the ambit of the present system.  There is no point in pretending that in the present system of taxation some money is available at the end of the rainbow and I was glad to hear the Minister for Social Welfare spell out that fact.  The Minister for Finance in a statement earlier today drew back from what he called a misinterpretation of statements he made previously. At the very least he had left the clear impression that by curbing evasion and avoidance techniques utilised in the present system there might be a large amount of money available to alleviate the situation with regard to PAYE workers.  That is not the case and I was glad to hear the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social Welfare, two Ministers who have spoken in this debate, point out that fact. There is no point in fooling people.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic.  In the present system of taxation there is no way inequities can be removed, revenue raised and incentives given to enable investment to take place.  I am not saying that the recommendations in the report on the Commission on Taxation can be adopted overnight but if they are shown to be under consideration and under detailed examination by the Government with a view to their implementation at an early date, at least it would be evidence of their bona fides that the matter was being considered seriously.</P>
    <P>Investment confidence is an important factor.  The question of real taxation reforms is important from the point of view of equity in the tax paying classes and also from the point of view of incentives so far as investment is concerned. The behaviour of the Government is a very important ingredient so far as confidence in investment is concerned.</P>
    <P>I ask the Government to consider very <Col N="1256" /> seriously the ill-effects of the contradictory view points expressed in statements by senior Ministers in regard to financing generally.  Financing and taxation are the kernel of running any community.  It is all about the creation of confidence, the raising of the level of investment and the provision of the necessary taxation without imposing any disincentives to the further creation of greater levels of investment. That is a thumbnail sketch of what investment is about in the public and private sectors.</P>
    <P>If the behaviour of Ministers in Government gives a rise to a lack of confidence in the implementation of our taxation system and their handling of public finances, one is straight away into an area in which investment just stops. The scene last week of very serious financial disagreement of a most fundamental kind in the running of a Government exhibited in public by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance does not do the country any good.  It does far more damage to investment than any other Government statement or attitude that I could think of.</P>
    <P>I make a particular appeal, in the national interest, that Government Ministers realise when they are talking about money, investment and taxation that these are very serious matters indeed which are treated very earnestly by investors all over the world.  We are all one global village and all these aspects are major considerations in making investment plans which depend on whether our climate of investment is a proper or appropriate one.  Generally, what is needed is a consistent and positive policy, particularly concerned with those reforms which are suggested in the form of the Report of the Commission on Taxation which has now been to hand for almost a year and in regard to which there should be some immediate statement of intent, at the very least, from the Government as to adopting and implementing, over a period of time, the recommendations contained in that report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad that Deputy Lenihan has drawn attention to the Report of the Commission on Taxation. It underlines the fact that one of the most <Col N="1257" /> firm plans in the joint programme of Government is the commitment by the Government to taxation reform.  The Deputy draws attention to the conclusions of this report.  However, if he had read on to the next sentence, he would have seen that the commission pointed out that these proposals constitute a formidable programme of tax reform which could not be carried through easily, or in a short time.  The report continues that many of the individual recommendations may be opposed but that they regard their proposals as a single package.  In other words, they are saying that this is something which cannot be done quickly and that they would like to see it done <i>en bloc</i>, not piecemeal.  Deputy Lenihan is not quite fair to the Government because it would not be right, as the Commission on Taxation warn against, that the recommendations which we like should be taken and those which we do not like left behind.  The Government must proceed with tax reform as an overall policy. Indeed, the Minister recently pointed out that it would be a very early priority of the Government.</P>
      <P>There are two sides to tax equity.  One, which we are discussing here, is reform of the tax code.  Equally important is reform of the tax administration.  In many ways, as a system of getting quick equity into our tax code that is a far more productive line of approach.  Our tax system is perhaps one of the most tortuous which could be dreamed up, certainly as it applies to the self-employed.  Their tax is assessed on a previous year's basis and then assessed by the tax commission, followed by a series of inquiries, appeals, adjudications, demands and ultimately enforcement if necessary.  By the very nature of that long system of tax collection and assessment, there are always substantial sums of outstanding tax in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the end of 1982, for example, there was £1,500 million in outstanding taxes. The Minister has rightly pointed out that this is not a crock of gold which can be quickly cashed in.  Of that £1,500 million &mdash; which applies to the three previous years &mdash; less than half, £500 million, was agreed in June, so the vast bulk is still <Col N="1258" /> under inquiry or appeal.  A further point is that over half of all that money referred to the tax year just gone &mdash; the 1981-82 tax year.  In terms of our system of collection, that is a very recent year.  It is difficult to get in taxes very quickly from that year under our present system.  Our system is a little like water flowing through a pipe.  The tax outstanding is the amount of water in the pipe at any given time and it is hard to flush all that out in a short time.  Essentially, under our system of collection, it proceeds slowly through the pipe.  This important consideration must be borne in mind when we contemplate how much can be got from just speeding up the process.</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of our tortuous system of tax collection is the large inequity between the PAYE and PRSI payer and the self-employed.  There can be absolutely no doubt about that at present. If we ignore the taxation on appeal and just take the amount of taxation agreed as due, the following picture emerges, in relation to the 1980-81 tax year as at the end of 1982.  The situation was that the PAYE and PRSI sector had paid up 91 per cent on time, 7 per cent was late and 2 per cent of that agreed due was not yet paid.  On the other hand, the self-employed were in the position that only 47 per cent was paid on time, 15 per cent was paid late and 39 per cent agreed due was not yet paid.  In other words, even ignoring the money on appeal, the self-employed are paying far later and time is money when one is talking about tax revenue.</P>
    <P>A further point is that there are substantial sums on appeal in reference to the self-employed, which is not at all the case with regard to PAYE payers.  That is the fundamental inequity in our tax collection system.  It is not so much that there is a crock of gold to be collected but that there is inequity between different types of taxpayers.</P>
    <P>There are also three other serious creaking points in our tax system.  One, which the Minister made clear in reply to questions earlier this year, is that interest on late payments is just not being collected by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1259" /> They are so pleased to reach a settlement that they ignore the interest which would have been due on late payments.  The figures which the Minister revealed showed about 1½ per cent <i>in toto</i> as being collected in interest on late payments which, when one considers that the penalty is supposed to be 1½ per cent per month, means that, effectively, the system is not being worked at all.</P>
    <P>Another creaking point to which I draw attention is that penalties levied on tax evaders, of which only very few are caught &mdash; about 100 last year &mdash; at 50 per cent are tiny.  In effect, it is cheaper than one would borrow money on a legitimate debt from a bank for a period of two to three years.  That, again, is a serious weakness in our tax administration system.</P>
    <P>A final very serious weakness in our tax administration system is that the legal enforcement procedures are creaking to a halt; they are very seriously deficient. The Auditor General drew attention to this.  In the last tax year 10 per cent only of the face value of tax sought was produced as a yield.  That was considerably worse than in previous years; it was 16 per cent three years ago.  Therefore, even though there may be an element of pure assessment that may never be realised, there is no doubt but that our legal enforcement system is seriously overstrained and is deteriorating in its ability to get in money.  I believe that those sorts of difficulties in our tax administration system are not lost on people who are willing to endeavour to defraud the tax code altogether.  The fact that there are no penalties for late payment and very little penalties for outright evasion will certainly act as an incentive to people to endeavour to avoid their due responsibilities.</P>
    <P>It is very pleasing to note that the Minister in his budget statement, and now, has promised further measures in the Finance Bill to tighten up this system.  He mentioned stiffer penalties, shorter appeals procedures, tighter disclosure arrangements for financial institutions and many other measures such as prison sentences and publication of names.  It is <Col N="1260" /> important when penalties are introduced that they be used, because I believe there are already considerable penalties within our tax code that can but are not now being used.  It is important that the Revenue Commissioners pursue these penalties vigorously.</P>
    <P>At this stage, with regard to the enforcement side of things &mdash; where obviously the Solicitor-General, the sheriffs and so on are seriously overstrained with work &mdash; it would be a wise idea to take in private consultants to have a look at our tax collection procedures, making it clear that they would have to report in a very short time to see how we can speed up these procedures.  The sums produced from reforms and findings of that nature should be clearly used to relieve the PAYE sector, that that should be shown to be the case and an explicit statement made to that effect.</P>
    <P>Having dealt with what I believe to be commendable moves by the Minister to tighten up our tax system &mdash; and there are several loopholes that will be tightened up &mdash; the situation still begs the question that there is need for a thorough-going change in our system of tax collection.  We must move towards the self-assessment system for the self-employed which would bring it much closer to the &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system and would complement the Minister's move already to put the self-employed on the same year tax basis.  That would constitute the greatest reform, making the PAYE and self-employed sectors seen to be on the same basis.  Many people have criticised that idea, maintaining that it would be a charter for evasion.  I do not believe that would be the case if, firstly, there are introduced stringent penalties and, secondly, a system of random and exhaustive checking of certain taxpayers &mdash; perhaps one in 20 &mdash; who would be placed under very severe scrutiny with very severe penalties for abuse.</P>
    <P>Under such a scheme we could operate a self-assessment method.  It is about time we moved towards such a scheme, particularly when one considers that not only do the United States use it but Britain, which has a tax code similar to ours, are introducing it in so far as they have initiated <Col N="1261" /> a pilot scheme in this respect. There is very strong argument for such a scheme.  I would not accept any argument that it is impractical.  Its advantages are many, four of which spring to my mind immediately.  First, it would release inspectors' time to tackle the real problem of tax evasion.  With each inspector having to handle approximately 800 files I reckon the sort of time he could give to an individual tax file would be approximately one hour.  Therefore there would be plainly no opportunity for an inspector to visit premises or go into great depth in regard to tax returns if that were the sort of time available to him.  A self-assessment system would release time to him for much more detailed examination of individual tax returns.  The other great advantage is that collection and assessment would occur on the same day.  Great attention has been given to the fact of taxes outstanding in an amount of over £1 billion.  But if we had a self-assessment system, on the day appointed at the end of the year when the self-assessment was made the cheque would issue with that assessment.  In other words, the Government would have the money in their pockets and appeal would not occur, as it does now, with the Government out of pocket for the whole of the self-employed person's tax due.  Another advantage of self-assessment would be that it would take the legitimate taxpayer out of the annual entanglement many self-employed taxpayers face by way of long series of letters and costly exchanges with the Revenue Commissioners merely to establish their fair tax liability.</P>
    <P>However the most important advantage is that it would demonstrate visible equity in that both the self-employed and PAYE would be on a &ldquo;pay as you go&rdquo; system.  That would constitute tremendous progress.</P>
    <P>The report of the Commission on Taxation is a valuable one to which we must give great consideration, but within the short time available on this debate we cannot give it the justice it deserves.</P>
    <P>There are a few anomalies in our tax code to which I should like to refer.  One is on the question of disclosure.  At present we have a system that is discriminatory <Col N="1262" /> between certain types of financial institutions as to the rules of disclosure. The building societies are treated far more favourably than are the banks.  I cannot see any reason, in logic or equity, for treating some financial institutions differently from others.  Both should have the same disclosure arrangements, both should have the same withholding tax arrangements and indeed the same balancing calculations of tax due for individual taxpayers.  Another important reform would be that all institutions should have to check the bona fides of overseas accounts.  At present, as we know, overseas accounts do not have to be reported to the Revenue.  There is the widespread belief that many overseas accommodation addresses are being used in this country to avoid legitimate tax due.  That is one anomaly that must be removed from our tax code.</P>
    <P>I would seriously consider also the Commission on Taxation's point that there is excessive disincentive to saving under our present system where all the nominal value of interest is assessed for taxation.  There should be some indexation clause written in there to give greater incentive to save.  I can see no reason for operating different disclosure arrangements for different types of financial institutions.</P>
    <P>A second area where anomaly arises is that in the capital gains area.  A serious anomaly obtaining there is that Government stockage enjoy complete exemption from capital gains tax which would be paid by any other investor.  The Minister is endeavouring to do something about that.  He has announced that disclosure of all transactions in Government bonds will have to be made.  It is only right that that anomaly in our tax code be removed as a matter of priority.</P>
    <P>A third area I should like to mention is that of section 23 lending.  This is a concession which has been remarkably successful in relation to getting residential property investment.  I cannot see why this concession which is afforded to one type of activity, the construction of dwellings for letting, should not equally be afforded to the more productive type of investment in our industrial sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1263" /> There is a need overall in our tax code and our grants system to examine the situation whereby our tax codes and our grants are very much more pressing investable funds towards the property end rather than towards the productive investment end of economic activity. More concessions should be afforded to the industrial and productive ends of investment where, after all, we can look to permanent jobs and not just jobs during the construction period only.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>: Of course.  That is an important direction for reform to be moving towards.  Perhaps it would be difficult to proceed rapidly in that direction with the building industry in such difficulties. If one looks back over the years where we had very high investment ratios but not high growth in employment one will see that one of the reasons was that funds generally were encouraged towards property rather than towards productive investment that would provide jobs in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A final point which I should like to make about what I consider to be anomalies in our tax code is the relationship between new capital investment by companies compared to new employment by companies.  The capital investment has a series of generous assistances.  There are grants, capital write-offs and interest on money borrowed for capital investment is allowable; but taking on new employment is open to a payroll tax and also ties an employer to future costs.  For example, if redundancy eventually occurs that employer is bound by our social welfare and redundancy payment codes to pay. In a real sense there is a heavy investment and commitment by employers in taking on new employees.  The tax code, far from alleviating that, has aggravated it. In the context of reform of our tax code we must look at the balance of incentives between investment in capital and the taking on of employees by companies. Greater employment is our essential objective and it is regrettable that our tax code over the years has evolved types of <Col N="1264" /> taxation and grants that militate against that profound objective.  I hope that in the near future we will have a more thorough debate on the report of the taxation commission, a document worthy of a debate here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: When I was informed that this debate was to take place I was very pleased.  It was most unusual that it should be ordered because there was not a motion on the Order Paper but it appears that with the Government and Opposition Whips agreeing that the credibility of the House was at stake we should discuss the major issue of the moment, taxation policy.  I was a bit naive in accepting in good faith that that was the purpose of the debate but now that it has gone on for a number of hours I have got the drift of its purpose: a continuation of a debate that has been going on in the media since the great tax march last Wednesday.  The great phrase we have heard is that there is no crock of gold, the £1,000 million is all nonsense and those who use that figure are only adding on three noughts.  We have been told that there is practically no money outstanding and the whole purpose of the speech by the Minister for Finance today was to stress that the money is not there in spite of the fact that in reply to Dáil questions, he told us that the money is there. The Revenue Commissioners, and the Comptroller and Auditor General, have given us the figure but today the Minister told us that those figures are misleading, are only estimates.  The Minister said:</P>
      <P>The only guideline I can point to is that between mid-1982 and the end of the year the figure reduced by £250 million.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what figure reduced by that amount.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of this reduction, some 10 per cent was brought into the Exchequer with the balance discharged as not being properly due.  If this pattern were to continue in respect of the end-year figure, then the balance ultimately paid <Col N="1265" /> into the Exchequer would be no more than £90 million to £100 million.</P>
    <P>In response to that statement the Fianna Fáil spokesman, Deputy O'Kennedy, said the Minister should have explained the position some months back and he was now admitting that the figures he gave earlier were wrong.  Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and the Minister for Social Welfare who added his tuppence worth on the PRSI question, are trying to show that the agitation about unfair taxation is eye-wash.  They accept that there is some injustice, that it must be tidied up but say that there is not a crock of gold.</P>
    <P>I should like to know who used that phrase, a crock of gold, first.  It was never used by the trade union movement. There is big money out there irrespective of what one calls it.  Deputy Richard Bruton, who has put down many questions in recent months on taxation, used figures which are contrary to those of the Minister for Finance.  The Deputy got those figures from the Minister for Finance in the course of a reply to a Dáil question on Tuesday, 1 March 1983.  The Minister for Finance today denied those figures.  According to Deputy Richard Bruton £1,500 million is outstanding but the Minister for Finance said the figure was £1,000 million, a difference of £500 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>: Deputy Richard Bruton said that much of the £1,500 million outstanding is under appeal and that only £500 million had been agreed as being due to be paid.  My calculations did not go that high and the CAG said the figure was £350 million.  However, I knew the figure due was higher than the figure mentioned by the Minister for Finance, £90 million to £100 million.  Deputy Richard Bruton has told us that £500 million has gone through all the appeals, delays and everything else and is due to be paid but has not been paid.  That could be <Col N="1266" /> described as a crock of gold and a big one.  It could reduce the budget deficit enormously, help to alleviate the PAYE sector and the Minister for Social Welfare who had to introduce such a shocking Bill recently.</P>
      <P>The question of tax evasion can be looked at in three different ways.  There are those who are not registered, they are lost and hidden in little attics.  There are those who are registered but are not returning their income or are returning a lower figure than they should.  Finally there are those who are registered, who have been assessed and have gone through all the appeals but still have not paid.  The £500 million we are talking about is only one portion of the outstanding taxes.</P>
      <P>The problem of people who were not registered for tax was not tackled until 1979 when a special inquiry branch was set up in Dublin.  Investigators from the Revenue Commissioners went along the streets knocking at doors and discovering new companies.  In three years they discovered 24,000 previously unregistered self-employed people.  The inquiry unit should be extended to cover all parts of the country, not just Dublin.  They discovered self-employed traders, newly registered companies and professional people such as engineering consultants, solicitors, accountants, doctors and so on.  These people have various ways of hiding and when discovered they may still escape and hide again.  The inquiry unit has undoubtedly been of great value and should be extended.</P>
      <P>There is also the problem of people who are registered for tax but do not declare their income.  We are all aware of the doctor who is paid a fiver which he puts into a drawer.  This is common practice and receipts are not given for these cash transactions.  It is a very difficult problem to deal with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party have recommended to three different Governments that a system of random sampling should be introduced whereby certain people are subject to in-depth examination and inquiry.  This system has been in use in the United States for a number of years and there is also a sampling system in the <Col N="1267" /> UK.  The report of the UK Public Accounts Committee published on 28 April 1982 indicated that in 1981 2.8 per cent of self-employed and 1 per cent of companies were examined in this in-depth fashion and the results showed that only 13 per cent had no understatement, while 87 per cent of those examined understated their income.  Under such a system of random sampling severe penalties should be imposed on people who are understating their income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton said that £500 million is due in taxation.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General dealing with the business sector states that taxes due to 31 December 1981 and not under appeal amounted to £224.3 million in non-PAYE income tax, £91 million in corporation tax and £21.9 million in PAYE deducted from workers but not paid to the Revenue Commissioners, a total of £337 million.  I would suggest that this is a crock of gold particularly when we are referring to only one area of tax evasion.  Those figures do not include VAT.  I have not the figure for the amount of VAT outstanding but it must be very substantial and could amount to several million pounds.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton also referred to the system of taxing the self-employed.  It is completely different from the system used for PAYE workers.  If the Revenue Commissioners believe that a PAYE worker has income which he is not declaring, penal taxation is immediately imposed and that tax is deducted from his salary.  If the self-employed are put on penal tax they are simply told that if they do not delcare their income they will be charged £10,000.  Long appeal procedures then ensue while nothing is paid, but the PAYE worker must pay tax during the course of his appeal.  If his appeal is successful the amount of tax overpaid will be refunded but he will not receive any interest.  If a self-employed person pays too much tax he will be paid interest at the rate of 1.5 per cent per month.  This represents a very substantial income for that person, far more than he would get from investing in a building society and it comes tax free from the <Col N="1268" /> Revenue Commissioners.  This is a very clever device used by many of the self-employed, so much so that the Revenue Commissioners are afraid to charge them too much.  This is holding back the whole system and it is totally unfair that workers whose money is deducted at source get no interest whatsoever on over-payments while the self-employed receive a very high percentage payment.</P>
    <P>The differing attitudes in relation to PAYE workers and others became very clear some weeks ago when the Waterford Glass workers began their protest. I do not support their refusal to pay and our party have never supported it, but they were immediately attacked and told that the Offences Against the State Act would be used against them if they refused to pay their taxes.  I recall that two years ago a resource tax was imposed on farmers.  This was a legal tax which was included in the Finance Act.  The farmers met and stated publicly that they would refuse to pay that resource tax. They did not pay it but action was not taken against even one farmer for that refusal.  Whereas £7 million was expected to accrue, only £700,000 came to the Exchequer.  Last year the Fianna Fáil Government in their Finance Bill took the unprecedented step, never taken before in any other country, of refunding £700,000 to the small percentage of honest farmers who paid their resource tax. The others are allowed to forget about it. The Fianna Fáil Government were saying that when they put on the tax and the farmers refused to pay it they were giving it back to those who paid it and they would try to think of some tax the farmers would not mind paying because it would be so small.  That is the attitude which brings people on to the streets in great anger.  They see everybody else treated in a completely different manner, people who can decide if they will pay or will not pay their taxes and they see the health contributions for the self-employed outstanding by £7.957 million and tax from farmers outstanding by £8,359,000, which is over £16 million outstanding in health contributions.  There are many more medical cards around the country than there are in Dublin.  Those people <Col N="1269" /> are getting the benefits but they are not paying a penny.</P>
    <P>In relation to the youth employment levy from the self-employed a sum of £11.5 million is outstanding and from farmers £5.5 million is outstanding.  The total amount between the health contributions and the youth employment levy is £19 million outstanding from the self-employed and £14.5 million from farmers. This is what drives people mad.  The workers are saying that other people can decide if they will pay their taxes and they want the same right to choose.  There is nothing done to those people when they do not pay.  The only property workers have is their week's wages.  The workers are saying that they have never got a week's wages into their pockets. They are saying they are entitled to their week's wages and they can then decide when they will pay their income tax or any other taxes.  The workers want the same right as everybody else to decide if they will pay their taxes.</P>
    <P>I advise the Minister for Finance to tear up his glib statements and realise what is happening.  If the workers decide, the same as everybody else is allowed to decide, that they will not pay their taxes the whole country will come to a standstill. The workers will make those decisions pretty quickly.  There is no use trying to say there is no money outstanding when we know that a large sum of money is outstanding.  Some people laugh at the whole taxation system, get all the benefits and grants they can and do not pay anything.</P>
    <P>The workers have never refused to pay their taxes.  In the great tax marches of three years ago they did not say they wanted to do away with the PAYE system of taxation.  They simply said they wanted a just, fair and equitable tax system. The Government got the warning and the message.  Everybody thought the matter was defused and that was the end of the story.  It is not the end of the story. What we saw last week is just a beginning of a campaign that will not stop this time but will keep going on until action is taken and the workers see that everybody else pays a fair amount of tax.  The workers are quite prepared to pay their <Col N="1270" /> taxes and to make sacrifices if they see hope for the future and if they see a purpose to it.  There is no purpose to this, there is no promise and there is no function in relation to the payment of taxes. There are only more cutbacks.  I want to emphasise that what happened three years ago will not happen on this occasion. This tax campaign will be fought to a finish.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am pleased to have the opportunity of making a brief contribution to this important debate.  I want to make two basic points and, as far as possible, I will try to avoid repeating what has been the theme of the afternoon.  The two points are, firstly, reform of the taxation system is needed but the reform must be fundamental and much of the concern of this debate and perhaps the concern of the public controversy are not germane to real and fundamental reform at all.  The second point I wish to make is that much of the public protest and the trends in that direction are inimical to real progress and are detrimental to the interests of those who seek the change.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's contribution and to other contributions. I accept there is much agitation and quite justified concern about the need for greater equity, the need to deal with evasion and the need to clear up anomalies and injustices in the system.  I suggest that the system needs examination also.  We should not let this debate go without questioning the basic premise underlying our taxation system.  I refer specifically to the PAYE income tax system. The preoccupation with evasion, with spreading the load wider and including people who do not pay tax into the net is fine but in essence it is secondary and peripheral to much more fundamental concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation did very fine and useful work under the chairmanship of Miriam Hederman-O'Brien and is a very helpful reference book in this area.  The terms of reference with which they were charged were, I suppose understandably, circumscribed to a proposal to overhaul the present structure.  I am not oversatisfied that fundamental questions may have been asked about the PAYE system even in the context of that very voluminous report although I believe there is an enormous amount of good <Col N="1272" /> work being done by that commission.  I believe there are lessons to be learned arising from their recommendations.</P>
    <P>The essential question is not how we clear up questions of evasion or bring more people into the tax net but how we create a system which raises revenue for the State and yet encourages initiative and enterprise.  Ironically, much of the taxation system, whether it is PAYE or PRSI cannot be said to be other than directly repressive of energy, initiative and enterprise.  As the base constricts and evasion grows the irony is that those who produce most and work hardest are those who are very often asked in those circumstances to bear a greater burden.  There are all kinds of peripheral questions here, including the growth of public expenditure and the need for some redress, in that very frightening spectre.</P>
    <P>I want specifically to deal for a short while with the PAYE system.  First of all, the marching we witnessed must be fully understood and accepted as being an expression, even though some of us might believe somewhat misguided, of righteous anger and understandable concern that despite agitation over the years precious little appears to have been done. There is ample evidence to indicate that there is injustice in the tax system. Recently we saw reports relating to comparisons between urban and rural household incomes and the manner in which the distribution of resources was assigned between those two areas.  I have often bemoaned the fact that there is increasing division between urban and rural in this area.  There are clear lessons to be learned from the article by J. Higgins in the magazine <i>Farm and Food Research</i> last month.  Comparisons between the spending power of farm and non-farm households is available in that magazine. There are injustices which could be removed if the political will existed to do so.  There is no other way out.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Were the differences between the farming community alone or between urban and rural?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: Within the farming community <Col N="1273" /> itself, the non-rural town house and the rural house.  There were problems and comparisons to be drawn between strictly rural and people in urban areas.  The differences were so great as to suggest a structured discrimination against people living in urban areas.</P>
      <P>Does the PAYE system serve the need it was originally designed for?  It was a system which we inherited, as we did so much of our legislation, from the British. It is based on certain principles which are illusory.  The fundamental question should be how to release the natural instinct of man to work.  How do we reward good work and discourage the opposite?  It seems that those who work hard are quite often expected to carry disproportionate burdens.  I am not talking about people who cannot find work but about those who are not interested in working or have no desire to do so.  They should not be rewarded for that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at some of the assumptions underlying the PAYE system.  It is assumed that it is a tax on employees. There is evidence to indicate that is not the case.  The tax element is a major irritant to those paying PAYE and fuels their understandable anxiety about the way economic trends are going.  In truth, income tax ostensibly paid by the average worker is paid by the employer and is in a sense a tax on production and employment. I do not offer this as something I am definite about at this stage but rather as a suggestion for consideration.  The PAYE system is not essentially a tax on income but rather a tax on employment. It is ultimately borne by the employer.  If the amount of tax which goes to the State is increased, employees demand higher take-home pay.  We could argue that the tax system is repressive as far as job creation is concerned, that it is a tax on production and on the product of the business itself, perhaps simply a part of the Government's share of the value added by the company or undertaking concerned.  The real earnings from employment comprise a man's disposable income.  Any increase in tax which impinges on that disposable income is inevitably shifted to his employer by a demand for higher wages or salaries.  It <Col N="1274" /> always comes back to the employer since for the employee the proper rate for a job is what appears in his or her pay packet and give or take a few pence that is what they expect.</P>
    <P>Despite the significant rise in gross take-home pay over the last 23 years, which would indicate that in real terms the employee had a much higher standard of living, the facts point elsewhere.  In 1960, as a percentage of GNP gross wages and salaries represented 45.4 per cent and net wages and salaries were 43.4 per cent.  In other words, the actual rake off to the State was 2 per cent.  In 1978 gross wages and salaries represented a substantial increase at 54.9 per cent of GNP. However, when one looks at the net wages and salaries, the take-home pay of employees, the figure was 41.6 per cent, which is slightly less than it was in 1960.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: Is that direct tax only or is everything included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>: It is purely direct taxation. During that time the State's take had increased from 2 per cent to 13.3 per cent.  There are reasons for that, but it is maligning the work force to pretend that over the years they never had it so good. It raises serious questions about public expenditure in terms of efficiency and productivity.  We should reconsider our system of taxation.  It is quite arbitrary. It seeks to levy tax on employees without any reference to the ability of that sector to pay.  If we accept my previous suggestion, which is that the employer ultimately pays the tax, then we can see that to continue to exact tax from each employee, whether in the clothing industry, banking or whatever, regardless of the capacity of that element which eventually pays the tax to pay, will cause problems.  We are taxing employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us take the clothing industry which we all know is in distress.  They recently approached us about PRSI.  They said it was a tax on employment.  I do not go all the way with that because there is social good from it.  Employment in the apparel trade has decreased from 32,000 in 1973 to 21,500 in 1981.  Imports as a percentage of home consumption have risen from 48 <Col N="1275" /> per cent in 1976 to 78 per cent in 1981.  In other words, the apparel industry is in difficulty.  Every employee in that industry is expected to pay the same tax to the State as employees in other sectors where their added value and ability to generate more revenue for their sector is far greater.  I appeal to the Minister to look at these points and consider reform in a fundamental way.</P>
    <P>As regards protests, they are very negative and incipient steps towards a state of anarchy.  I do not want to overdramatise it but recent comments included a trade unionist encouraging witholding of PRSI in Waterford.  I heard a trade union leader say on the radio that we should &ldquo;put the boot into the Government&rdquo;, as if the Government existed apart from the people and had some kind of extra terrestrial origin.  I have seen a trade union leader exhorting members to agitate for the refund of the £10 fee for examinations which the Government recently introduced. Even though I am not an enthusiastic advocate of that measure, I abhor anyone exhorting people to break the law.  I have seen a trade union leader on television justifying the witholding of payments and I heard a spokesman for ACRA last night saying they will refuse to pay local charges.  These are very dangerous trends and this protest is leading us only one way.</P>
    <P>We must accept that protest has to be available as a means of ventilating concern; but there is a need for great leadership, not just at Government level but also at trade union level.  Many of the trade unions are fighting battles which they have already won.  We should look not only at the reform of taxation but at the umbrella of structures dealing with conflict in the workplace, because the place ultimately to resolve difficulties should be around a table and not in the streets.  The logic of people stopping work in the middle of a week is suicidal in its implications and the very last thing we need.  I suppose I would be ridiculed if I suggested that if future protest marches take place they should be held on Saturdays when workers would not injure each other.  We must all use our <Col N="1276" /> best resources.  I ask the Minister not merely to look at the issues he has raised today but also the fundamental issues of how we can unleash the good that is in our work force.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am very disappointed at the speech which the Minister for Finance made today.  There is no light at the end of any tunnel.  He talked about the heavy social expenditure and how he had to get money in by taxation in order to cope with it.  The burden of his speech was evasion, evasion and evasion of taxation. Deputy Mac Giolla correctly pointed out that the Minister was the chief culprit in talking about evasion but is now running for cover saying there is not so much evasion after all.  I know a good deal of what the Minister says is true, that the figure which was given originally included assessments&mdash;and sometimes the tax people simply throw in a large assessment to frighten the living gizzard out of the taxpayer and bring him quickly to the office lest he be put out of house and home.  If somebody is malevolent enough to give a name, as happened in my constituency recently when a man living in a labourer's cottage with two acres of land got a bill for £500, that would be included in the global figure which was being bandied about as tax which was owed.  There is truth in the statement by the Minister but the propaganda was started by him and others, for what purpose I do not know.  In these assessments they seem to just think of a number in order to draw the taxpayer in.</P>
      <P>I could not help smiling wryly when I read what the Minister said about social commitment when for a mere bagatelle he decided that the oral examinations in modern languages are to be wiped out in the schools simply to save a half a million pounds or £1 million.  This is ridiculous in the context of taxation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach told me today that we paid £25 million for potatoes imported last year.  That would nearly pay for the total school transport system about which there has been such a brouhaha quite recently.  We behave in a crazy fashion. This year we have a superfluous supply <Col N="1277" /> of potatoes.  Next year we will probably have no potatoes and we will be paying money to import them from Cyprus or New Zealand where poor quality potatoes come from.</P>
    <P>The general subject of the severity of the taxation policy of the Government has been well debated.  I read the report of the Commission on Taxation and I am not going to deal with anything on the broad philosophic level as Deputy Keating did.  My own contribution will be mainly concentrated on the area around the Border but, before that, I want to correct something which Deputy Mac Giolla said.  Fianna Fáil did not pay back the resource tax as Deputy Mac Giolla alleged.  This was a decision of Deputy Bruton and Deputy Dukes in the budget of July 1981.  It was in their election manifesto and they were responsible for paying the resource tax.</P>
    <P>I mentioned in the House already that this budget, its direct taxation, increase in PRSI and especially the increase in excise duty and VAT have practically killed commerce in the Border area.  I do not think the Minister or the House realise how serious it is for the commercial and general life of the community which I represent, plus the community in Louth, Leitrim, Sligo and Donegal.  As the House knows, it all arises from a Border which should not be there in the first place and which set up all kinds of artificial patterns in trade since it was first foisted upon the country because in my area Belfast was the commercial capital. The commercial pull was to Belfast rather than to Dublin before the Border was established.  The same is true of Donegal and Derry.  A savage gash was inflicted by the imposition of the Border in the first place on the commercial life of that area but we have compounded the error by all our activities since 1922.  We have closed the railways in that area and the taxpayers there are contributing to a £76 million subsidy to the railways and derive no benefit from it despite the fact that we were promised extra money for roads in the area when the railways were done away with.  The closure of the railways affects the two counties of my constituency, <Col N="1278" /> the western part of the Six Counties and Donegal in particular.</P>
    <P>I would like to make a point to the budding economist.  There has not been any in-depth economic study of the problems created by the Border for the Border areas.  Whatever economic research has been done has been done on a &mdash; if it is not too big a word for such a small entity &mdash; global basis for the whole Six Counties, the major portion of which is in the eastern part in and around Belfast city.  Studies with regard to the Twenty-six Counties have generally been about the whole country but there has not been any in-depth study of the effect on the economies of the Border areas.  I suggest that it would be a very good idea to do that now with a view to finding out what measures &mdash; governmental, local or private &mdash; can be taken to remedy the effects of this disastrous budget.</P>
    <P>We had a visit from the Economic and Social Committee of the EEC.  They have no power to take action.  As the chairman of the committee said, they have no <i>pouvoir</i>, but they have compulsion.  They have not the power.  They were appalled at the situation industrially, commercially and socially, along the Border. They were prepared to admit that.  One does not wash one's native linen too much in public before visitors and those of us who made a contribution when they visited refrained from attacking our Government in the presence of people from the economic and social committee who were foreign to us.  I consider this a good principle to go on.  It could have been said that much of the trouble at present in that area is directly due to the taxation policy of the Government as shown in this budget.</P>
    <P>Many people are now aware that from a social point of view and from the point of the workings of the Department of Justice it is having a very deleterious effect on the inhabitants around the Border. I am referring to wholesale smuggling which is bound to result from this. Busloads are now travelling from all over the country, from the south of Ireland, from Dublin as well as from the Border counties, to purchase goods in the Six <Col N="1279" /> Counties with a consequent loss to the Revenue Commissioners here, to the excise people and to VAT also.  Border traders made out a long and detailed document and sent it to the Minister for Finance.  I have not time here to deal with it but it takes up all these aspects of the budget and the effect it is having on the area there, and I am making an appeal now to the Minister for Finance and to serious-minded Members of this House to take cognisance of what is being done by deliberate Government action in that area by way of damaging the communities along the Border right around from Donegal to Louth.</P>
    <P>We are hopefully building up a tourist industry based on coarse fishing and game fishing.  The Government aid in that regard is to increase VAT on the hotel charges in the area.  The political aspects are also important and they have been touched on already by some people in the course of this discussion on taxation. Where you have unemployment, as you will have, in the distributive trades and in industry and a large number of very active young people with the advantage of a post-primary education, which their grandfathers did not have, you are preparing a very dangerous social recipe, particularly along the Border where the emotive issues and the very existence of the Border add fuel to any fire created by the Government action in this regard.  As a result you will have destabilisation, and plenty of people are quite anxious to see our society in general destablished and in particular the society along the Border.</P>
    <P>On a national scale we cannot reiterate often enough how important the capital budget is for the country in general.  I know that Ministers and economists have said that perhaps our capital investment was not as good as it might be, that it was not producing the results it might produce. In the construction industry, and particularly in areas which are not heavily industrialised, capital investment in worthwhile infrastructural projects, projects that will assist the industrial and agricultural development of an area, is essential.  We had an austere programme. There is no question about that.  We do <Col N="1280" /> not deny it and to do so would be hypocritical. We campaigned up and down the country on the document <i>The Way Forward</i> but we had a plan for substantial capital expenditure particularly in the areas that would bring quick results from the point of view of employment.  The taxation imposed &mdash; direct, excise and VAT &mdash; has been severe and I do not see how anybody could but understand the people who are marching, but my real sympathy is with the people who have no jobs.  My real sympathy is with the areas where traditionally people as soon as they were finished at one time in the national school had to head off mainly to Britain and the US.  There is no place to go now and we have a more sophisticated work force.  Again, here is a recipe for severe social unrest.</P>
    <P>I have been requested by traders of the area to ask the Minister for Finance to employ more customs and excise officers. There is a ban on the employment of extra officials in the public service.  He might look at that and it might be helpful if he did so.  People are shopping from all over the country in the Border area and some of our shops are being closed down or opened for only part of the day.  I want to refer to one thing which public commentators in the media particularly are saying now.  They are saying, &ldquo;Well, you cannot blame the people, the prices are so low.  You are not going to criticise them for going across the Border and purchasing&rdquo;.  I do not go along with that grá mo chroí approach to this because the very people who are getting old age pensions, disability pensions, children's allowances, agricultural grants and so on are getting them from our Exchequer. They need not go to Stormont or Westminster if they are looking for that money.  Consequently when they are spending and enriching the UK Government, which is what they are doing, they are doing harm to the place that they themselves are drawing their money from.  I am prepared to argue with any person I meet who puts up that kind of argument.  I am prepared to argue with people who are dependent on the State here for direct payments who have argued with me that it is a good thing for <Col N="1281" /> them &mdash; after all they have so many children to feed &mdash; to go up and make purchases in the Six Counties.  I do not accept that.  They are taking up children's allowances from here to benefit another exchequer.  Where do third-level grants come from?  Where do agricultural and housing grants come from?  We should establish a climate of opinion that the person who does that kind of thing is doing damage to the country.  In Sinn Féin times when that organisation was first established people went to no end of trouble and extra expense to themselves to support their own.  I may be laughed at, it is naive, simplistic and so on, but I must continue to say that that is what I believe in.</P>
    <P>Some people have suggested that there should be a compulsion to spend 48 hours in the Six Counties before allowing them to bring duty-free goods in here.  I do not know whether that would work.  We know about butter ships and so on and the problems in the North Sea.  Denmark has a regulation that 48 hours must elapse over the border in Germany before the customs allowances can be availed of.  I do not know whether there is any possibility in that of helping our traders.</P>
    <P>Reverting to capital investment, in my area we in Government had a programme for decentralisation.  The construction industry is at a very low ebb, in some places with unemployment as high as 48 per cent.  This Government should continue with the plans we had for decentralisation which, as I said earlier, will have the most immediate impact on the employment situation in that area.  For that reason I would be willing to go along with the statement made already in this House that when one can relate the payment of tax to the creation of employment it is much easier to take.</P>
    <P>What remedy can I suggest for the Border areas?  I do not believe the refusal to pay movement should be countenanced. When we were in office and when very few people on this side of the House were taking an objective or philosophic view, the present Minister for Health, Deputy B. Desmond, made that kind of speech here.  Everybody knows Jerry Browne, Governor of California, <Col N="1282" /> found himself in serious trouble when he cut taxes and did not have the wherewithal for services.</P>

      <P>: I made the point that unemployment is a serious problem, particularly unemployment among our young people.  I have one suggestion to make, but it is not a fully formed idea. The EEC invented a system of MCAs to try to iron out difficulties when the various currencies got out of kilter.  In aid of the Border areas, could the Minister for Finance not evolve a scheme similar to the MCA scheme so that he will not totally kill commerce in the Border counties?</P>

      <P>: I want to make a few points but I will not mention points which have already been made.  From what Deputy Mac Giolla said there seems to be an inference that only people paying PAYE are workers.  I do not know what he means by &ldquo;workers&rdquo; but I consider myself to be a worker.  At what level of income does one stop being a worker? Perhaps Deputy Mac Giolla who has the same salary as I have, does not consider I am a worker but he is.  There are people, some of them trade union leaders, earning £30,000 a year.  Does Deputy Mac Giolla consider them to be workers? Does he consider that those people have the same justification to ask for tax reforms as the people on lower incomes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a medical practitioner is guilty of malpractice he is struck off the register. In certain circumstances accountants can certify accounts or tax practitioners can negotiate with the inspector of taxes, but there is no comeback if on inspection the Revenue people find serious irregularities. If we are serious about tackling the tax problem we should ensure that accountants, tax practitioners and so on are State registered.  At present there are five or six bodies of accountants registered, and for limited companies anybody can submit a tax return.  I believe most of the people making tax returns are registered as businesses but they <Col N="1283" /> should also be registered with the State. If they are found guilty of malpractice they should be struck off the register as happens when a medical practitioner is found guilty of malpractice, because the social injustice is just as serious.</P>
    <P>Last week we had marches which were the result of information supplied to this House by the Minister for Finance.  I said in my budget speech that the information supplied to the Minister by his officials was not correct.  I said there was a large degree of estimating in those figures. Many people took to the streets, mainly because of the information supplied by the Department of Finance which was not accurate.  I strongly believe that the Minister should take severe action against the people who supplied that information.  He should find out why that information was supplied in such a way as to cause the people to take to the streets to protest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>: I will be raising this matter elsewhere.  People were given the impression that a very large sum of money was outstanding, but that was not so.  I want to know how that happened. It caused workers to lose about £80 million when they took to the streets in protest.  I support the case for PAYE reform.</P>
      <P>We should be clear that tax evaders and avoiders are as numerous in the PAYE sector as in other sections of the community.  For instance, there are many PAYE people, such as directors of companies, who have other incomes, and others do nixers.  All tax evaders are not outside the PAYE sector.  For instance, I suspect there are a certain number of people who are paid a certain sum each week, and that amount is shown on the books, but these people often get a few pounds under the counter.  If we are to be serious about tax evasion and avoidance we must look at it right across the board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this point very clearly and do not wish to cause any unnecessary drama, but I take very serious exception <Col N="1284" /> to information confidentally collected by the Revenue service and the inspector of taxes being supplied and used by these people in other ways than through this House.  If any of these people employed as civil servants want the information to be brought to the attention of this House they should give it to the Members.  There are too many suggestions that there are people who for their own ends supply information and take up attitudes for reasons other than in the public interest. This approach should be checked.  I want to see this matter being brought to a head and dealt with, but I do not want to see certain sections of the community taking advantage of the situation for their own good.  Let us be serious about the difficulties facing those in the PAYE sector and try to redress the situation.</P>
    <P>Over the last few days I was glad to hear that it is likely that the yield from capital taxes will be increased.  In my view the capital tax area is not contributing its fair share to the community and has not done so since Deputy Colley, as Minister for Finance, abolished wealth tax, the car tax and rates were removed and where there was the virtual abolition of capital gains tax for certain categories of taxpayers. The matter of justice being done is one thing, but justice being seen to be done is another thing.  Those who are working and who are heavily taxed should be given a sense of confidence in the tax system.  That confidence does not exist at the moment and a system of capital taxation, justly administered, could adjust that situation.</P>
    <P>Most PAYE people are in a position where there is little scope for tax evasion, but it is fair to say, and it should be said, that many businessmen &mdash; I, as an accountant, come in contact with them frequently &mdash; are meticulous about making their VAT, PAYE and PRSI returns. Those people should be told that it is appreciated, because such standards should be encouraged among the rest of the business community who are not paying their way.  Not everybody in business is avoiding or evading tax: there are many conscientious people and unless we are to discourage people who are in business from giving employment we should be <Col N="1285" /> careful to give encouragement to those people in business who maintain high standards.</P>
    <P>I feel strongly about groups who have been behaving in a bullying manner towards the Executive, towards the Government and towards this House in many ways.  I am talking about farmers' associations and others against whom I have no grievance in particular &mdash; I worked with them for some time and I was very happy with them.  The attitude those people have been taking publicly &mdash; privately they agree they have to pay their way &mdash; has been seen by people in the PAYE sector to be succeeding.  Those people have been seen to succeed because they have pressure groups and not because their case has been either right or wrong.  They have the voting power, they have the public relations machines, the bullying power.  This sort of thing has crept in.  The sooner we nip it in the bud and get back to proper representation in elected assemblies like this House the better it will be for everybody.</P>
    <P>We have to tell this to the farmers and to trade unionists who have been growing increasingly intemperate in their language. We have to tell them that although democratic opposition is acceptable, and in my view to be encouraged, we will not accept anything that would usurp or threaten the State.  The language being used by those people should be thrown back at them.  We should make it very clear that that sort of language is totally unnecessary.  I speak about some of the speeches last week, which were unnecessary: the march itself was sufficient, if indeed it was necessary.  We must make it clear that we will not give way to bullying no matter which source it comes from.  Those people have their own reasons for making the extreme speeches they made, but they should take note of that.  It might go down well in the papers and with their members but I do not think any of the Members of this House will be bullied, cajoled, or pushed by this sort of crowd hysteria.</P>
    <P>I should like to make clear my support for the case for tax reform, for the case for an equitable tax system.  It should <Col N="1286" /> come sooner rather than later.  It will require a certain amount of courage on the part of the Government.  If the Government are to lose revenue from one source because of tax reform they will have to find it from another source. It will mean difficult decisions, which will be opposed by Fianna Fáil but particularly by Deputy Mac Giolla, who is everybody's friend and wants to give everybody everything.  Any changes we attempt to make will be opposed by those people when the time comes, but we should get on to make those reforms because we would be justified and will be seen to be justified.  If we do not respond to just cases this House will lose its credibility.</P>
    <P>My final point is in relation to the many people who are in pensionable guaranteed employment.  Take a man in such a situation, with an income of £10,000 a year.  Then take the position of a man who works down a sewer, also with £10,000 a year, although the latter would be unlikely to have that kind of income. Should both pay the same tax?  Should a man who has to toil seven days or seven nights a week have to pay the same tax as a man who arrives at his office at ten in the morning, has his tea break and knocks off at 5 p.m. and has two months holidays a year and is paid 100 per cent income while he is out sick be in the same tax category as the other?  If we are really out for justice in the tax system, let us not be cosmetic because if so we are only putting off the day when the section of the community we are being unfair to will take it upon themselves to reject the system. We must get real justice into the system and any reform will have to be on that basis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>: The problems we face began ten years ago.  We laid the basis for them gradually, inexorably, in the seventies. We were living beyond our means and we borrowed in order to plug the gaps in the hope that the days would get better as we went on.  Instead, the days got worse, time got worse, depression became widespread in Europe and throughout the world, and we continued to borrow even further.  The pre-election <Col N="1287" /> promises of 1977 marked the high point of the madness that grew on us as a political entity five or six years previously. The succeeding years were the same, until we were pulled up sharply in the last couple of budgets.</P>
      <P>We had gone mad.  We believed we could continue to borrow and to make promises at elections for which we did not have the money to pay, and it was from Billy to Jack: we were bidding and counter-bidding in auction politics.  That is where the mess we are in today began, but it is not all of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What all Governments from 1977 onwards failed to realise is that we had work to do, that we had the hands to do it, but instead of putting them busy to do that useful work we paid them a pittance for idleness.  That is what we have been doing, and I have been one of the few in those years, at each election, through the manifestoes of my very small party, who tried to bring to light and to the notice of the big parties that we had a construction industry that was running down, we had a growing population, above all we had and still have an expanding need for houses, our roads are a disgrace, the provision of services has slowed down, our schools and hospitals are too small, public buildings of various kinds are inadequate for the jobs they have to do, and yet we continue blindly ignoring the fact that we are paying out almost as much to upwards of 50,000 people who could be employed directly or indirectly in the construction industry doing a great job that will be required in the future at far greater cost than we could do it for now. What a boost it would be to any government or party, and to the country as a whole, if we could only get 20,000 reemployed. We could give employment to 50,000 to do the work that requires to be done.  We continue to ignore it.  Why, I do not know.  It is the maddest episode of our time.  Do not tell me, as I have been told before, that it is the same in all the countries in Europe, and the same all over the world.  The difference is that they have too many houses.  Their populations are going down. they have not got a young growing population as we have. <Col N="1288" /> Their schools are too big.  Their roads are adequate for 50 years ahead.  They have these things in abundance.  That is their problem.  We have a growing population. We have idle hands.  We have money going out and coming in, and we talk about protests.  The protests are because of the fact that too few people are working to pay the tax necessary to maintain the unfortunates who cannot get work. That is really our problem.</P>
    <P>The answer must be employment.  We must have useful employment, not going back to the days when a foreign government got our people to build things merely for the sake of putting them to work.  Monuments are still to be seen. They are not very beautiful but at least they are there.  The foreign government recognised that work was not a bad thing. We need to employ our young people and many of those who are out of employment. We must provide the services without which we will not be able to keep our population, and particularly our young population.  When things begin to brighten elsewhere they will be gone like snow off the ditch.  I would not blame them.  Why should they stay if they have not got the houses and the facilities they can get elsewhere?</P>
    <P>As somebody said, we have not got the safety valve of emigration to fall back on. There is no outlet because there is nowhere to go.  There will be places to go if we are optimistic enough to believe that this depression cannot last forever and that there will be an end to it.  It will end elsewhere before it ends here, and our people will stream out of the country. As I know, and as those who come from the part of the country I come from know only too well, no matter what changes may take place in the future, many of those who go will not return.  This is the sad fact with which we are confronted.</P>
    <P>I want to add to what has already been said by Deputy Wilson.  Over and above all the other problems talked about in this House, we have a problem in the Border counties about which the Minister for Finance was well and truly warned before he introduced the taxes which are now crippling our entire economy and killing commercial life within 40 or 50 <Col N="1289" /> miles of the Border from Louth to Donegal.  I was a member of the deputation who told him about the grave consequences and the disaster we foresaw within 12 months affecting our commercial and business life within a band of 40 miles of the Border.</P>
    <P>The problem stems from a number of taxes which have put our prices far ahead of prices on the other side of the artificial yoke of a Border.  Our people are streaming across the Border.  The one price above all others which is motivating them is the difference of 80p per gallon in the price of petrol.  Car owners are streaming across the Border.  Coaches are being run from here but that is for a day out.  It is nothing compared with what is happening where I come from.  People are going across to get petrol to come and go to work if they are fortunate enough to have work, or to bring the children to school. The man and his wife, or somebody from the household, go across once a week for a fill up and they buy all the goods they want for the household in the supermarkets across the Border.  If they want something from a draper's shop or a shoe shop, even if it might be cheaper and better here, for convenience they will go into that shop across the Border.  The stream has only started.  I repeat what I said to the Minister for Finance before he imposed these taxes.  Unless he changes his policy, within 12 months there will be no business of any kind within 40 miles of the Border.</P>
    <P>To compound that, the increase in VAT is killing off what was left of our tourist industry and hotel business.  We are losing our hotels.  Look at the number on the market.  There would be more on the market but for the fact that the demand is not there.  Restaurants, pubs, filling stations, garages and service stations will go, and with them will go the grocery shops, the drapery shops and the shoe shops.  There is no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>Another problem will creep in within a matter of months.  As soon as stocks have been cleared much slower than they would have been cleared even a year ago, they will not be replenished.  Within a matter of six months, people who are crossing the Border and encouraging <Col N="1290" /> others to cross it because of the difference in prices, will no longer have the alternative of buying at home because the traders will not have the stocks.  Trade will be too slow.  The money will have dried up and they will have to cut down on the variety of their stocks, thereby further reducing whatever little trade may be left to them.  Before they allow this flood to become a deluge, the Government should take action on the price of petrol and the price of oil.  They might also take a swipe at the oil companies. In the UK the base price of oil and petrol is 89p a gallon, or thereabouts, and here it is £1.29 per gallon before tax and duties.  Why?  It is time we knew.  It is time the Government put the screws on to find out why there is such a difference in the base price before we add the penal taxes.</P>
    <P>I am told it would cost £150 million to take 50p off the price of a gallon of petrol. The Government will lose more if they do not take it off, because the revenue will not come in.  The Minister and the Government are codding themselves. There is also the fact that the outgoings on the newly created unemployment along the Border, never mind what is happening throughout the country, will cost far in excess of what the Government propose to take in from this tax.  I regard it as a phoney tax on petrol in our part of the country.</P>
    <P>I did not mention liquor.  You can buy a bottle for £5 across the Border and it costs £13 here.  At home people might not think of buying liquor but, when they are across the Border they realise it is a bargain and they buy it.  This replaces sales which might have been made here and the Government lose the revenue. The parties and weddings and functions which used to come streaming across the Border are now drying up and the reverse trend has started.  I do not blame anyone for that.  It pays to do it.  Our attractions are not sufficient any more when set against the additional costs of functions here.</P>
    <P>People used to be attracted to come here because it was more peaceful.  They wanted to get away from the problems and the troubles of their own.  They are <Col N="1291" /> no longer coming here.  In spite of the difficulties of cross-Border travel, our people are going across for functions and weddings.  A grim picture has begun to emerge which gives no hope for the survival of any business within 40 or 50 miles of the Border.  Whatever other protests there may be, the Government should have a look at this problem.  It is the most urgent and most vital of all of them.  No matter what may be said about workers on PAYE, this problem comes out at the top.</P>
    <P>The only way out is a reduction in tax. It is up to the Government.  They were warned about it before they imposed these taxes which were well telegraphed. They did not take note of those warnings. I hope they do so soon.  If they allow the situation to continue the remedy will not work because the commercial life of the region south of that artificial Border will be destroyed.</P>
    <P>Much more could be said but I cannot overrun my time at 7 p.m. as many other speakers have done.  However, I must admit that the last speaker did not do that. I ask the Government to look again at the petrol and oil tax above all other taxes.  In addition, they should give work to those people who are idle and who are being paid money which the taxpayers find impossible to provide.  People should be given work to do so that they, too, can pay tax and thus ease the burden on the rest.  In this way the Government will get the revenue they need so badly and which they must have.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to withdraw immediately the charges imposed on job applications in the Public Sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank the Chair for the opportunity of moving this very important <Col N="1292" /> motion in my name and that of my colleague, Deputy Calleary, on behalf of my party.  The importance of the debate this afternoon and the issues raised by the protesters who have legitimately been making their views known outside this House today may have meant that somewhere along the line the social implications of this penal decision by the Government may have been lost in the publicity stakes because of the number of other current problems.  I want to emphasise how seriously we view this reactionary step by this reactionary Minister, supported by this reactionary Government.</P>
    <P>Before I deal with our motion I want to scoff at the terminology of the amendment proposed by the Minister.  The amendment states:</P>
    <P>recognises that in present financial circumstances it is desirable that the cost of some State services be borne to at least some extent by those making use of the services.</P>
    <P>We must remember we are talking about school-leavers, about the unemployed and about people who may have genuine reasons to seek a change of employment. I say to the Members opposite, particularly to the members of the Labour Party, that voting for our amendment will not bring down the Government.  What it will do is to give the Government a message that new ideas with regard to employment are needed urgently, not the kind of retrograde decisions that have been taken in areas such as we are discussing now.</P>
    <P>In case it may be thought we are the only people who scoff at the Government's decision, I should like to draw the attention of the House to the April issue of the publication <i>Liberty</i>, the magazine of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union, which I am sure is read each month by Members of this House. In that publication there is a cartoon by the distinguished cartoonist, Bob Fannin, which is worth looking at.  It depicts two obviously unemployed people walking along and nearby is a notice board with the sign &ldquo;application fee for Government jobs&rdquo;.  The caption underneath shows one <Col N="1293" /> unemployed person saying to the other &ldquo;next step &mdash; auctioning off jobs to the highest bidder&rdquo;.  They are telling the Minister that is the only move left for him to make.  That is not a production of Fianna Fáil but appeared in the official magazine of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter on the Adjournment on 3 March last as a result of advertisements that appeared in the national newspapers the previous day, I said then that the first intimation we had that this move was being contemplated was not contained in the budget speech of the Minister for Finance but appeared immediately afterwards in the now famous pink papers.  They were handed to Members of this House and were entitled &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;. They included the principal features but they also included other items not mentioned by the Minister.  They gave some frightening details.  On page three of that document there was reference to fees to be charged by the Civil Service Commission for civil service examinations.  I tabled a question in the hope that the Government would have some common sense about the matter.  They were trying to collect a small amount of revenue at the expense of unemployed young people.</P>
    <P>On 2 March the national newspapers gave details regarding this charge in the column dealing with careers in the public service.  A statement in that advertisement stated:</P>
    <P>There is an application fee for all competitions announced by the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commissioners after 1 March 1983. Instructions as to how the fees are to be paid are contained in the documentation issued with application forms.  It is regretted that because of the arrangements necessary for the handling of the fees, completed application forms can only be received in the headquarters office.  The issue of application forms will also be centralised at that office.</P>
    <P>That has two implications.  It means we <Col N="1294" /> have gone back to the 1960s in that we are imposing a charge and we have done away with the idea of decentralisation. We are centralising everything and we are emphasising that in our advertisements for the public service.</P>
    <P>Although the advertisements did not state so categorically, the Minister told us that it meant one fee of £10 for each group of jobs advertised.  It was not clear from the advertisement if that was the intention but if it is an improvement on what was first intended at least the efforts on that day bore some fruit.  However, if two, three or four members of a family have to apply, they will have to find £20, £30 or £40 and it may be that there may be no one employed in that house.  I wonder if the Minister and I live in the same country?  Does he think that is justified?</P>
    <P>It is well known that the Leader of the Labour Party was not happy with the decision taken and that he made strong efforts to change the situation because of pressure from his supporters.  To date he has been unsuccessful in getting the £10 charge abolished.  I will quote from <i>The Cork Examiner</i> of 13 April 1983 in which the following notice appeared: &ldquo;Details regarding the application fee will be given in the documents issued with the application forms&rdquo;.  All that is stated is that details are available, which is a new type of advertisement.</P>
    <P>Where does all of this leave us?  One could say that it is typical of the Government's approach to employment and unemployment.  We were told about the long deliberations in Barretstown Castle, yet the Taoiseach on the radio this morning did not make any comments on the economic problems which were reported to have been discussed there. We do hear of kites being flown in all directions, but that is of little consolation to those about whom I am concerned&mdash; many coming on the employment market in the next two months in an already high unemployment situation difficult for any Government in any western country.  The problem is extremely difficult here because of the size and growth of our young population and of the work force. A miserable defence was raised by this <Col N="1295" /> Minister on the occasion of our Adjournment debate.  He told me that my memory was not right, that colleagues of mine had been in Government as Ministers for Finance when such fees existed.  I never served in this House under either of the two Deputies mentioned, both respected members of my party and respected Ministers of this House and this country who gave excellent service over many years. I refer to Dr. Jim Ryan and Mr. Seán MacEntee, both of whose names were mentioned previously by the Minister opposite.  During their terms as Minister, charges did apply but surely that only strengthens my argument that this Minister is reactionary enough to go back to the dim days of the late fifties or early sixties.</P>
    <P>He also referred to my not being sincere in my comments if I was Minister for Labour and Public Service who prepared the Estimates for this year.  He was kind enough to say that they were genuine Estimates, pared to the bone.  I do not deny that.  He said that he must provide the money elsewhere.  I do not believe all that I read in the newspapers.  Over the weekend, I read some alarming comments on how money might have been spent, but I am not sure whether these are accurate or inaccurate and I do not wish or expect the Minister to comment on them.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister not to put a charge on school leavers in respect of applications or interviews.  These count as experience and education and are helpful, even if not successful.  They give school leavers some assistance, training and hope for the future.  We are told that the revenue involved is somewhere in the region of £400,000.  Again, one cannot be sure how this figure is arrived at.  We are told that there are different fees and the Minister went to some length in his previous reply to say that there was a cost to the State.  Of course there is, but one can look at this whole thing from two points of view.  It could be regarded as part of Fine Gael's employment policy, although I am not sure what that is and it is not clear who enunciates it.  It could also be seen as part of this much flaunted new idea <Col N="1296" /> about which we hear so much &mdash; the Minister's programme for public service reform.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about Dáil reform and public service reform.  I understand on good authority that most of this is top of the head talk.  I support Dáil reform and public service reform, but question the sincerity of some members of the present Government where that is concerned, with particular reference to Dáil reform. I am not offering criticism to the same extent with regard to public service reform.  I am satisfied that the commitment to Dáil reform is more an effort to fly a kite and create a smokescreen than a genuine commitment.  I mean that because I know that to be so.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of the Fine Gael employment policy &mdash; if policy one can call it &mdash; seems to emerge as one to reduce the demand for employment.  We have heard a number of initiatives offered publicly. One member of that party suggests that young people should, if possible, emigrate and seek work abroad.  He does not stipulate where.  Of course, some jobs are available in Europe and I support the efforts of those interested in getting those jobs but let us not get away from the fact that there is an unemployment problem which is not confined to this country.  This former Cabinet Minister says young people must emigrate and look for work abroad, even if there is not any.  I presume he thinks it more desirable to say that rather than see the politicians here being embarrassed at the magnitude of the task which is not being tackled.</P>
    <P>Another prominent member of the Fine Gael Party enunciated the one family, one job dictum.  Is this more of their emerging policy?  In practical terms, as told by many of the commentators, he appears to be saying that all married women at work should go home but, of course, all the mayors, company directors, TDs and so forth appear to be exempt.</P>
    <P>The next plank in the Fine Gael employment policy appears to be one to discourage people from applying for public service jobs, which is the specific problem before us at the moment.  If the people cannot afford £10, then they do <Col N="1297" /> not apply, so that the problem is not as obvious as it should be.  Looking at it from another point of view, the £10 charge on school leavers could be viewed as part of the reform of the public service. The object of the Government's economic policy is to isolate the public service from the recession.  One wonders what all these exercises are in aid of and what they hope to achieve.  In future entry to the public service is to be made more difficult, because now there will be a charge.  We have a reactionary Minister and we have gone back 20 years.</P>
    <P>Public service jobs are to be available only in Dublin, because the decentralisation programme has been done away with.  To consolidate the position, the Government say in the advertisements for new recruits that the central office will deal with all applications and all fees.  I am sure that the Minister, being confined to a Dublin constituency, is not aware of the hardship of my constituents in having to travel to attend interviews and examinations, with the cost, the time factor and the necessary subsistence, that money not being available from any other source but the individual or the home.  In addition to that, they are charged £10 extra. Surely one must have a conscience for the people who must travel and at a cost.</P>
    <P>At present one might well wonder if the major plank of public service reform is the performance of Ministers abroad. I want to know from the Minister is it correct to say that he intends undertaking a tour of EEC capitals to help the reform programme, in an endeavour to establish what is the position in each of the EEC Governments?  Are study trips abroad being organised?  That would appear to be the case because every week or 10 days we hear of Ministers being somewhere.</P>
    <P>Then there is this miserable £10 fee on young people attending interviews or examinations.  The Minister, in a very patriotic comment, asked for a day's work for Ireland.  I say to these Ministers: show their commitment to the home scene.  We have a Taoiseach who, we understand, for the second time since this Government were elected, was abroad for a few weeks.</P>
    <Col N="1298" />
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>: Would the Deputy relate his remarks to the motion before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: Of course I shall. I am saying that whatever revenue the Taoiseach spent abroad, if spent at home would be useful to our economy rather than putting a charge on the school-leaver. That is why I think my comment would be in order.</P>
      <P>The reasons given by the Minister in his reply to me on 3 March last were absurd to say the least.  He said that some applications were frivolous, that they would cost about £30 to process.  If the Minister is saying that it costs £30 to process an application from an unqualified person, or that it is a frivolous application, then surely there is something wrong with the system.  In other words, there is room for improvement and let that improvement be effected.  Those are the public service reforms needed.</P>
      <P>There was also a comment that people who will occupy highly-paid jobs can afford to pay.  One could extend the logic of that defence to an enormous degree, to a degree that would be even stupid in its dimension.  What I should say is this: remember that the majority of applicants &mdash; and I ask the Minister to give the statistical information to the House &mdash; will be young school-leavers or people at present unemployed.  They will be the people who for the most part will pay this fee.  Therefore, do not let us defend those people who transfer for the sake of improving their income substantially.  If that is happening it is a different situation and constitutes the minority of applications. It constitutes the minority of jobs advertised because the majority relate to the young school-leavers or unemployed persons going perhaps into the postal service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to hear the Minister defend it because it existed in the past. Surely this is what draws my charge of his being a reactionary Minister and the Government being a reactionary Government.  It was abolished in the 1960s.  In fact I think it was our party leader, Deputy Haughey, who presided <Col N="1299" /> over that abolition.  I would regard that as progress.</P>
    <P>I look forward to hearing what the Labour Party members have to say on this issue.  They must realise that there is being imposed here on the ordinary person seeking employment a new charge &mdash; and when I say new it is not sufficient for me to be told it existed 20 years ago. It is new in the context of the Ireland of today.  It is a miserable imposition that will bring in a small amount of revenue which, in my opinion, will cause discrimination against an already over-taxed group in our society.  The people who can least afford to pay this £10 are those who have already run out of patience with the performance of this Government to date. When the marches of last week were taking place I remembered a few short years ago some members of the Minister's own party who took part in those earlier marches.  They were far away from them last week.  But it is actions of inequity, of creating divisiveness, of worsening inequity, it is decisions like these which cause the present unrest.</P>
    <P>I listened with interest to Deputy Blaney make the point about what we all know to be an added problem.  I shall not go into that because I appreciate I could be brought to order.  But all of these actions are creating a new divisiveness in our society, constituting a new imposition on the biggest sufferer.  Who are the biggest sufferers in regard to this charge? They are the children and relatives of the PAYE people.  I know the Tánaiste would probably say now that he did not like the timing or the tone of the Minister's announcement but &mdash; and the &ldquo;but&rdquo; would be that it would be an option he would have to consider and vote for.  That would probably be the approach.  I would say to his party members that here they are afforded an ideal opportunity to deliver a lesson to the Government, a lesson that will not defeat the Government but at least affords them the opportunity of saying: &ldquo;you are doing a hell of a bad job, we want to see you do better&rdquo;. If they do not do that one has to question the sincerity of the comments one hears from time to time.  I believe that, of all <Col N="1300" /> the decisions taken to date &mdash; some of them having received much greater publicity &mdash; this is the most unacceptable, most insensitive, insensitive in the sense that it hits young people, school-leavers, at a time when youth unemployment and unemployment generally is of grave concern.</P>
    <P>We forecast the problems the budget would create when we heard the statement of the Minister for Finance.  We were told by some that it was totally unacceptable to the Labour Party.  The timing might not have been right, the tone might not have been right but they trooped into the lobbies to support it. This is their opportunity, not to bring down the Government, but for each member of the Labour Party to say to himself or herself: &ldquo;I can on this occasion go through the lobbies and support what is a very sensible motion in this House. I can do so knowing that it will not defeat the Government but will deliver a message saying: `Get your house in order, do your job a bit better, lay off the young people'.&rdquo;  I am even prepared to compromise if the Minister is sensible in this House and to say: Discriminate in your job applications, discriminate in your job advertisements, think about where there are promotion opportunities for an already-employed person, discriminate there as distinct from the unemployed person or, above all, the school-leaver. But for God's sake remove it, and remove it fast in the case of school-leavers.</P>
    <P>I wonder how members of the Labour Party felt yesterday.  I read with interest a comment of a former Member of this House, a former Minister for Finance, now a member of the European Parliament, Mr. Richie Ryan.  What did he say? He said that socialism was the source of all our ills.  That is the comment of a former Minister for Finance in a Fine Gael/Labour Coalition Government. But, wait for it &mdash; and this is what I want the Labour Party to listen to particularly &mdash; he said that Fianna Fáil have been carrying out socialist policies since 1977.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: I would welcome the Deputy joining us tomorrow to vote against the £10 fee that all school leavers will be charged when applying for positions in the public service.  The Deputy should listen to what I am saying because the voters in Clare will be looking closely at what he decides tomorrow night.  They will wonder why the Deputy, a sensible person, did not vote against that charge. We are all aware of the disarray on the Government side in regard to business which will come up for discussion next week and the decision to introduce a charge of £10 for public service job applications has been lost in the publicity about all the other issues.  Important though those issues are the matter under discussion is equally important because it hits at the core of our society and will affect young people for generations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Responsible and sensible Members whose constituents must pay the cost of <Col N="1302" /> transport and subsistence for their children who sit public service examinations must question this new charge.  If more than one member of a family applies for a position they must also pay the £10 fee. The decision to introduce that charge is an indication of the small mentality of the Government, a Pale mentality.  The charge should be forgotten.  Government Deputies should remember that if by their support our motion is adopted it will not mean the end of the Coalition Government.  We are opposed to this tax on the unemployed.  I ask the honourable and respectable Members of the Labour Party to support our motion tomorrow night.</P>
    <P>In the course of my contribution on 3 March I referred to the views of many commentators.  I pointed out that the decision to introduce this charge was the thin end of the wedge and what frightened me particularly was the position of young unemployed and school leavers. On 3 March I referred to an article in <i>The Cork Examiner</i>&mdash; I apologise for being parochial but one cannot but be interested in one's local paper &mdash; in regard to an advertisement which had appeared on 2 March.  The newspaper had checked the facts with the GIS and reported:</P>
    <P>Those applying for the Garda Síochána are not required to pay a fee with their application.  However, the GIS spokesman said yesterday, that it is believed a compulsory application fee will be introduced in this sector shortly.</P>
    <P>This is the thin end of the wedge by a reactionary Minister in a reactionary Government.  Where will the Government go next?  Will they go to the State boards?  Will apprentices now be charged £50?  Will the situation be similar to that portrayed in the cartoon in <i>Liberty</i>, auctioning off jobs to the highest bidder? That is the risk we are running.  That cartoon may be jocose but there is a dangerous element in all this.  What about AnCO?  Will they be asked to charge their trainees a fee?  What about the other training agencies?</P>
    <P>I am aware that examination fees and course fees have been increased, but are <Col N="1303" /> we going to defend those increases, and the introduction of the public service fee, by saying that all services must be paid for?  The Minister has challenged me to tell the House where the £400,000 can be got.  In November, prior to the election I, as Minister for the Public Service, decided with the Government what the Estimate for that Department would be for 1983.  Any change made by the Government is not a matter for me and I should not be challenged on it.  We had outlined our Estimates clearly prior to the election.  In fact, the Minister complimented me on my Estimate saying that there was nothing dishonest about it and that it was properly prepared.  Any changes since then are matters for the Minister.</P>
    <P>I know how the people in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency feel about this hurtful, insensitive and blatant attack on school leavers.  I ask the reasonable and honest Members of the Labour Party whose supporters are seething because of this miserable £10 charge to support us tomorrow night.  The Government will not be brought down but success for our motion will deliver a clear message to them to govern with concern for the ordinary people from whom the Labour Party and I draw our support. The Labour Party cannot expect to retain that support unless their Members take seriously what I say on issues such as this. I am prepared to compromise and listen to the Minister if he says that some jobs in the public service that attract a high salary should be subject to this £10 charge.  That fee on school leavers and the unemployed in 1983 is the most disgraceful decision taken by any Government since the thirties.  It is reactionary and will always be considered to be so.  I will not allow the House forget it.  Labour Party Members tomorrow night will have an opportunity of redeeming some of the credibility that is slipping so fast from them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil <Col N="1304" /> Éireann&rdquo; and substitute: &ldquo;recognises that in present financial circumstances it is desirable that the cost of some State services be borne to at least some extent by those making use of the services.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is always an experience to be present when Deputy Fitzgerald makes a contribution and I do not think I could say much more than that about what he said tonight.  At the outset Deputy Fitzgerald chose to scoff at the terminology of the amendment.  Perhaps it might have been more appropriate if he had referred to the fact that the wording of his motion is totally fallacious and misleading.  The motion refers to charges imposed on job applications in the public sector.  I would have thought that a former Minister for the Public Service would have had some comprehension of the definition of the public sector, the public service and the civil service.  I would have expected him to realise that the charges which have been introduced apply only to the civil service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputy adopted a very hurt and pained expression when he had a gentle reminder from a Deputy on this side that he should address his remarks to the motion.  Perhaps he would now allow me to make my contribution.</P>
      <P>The charges apply only to jobs to be filled by the Civil Service Commission and this was made clear when these charges were originally published in the document issued in conjunction with the Budget Statement.  It was also made abundantly clear by me when the Deputy raised this matter on the Adjournment on 3 March last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to thank the Deputy for his endorsement of my suggestion made some weeks ago in Cork that people might consider voluntarily working a day for Ireland and it was heartening to hear <Col N="1305" /> the Deputy describe that suggestion as a &ldquo;patriotic comment&rdquo;.  I thank him for his support of the concept I outlined.  It is indeed heartening that he should have deverged slightly from his motion to acknowledge that fact.  It was less heartening to hear him consistently mislead the House by referring to a £10 application fee because I was at pains to point out to him on 3 March that there are two levels of fee, £7 and £10.  Almost three-quarters of all jobs advertised in the civil service carry a £7 application fee whereas only a quarter would be charged at the rate of £10.</P>
    <P>I want to say, at the risk of stating the obvious, that it gave no pleasure to me or my colleagues in Cabinet to re-introduce fees, fees at even this modest level, in respect of jobs advertised in the civil service.  It is patently obvious that politicians generally prefer to do things which will be perceived as being popular.  They prefer to do things which are easy, which win soft acclaim and popular support. They prefer to spend money and get the clap on the back.  This is the &ldquo;hail-fellow-well-met&rdquo; syndrome which, as it paraded down its dizzy way in the last years of the seventies, brought this country to the brink of disaster.  It has meant that we as a Government and the entire population have had to suffer the imposition of what all would agree was a budget of a very harsh and severe nature, the imposition of charges in respect of some State services and the reduction, changing or elimination of other State services. All those things have had to be done because of the spendthrift and reckless approach adopted by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and his colleagues when they were in Government in the late seventies and the turn of the decade.  It ill behoves him now to advocate a return to the days of spending money borrowed abroad at the expense of the charges to be borne by the population in the years ahead.  The years ahead have arrived and we are now paying for the sins of the Deputy and his colleagues.</P>
    <P>I was asked by Deputy Fitzgerald to give some statistical information.  This might be of particular interest because the numbers who apply for jobs advertised <Col N="1306" /> greatly exceed the number of jobs available.  That is probably the greatest under-statement I have ever made in this House.  During 1982 the Civil Service Commission filled very few jobs, yet they advertised what appeared to be a substantial number.  Approximately 80,000 people were called to sit for written examinations while only 1,400 jobs were filled.  I will give some examples.  In respect of the position of post office clerk, 26,768 forms were issued, 16,000 forms were returned and 14,400 applicants were found to be eligible to sit the examination. When the examination was held 12,055 attended and of those 116 were offered appointment.  The total cost of that exercise was £173,500.  For the executive officer position, a grade for school-leavers, 9,452 people were eligible, 8,478 sat for the examination and 139 were offered appointment.  Even in respect of a relatively junior position as key punch operator 1,184 people were eligible, 544 attended and 35 were offered appointment.  A total of 1,431 sat for the examination for a junior postman and 46 were offered appointment.  In respect of the position of trainee technician, 8,036 attended for examination and 369 were offered appointment.  The numbers I have given as being appointed represent the numbers who have been offered appointment and not all have taken up duty as yet.</P>
    <P>We need to have a fundamental look at the system whereby so many people every year apply for jobs in the civil service.  Approximately 80,000 people were called for written examination by the Civil Service Commission last year in respect of some 1,400 jobs.  It might have been more honest and fair if the applicants were given some indication of just how few opportunities there really were of obtaining gainful employment.  It might be suggested that the whole operation of the Civil Service Commission in certain areas where so few jobs were available was deceitful and fraudulent because the unfortunate applicants were given the impression that there were real opportunities for jobs.  So many apply that examinations must be held in a multitude of centres.  We must acknowledge <Col N="1307" /> the right and desire of people who are eligible for a position to put their hat in the ring and apply for consideration.  We also have a duty to those people to make them aware of what the possibilities of employment actually are.</P>
    <P>There are many other examples which I could give in respect of other examinations which the Civil Service Commission conducted.  They are not the only large public body who interview large numbers of people in respect of jobs which are not there.  I inquired today of Dublin County Council about the numbers they called and examined during last year.  In regard to a position they advertised for clerical officers, they had 3,033 applicants and the council appointed three.  Is that not really a charade?  No matter how excellently conducted the examination was &mdash; I have no reason but to believe that it was conducted fairly &mdash; even God would be put to the pin of His collar to decide which three out of 3,033 people were best.  In regard to a clerk-typist position, 1,409 applied and one was appointed.  In regard to a library assistant, 1,843 people applied and one was appointed.  In regard to a Dublin Corporation clerical officer position, 2,624 people applied and 56 were appointed. In the previous year, for a clerical officer position, 2,100 people applied and 80 were appointed.  In the previous year they had 937 applicants for a typist position of whom they called 48 and 25 more this year, because Dublin Corporation did not conduct any examination for typists this year.</P>
    <P>Perhaps Deputy Fitzgerald would have preferred, when we decided there were savings which had to be made, that we would not conduct any examinations at all this year but used the panels set up last year.  That would at least have allowed those who were on last year's panels some opportunity of being offered the few jobs which will occur this year, but it would have been patently unfair to those school leavers who will come on stream later in the year and who should get their opportunity, however slight it is, of applying for whatever positions are on offer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1308" /> I believe we must find ways to make the numbers who are actually examined more relevant to the numbers of jobs available while at the same time allowing all people who are eligible in some way to make initial applications and have those applications screened.  I believe, on balance, that would be a fairer way to all applicants.  It would certainly be fairer to those who eventually would come to be examined and who would realise they had some chance of getting those jobs. There are many young people now who must feel despondency in their hearts as they go from one written examination of the Civil Service Commission to the next and who intersperse them with examinations and interviews for the corporation, the county council, the banks, the health boards and the rest, for jobs that are not there.  Imagine one clerk-typist being appointed out of 1,400 hopefuls who were interviewed.  Is it not really a charade?</P>
    <P>The total number of applicants to the Civil Service Commission were more than 100,000 for fewer than 7,000 jobs. We need to let people know what those figures are and to let them realise when they are applying that they have a very limited opportunity of success.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to ensure that more equity will be introduced into the system so that those who come to be examined will realise there is some meaningful possibility that if they do well at the examination there may be jobs for them at the end of the line.  It gave neither the Government nor me any joy whatsoever to have to introduce the £7 charge and in certain cases the £10 charge this year. There are very few opportunities open to Governments.  Those are the harsh facts of life.  The opportunities for a Government to raise revenue to run the country amount to increases in taxation or reductions in expenditure.  Reductions in expenditure amount to either the elimination or reduction of services or the charging for services.  It goes without saying that we all feel there have been quite enough levels of increases in taxation imposed this year.  We have seen the reaction of people in relation to this.  We have also seen many of Deputy <Col N="1309" /> Fitzgerald's colleagues fulminating when the Government made some attempt to reduce or change services.  The only other option is to charge for some services, for partial offsetting of some of the costs.</P>
    <P>I gave a figure for the average cost of applying for a job in the Civil Service Commission.  It is £30 per application.  In respect of 75 per cent of the applicants who will be applying, an application fee of £7 is less than one-fourth of the total cost and the remaining cost will be borne by the taxpayer.  The taxpayer represents quite a number of those constituents in Cork that Deputy Fitzgerald referred to. My duty is to them as well as to the applicants for civil service posts.  They are not mutually exclusive groups.  Those who apply for civil service posts are taxpayers or they are the sons and daughters of taxpayers.  I imagine that in most instances, if they are the school leaving sons and daughters, it will fall on the parents who are taxpayers to pay the fees. We must realise there is that responsibility for all of us.</P>
    <P>It is my intention, in conjunction with the office of the Civil Service Commission, to bring about a change in the entire operation of the commission, which was hinted at by Deputy Fitzgerald in one of his more lucid moments, during the course of this year in order to secure a reduction in the operational costs of the commission by a reduction in the way in which applications can be screened next year, which would equate to the amount of money raised by the fees this year.</P>
    <P>I have already outlined that the only way in which Governments can operate is by more taxes, reduced services or charging for services.  I have just suggested that if we can in some way change the operation of the Civil Service Commission to bring about a saving of the equivalent of the £400,000, which will be raised through the fees this year, there will not be any necessity for the continuation of the fees during 1984 or thereafter. I cannot over-emphasise the need which fell on the Government to take fire brigade action on assuming office following the adoption of Estimates of the outgoing Government last November which, as I said the last day in respect of the <Col N="1310" /> Department of the Public Service, were prepared in a genuine and straightforward way and which had, as Deputy Fitzgerald said, no fat contained in them. The total cumulative effect of those Estimates was far in excess of anything which could be thought to be an acceptable current budget deficit.  It was necessary for further savings of an extraordinarily high nature to be found within the Estimates again.  There were, because of that, a number of fire brigade actions which had to be taken by the Government.  Now as we move into our five years in office we have the opportunity carefully to examine the ways in which certain operations are carried out and to see where savings can be effected or changes brought about in different ways.  I am suggesting that through a fundamental re-appraisal of the way in which so many people are called and given false hopes for non-existent jobs, while still safeguarding the right of every person to apply and be examined and for a certain number to go through the process and be chosen, there could be a substantial saving in subsequent years which would be equivalent to the revenue derived from the fees this year.</P>
    <P>I thought it ironic to hear Deputy Fitzgerald fulminate again at the system and say the Minister should do something about it.  No one has served longer as Minister for the Public Service than Deputy Fitzgerald and he had responsibility for the operation of the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

      <P>: The commission operates efficiently.  There have been suggestions that it was inefficient but it uses electronic multiple choice scanning equipment, computers and the most modern technology. Given the enormous number of applicants for whom it must provide a competitive test I am impressed by the way it operates.  The commission managed to achieve a staff saving of 13 per <Col N="1311" /> cent which is more than has been achieved by other Departments.</P>
      <P>In his efforts to deceive and confuse, Deputy Fitzgerald made statements which were less than helpful and could not be described as accurate.  He spoke about a reduction in the number of interviews conducted outside Dublin.</P>

      <P>: In 1981, 17 per cent of interviews took place outside of Dublin. In 1982 under Deputy Fitzgerald's tenure of office that was reduced to 9.9 per cent. In the Estimates, which he so proudly reminds the House he prepared a substantial part of in November last year, there would be a further drastic reduction in the number of interviews conducted outside Dublin because of his policy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the areas of reform I have introduced relates to the Civil Service Commission. In the past, certain Ministers conspired with public representatives to give the impression that the Minister could interfere with the commision and get an applicant a job to which he or she was or was not entitled.  The public representative would write to the Minister and the Minister would write back to the applicant giving him details which he could have got himself anyway.  He would finish the letter by saying he was sorry he did not have better news on this occasion, giving the impression that perhaps on the next occasion the applicant would be successful. The impression was created that in some way he had some hold over the commission and could get a job for a person to which he or she was not entitled. If the person was successful a letter was written from the Minister giving the impression that the applicant should be <Col N="1313" /> grateful to the Minister.  I have stopped all that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Minister has done other things too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have written to public representatives and to applicants who write directly to me explaining that it would be wrong of me to appear in any way to interfere with or influence the commission.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>: I tell them that applicants will be recruited on their merit.  This has always been the case.  It is one reform of which I am proud.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made great play of seeking to confuse people by adverting to advertisements in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> which did not specify that the fees were £7 and £10.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: He endeavours to suggest there is another scale of fees.  This is erroneous, fallacious and misleading. The fees in respect of 70 per cent to 75 per cent of the jobs are £7.  In respect of the remainder the fees are £10.  There are only two fees.  I appreciate that for some people the simple fact that there is a scale of two fees may be confusing but the vast majority of the public will understand it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: I have been considering whether even these partial charges might impose a hardship on some people and consequently the Government decided that a person will pay the fee on his first application and the fee will operate in respect of any subsequent applications that person may make.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>: The intention of the Government is that the fees will operate <Col N="1314" /> partially to offset some of the cost to the taxpayer of the operation of the commission. Perhaps the debate will bring to the attention of those unfortunate people who are looking for jobs the real facts in respect of their chances.</P>
      <P>As regards the major examinations last year, it cost an average £650 per job filled.  Some jobs cost well over £1,000. Many thousands of young people were needlessly misled into attending at examination centres and competing in examinations for which they had no chance at the outset because there were virtually no jobs on offer.  I intend to see that that system is changed and made fairer on behalf of the applicants generally and, in doing so, also to bring about such a change which will mean that the charges will not have to be imposed after this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am glad we have succeeded in helping to twist the Minister's arm and the arm of the Government in the latest change they have made in this very foolish, savage and unjust charge. The Minister got quite annoyed at times. He seemed to feel that Deputy Fitzgerald was casting some doubts on his intention to reform the public service.  He is being less than honest because he should be the first to know, from his three or four months as Minister, that Deputy Gene Fitzgerald went a long way towards reforming the public service.  I am sure if the Minister wants to inform himself, he will get the information quite readily.  He succeeded in clouding the issue.</P>
      <P>This debate is about the impositions which he and the Government have made, which will hit hardest, no matter what he says about the taxpayer, on young people who have very limited job opportunities and who are anxious to see if their talents are suited to the public service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made great play about the two charges, £10 and £7.  When the first advertisements came out they were quite clear.  They stated whether the application was a £10 charge or a £7 charge.  It is highly significant that that has now been replaced by the following&mdash;<Col N="1315" /> Details regarding the application fee will be given in the documents issued with the application forms.</P>
    <P>We could take an example which the Minister gave us in relation to a competition for post office clerks.  He said that about 26,000 people applied, that about 16,000 forms were issued and that 14,000 were called.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">

      <P>: We can see from the examples the Minister gave that the competition to which he referred would almost have paid for itself.  In relation to the cost for many school-leavers who are applying for the first time the fee is £10. I have seen letters demanding a fee of £10.  The Minister gave appalling figures in relation to the numbers and I know, from reports issued, of the very huge number of applications that are made and <Col N="1317" /> the very few places which can be filled.  I do not think any charge should be made when every Deputy knows that so many people are anxious in relation to employment, wondering where they are going to obtain any kind of employment and look to the civil service for work.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have an opportunity of speaking on this motion.  It is on an issue which typifies the approach of the Government to employment.  The action of the Government should not, however, be judged on this single issue.  It should be judged in relation to appeals which the parties which make up the Government, but especially Fine Gael, made to young people over the last number of years.  They were assured that their future lay with Fine Gael who really cared for them.  They invited them into their tender arms, but those tender arms have now become talons.  They were told that if they joined Fine Gael they could fulfill their life's ambitions.  The Taoiseach played a leading role in what can only be described as the seduction of youth. Fianna Fáil were depicted as an uncaring party, who put shackles on their ambitions. Many young people succumbed to the untruths that were told to them at that stage and fell for the promises made by Fine Gael.  The well-oiled publicity machine of Fine Gael was highly successful in its objective to attract young people into their ranks.  Tonight we are discussing the reality of what happened.  Tonight we see how Fine Gael care for the young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I had to laugh when I heard the Minister talk about the Fianna Fáil Estimate. I remember listening to Fine Gael politicians telling us in November during the election campaign how things would change when they would get into office, how Fianna Fáil were crucifying the people in relation to education, health and medical cuts.  If the Minister in his lecture to us adverted to the fact that he told us that since 1977 we have been falling into the position that he and the members of his Government now find themselves in he forgot to say what happened in November when the Estimates were published when he knew what the position was and what he and the other <Col N="1318" /> members of his party &mdash; and I am afraid, Sir, the members of your own party &mdash; said in relation to Fianna Fáil at the hustings all around this country.</P>

What are those young people now thinking?  What are they saying to themselves in relation to the Fine Gael commitments made to them?

      <P>: &mdash;&mdash;that details regarding the application fee will be given in the documents used with the application forms?  Why have they not the courage to put down that it is either £7 or £10 and have finished with it once and for all?  Let us next week publish the fact that the Minister said here tonight that if you apply for 20 jobs now the one fee will do. In the circumstances applying now in the economic climate that we find ourselves in here when the strains and stresses on young people are enormous and increasing every day, when the job opportunities open to them are extremely limited, the imposition of this fee, while the Minister may feel that the amount is very little, is to many people the last straw.  The wording of the amendment is an insult to them because it states, &ldquo;recognises that in present financial circumstances it is desirable that the cost of State services be borne to at least some extent by those making use of the services&rdquo;.  These young people have no option but to make use of the services because the only way they can join the civil service is by going through the Local Appointments Commission or the Civil Service Commission.  They cannot join the civil service in any other way. To say that they are making use of the State services is somewhat misleading.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>: Then that is fine.  These young people are being asked to pay a fee, a levy, a charge.  These are words that we all have heard in the last few weeks and days in relation to tax, rates and so on.  These words are in vogue in the county councils.  People are being <Col N="1320" /> asked to pay this fee for the privilege of getting an application form for a job. They have no option but to use that service because they cannot join the public service in any other way.</P>
      <P>I agree with the Minister's figures and with some of his sentiments with regard to the number of young people applying to the Civil Service Commission and the Local Appointments Commission, but I cannot see how else he can screen.  I agree with him that if you state basic qualifications the Civil Service Commission is the one way through which you can process job applications.  At least it means that those who apply know that they must be best before they can get the job.  I do not like to hear the Minister talking about the screening process.</P>

      <P>: Estimates of receipts in 1983 from EEC funds made at this stage of the year are subject to a wide margin of variation.  For example, receipts under the FEOGA guarantee section, which account for a major part of estimated receipts, are affected by fluctuations in world markets, currency fluctuations and various other factors.  Other receipts will depend on the projects approved by the EEC Commission and the pace of implementation of these projects.</P>
      <P>Subject to the foregoing, the following estimates are provided:</P>
      <P>FEOGA Guarantee Section.  No reliable estimate is possible at this stage for the reasons already indicated and also because the prices for the current year have not yet been settled.</P>
      <P>European Regional Development Fund.  Receipts in 1983 are estimated at about IR£70 million, viz. £68 million from the quota section and £2 million from the non-quota section.  For details of the headings under which these receipts are expected I would refer the Deputy to Table 4 of the Revised Public Capital Programme for 1983, shown on page 175 of the 1983 budget publication.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European Social Fund.  Receipts are estimated to be of the order of £90 million. Operations which benefit from the fund in Ireland are those relating to vocational training of unemployed and redundant workers, retraining of existing employees for higher qualifications, training for junior or middle management <Col N="983" /> skills, schemes for the promotion of employment mainly for young persons and programmes for rehabilitation of the handicapped.</P>
    <P>FEOGA Guidance Section.  Receipts in 1983 are estimated at about IR£65 million.  The main claims for reimbursement will be under the following headings: Mountain and Hill Farming, IR£20 million; Drainage Programmes, IR£10 million; West of Ireland Programme, IR£8½ million; Farm Modernisation, IR£7½ million; Meat Programme, IR£6½ million; Marketing and Processing Projects, IR£5½ million (very tentative estimate); Dairy Herds Conversion &mdash; Guidance element, IR£2 million; Animal Disease Eradication, IR£1.8 million.</P>
    <P>EMS Interest Subsidies.  Subsidies amounting to £42 million are expected in 1983.  These subsidies, which are related to Ireland's borrowings from the European Investment Bank and under the New Community Instrument, usually amount to £46 million a year but because of an overpayment of £4 million in 1982, the 1983 estimate is reduced accordingly.</P>
    <P>Other Receipts.  Other receipts from the EEC arise in areas such as research and investment and energy projects. Receipts are estimated at about IR£3 million in 1983.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 607 and 608 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my Department's policy to have inspections carried out within six weeks or so of receipt of completed application forms.  For geographical reasons and because of the need to arrange inspectors' visits on an economic basis, it is possible that from time to time there may <Col N="993" /> be longer delays in individual cases. Every effort is made to try to avoid this. In cases where applicants are not at home when the inspector calls there is a standard procedure in operation: &mdash; the inspector leaves a card and calls again by appointment; if the applicant is not at home on the second occasion, the inspector returns the file to Headquarters where the matter is taken up directly by the Department with the applicant.</P>
    <P>It may happen from time to time that the procedures set out are not fully complied with in particular cases.  If the Deputy has any such cases in mind, arrangements will be made in the Department to look into them on receipt of the relevant details.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The fees regulations do not provide for any exemptions.  The level of fee involved is relatively low in relation to the overall costs involved in the provision of buildings, even allowing for a voluntary input in some cases.  It should be borne in mind that the processing of any application, no matter who the applicant may be, involves cost to the planning authority and can raise serious planning issues which must be assessed by the authority in the context of the overall planning and development of its area.  In these circumstances and having regard to the need to reduce as far as possible the burden falling on ratepayers and taxpayers, I regret that I cannot provide for exemptions on the lines referred to in the question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>

These fees represent a small proportion of the overall costs involved and could not be considered a major burden.

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The development control system operated by the local planning authorities has significant cost implications &mdash; in excess of £9 million in the current year &mdash; which up to now have been borne by the public at large through general taxation. At a time when public finances are coming under increasing strain and simply cannot meet all of the demands made on them, it seems reasonable and equitable that the persons who utilise the planning system to develop property from which they will derive enhanced benefit, should make some direct contribution towards the overall cost of the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of buildings, the level of fee at £1.75 per square metre of gross floor space represents a small proportion of the overall cost involved and could not be regarded as a major imposition, even <Col N="1005" /> in the case of large developments.  It is not unreasonable that the amount of the fee should be related to the extent of the development and I do not propose, therefore, to provide for an upper limit on the lines referred to in the question.</P>

    <P>Present statutory requirements aim at upholding satisfactory driving standards in a number of ways.

Such applications arise in exceptional circumstances.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 663 and 664 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as standards for examining learner drivers are concerned, I am satisfied that the driver testing system operated by my Department is generally of an adequate and even standard.  Only minimal changes to it will arise from implementation of EC Directive 80/1263 of 4 December 1980, dealing with the harmonisation <Col N="1012" /> of the laws of member states in relation to driver licensing.</P>
    <P>I do not propose at present to introduce regulations to deal with the operations of driving schools.  The EC directive referred to does not concern itself with this question.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 672 and 673 together.  The information sought is as follows:</P>
      <P>Allocations for the various programmes/services are generally based on claims submitted by local authorities having regard to the financial provisions made available by the Government in the revised Public Capital Programme and the revised Estimates for Public Services. The amount allocated to individual authorities is assessed on a number of factors such as the demand for the service or project in the area, on-going programmes/projects in the area and general ability of the authority to proceed with the programme, and so on.</P>
      <P>The allocations listed below are adequate for the continuation of normal services.  In the case of local authority housing, the allocations cover commitments at 1 January 1983 and new starts up to the end of February.  Additional allocations will be made later in the year to cover further housing starts.  In the case of house purchase loans and sanitary services, the allocations will be kept under review during the year in the light of the demands in different areas.</P>

      <P>In general, local authorities have like powers in regard to charging for services. There are some exceptions &mdash; for example, urban authorities may not charge for water supplied to domestic consumers whereas county councils may make such charge.</P>
      <P>It is my intention to confer on all local authorities a general power to charge for services by way of legislation which will be introduced shortly, and this will serve also to do away with any anomalies in the existing powers as between different authorities.</P>

      <P>Revenue expenditure is met from rates, State grants and miscellaneous receipts, accruing from such items as housing rents and other charges for goods and services.</P>
      <P>There is no substantial change this year in the basic method of financing local authorities but I would refer the Deputy to my speech during the course of the debate on the budget (Dáil Debates Volume 340, No. 9, Columns 1752 to 1756) in which I outlined my policy of increasing the financial independence of local authorities.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 681 and 682 together.</P>
      <P>Financial aid from EEC sources for the improvement of public roads was received in 1982 from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and by way of grants under the western package.  The amounts of such aid from each source in 1982 were as follows:</P>
      <P>European Regional Development Fund: The amount received from the quota section was £11.7 million.  This was treated as a recoupment of Exchequer expenditure on assisted projects and was used to increase the overall resources of the Public Capital Programme.</P>
      <P>Particulars in respect of aid from the non-quota section are set out in a reply by the Minister for Finance on 3 February 1983 to Questions Nos. 50, 51 and 52 from Deputy J. Leonard and Deputy N. Blaney.</P>
      <P>Western Package: £781,085 was received under the package.  This was treated as an appropriation-in-aid of the Environment Vote.</P>
      <P>The ERDF (Quota Section) aid is assisting the execution of works not only on projects included in the road development plan for the 1980s but also other road improvement schemes throughout the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The western package provides, <i>inter alia</i>, assistance towards the costs of improvement works on county roads, used mainly for agriculture and forestry in 13 counties.  At least 35 per cent of the inhabitants of the district involved have to be principally engaged in agriculture or forestry.  To avail of the aid for roads <Col N="1028" /> under the western package, the block grant for roads to certain county councils in 1982 included sums specifically to finance programmes of works on eligible county roads as follows:</P>

    <P>1981 was the first year of the western package.  The allocation in that year to Galway County Council was £179,000.</P>
    <P>Works under the foregoing schemes were undertaken at a large number of locations throughout the entire country. I feel sure that the Deputy will accept that the preparation of lists showing the hundreds of locations involved would take up a disproportionate amount of time in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The Deputies will appreciate that I do not have functions in relation to prices and margins for oil products sold on the market and, therefore, in reply to the question I have to rely on data generally available.  On the basis of monthly <Col N="1040" /> information received by the EEC from the member states (excluding Greece) the simple average of the tax exclusive EEC prices of gas oil and fuel oil on 15 December 1982, which is the latest date of available information, was US $317.42 per 1,000 litres and US $191.21 per tonne respectively.  The Irish prices at the same time were gas oil US $357.68 per 1,000 litres and fuel oil US $222.82 per tonne.</P>
      <P>It is estimated that industrial consumption in Ireland of gas oil in 1982 was 0.232m. tonnes and fuel oil 1.492m tonnes.  The extra cost to Irish industry when compared with the simple average of EEC prices was therefore $11.1m. gas oil and $47.2m. fuel oil.</P>
      <P>If the EEC average is weighted by total oil consumption in each country the estimate of the extra cost to Irish industry is US $11.0m gas oil and US $63.1m fuel oil.</P>
      <P>Care must be taken with the data on the following grounds: (a) extrapolations from one month to an annual basis can be misleading particularly in regard to 1982 when there were many fluctuations in prices between products and between countries; (b) price data for gas oil includes prices charged for household gas oil usage; (c) petrol has been excluded as industrial use of petrol is not separately available; (d) the break down of fuel oil and gas oil and usage in each member state for 1982 is not yet available.</P>
      <P>The latest Community monthly pre-tax price data available from the EEC Commission is as follows:</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Molony</b> asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the cost of maintaining Whitegate Refinery (a) annually and (b) expressed in the additional cost per gallon of petrol/oil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>: I am assuming that the question does not relate solely to the operational costs at Whitegate which are competitive for a refinery of its type.</P>
      <P>There are different methods of evaluating the cost in national economic terms of retaining the refinery in operation and the results of the calculations can vary considerably dependent on which method is chosen and when the calculation is done.</P>
      <P>The method of calculation of the cost which follows is based on a comparison of the refinery product prices with the average of the oil companies' actual import prices of product (which would cover both spot-related and term contract purchases) on the grounds that it is reasonable to assume that this average price would equal the average price of the oil product imports substituted by the refinery's output.</P>
      <P>The difference between ex-Whitegate prices and the companies' average import prices during the period 6 September 1982 to end-February 1983 is estimated at approximately $20 million.  On an annual basis this cost would be in the region of $43 million but I must point out that annualising the historical cost could prove to be misleading as the import prices of petroleum products fluctuate continuously.  Indeed, both the Whitegate and import prices have dropped considerably from 1 April 1983.  A factor which could affect the annual outturn is that, since September last, Whitegate has been refining the final contract shipments of what was at that time relatively high-priced Saudi crude oil.  The only realistic annual figure would be a calculation after a full year's operation.</P>
      <P>Applying this annualised cost of $43 million to the total petrol and oil sales in Ireland in 1982 yields a figure of approximately 3p per gallon.</P>

However, I will try to obtain the information requested, from the organisations concerned, and I will write to the Deputy in the matter.</P>
      <P>Regarding the prospects of obtaining increased Social Fund assistance for the Dublin region, I would point out that the amount of fund assistance approved for the country generally has increased each year since we joined the EEC.  A considerable amount of that assistance has gone towards programmes carried out in the Dublin area.  The prospects of obtaining increased assistance for Dublin will depend on the extent to which eligible programmes are promoted by organisations in the area.  The assistance of my Department will continue to be available in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Cooney)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The information sought by the Deputy is as follows:</P>
      <P>(1)  Recruitment to An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and An Slua Muirí has been suspended temporarily as part of the Government programme for achieving a reduction in the level of public expenditure in 1983.</P>
      <P>(2)  Potential officers' courses are conducted as required to maintain a pool of qualified personnel to fill vacancies as they arise.  At present there are sufficient personnel so qualified. Potential NCO courses will continue to be conducted during 1983; the reduction in full-time training will be made up by additional week-end periods of training for potential NCOs.</P>
      <P>(3)  Paid week-end security duties are undertaken occasionally by FCA personnel to relieve Permanent Defence Force personnel for other operational commitments.  These duties will be continued on a limited scale as required by the exigencies of the service.</P>
      <P>(4)  Issues of clothing and footwear are not expected to be affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(5)  It is anticipated that the level of activity on field days will be approximately the same as in 1982.  However, such field days will, as far as possible, <Col N="1045" /> be held at locations where the provision of rations is feasible.</P>
    <P>(6)  It is anticipated that expenditure on mileage in relation to field days and local training activities will be maintained at the same level as in 1982.</P>
    <P>(7)  Approximately 330 First Line Reservists and 9,000 Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil and Slua Muirí personnel will undergo annual training in 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will state in relation to the PSORG report, 1969 (a) the number of officers in his Department deployed mainly on this type of work in 1973, 1977 and 1983 and (b) the progress achieved to date on each civil service Department; and whether he considers, in view of the lack of progress in this area, that the concept should be abandoned and his staff redeployed on other more pressing work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>: (a) The Public Services Organisation Review Group recommended wide-ranging and fundamental changes in the organisation and management of the civil service, including the transfer of central responsibility for the organisation, personnel and remuneration functions <Col N="1046" /> from the Department of Finance to a new Department of the Public Service. Because of the wide range of the review group's recommendations, it could be said that all the ongoing work of public service management and control now carried out by the Department of the Public service was touched upon in the report of the review group.</P>
      <P>I am assuming, however, that the Deputy is referring to work arising from the specific recommendations in the PSORG report relating to the concept of departmental restructuring on the basis of separation of responsibility for policy and execution and the provision of staff support in the functions of planning, finance, organisation and personnel. Because some of the officers engaged on this work had other responsibilities, it is not possible to give precise figures but the full-time equivalents of officers in my Department engaged on this work on the duties mentioned were approximately: 1973, 3; 1977, 6; 1983, 14.</P>
      <P>(b)  The structural reform is aimed at securing the clearer identification and separation of policy and executive work, a more rational distribution of functions and the development of specialist staff support units.  The Departments of Health and Transport have been reorganised on the basis of those principles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New structures, derived from a comprehensive analysis of functions, have been agreed with the management and staff representatives in eight Departments: Agriculture; Defence; Education; Environment; Gaeltacht; Trade, Commerce and Tourism; Labour; and Social Welfare.  Detailed implementation work is now in progress in those Departments. Proposals have been put to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry without agreement having been reached, while proposals have yet to be put to the Department of Justice.  Global reorganisation programmes have not been initiated in the Departments of Industry and Energy (some of whose functions had been studied before their transfer from the then Department of Industry, Commerce and Energy), Posts and Telegraphs, because of the proposed establishment <Col N="1047" /> of the two boards, or Foreign Affairs.  The Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, and the Public Service were not intended to be restructured on the same lines because they supply central support to Government.</P>
    <P>Most Departments have either established the specialist units for planning, finance, organisation and personnel or have designated the officers who are to head the units.</P>
    <P>I strongly disagree with the view that the concepts recommended by the PSORG should be abandoned at this stage.  They provide an ideal framework within which measures to secure better management and value for money in the public service &mdash; so vital in present circumstances &mdash; can be put into effect.  I have many such measures under active consideration at present and I intend to press them as a matter of urgency.</P>

      <P>: Telephone service was offered last year to all applicants in the Black Valley area of County Kerry.  None of the applicants accepted the offer.</P>
      <P>Because of the distances involved, the nature of the terrain and the scenic character of the area provision of telephone service by normal means, that is, by way of overhead linework is not considered feasible.</P>

    <P>Because of the very heavy capital costs the rental chargeable to each applicant <Col N="1059" /> would be higher than normal and would be of the order of £150 a quarter.  In order to ensure some degree of return on the capital expended each applicant would be required to make advance payment equivalent to seven years' rental at current rates together with a connection charge.

      <P>: I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as the taxpayer's income did not exceed the tax-free allowances for the year 1981-82 no PAYE was deducted from the emoluments received. There is no information available to the Inspector of Taxes which suggests that the taxpayer is entitled to a tax refund for any year.</P>

      <P>: It would be premature to give a date by which works to Ross Castle will be completed. A considerable amount of work was done to the monument between 1975 and 1982 to prevent its collapse and to undo some of the less sympathetic alterations of the last 300 years.  Structural consultants were engaged last year to prepare detailed plans for the major structural consolidation of the castle which is necessary before final conservation can commence.  This structural work will take about four years to complete.</P>

      <P>: In the period mentioned by the Deputies the maximum tax inclusive prices for the major petroleum products in Ireland have been fixed by maximum prices orders under the Prices Acts.  However, in view of the fact that each of these orders sets separate individual prices for up to 75 different products or brands at wholesale level and for up to 26 at retail level the preparation of a statement giving the tax-exclusive element in each price on 16 different dates over the past eight years is not <Col N="1079" /> possible in the short time available.

      <i>Notes</i>:</P>
    <P>* From 1 December, 1981 the excise duty on hydrocarbon oils in the Residual Fuel Oil category was reduced by 2.5p per gallon (to 4.5p per gallon) where the oil was for use for a purpose other than the generation of electricity for sale.</P>
    <P>&dagger; Residual Fuel Oil used for the purpose of generating electricity for sale remained chargeable with excise duty at the rate of 7p per gallon and other R.F.O. at 4.5p per gallon.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1081" /> In regard to prices of petroleum products in the UK and other EEC countries, some limited information in this regard is published by the EEC Commission in their oil bulletin but I think it important that any conclusions drawn from that information should have due regard to a lack of uniformity which exists in the price-reporting procedures operating in the various countries.  Indeed the Commission's bulletin itself carries a qualification to the effect that in the figures included no account is taken of market structures, quality specifications and methods of distribution which are unique to each member state.</P>
    <P>As the Deputies may be aware substantial reductions have recently been made in the Irish maximum prices for petroleum products with effect from 1 April 1983 (wholesale) and 5 April (retail).  The pre-tax reductions involved range from 10.25p to 13.5p per gallon in the price of petrol, from 6p to 8p per gallon on road diesel, from 4p to 8p per gallon on other gas oils and from 1p to 3.5p per gallon on fuel oils.</P>

      <P>: The price reductions to which the question relates have, in fact, already been brought about.  The relevant order came into effect at wholesale level on 1 April 1983 and at retail level on 5 April 1983.  The new reduced prices are set out in the Maximum Prices (Petroleum Products) (No. 4) Order, 1983, S.I. No. 93 of 1983, which was presented to the Dáil on 31 March and is now available in the Dáil Library and full details were published in the daily newspapers on 2 April 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision having been made for increases in excise duties of 6p (including VAT) per gallon on petrol and 4p <Col N="1082" /> (including VAT) per gallon on road diesel the net reductions at retail level provided for in the order range from 6.6p to 10.6p per gallon on petrol.  The reductions at wholesale level range from 3.41p to 5.87p per gallon on road diesel, from 6p to 7.5p per gallon on industrial gas oil and home heating oil and from 1p to 3.5p per gallon on industrial fuel oil.</P>

      <P>: The present chairman of the Adoption Board, who is a district justice released from her duties as district justice, receives the salary of a district justice. The chairman was first appointed on 1 February 1975.</P>
      <P>The deputy chairman, when acting as chairman, is paid such remuneration as may be determined by the appropriate Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  The rate obtaining as at 29 January 1983 was £40 a day.  The term of office of the former board expired on that date.  The Minister for Health appointed a new board for the period from 30 January 1983 to 29 January 1988 and, with the agreement of the Government, introduced a provision for the payment of a fee of £750 a year to each ordinary member of the board.  No appointment to the office of deputy chairman of the new board has yet been made.</P>
      <P>The members of the board are paid travelling expenses and subsistence allowances at the Class A rates approved from time to time for higher civil servants. Where, however, these subsistence allowances prove inadequate in any case there is special provision, as an alternative, for the payment of the vouched cost of hotel room plus vouched reasonable expenditure on meals.</P>

      <P>: My predecessor made funds available to the Eastern Health Board to enable the board to afford financial assistance up to an amount of £16,000 to the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association in respect of the year 1982.  However, as the Deputy will appreciate, the board, in accordance with standard procedures, was obliged to have regard to the statement of accounts of the association in deciding on the extent to which payment was justified.  In the event, the grant required to meet the association's shortfall for 1982 amounted to £11,844.</P>
      <P>In respect of 1983, I have made sufficient funds available to the board to enable it to afford assistance on the same general level as was given to the association in respect of 1982.  Already an advance of £4,156 has been paid in respect of the current year bringing the total payment since March 1982 to £16,000.  The board will not be in a position to determine the amount of further assistance required by the association until such time as it obtains and examines the audited accounts of the association for the year ended 31 March 1983 and projected accounts for the year commencing 1 April 1983.</P>

      <P>: Although there is a waiting list for orthodontic treatment in the Western Health Board area, in normal circumstances the child in question would now be in a position where approval to proceed with treatment would be given.  However, the specific type of orthodontic treatment required &mdash; fixed appliance therapy &mdash; is <Col N="1089" /> one for which the Department of Health has been seeking to get agreement on a scale of charges with representatives of the private orthodontists who provide the service on behalf of the health boards. The absence of an agreed scale of charges has led to a hold up in the issue of authorisations for treatment.  Discussions on a fixed scale of fees are in progress with the private orthodontists and I am hopeful that agreement will shortly be reached so that treatments can again be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>The rates of allowances at present paid by the respective health boards are set out in the tabular statement hereunder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that the minimum allowance for foster care should be not less than the non-contributory's orphan's allowance under the social welfare code and my Department have recommended this <Col N="1091" /> guideline to the health boards.  In fact, however, some of the health boards pay more than the recommended minimum rate in respect of older children.</P>
    <P>The linking of allowances to the social welfare rates allows for the automatic <Col N="1092" /> revision of the allowances by the boards in line with social welfare increases without any specific direction from me.  The new regulations (article 15) make provision however for the giving of such a direction should circumstances so require.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned is presently in receipt of flat-rate unemployment benefit at the weekly rate of £45.20 which is the rate appropriate to a married man after 156 days of receipt of unemployment benefit with less than 280 paid contributions during the last seven years.</P>
      <P>This rate does not include pay-related benefit as prolonged inquiries to determine his eligibility for pay-related benefit were only recently completed.  He is entitled to pay-related benefit at the weekly rate of £8.18 increased to £15.13 from 1 January 1983.  All arrears of pay-related benefit were paid to him last week.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 4 January 1983.  However, she is not entitled to unemployment benefit because the contributions payable in respect of her employment during the relevant contribution period 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982 were at the class J rate which provides cover for occupational injuries benefit only.  The decision in that regard was conveyed to her on 23 March 1983.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned has been awarded a widow's contributory pension, at the maximum rate appropriate to a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children, with effect from 24 December 1982.  A pension order book with orders payable from 25 March 1983 was issued to the designated post office on 24 March 1983 for collection by her and she was notified accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrears of pension from 24 December 1982 to 24 March 1983, adjusted in <Col N="1097" /> respect of disability benefit which she received in the same period, have been paid direct to her by payable order.  Her husband who died on 11 November 1982 was in receipt of old age non-contributory pension which included an increase in respect of his wife.  This payment was continued for six weeks after his death up to 23 December 1982.</P>
    <P>The claim form received in this case on 15 December 1982 was for a widow's non-contributory pension.  It was only following a visit to the claimant by the local officer of the Department and further inquiries that her entitlement to a contributory pension was established.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 12 November 1982.  However, there is no record at the Department of contributions in respect of him in either of the contribution periods from 6 April 1980 to 5 April 1981 or from 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982 and his claim was accordingly disallowed.  The possibility that contributions due to be paid in respect of him were not paid is being investigated by a social welfare officer and his entitlement will be reviewed in the light of the outcome of these inquiries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He is not entitled to unemployment assistance as the means assessed against him, £30 weekly derived from board and lodging in his brother's home exceed the maximum rate payable to him.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Following investigations it was decided to award allowance to the person concerned with effect from 1 September <Col N="1100" /> 1982.  This is the earliest date from which allowance can commence to accrue in respect of a child born in August 1982. An allowance book payable from March 1983 at £11.25 per month was issued direct to the claimant's home address on 23 March 1983.  A payable order in respect of arrears of £67.50 due for the period September 1982 to February 1983 was issued on 25 March 1983.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The person concerned is entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £6.95 being the maximum rate payable to him £43.95 less means £37 with effect from 29 September 1982.  Means are derived from the benefit to him of his wife's earnings.  All arrears due were paid to him on 30 March 1983. Further weekly payments at £6.95 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason for the further reduction in the rate of widow's pension being paid to a person (details supplied) in County Westmeath; when the situation will be clarified with regard to her husband's social security contributions in England; and the financial bearing this will have on her allowances here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The rate of widow's non-contributory pension being paid to the person concerned was reduced by £2 per week from 14 January 1983, following a re-investigation of her means derived from earnings and a holding of land.  Her current pension of £23.80 a week is that appropriate to a widow under 66 years of age who has no qualified children and who has weekly means which exceed £14 but do not exceed £16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1101" /> During an examination of her possible title to a widow's contributory pension in 1967 under the Irish-United Kingdom reciprocal agreement on pensions in operation at that time it was stated by the Department of Health and Social Security in Britain that whilst an insurance number had been allotted by them to her late husband no contributions were paid by him in that country.  This information was conveyed to the claimant again on 25 March last.</P>
    <P>The number of Irish contributions paid and credited in respect of him from the date of his first entry into insurance in January 1945 to the end of the year before his death in 1966 totalled 408.  This record provides a yearly average of only 19 contributions when spread over the 21-year period from 1945 to 1965 inclusive.  The minimum average required to qualify for the lowest rate contributory pension is 24.  The decision given to the widow in this case in 1967 that she was not entitled to a contributory pension therefore still applies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: Following a re-investigation of his case the means of the person concerned were factually assessed at £57.65 weekly with effect from 9 March 1983. Means in his case were derived from the value of his holding.  He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the rate of £11.90 weekly being the maximum rate payable to him £69.55 less means £57.65.</P>
      <P>He has appealed against the amount of means assessed against him and his case has been referred to a social welfare officer for further inquiries.  When these are completed his case will be submitted to an appeals officer for determination and his rate of unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of his decision.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned was disallowed payment of disability benefit from 31 January 1983 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work. Following an appeal against the disallowance he was examined by a different medical referee on 6 April 1983.  On this occasion the medical referee was of the opinion that he was incapable of work. Payment of disability benefit has been restored to the claimant on the basis of the second medical opinion and all the arrears payable from 31 January 1983 have been issued to him.</P>

      <P>: Under the existing scheme free travel is available to married couples travelling together provided one member of the couple qualifies for free travel. Extension of the scheme to give individual entitlement to a spouse who was not qualified for free travel in his or her own right would be a radical departure from the conditions of age or permanent incapacity on which the existing scheme is based.  It would no longer be possible to confine the scheme to the groups for whom it was intended and there would also be significant cost implications. Expenditure on the scheme in 1983 is estimated at £19.5 million and I have no funds available to meet the additional cost of any extensions to the scheme.</P>

      <P>: The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 18 January 1982 to 15 January 1983.  Payment ceased at that date as, according to the records of my Department, he had fewer than 156 contributions paid on his behalf since <Col N="1134" /> his entry into insurance and he was therefore entitled to benefit for only 52 weeks. The claimant indicated that he was previously employed in Great Britain and inquiries were made from the British authorities to ascertain his British insurance record.  On completion of these inquiries, it was established that he has sufficient contributions paid to qualify him for further payment.  Accordingly, arrears of disability benefit payable to 16 April 1983, less the amount advanced to the claimant by way of supplementary welfare allowance, have been issued and further payments will continue to issue weekly while he remains incapable of work.</P>

Payment ceased after that date as he had fewer than the required minimum 156 paid contributions to his credit since his entry into insurance to entitle him to further payment.  To requalify for further payment of benefit it would have been necessary for him to resume work and have at least 13 weeks of insurable employment after the last payment of benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension requires a claimant to have at least 156 contributions paid in respect of his employment. The department's records show that a total of 88 contributions were paid in respect of the employment of the person concerned in Ireland.  Therefore, he does not qualify for a retirement pension under Irish legislation.</P>
      <P>Under EEC Regulations on social security account can be taken of his British insurance record but as he had only 42 contributions paid in respect of employment in Britain the combined total of 130 paid contributions is still not sufficient to enable him to satisfy the required condition under Irish legislation.

      <P>: The person concerned claimed disability benefit in respect of the period from 8 July 1982 to 16 October 1982 and was paid at the rate appropriate to a married woman.  She made a further claim to disability benefit from 5 January 1983 and payment commenced at the appropriate rate.  As a result of a letter from her employer in January 1983 it was ascertained that her original claim should properly have been one for occupational injury benefit.  While the position was being established she was inadvertently paid further benefit for that period instead of the then current claim.  This resulted in an overpayment of £209.84 after her claim was admitted for injury benefit and allowance made for the difference between the injury and disability benefit rates.</P>

      <P>: The claim to unemployment benefit of the person concerned was turned down by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not available for employment as she was not genuinely seeking work.  Following an oral appeal hearing at which she gave evidence on her own behalf the appeals officer was not satisfied that she was genuinely available for employment and he confirmed the decision of the deciding officer disallowing her claim.</P>
      <P>Availability for employment means that the claimant must be genuinely in the labour market for full-time employment. He or she must be free to take up such work, must be making genuine efforts to get work and must not place unreasonable limits on the type or location of the employment which would be acceptable.</P>

    <P>While a person in receipt of an unmarried mother's allowance may, provided she satisfies the conditions, receive a reduced rate of unemployment or disability benefit as well as her unmarried <Col N="1159" /> mother's allowance, she cannot qualify for unemployment assistance in addition to her allowance as an unmarried mother.

      <P>A pension book at the rate of £75.70 was inadvertently issued at the general renewal of pension books from 31 March 1983.  A replacement book at the correct rate of £83.15 payable from 31 March 1983 was forwarded to the person concerned on 25 March 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>: It was indicated by my predecessor in reply to a similar question on 3 November last that it is the intention to extend optical and dental benefit to the wives of insured workers as soon as practicable, having regard to other priorities and the finances available.  The annual cost of extending the benefits in the manner suggested would be about £5,500,000.  No provision was made for the proposal in the 1983 Estimates drawn up by the previous Government nor in the current revised Estimates.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the critical state of the public finances and the necessity to allocate scarce resources to those whose needs are greatest, such as the very large number of unemployed, I do not have any resources for this area at present. Insured persons who hold medical cards and their wives are covered by the schemes administered by the health boards and to this extent cases of hardship are accordingly catered for under existing arrangements.</P>

      <P>: The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned has been allowed at the weekly rate of £51.65 being the maximum rate payable to him £69.55 less means £17.90 derived from the value of his holding and from capital. Weekly payments at £51.65 commenced last week.  There are, however, no arrears of unemployment assistance due as he was in receipt of advances of supplementary welfare allowance pending decision on his unemployment assistance claim and the amount paid had to be recouped to the health board.</P>

      <P>: (a) The weekly amount of pay-related benefit to which the person concerned was entitled from 14 February 1983 was £11.67.  (b) He has received flat rate unemployment benefit from 3 February <Col N="1177" /> 1983 at the maximum weekly rate in his case of £81.95 and pay-related benefit from 14 February 1983 at the weekly rate of £11.67.  (c) Gross weekly payments of £93.62 will continue to be made to him as they become due for the duration of his claim.  (d) The amount of pay-related benefit to which the person concerned is entitled is based on his reckonable earnings from 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982.  However, under the regulations, the combined amounts of flat rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and any income tax refunds paid may not exceed 85 per cent of the person's average net weekly earnings.  The 85 per cent limit in this case is £93.62.</P>
      <P>Accordingly the total amount payable to him by way of flat rate and pay-related benefit may not exceed this figure for the duration of his claim.</P>

      <i>Notes</i>:</P>
    <P>(1) There is no Deputy Secretary post in the Department.</P>
    <P>(2) New posts were sanctioned after 21 July 1981 because of an increase in the Department's workload, particularly in relation to unemployment benefit claims.  The increase in the total number of posts is partially offset by unfilled vacancies.  The nett result is that the number at (b) above shows a slight increase on the number at (a).</P>
    <P>(3) New posts in the Department's Inspection Branch were sanctioned because of an increase in the workload.  Recruitment of Social Welfare Officers is proceeding and new Social Welfare Supervisors will be appointed when the new Social Welfare Officers are recruited.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture whether he proposes to compensate farmers fully for the losses they suffer when their cattle contract one of the diseases referred to in the Diseases of Animals Act, 1966; if he is aware that the term compensation in that Act can be interpreted as full reimbursement; and if he considers that the cost of something which is of benefit to the entire community i.e. eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis, should be borne entirely by one section of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>: The diseases of animals and poultry scheduled in the Diseases of Animals <Col N="1189" /> Act, 1966 are divided into Class A and Class B diseases.</P>
      <P>No case of a Class A disease has occured in Ireland in recent years and the question of paying compensation in respect of these diseases does not therefore arise.</P>
      <P>The main Class B diseases, where compensation arises, are bovine tuberculosis and brucellosis.</P>
      <P>In the case of an animal slaughtered following a positive reaction to a test for either of these two diseases, the herd-owner is entitled to receive both the salvage value of the animal and, subject to certain conditions, an additional payment by way of a compensatory grant. Grant levels were, in fact, substantially increased recently.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that animals infected with disease are unlikely to command the same market value as disease-free animals, I am satisfied that the present arrangements provide for adequate reimbursement to herdowners in respect of reactor animals slaughtered under the schemes relating to the eradication of the two diseases mentioned.</P>
      <P>In so far as eradication of TB and brucellosis is essential in order to maintain and expand overseas markets for our livestock and livestock products, the primary beneficiary of the eradication schemes is the farming industry.  However, the present position is that apart from relatively minor amounts recouped from the EEC, the substantial funds already expended and currently being spent by the State on the disease eradication programmes are derived entirely from general taxation. There is therefore no question of the cost being borne only by one section of the community.</P>

      <P>: I propose to take Questions Nos. 1151 and 1152 together.</P>
      <P>It is not possible within the financial resources available at present to improve beyond last year's level the means test conditions to be prescribed for the purpose of determining elegibility for higher education grants in respect of students sitting for the leaving certificate examination in 1983.</P>
      <P>It is desired to point out that substantial improvements were made in the grants scheme in 1981; the means limit for fees and maintenance grant was raised to £12,000 from £6,100 and the means limit for a fees only grant was raised to £14,000.  In addition, the maximum value of the grant was raised from £600 to £1,000 plus fees.</P>
