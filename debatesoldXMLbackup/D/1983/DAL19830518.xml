      <P>I understand that it is proposed to have expressions of condolence on the death of Frank Aiken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Frank Aiken's record of service to the nation is known to all. For over 40 years from his participation in the events that led to the independence of this State until he relinquished office as Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1969 he was active in the political life of this country. In the final ministerial office which he held he enhanced this country's reputation in the international forum.  His work to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons through the United Nations, led to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty of 1961, which is a monument to his persistence and idealism.</P>
      <P>His kindness and generosity to which I myself and other members of my family can personally testify, brought him the regard of all who knew him, and with his wife, whose tragic death darkened the closing years of his life, he will be remembered affectionately by all whose paths crossed his during that long life.  I wish to extend my sympathy to his family on behalf of the Government and on behalf of the party I lead.</P>

      <P>Tháinig brón mór <Col N="1492" /> orainn go léir nuair a chualamar go raibh Proinsias Mac Aogáin imithe ar shlí na fírinne.  Togha fear a bhí ann, laoch cróga, Gaelach.</P>
      <P>With the death of Frank Aiken Ireland has lost a distinguished public man.  His contribution to the attainment of our freedom and to the wellbeing of our people has been enormous.  His love of country, patriotism, integrity, selfless dedication to his political ideals, his particularly strong devotion to the Irish language all won for him admiration and respect from all sides.  His long and distinguished career of public service began when as a boy of 15 he joined the Irish Volunteers and he subsequently rose to be Chief of Staff in the Irish Republican Army.  He was first elected to Dáil Éireann for the Louth constituency in 1923 and he achieved that rare distinction of an unbroken record of parliamentary service here in the Dáil covering a period of 50 years, first as Minister for Defence and during the crucial years of World War II as Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures.  His work in building up the Irish Defence Forces to the level which the maintenance of our neutrality demanded was outstanding.</P>
      <P>He was always a positive thinker and he had original ideas which he never hesitated to canvass enthusiastically.  His support for the development of Irish industry and in particular for the establishment of the Irish peat industry has been widely recognised and acclaimed. In latter years as Tánaiste and Minister for External Affairs he dedicated himself selflessly and enthusiastically to the cause of world peace and to the work of the United Nations.  By his fearless and original contribution to the UN General Assembly debates he achieved world stature, and indeed he won a proud and respected place for Ireland in the forum of the nations.  He will always, of course, be particularly associated with Éamonn de Valera, whose close friend, companion and confidant he was down years in good times and bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On behalf of my colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party and on my own behalf I join with the Taoiseach in extending to the sons and daughters of the late Proinsias <Col N="1493" /> Mac Aogáin deepest sympathy on their loss.  I gcomhluadar laochra Gael go raibh sé go deo.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of the Labour Party I, too, wish to be associated with the remarks made here this morning on the sad passing of Frank Aiken.  He served the country for many years in public life and he did so in an honourable and dedicated manner.  Our deepest sympathy is extended to the Aiken family who can be very proud of the enormous contribution made to the nation by Frank Aiken.</P>

      <P>I would like to be associated with the tributes to Frank Aiken.  I cannot say that I would have agreed with the Government with which he was associated but he would be remembered nationally if only for his great contribution in the War of Independence. Subsequently he became an international figure through his activities at the United Nations where he gave us an example which should be followed today, indicating our positive role of neutrality. I wish to be associated with the vote of sympathy to his family.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, I did not realise this point had been made yesterday.  I do not want to be over-solemn about it, but this House is specifically prohibited by the Constitution from enacting anything which is repugnant to it, and this Bill should not even have reached its Second Stage.</P>

      <P>How can the Chair be in a position to over-rule me before the Chair knows what I am going to say?  I shall endeavour to acquiesce with the Chair's hopes in this matter.  I have been conscious since yesterday of the fact that your suggestion that these matters can be dealt with on Second Stage is not really appropriate in this case because many of us would like to know the constitutional implications of this legislation before we proceed to Second Stage.  I reiterate my appeal to the Minister to let us have some indication of the Government's view of the constitutional position before Second Stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter on the Second Stage speech and perhaps the Minister might now be in a position to clarify the definition of the word &ldquo;available&rdquo; in so far as it applies to section 45. I made the case that if the director was to make an unlawful distribution of the profits, it is not apparent from the wording of the section that there is any stated liability or penalty that might be attached to the said director.  There is no penalty outlined in the Bill and perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three rules involved: (1) A distribution may only be made of profits available for the purpose. (2) Profits available for distribution are a company's accumulated realised profits so far as not previously utilised by distribution or capitalisation, less its accumulated realised losses so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganisation of capital duty made.  (3) An unrealised profit should not be applied in the paying up of debentures or any amount unpaid on any of the company's issued shares.  These rules and those in subsections (1), (2) and (3) of this section are supplemented by the remaining five subsections which set out the meaning to be assigned to some of the terms used.  A definition in section 51(4) provides that the reference to profits and losses is to both capital and revenue profits and losses.  Did the Deputy ask for some other information?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the distribution of profits as outlined by the Minister. If a director made an unlawful and fraudulent distribution of profits, is there any way of bringing him to justice and is there any penalty outlined in the Bill which would attach to him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>He would be in breach of the law if he went outside the stipulated definition of profits for distribution.  Penalties could be imposed by the courts in <Col N="1499" /> those circumstances.  So far as I am aware, the penalties to be applied would be those we discussed earlier in relation to other matters and would be up to a maximum of £500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Under section 40 certain people are named and it is stated that a person shall be guilty of an offence if he breaches a particular section.  That might have been a suitable section for an addendum as it concerns the distribution of available profits.</P>

      <P>In page 59, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(4)  Subsection (1) shall not apply to any company&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  to which Part XI of the Principal Act applies; and</P>
      <P>(b)  which has provisions in its constitution that would entitle it to rank as a public limited company if it had been registered in the State.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment arises from representations received recently which drew attention to a problem which section 56 creates for certain foreign companies operating in the State.  That section makes it an offence for any person who <Col N="1501" /> is not a public limited company, as defined in section 2 of the Bill, to carry on business under a name which ends with &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo; or PLC or the Irish equivalent.  The problem is that a company incorporated outside the State, for example under UK legislation, may be a legitimate public limited company and obliged to style itself as such.</P>
    <P>While it may establish a place of business within the State under section 6 of the Companies Act, 1963, without being incorporated here, it would be technically in breach of section 56 of this Bill by using the designation &ldquo;public limited company&rdquo; or the initials PLC as the last part of its name.  The requirements in Part VI of the 1963 Act are sufficient to prevent fraudulent registration or misleading names being used by foreign companies which establish a place of business here, and the procedures set out therein have worked well over the years.  Accordingly, it would be inappropriate to include public limited companies incorporated elsewhere and operating in the State within the scope of the offences created by section 56 of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>

      <P>In page 61, before paragraph 1, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
    </Speaker>

    <P>This amendment is necessary because of the provision in subsection (6) of section 20 of the Bill that a resolution of a company to give, vary, revoke or renew the directors' authority to allot relevant securities, although it alters the articles of the company, may be an ordinary resolution, for example, passed by a simple majority. Ordinarily under section 15 of the Principal Act, the article may be altered only by a special resolution, for example, a resolution approved by a majority of 75 per cent.  The effect of this amendment is that, instead of referring to the articles as altered by special resolution, the definition now refers to them as altered by resolution of the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1503" /> The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the further financing of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Ltd. by increasing the limits in existing legislation and also to give statutory authority for SFADCo's small industries promotional activities in west and south-west Offaly.  Specifically, the Bill provides for:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  an increase from £80 million to £120 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company;</P>
    <P>(ii)  an increase from £40 million to £60 million in the aggregate amount of grants which may be made to the company;</P>
    <P>(iii)  an increase from £22 million to £25 million in the aggregate amount of advances which may be made by the Minister for Finance to the company; and</P>
    <P>(iv)  statutory authority for SFADCo's role in the promotion of small indigenous industry in west and south-west Offaly by the amendment of sections 2 (1) and 4 (1) of the 1970 SFADCo Act.</P>
    <P>Share capital is used by the company for capital expenditure on the industrial estate at Shannon, in other locations throughout the mid-west region and west and south-west Offaly.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, factory construction and main infrastructure works in Shannon town.  A small proportion of share capital is also expended on aviation-related tourism projects of a capital nature.</P>
    <P>Grant-in-aid moneys are used to meet the company's running expenses and to provide financial aid to industries on the Shannon Industrial Estate.  Part of the company's running expenses relates to the development of traffic through the airport.  Expenditure for this purpose is met by a special Grant-in-Aid for which the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism is accountable but which comes <Col N="1504" /> within the overall limit being amended by this Bill.</P>
    <P>Repayable advances are used to finance expenditure on the provision of houses and related services for Shannon town.  The main headings of expenditure are land acquisition, construction of houses, community buildings and the provision of house loans under the company's tenant purchase scheme.  Repayable advances together with interest charged are repaid at six monthly intervals to the Exchequer by way of annuity. Expenditure by the company under the heading of share capital, Grant-in-Aid and Repayable Advances to 30 April 1983 are as follows: Share Capital, £77.3 million; Grant-in-Aid, £38.5 million; Repayable Advances, £19.1 million.  The existing limits for share capital and grants will be reached during this month.  It is, therefore, necessary that these statutory limits be now increased to enable the company to continue its operations.  The limit of repayable advances will be reached during 1984.  On the basis of estimates of expenditure available, the proposed new limits will be sufficient until 1987.</P>
    <P>When SFADCo's financial limits were last amended in 1980 their responsibility for the promotion of small indigenous industry in the mid-west was extended into west and south-west Offaly.  The extension of SFADCo's mandate into Offaly was effected by way of an administrative arrangement whereby SFADCo operated as consultants to the IDA in the area.  This arrangement has to date worked very satisfactorily.  However, I consider that, consistent with the procedure of accountability to the Oireachtas and given the temporary nature of the Offaly assignment, the amendment of SFADCo's financial limits should be availed of to put SFADCo's role in Offaly on a proper statutory footing.  The work already begun by SFADCo, particularly in the development of client and local community relations, requires a number of years before it can produce lasting and worthwhile results.  Therefore I would envisage SFADCo continuing to have statutory responsibility for small industry in this area in the foreseeable future.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1505" /> In the case of the mid-west region, SFADCo act under statutory delegated authority from the IDA.  Delegated authority will now also apply in respect of west and south-west Offaly.  I regard the intensive promotion of small indigenous industry, a task given to the company in 1978, together with the development of air traffic and the industrial estate at Shannon, as SFADCo's primary challenges. SFADCo's role in small industry is not solely concerned with the mid-west region and west and south-west Offaly; they have the far broader and more vital national task of:</P>
    <P>developing and testing concepts and systems which will lead to dramatic growth of small indigenous industry in these areas and to do so in a manner which will pioneer future national programmes.</P>
    <P>This national role must not be lost sight of.  This intensive experimental role requires resources and expertise over and above that needed in solely direct promotional work.  It also entails the devising, testing and assessment of new approaches and programmes for the intensive development of Irish indigenous industry in such way as will influence the content and directions of national policy in this sector and lead to the application throughout the country of the approaches and programmes found to be successful.  For example, two such programmes which are proving to be particularly successful in this regard are the innovation centre and the microelectronics application centre.  The innovation centre, which is a division of SFADCo and is located on the Plassey Technological Park, is currently assisting over 80 projects in places as far apart as Donegal, Waterford, Dublin and in the mid-west region.  This availability nationwide of the services of the innovation centre is made possible because SFADCo, rather than duplicating innovation centres all over the country, use the existing network of agencies and institutions which are available locally. The National Microelectronics Application Centre, which was established in 1980 by SFADCo in consultation with <Col N="1506" /> industrial firms in the mid-west region as an independent commercially oriented private company, is also assisting firms throughout the country in the very important work of redesigning existing processes and developing new ones related to the technology of the eighties and micro-chip.</P>
    <P>In addition to the experimental and pioneering-type activities, initiatives undertaken todate include the provision of a range of advisory services for small industry in the areas of finance, marketing, industrial relations, production and materials management as well as the provision of training courses specially designed and developed for those establishing, managing and working in small firms.</P>
    <P>When first given its small industry role in 1978, the total number of small firms operating in the mid-west was 300; the company had increased this number to 650 at December 1982.  The number of persons employed in small industry increased from 3,480 to 4,800 and the company expect that by the end of 1987, 7,000 people will be in full-time employment in small firms in the region.</P>
    <P>The actual number of sustainable jobs created is the true test of SFADCo's endeavours.  Therefore it is satisfactory to report that nearly 2,000 new jobs have actually been created and sustained.</P>
    <P>On the Shannon Industrial Estate total employment at 31 December 1982 was at 4,300, which was slightly down, 6 per cent, on the 1981 level.  While the lack of growth in employment on the industrial estate in 1982 is a matter of concern it is worth noting that this was the only year since 1975 in which a nett growth of jobs has not been achieved.  SFADCo are confident that a return to job growth will be achieved in the current year and are reallocating their resources to meet this challenge head on.  Despite the lack of growth SFADCo in 1982 approved facilities for expansions in 16 existing industries at Shannon which will generate 430 new jobs at full production.  1982 was also the first year in which the 10 per cent rate of tax for new service companies locating on the estate was promoted and, while <Col N="1507" /> competition from abroad to attract these international service industry projects is intense, SFADCo are confident that the marketing efforts in the US and Europe, which were intensively carried in 1982, will result in the programme making a significant contribution to the industrial estate job numbers in 1983.</P>
    <P>Value of exports from the estate continued to rise in 1982 with an 8 per cent increase to £165 million and the nett favourable trade balance increased by 3 per cent to over £93 million.</P>
    <P>Shannon Development plan in the current year to assist in the establishment of projects for both manufacturing and service industries which will generate 1,500 new jobs.  In addition, to ensure that every opportunity is taken to increase job creation from existing firms and, where possible, to avoid job losses the company are in very close contact with all firms on the industrial estate.</P>
    <P>A study to chart the future of the industrial estate over the next 20 years is being undertaken by the company.  The findings of this study will determine the kind of industry that Shannon will endeavour to attract over this period and the promotional strategies that the company will need to use.  Factors to be examined in the course of this study include technological developments, the micro and macro environment, demographic trends and educational developments all of which will have a bearing on the future development of the industrial estate.</P>
    <P>An integral part of the whole SFADCo operation is, of course, Shannon town itself.  The population of the town continues to grow steadily and at present over 8,500 people are living in Shannon.</P>
    <P>In March 1982, the first elections for town commissioners were held.  Shannon town is the first town for over 30 years to have been granted such status.  Major developments are taking place in the town centre area which represents an investment of nearly £2 million &mdash; new offices and showrooms for the Electricity Supply Board, a new public library, a new post office and a new telephone exchange.  Shannon town continues to have one of the highest home ownership <Col N="1508" /> rates in the country with almost 58 per cent of the housing stock now in private ownership.</P>
    <P>Air traffic through Shannon airport showed a substantial growth in 1982 over 1981 with an overall increase of 11 per cent and a throughput of over 1 million passengers.  This significant growth was due principally to an increase of 25 per cent in transit passengers.  Terminal traffic on the North Atlantic route, which accounts for half of all terminal traffic &mdash; 590,000 passengers in 1982 &mdash; increased by 10 per cent last year. Despite the lack of employment growth, the firms on the industrial estate, in particular, together with industrial concerns within the hinterland of the airport, contributed to a 10 per cent growth in terminal air freight in 1982.  The 1982 total level of 20,000 tonnes of air freight, most of it industrial, represents an increase of 10 per cent over 1981, and a cumulative increase of 80 per cent over the ten years to 1982.  The company are continuing their work on the development and implementation of new tourism projects which will assist in generating traffic through the airport and consolidate Shannon as the country's North Atlantic gateway.</P>
    <P>The company's indirect involvement through small industry and tourism projects in urban renewal activities in Limerick city has done much to stimulate private sector redevelopment of the decaying areas of the city.  The company, in co-operation with Limerick Corporation and other private interests, are to be congratulated on what has been achieved to-date with over 90,000 square feet developed and a further 20,000 square feet currently being developed by the private sector.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome this Bill.  We are all delighted to welcome the success story of SFADCo, a development company that dates back to the late fifties.  They are one of the few of which we can say that they have fulfilled their primary role.  The success achieved down through the years is a shining <Col N="1509" /> example for other semi-State agencies.  It is the sort of success story that we in this House welcome.</P>
      <P>This is an enabling Bill to increase the limits in existing legislation and to give statutory authority for SFADCo's small industries promotional activities in west and south-west Offaly.  The Bill, according to the Minister's speech, provides for:</P>
      <P>(i)  an increase from £80 million to £120 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company;</P>
      <P>(ii)  an increase from £40 million to £60 million in the aggregate amount of grants which may be made to the company;</P>
      <P>(iii)  an increase from £22 million to £25 million in the aggregate amount of advances which may be made by the Minister for Finance to the company; and</P>
      <P>(iv)  statutory authority for SFADCo's role in the promotion of small indigenous industry in west and south-west Offaly by the amendment of sections 2 (1) and 4 (1) of the 1970 SFADCo Act.</P>
      <P>Deputy Des O'Malley when he was Minister, extended the role of SFADCo into part of Offaly.  Some would say he included half of Offaly but Deputies from Offaly will no doubt be able to tell us more about that than I could.  This is the first opportunity the House has had to give statutory backing to that extension of the SFADCo role.  Deputy O'Malley said that he would come back to the House at the earliest opportunity to do this.  It is being done in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a long time SFADCo have fulfilled their statutory role in developing Shannon Airport and making it a worthwhile airport.  They have put their full weight behind the development of Shannon. Even in difficult times in recent years when all international aviation has suffered, the generation of business at Shannon is a tribute to all concerned.  Something over 600,000 passengers go through Shannon Airport each year.  Not alone <Col N="1510" /> does that benefit the Limerick and mid-west regions but, as statistics show, the benefits fan out all along the west coast. It has, indeed, a good contribution to make to the economic wellbeing of the entire west coast.  It is interesting to look back and see what has been achieved in the development of Shannon Airport itself in its primary role and in the development of small native industries.  The philosophy underlying the strategy, the attainment of excellence and quality, deliveries on time and getting the job done, is certainly a philosophy that could be adopted by many other companies both small and large.  Indeed, if I may say so, it is a philosophy that could be adopted with advantage by this House.</P>
    <P>We are a small country dependent for our bread and butter and our day-to-day living on exports.  We are all aware of the fierce competition that exists in world markets.  It is fundamental wisdom to look at those markets to find out what ones are available to us.  In order to succeed in those markets the job must be well done, the goods must be quality goods properly presented and delivered on time.  That is where the strength of Irish exporters lies in the fiercely competitive markets of the outside world. That is a philosophy that has been constantly promoted by the chairman of SFADCo.  He is, of course, a very successful businessman and I should like to take this opportunity &mdash; it is seldom we get the opportunity &mdash; of congratulating the chairman and his staff on the excellent job they have done and are doing.</P>
    <P>Last year was a very difficult year.  Yet, despite the difficult times, the track record was a good one by and large.  I endorse everything that has been done in industrial development there and particularly in the development of Shannon Airport, and I urge them to keep up the good work.  As well as having a primary role to play in developing small native industries they also have a secondary role.  It is an important one.  I refer to the development and testing of concepts and systems which will lead to a dramatic growth of small indigenous industries. Here is an organisation which adopts new concepts and pilot schemes and tests <Col N="1511" /> them out to see if projects are worth-while. All this is done with very small overheads.  If the test is satisfactory they let some other agency such as the IDA take the project on board.  This centre serves not alone the mid-west and the Limerick region but industry right throughout the country.  The micro electronic centre is an example of such a pilot scheme.  Here is a centre which provides a magnificent back-up service to the expanding electronic industry.  It shows clearly what can be done in a pilot scheme by an organisation like SFADCo.  When these centres were established it was made abundantly clear that we did not want another bureaucratic organisation. The staff have been kept to a minimum and that minimum staff have done the job they were set up to do.  There are no huge overheads, no bureaucracy, and there is an important lesson to be learned from that type of approach.</P>
    <P>I think, as I said, the secondary role is a most important one.  It will be a very important role in the future.  The concept of advance factories was born in the SFADCo organisation and later expanded throughout the country.  It was adopted by the IDA.  This is the type of forward thinking one needs in an organisation like SFADCo.  We are all agreed as to the beneficial results.  The advance factory idea has been in operation for quite a number of years now and we are at a stage of national development when it is time to take stock and ask ourselves what will replace the small advance factory concept.  There has been difficulty in attracting industrialists to rural areas and it is here the concept of the advance factory has played an important role. That concept has served us well.  If an industrialist can be shown a small factory unit in a remote region then industry will be attracted to that region.</P>
    <P>The time has come now to examine the whole situation.  We must look forward to the nineties and to the end of the century to discover what the new concepts should be.  We must ask ourselves what we should be doing now.  Some ideas have been tested in the United States and these are worth looking at. <Col N="1512" /> Instead of the advance factory concept for the future we shall probably be looking at a more sophisticated type of building. In the environment of the future we will have our very highly skilled welleducated graduates coming out of our schools of technology and our universities, young men and women with creative minds, in whose education we have invested heavily.  It will be their job to examine future trends in electronics, computers and telecommunications. That is the area in which there will be growth.  The ground work has been laid in electronics, computers and telecommunications. We have made a heavy investment in the infrastructure over the last four or five years.  I welcome the change in the curriculum of universities and their adoption of a more extrovert approach to the requirements of industry. As a result of this we will be able to take full advantage of this role in industry in the years to come.  These are the new concepts.</P>
    <P>More recently in the US, in Denver, I looked at an operation being carried out by Data Corporation.  They had taken over an office block and placed computers at the disposal of any student, or anybody with ideas who wanted to sit in to work out projects.  Those computers are linked to all the data banks throughout the world and people with ideas about developing projects or programmes have available to them at the push of a button all the information that is necessary to put new projects together.  Out of it about 18,000 small enterprises and new business ventures emanated.</P>
    <P>That is the type of development we need here, or something along those lines.  We have all heard of the Thousand Apples Programme.  Computers are made available to young people who want to develop ideas.  They can get all the information that is available throughout the world.  It is a good marketing strategy by a large computer firm.  There are reservations about that type of development in the United States.  People feel they are tied to one particular company, but an examination should be carried out to see what the benefits would be for this small country so that we could capitalise <Col N="1513" /> on our strength and ensure that in the future we will invest more in people than in bricks and mortar in which there is heavy capital investment.</P>
    <P>In Ireland an area that has not been well developed is the software part of the computer industry.  We have the ideal population mix to engage in that type of development.  The training that is necessary for all that is there.  When you are developing the software side of the computer industry you are investing in people.  One clear example of that is the project that was secured for the Blanchardstown estate.  The initial year's investment in that project was in the development of a product, research in that product and the training of marketing skills &mdash; all investment in people.  That is the type of new development we need. We need the total business concept: we do not want to be just an assembly line for particular products for which the research and the marketing have been done elsewhere.</P>
    <P>It is a new approach and I know SFADCo would be in line with that approach.  There are vast opportunities in the software area.  The banking and insurance institutions here are moving into the computer era.  There has been a complete new development in the banking service.  Those financial institutions could make a great contribution towards solving unemployment if they took in so many young people each year and used the hardware they have in the computer area to train those people for computer programming.  A great amount of investment is going to waste in this country.  A lot of investment has been made but proper use is not being made of the assets we have.  We have enormous expertise in that area.</P>
    <P>On my last visit to Germany as Minister for Industry and Energy I visited the Nixdorf Corporation.  I am glad we have an arm of that corporation in Bray.  There we saw that, side by side with production, there is a vast training programme going on.  There are 2,300 young people being trained side by side with the production that is taking place.  There is an interchange of young people who are there to be trained in the real work environment: <Col N="1514" /> they can be moved from their training quarters in one corridor to production in another corridor.</P>
    <P>That is the type of new thinking we need here if we are to get to grips with our problem.  I asked the head of the Nixdorf Corporation at the time if he would consider the same type of pilot programme in Ireland.  &ldquo;By all means&rdquo;, he said.  It is interesting to note that when that philosophy of a self-made man in Germany was initiated, the German authorities frowned on it and the education authorities did not want to know about it.  He knew exactly what his requirements were and he was prepared to go ahead, though nobody was prepared to listen.  Some few years later the German education authorities came back to him and said they wanted to be part of that development.  They were looking for a site in the vicinity of his operation and he put up a temporary building for them. They are now training 600 people on the industrial campus.</P>
    <P>He agreed with me that, in conjunction with the IDA and the Irish Government, he would put up a pilot scheme in Bray to accommodate 300, with no ties whatsoever. He was prepared to take in those young people, train them and take his chances on how many of them would join the Nixdorf Corporation.  We cannot let red tape and bureaucracy stand in the way of that type of development.  Our unemployment problem is too critical. We need action and results.  Throughout the country one notices the number of schools that close at three in the afternoon and which are closed altogether for five and a half months each year.  Can we afford that at this time?</P>
    <P>We will have to come to grips with this. We must use the accommodation that is there.  Equipment can be put into those schools to train those young people.  That would be genuine training in computer and software programming.  As I have said, that is an area that caters for people, not bricks and mortar which requires such heavy investment.  Old solutions are no good any more.  We must look at our strengths, see where we have to go and decide we will do it, and we cannot afford to let red tape, bureaucracy or anything <Col N="1515" /> else stand in our way.  We have 70,000 young people on the labour market at the moment, not counting the number of young people who will come out of the schools at the end of this summer, hopelessly looking for work.  We have commissioned enough reports on this front and we must now present radical solutions quickly to prepare those young people for something meaningful in life.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Government that any such solution brought forward will get the support of this side of the House. Otherwise the House will become more meaningless as the years go on.  That type of thinking is part and parcel of the SFADCo board and staff.  They have had tremendous success in taking small industries by the hand over the years.  When I was Minister I saw the success of their work and I decided it was time to extend it into the IDA operations.  For that reason, last October I extended the SFADCo approach into small industrial development under the aegis of the IDA, giving responsibility to the IDA to bring together the county development officers to join hands, as SFADCo had done, to promote and develop small industries. Incubator type factories were begun in association with third-level colleges, technical colleges and the NIHE in Limerick.  That is the type of development programme I saw in my short term in office.  Taking into account how SFADCo had developed their own system, I felt the IDA should be given the same type of approach and that decision was taken last October.</P>
    <P>Small industries should be helped by the secondment of management expertise, whether in the financial or production areas, from larger companies.  We all know that a small concern may have a production expert but they might fall short in the areas of marketing, finance control or other areas and they may not be able to afford to employ these experts who are vitally necessary to the proper development and financial wellbeing of the company.  A scheme along these lines is being developed by the IDA and it should be successful.</P>
    <P>We see the problems that arise in <Col N="1516" /> industry.  Very often there is a lack of trust between workers and management or there may be a lack of communication between them and industries close.  But workers feel that in a co-operative they could do a better job.  There is a successful co-operative in Navan.  This idea should be promoted further especially if a product is viable.  We cannot afford not to explore every avenue open to us.</P>
    <P>The secondary role of SFADCo, in the micro-electronic centre and the innovation centre and their success in these areas, is a good example of where we as a nation can go.  I subscribe fully to the philosophy of the chairman and hope this House will endorse what they are doing.</P>
    <P>Another area which has a significant potential for development is the development of the food industry.  Many reports were issued in the seventies.  I remember an excellent report, commissioned by the Bank of Ireland on the development of added-value in the food processing industry in Ireland.  It is a very interesting document which contains many excellent and worthwhile ideas. That issued in the mid-seventies but nothing much has been done about it since.</P>
    <P>The co-operatives have done an excellent job developing their products.  Bord Bainne have done an excellent marketing job.  However, there are many other areas in the food industry which need to be tackled, decisions made and action needs to be taken.  I have always held the view that while responsibility for this area is stretched over many areas we will never see desirable results.  The beef industry is a good example.  The Department of Agriculture have responsibility for agriculture, but I believe their responsibility should stop at the farm gate; pricing structures in Brussels all finish at the farm gate and a single Minister must take responsibility from there on.  For example, in the marketing area CTT do a little, CBF do a little, the co-operatives do a little and there is a range of people doing bits and pieces, some successfully. On the development side, the IDA have their own input.  Last year they produced a document which served to focus the mind and attention on the opportunities that exist.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1517" /> The FEOGA grants are not being fully utilised.  The Minister of State knows that as well as I do.  Last year and the year before grants went a-begging in Europe. The FEOGA allocations to Ireland were not taken up.  Here we are crying about development and unemployment yet we are letting money go by the board.  I believe a single Minister or agency will have to take responsibility for this area. I wrote it into the record in the Department before I left that I believe the development of the food industry should be handed to SFADCo as a pilot project for three years.  They have the expertise. They are centred in an area where they can come to grips with many of the problems facing the food industry.  After three years we could look at the results that can be achieved if nobody puts any blockages in their way, if the bureaucratic problems are removed and if they are given free rein and full responsibility.  If they are successful the responsibility can then be given to a national food development corporation, an agricultural development corporation or any other organisation.  I hope the Minister will take this opportunity to tell us if he believes in this concept, if he is prepared to run with it and give SFADCo the opportunity to develop our food processing industry.</P>
    <P>When the Prime Minister of New Zealand was in Ireland last year I had the opportunity to meet him.  He was involved in carrying out a full reappraisal of his industrial strategy and industrial policy.  As we all know, New Zealand suffered very heavily during the recession in the seventies when the British joined the EEC, because many of their markets were closed.  At that time they were faced with a very difficult challenge.  I asked the Prime Minister what the results of his industrial strategy and policy reviews had been and he said he was coming more and more to the conclusion that there were many types of industry which New Zealand should not be in but there was one they should be in.  His philosophy was, if you can grow it, New Zealand should be in it.  We have the finest grasslands in the world, the best climate for producing food with a flavour which is <Col N="1518" /> unsurpassed anywhere in the world, and our biggest asset is under-utilised.</P>
    <P>We have the capacity to do the job properly but we need to develop a philosophy of excellence and quality, which is the theme running through this SFADCo operation.  That needs to be done at national level so that Irish food can be identified as excellent quality food for the international markets.  In recent times the impact that can be made on import substitution has been discussed in this House.  Import substitution is not given much attention by many, but there is huge potential for job creation, not alone in food but also in connection with the building construction industry. Again, the job must be well done and we must produce quality products.  We must do what we do well.  If we focus our minds in that direction we can succeed, just as New Zealand has done, overcoming its problems of the seventies by concentrating its full energies and resources in the eighties on the development of its food industry.  Job creation has followed in the area of packaging, advertising, printing and all the spin-offs running right through the economy.</P>
    <P>If we cannot develop an industry for which we have the raw materials, we are on the road to nowhere, but I believe we have the capacity for this development. Everybody should know the direction in which he or she is going and be responcible to a particular Minister or agency and, given the wherewithal, that agency can do the job and can also show us the way to import substitution.  As a member of the last Government and as Minister I took a decision to set up import substitution units in the Department of the Environment to supervise the purchasing of raw materials and to monitor their importation in order to ensure that Irish suppliers got a fair crack of the whip. However, you must deliver and you must have a quality product.  The same goes for the Department of Industry and Energy.</P>
    <P>I also set up a monthly reporting system under which a report should come in from every State and semi-State purchasing area.  We saw where our purchases were being made and what was being <Col N="1519" /> done.  That gave us the opportunity of channelling most of our investment within the Irish economy.  Many purchases are being made abroad by State and semi-State operations which could have been bought at home.</P>
    <P>Within the offices of the Irish Goods Council, we set up a data bank to ensure that the suppliers' names and their products are available at the press of a button.  A similar operation is carried on in the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  A pool of information is available, but it needs to be monitored, co-ordinated and more cohesive.  We can produce many more jobs with import substitution, not to mention the thousands of jobs that would be created if we got down to producing quality food to replace all the imports on our supermarket shelves.</P>
    <P>An entrepreneurial spirit exists in most Irish people.  It saddens me to see today's approach of killing enterprise and initiative and not recognising the need for risk-takers.  The man who puts his money at risk should be rewarded for doing so, otherwise we are killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  Either we are committed to private enterprise or we are not.  If we are, the spirit of enterprise must be helped and fostered.  We should not introduce policy measures, whether in budget strategy or Finance Bills which will kill that entrepreneurial spirit.  We must produce before we can distribute. If we do not recognise that fact I and many Members of this House know where we will end up.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have shown the way in the past and can do so in the future.  Like every good organisation, after so many years in operation they are now prepared to have a look at themselves and see where they are going.  They are to be complimented for that.  If anyone wants to have a look at many of our semi-State agencies all hell breaks loose and the agencies involved adopt a defensive attitude, backing into corners.  Every three years, SFADCo look at their operations to see that their overheads are not getting out of line and that they are giving value for money invested.  I read a report <Col N="1520" /> recently that they intend bringing in a consultancy firm to help them with the investigation into their entire operation over the last three years.  I welcome that wise approach.  It is also wise not to tie up their own top managerial people where there is another job of work to be done, by bringing in outsiders to help them.  We look forward to the results of that in-depth examination.</P>
    <P>I also welcome their new approach of looking out for the next 20 years and seeing where they should be going.  I admire their chairman, who has capability and ability.  He points the way to other semi-State agencies not to be afraid to take a look at themselves and change their route.  SFADCo have achieved the role which they set themselves over the last 20 years and why should they not look at their role for the next 20?  There will have to be a different approach and perhaps a need for different policies and objectives.  That is the correct way to run a good organisation and that is why SFADCo have achieved their success. They will be equally successful over the next 20 years, given the same freedom and opportunity.  I fully support the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill, in conjunction with Deputy Reynolds who breeds optimism every time he speaks in this House on the subject of industry.  His compliments to the Shannon Free Airport Development Company are very well deserved and I concur with everything he said about the need for optimism in the future and the need to develop the service industry and about the programme already being undertaken by that development company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conjunction with this injection of capital outlined in the Bill, SFADCo have undertaken to re-examine their long-term and short-term future strategy. They have already been involved in a food development programme on a small pilot scheme basis which was illustrated last year by a food exhibition in Limerick. That food exhibition included a wide range of products, some small products being produced in home industries.  That was a notable achievement for that area. However, the Minister should give the <Col N="1521" /> development company a new direction. If Deputy Reynolds will forgive me, as a Clare Deputy I will be introverted because the development has been established in my county.  Since the small industries programme of 1978, allocated funds by Minister O'Malley, major industrial development in the industrial estate and in Ennis, in particular, has lost its emphasis.  The development company must receive greater authority from the Minister with regard to major industry in that location, instead of accepting crumbs from the IDA table.  That is not good policy.  That the IDA have not established any new major industry in Ennis since 1978 is an indictment of their policy and of their attitude to SFADCo.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Reynolds said, SFADCo was founded in 1959.  Next year they will celebrate their silver jubilee. The financial injection proposed under the provisions of this Bill is well merited by such a successful company which has secured for the industrial estate a peak of almost 5,000 jobs, mainly labour-intensive. Since the fringe elements now attaching to work have rendered it less attractive to bring in labour-intensive industries the direction of SFADCo should be towards some kind of food development programme. There are other natural resources I should like to see them take a hand in.  One of those would be the development of the entire Shannon estuary on an industrial basis.  For too long we have been ambivalent about the development of that port, of the long line on the Northern shore from Carrigaholt to Limerick and, on the southern shore, from Kerry into Limerick.  While there have been major developments in Alcan, Foynes and at Moneypoint, when these major construction industries are wound down there will be no other major industry based on the banks of the river.  I believe a company such as SFADCo would be able to undertake and examine the situation obtaining in other ports such as Le Havre in France, or other major ports in Europe, ascertaining what major industrial development took place there and also how we could attract major heavy industry into the Shannon area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1522" /> There is unemployment in the Shannon region with a pool of skilled labour, suitable to heavy industry, to the construction industry, available there.  This development company should be given some authority to assist in the industrial development of the estuary.  That would constitute a new scheme and I think was spoken about when the enabling Bill was first introduced in 1978.  I do not think the idea was ever developed.  I believe it is necessary to proceed along those lines because of the ambivalance experienced in arriving at a Shannon estuarial authority. There does not seem to be agreement between the Kilrush, Clarecastle, Limerick and Foynes harbour boards.  It is a pity to see the lack of usage of the great natural resource there, particularly with the depth of water of the Shannon. In that respect I might compliment Limerick Harbour Commissioners on their recent report outlining how, with a limited injection of capital, a great port could be made available by the removal of the sand bank opposite Carrigaholt.  I would suggest that the Minister examine the role of SFADCo in relation to this estuarial development.  While it is geographically well placed it is not being taken advantage of, nor are the labour skills available there.  While I do not know sufficient about the capital availability, SFADCo's marketing ability should be able to attract major international companies to our shores if given the opportunity.</P>
    <P>In regard to the service industries about which Deputy Reynolds spoke, there is enormous scope for software industrial promotion and service industries here, particularly in Shannon. Indeed I might commend SFADCo on the tremendous work they are doing to provide such service industries.  I cannot say the same of the IDA, certainly in the mid-west region, because of numerous occasions Clare County Council and public figures in Clare have requested the IDA to examine service industries.  All we have been told in this respect is that they have a pilot scheme in operation on a national basis.  They do not seem to be aware that in County Clare, particularly at Shannon, there is the greatest number <Col N="1523" /> of young people coming on to the labour market, without facilities, without mobility and that there is grave necessity to harness their energies and skills.  Therefore SFADCo might well move into that area also and develop service industries.</P>
    <P>One recent development was not of much advantage to the area, that was the loss of two contracts by Westinghouse Electronics and Control, at site 7 on the industrial estate.  Some 30 engineers, very skilled computer engineers, were employed on that project to develop and bid for contracts, on both occasions with the ESB.  The first was for the national control centre, when the ESB saw fit to give the work to the Brown-Boveri Corporation of Switzerland.  The other contract in respect of which Westinghouse bid was the planned control system at the Moneypoint project, when again the ESB gave it to an outside company, Siemens, of Germany or Holland; certainly they are not an Irish company.  I suppose the ESB took these decisions on economic grounds but the result of those losses of contracts has been that Westinghouse have transferred almost 30 engineers to the USA, all of them Irish, well trained, highly skilled.  I think four only remain here.  Incidentally all 30 of them have continued to find work which is an indication of the degree of skill they possess. It should be said also that it is a tribute to the technological institutes they attended, whether it was the NIHE, UCC, UCG, UCD or elsewhere.  Haemorrhages like this cannot be tolerated here.  Heavy investment in technological education should be taken advantage of rather than losses such as these being incurred.  I understand that the Minister for Industry and Energy has great admiration for the Westinghouse Corporation who have made substantial investments here.  There should have been some monitoring of these contracts before the ESB decided to place them in Europe.</P>
    <P>On the social scene, last year we had the Shannon Town Commissioners established. Here again SFADCo must be complimented on the smooth system they adopted and on their attitude to the take-over by the commissioners of part <Col N="1524" /> of the management role they had undertaken since 1979.  That particular election was not a great success for the Fine Gael party.  I am sure the majority party&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I am sure the majority party took great pride in it.  Indeed I think that election accompanied the election of the former Taoiseach and, as Deputy Barrett is wont to say, was an indication of the desire of the electorate to get rid of successive Governments no matter to which party they belonged.  Much credit is due to the agencies involved in improving the social environment of Shannon town, a new town with a population of almost 10,000 people.  The facilities being provided by the development company indicate a keen awareness of planning, though there are some aspects of the planning with which I would not agree. However, the company are promoting the development of the town.  There has been rapid commercial development of the town centre and the facilities being provided are very good.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister for the Environment to consider changing the status of the town from that of a town commission to urban council for the next local election.  This would give a greater sense of responsibility and of unity to the town in that they would be responsible for their own rates and so on.</P>
      <P>In the area of tourism SFADCo have played an important role in the Clare region and at Bunratty in particular where there has been developed a folk park that is a tribute to the various skills available in the region.  There remain in Clare craft skills that seem to have vanished elsewhere.  The company are to be complimented for their work in that regard.  However, I regret the recent controversy regarding planning permission for a building near Bunratty bridge.  This planning permission was given properly by An Bord Pleanála but Clare County Council objected to it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps I am digressing a little but the Bill relates to SFADCo who have a role in the area of tourism as was referred to by the Minister earlier.  The development company have been attempting to emphasise the connection between tourism and crafts but their efforts will be inhibited to some extent by this new development.  In the interest of preserving the single unit there the State should have stepped in to control the planning in respect of the new development. It does not say much for the State's warning system that there was no objection after the matter was passed to the planning board.</P>
      <P>This capital injection for SFADCo is on a three-year basis but I am wondering if, while this is in line with the different reviews conducted by the company, it is too short a time.  Perhaps it should be extended.  I realise that this would impose a further limit on the capital being made available but in the sixties the development company, having somewhat more freedom and more time, developed a considerable amount of industry.  They were in a position to move into wider fields.  I would consider the time element in this case to be a limiting factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to be here today to support legislation that will be to the benefit of Shannon.  It was alleged recently in the <Col N="1526" /> national press that as a Deputy for Clare I had no interest in Shannon.  The situation is that for more than 20 years I have been working in an industry that was set up by SFADCo.  We started in that industry with 40 people.  The number peaked at 1,000 but it is now down to 90.  I understand that, because of the international recession, that company are experiencing further difficulties.  However, coming into public life in 1974 I have at all times promoted the interests of Shannon and of the development company, a company which is subjected to quite severe bashing from time to time. They are bashed locally on the basis of their bureaucratic attitude on some matters, but they have been a very progressive company.  I was disappointed that I should be accused of not having any interest in the company and also that it was alleged that a Deputy had to go around this House looking for me to come in and speak on the Air Companies Bill.  That is not true.  I was here to speak on the Bill. I was the last person offering but Deputies on the other side endeavoured to let the Minister in rather than to let me contribute.</P>

I am interested in being returned <Col N="1527" /> to this House and for that reason I support the Bill wholeheartedly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowan Mr. Cowan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, welcome this Bill. I welcome it basically because it gives statutory authority to SFADCo's role in the promotion of small indigenous industry in south-west Offaly.  The relevant power is contained in the 1970 Act.</P>
      <P>In 1980 the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, brought this area of Offaly under the umbrella of SFADCo, a move that was much welcomed in that part of the county.  The basic reason for the then Minister's action was his awareness of the necessity for improved industrial development in that part of Offaly particularly.</P>
      <P>I compliment the IDA for their co-operation with SFADCo in the past three years in relation to the development of the area I am speaking of.  There has been very welcome industrial improvement in south-west Offaly as a result of that co-operation. Deputy O'Malley as Minister was aware of the very poor industrial growth in that part of Offaly along the banks of the Shannon in the south-west end of the county.</P>
      <P>Public representatives in County Offaly at both local and national level have always advocated that Offaly should be classified as a designated area due to the poor industrial growth rate there. Unfortunately successive Ministers have not acceded to our request and even at this late stage I would urge the Minister of State to consider putting the whole county under the umbrella of SFADCo. I urge this course because the industrial and employment situations have been deteriorating in the county, especially during the past year or so.  I specifically mention recent redundancies in Tullamore Yarns and the closure of Paul &amp; Vincent in Tullamore.  There are many IDA factories in Tullamore, Birr, Edenderry and Clara which have been idle for some time.  The Offaly Development Team have on numerous occasions put forward a very good case to have the whole county designated because we have one of the slowest industrial growth rates in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> The involvement of SFADCo has brought about improvements in west and south Offaly which we could not have envisaged.  Small industries have been expanded and others have been created and there is agreement among all concerned that the involvement of SFADCo in the whole county could bring about further improvements, particularly in areas where there have been job losses. I know it is not easy at this late stage for the Minister to give full consideration to my request but I would hope that action would be taken on the basis of the record of industrial development and the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that SFADCo now have statutory authority for the area in question but I am requesting that the whole county should come under the wing of SFADCo.  I compliment SFADCo on their job creation effort.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to draw a line defining precisely the areas of west and south-west Offaly.  Small industries which are in close proximity to the designated line cannot avail of the extra grants made available through SFADCo and do not receive the same co-operation from them.  I request the Minister to give every consideration to including the whole of County Offaly under the wing of SFADCo.  This would help to alleviate the problem caused by so many job losses in the area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, have great pleasure in welcoming this Bill.  During my working life as a trade union official I have had very close involvement with the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  It gives me great pleasure to record my appreciation of the work SFADCo have done for the mid-west region.  The company deserve every support this House can give because by any standards theirs has been a shining success story of which any country could legitimately be proud.  They are a model for any semi-State or private company because of the minimum of bureaucracy, their vision and fresh approach and their readiness and flexibility to try out new concepts for the greater development and protection of worthwhile employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1529" /> Their track record in regard to successful innovation is unique.  They set up the first duty-free airport in the world which became a model of its kind.  Afterwards, when the whole area was threatened by the overflying of jet aircraft, they pioneered the development of what became one of the world's outstanding industrial estates.  That concept was responsible for student groups and study missions coming from many Third World countries to examine and learn from that project.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that when I was Mayor of Limerick in 1977 I played a part in setting up an arrangement between SFADCo and the authorities in Derry for a model prototype project there based on what had been achieved by SFADCo so that they could help their own region. This venture has reached some fruition and it was announced a fortnight ago that they are talking about a joint project on both sides of the Border.  This has been mentioned by John Hume and it has sprung from their involvement with SFADCo.  I know this to be a fact because I was involved in the initial contacts.  This development is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>SFADCo were responsible for a unique concept in entertainment and tourism which has now been copied successfully by six other countries.  I refer to the promotion of entertainment in castles at Bunratty, Knappogue and Dunguaire.</P>
    <P>A recent development was the setting up in conjunction with the NIHE authorities of a micro-electronics application centre in the Plassey Technological Park. There has been great interaction between SFADCo and the NIHE.  I was a member of the governing body of the NIHE for five years.  Their joint influence in the Plassey Technological Park and in other areas has revolutionised the industrial face of the mid-west region.  There is still room for improvement but that recent project has been responsible for the attraction of new industries in the information-intensive sector.  This is very important.</P>
    <P>It would now seem to be the policy of the industrial promotion authorities that they should in future concentrate on capital rather than labour intensive projects. <Col N="1530" /> While it is certainly desirable that we should have as many research and development facilities as possible, nevertheless I would not entirely discard the idea of attracting labour intensive industries. I know that many of these industries, such as the textile industry, have largely moved to the Third World and are not a worthwhile risk venture for companies in this part of the world.</P>
    <P>One of the greatest benefits gained from SFADCo was their use of the labour liaison officer concept.  I do not know if this was repeated elsewhere.  They had their own labour liaison division staffed by able people who had vast experience in the area of labour relations.  Their sole function was to advise companies coming to the area of the culture and ethos of the region and of the country generally and of our industrial history.  Some companies ignored at their peril advice with regard to unionisation but generally one of the great benefits of this initiative was the spin-off in the industrial relations scene.  Foreign companies coming to the area had highly developed personnel policies that were light years ahead of the almost barbaric and primitive approach of native Irish companies with regard to industrial relations.  This was one of the advantages of setting up the Shannon Industrial Estate.</P>
    <P>I remember when an ambassador from one of the major industrial European countries came to the region.  I met him and discussed with him the whole set-up in the region.  He was also an industrialist and he toured the factories.  He paid an earnest tribute to the flexibility and level of productivity in the mid-west region. There were factories there that had exact counterparts in his own country in terms of technology and manning levels and the factories in Shannon were producing nine products for every seven produced in the parent company.  This gives an idea of the work done by SFADCo in some of the industries that were attracted to the area. Some of the best individual work performances for some multinationals came from their subsidiaries in the mid-west region.  That should be put on record because frequently it is forgotten.</P>
    <P>I support the idea of SFADCo being <Col N="1531" /> asked to develop the concept of food processing.  We are in a very difficult situation at the moment.  We have gone through an industrial recession since 1973 and we are now in a position where our unemployment is an all-time high.  People say that when the present recession passes everything will be all right.  It will not be all right because lost within the present recession is the development of the micro-chip.  We are now moving into the age of structured unemployment. What I mean by structured unemployment as distinct from cyclical unemployment is this: for example, is some industries such as the hotel and tourist catering industries there are peaks and valleys in summer and in other periods of the year but now we are moving into the modern and frightening phenomenon of structured unemployment.</P>
    <P>Let us take the example of a company who employ 1,000 people who are doing well and who want to expand.  They will build a new factory with ultra-modern technology and they will employ 100 people.  In a few years there may be a recession: the company will not close down the modern factory with the work force of 100 but it will close down the old factory with 1,000 jobs gone.  Redundancy payments will be made and everyone will be satisfied they have done the best job in the circumstances.  In the future the business may pick up and the owner of the business will make the necessary accommodation but he will not hire the original 1,000 employees or an outmoded technology.  He will build an even newer factory with another 100 people so that the net loss will be 800 jobs.  This is an example of what is happening and the implications for society are frightening.  We have not adapted ourselves culturally to face the problem. SFADCo are to be commended for what they have done in this area.  They have set up a micro-electronics application centre to keep abreast of developments. We need research and development because they are the value-added type of benefits we need.  We will not survive if we do not keep ahead in investigation and research of product development. <Col N="1532" /> This is where our future lies.  The Danes have given us an outstanding example in that context.  They are similarly situated to Ireland in the context of lack of resources.</P>
    <P>It is beyond argument that our whole future lies in the area of food processing. We are part of the biggest and wealthiest common market of people in the history of the world, with the highest living standards.  Unfortunately our traditional food processing companies &mdash; I regret to say this about companies in my own region &mdash; failed to adapt to the terms of free trade in the 1960s despite the fact that they were given adequate warning. Some adapted and they are surviving and doing very well.  We are now in an era where, for example, a girl in Hamburg who goes to work at 8 a.m. and returns home at 4.30 p.m. can pre-set an automatic oven to cook a meal.  We are in the era of processed foods and, again, the Danes have given an example to the rest of the world.  Ironically, the Danes came to Limerick to study this aspect in the bacon and pork industry at the end of the last century.  We sent people to Russia from my own city to teach them.  We have fallen behind and we must make every effort to get back into this area.  We have the best indigenous resources in the world.  A German industrialist in Kilrush told me that if his country had our climate he would have two sets of crops each year.  Our cattle are out for nearly 12 months each year and we have everything going for us.  Yet we have the scandalous situation that in 1983 food to the value of £800 million will be imported here.</P>
    <P>Private companies have failed to move into this area.  I will give an example of what I mean.  Some years ago there was a possibility of a change of government in Italy which resulted in tremors running through some of the industries and factories in that country.  Some of them approached SFADCo with a view to coming here and I was involved in negotiations to set up a company that was going into the liqueur business in a small way. They would have used 100 million dozen of eggs in a year, 800 million gallons of milk and 1 million small bottles.  I think there would have been about 28 or 30 <Col N="1533" /> direct jobs with a spin-off employment of about 60 other jobs.  In addition, the benefits would have gone back to the farmers supplying the produce.  This is an area in which we should be active and our neglect in this matter is an indictment of us.  We are scandalously at fault in not moving into that situation.</P>
    <P>We must face the fact that we have no other great resources to create employment for young people.  This is why I think SFADCo are very suitable as a State body who have given the lead to most other semi-State companies because of their vision, imagination and their flexibility to adapt at very short notice.  This was proven when Deputy Desmond O'Malley asked them to move into the small industries programme. They were in like wildfire.  That has paid off.</P>
    <P>The State through SFADCo could get in, research, pioneer and develop the food processing concept and get in as many people as possible.  The food processing industry as a labour intensive industry is second only to petro-chemicals within the Common Market.  It came from seventh to second place in the league table of labour intensive industries.</P>
    <P>The progress of SFADCo is an example for everybody.  In the Ennis, Limerick, Shannon triangle 40 per cent of the entire work force are based.  There are 2,000 people employed directly at Shannon Airport.  Other areas ask for a SFADCo for their region.  The main function of SFADCo is to promote Shannon Airport.  That has been done very successfully. There are 6,000 people working in the industrial estate.  The spin-off to the entire western seaboard, not just to the mid-west region, is unquestionable. In 1974, TWA insisted, with their economic muscle, on overflying Shannon and landing at Dublin.  They forced us to give way on that, with the help of the Civil Aeronautics Board in America, but it emerged that eight out of every ten tourists terminating their flight at Shannon went as far up as Mayo or Donegal or down to Kerry.  The spin-off to those regions is unquestionable.  That is the industrial hub of the entire mid-west region.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1534" /> SFADCo have been very fortunate with the ability of many of the people working there.  They have been very fortunate in the vision of people like Brendan O'Regan, his successors and other people down the line because they have a great social commitment not merely a norrow industrial programme.  They were also concerned with reversing the trends of rural imbalance in the mid-western region.  They shoved industries into the less populated areas.  I would like to compliment Father Harry Bohan, who worked with SFADCo and pioneered the concept of the rural housing organisation, to bring housing out from the major areas of conurbation into the rural areas. That was another example of the broad philosophy of SFADCo.  They deserve every support we can give them.  They are a model for the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>People on one side of the political divide do not often praise people on the other side but I want to praise Deputy Dessie O'Malley for the great courage and initiative he showed in instigating the small industries programme.  I believe if that programme is intensified properly and SFADCo supply the back-up facilities, research, marketing and accountancy facilities, that can be one of the major hopes for the country.  I heard Dr. Krabbe, a German-born engineer and one of the bosses of one of the major companies in the mid-west region, pay tribute to the quality of Irish engineers. Westinghouse, which was mentioned earlier, could not get over the quality of the Irish engineers who went to their company initially.  We now have educated people who have the capacity to take advantage of the opportunities there. Some of them, who are graduates of NIHE, have already moved into this area.  It is very significant that when Bombardier last year had to cut back their work force of 350, 300 other workers in small industries were locked into the Bombardier programme.  That is where the significance of the small industries programme lies.</P>
    <P>Somebody referred to import substitution. I understand that if import substitution was properly researched and intensified, we could save on a balance of <Col N="1535" /> payments situation £1,000 million.  That concept needs to be far more intensely developed than it is at the moment.  We call it the matchmaker programme, where you can tie up the needs of one company with another company who can supply them.  That has also been set up by SFADCo and other people in the region.</P>
    <P>One of the things I welcome is SFADCo's recent announcement of setting up a task force.  It is good for SFADCo as well as other organisations to review their progress on a periodic basis.  SFADCo, because of the threat to employment which we are now facing, have set up this task force.  They will look at a whole new concept and investigate where existing employment can be improved, with a view to consolidation of good, worthwhile employment, and where new types of industries can be brought in.  They will look at new investment opportunities and future prospects. I would like to quote from the terms of reference of that study group.  They are:</P>
    <P>Technological developments, the micro and macro environment, demographic trends, educational developments, etc., which are likely to have a bearing on the development of the estate during the remainder of the eighties and nineties, investment opportunities appropriate to Shannon for the eighties and nineties in the light of these developments; the relevance and adequacy of existing practices, policies and incentives in relation to the development of the estate during the same time phase; the identification of barriers to development and suggestions for their modification or removal and strategies calculated to best help the company market and implement the opportunities identified.</P>
    <P>I know it is very difficult in the present climate but we should not discard willy-nilly the idea of attracting labour-intensive industries.  We should concentrate where we can on the promotion of the Shannon Estuary, which is one of the prime estuaries of the world capable of rivalling Rotterdam.  I am a member of <Col N="1536" /> the Limerick Harbour Authority and I appeal again to all the interests involved to submerge their local aspirations and concentrate on the macro development of the estuary for the good of all.  One area should not seek to take advantage over another area.  We should have the courage and vision to submerge local interests and come together for the benefit of the whole region.  We all know local antagonisms were whipped up for political reasons.  That was short-term thinking.  I welcome the talks which are being carried on between some of the areas concerned.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have a major role to play in the development of Shannon.  Heavy industry will guarantee future employment. I am talking about two great growth industries, engineering and chemicals. These have major potential for development.  If we develop this estuary for the good of all we will have a great future.  I welcome the Bill.  It gives the necessary authority and support to SFADCo in the wonderful work they are doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I wish the Minister well in his appointment.  He is coming to office at a most difficult time and I assure him he will have our co-operation in dealing with the serious problems which face industry.  Deputy Reynolds said we should do what we do do well.  Anything SFADCo have done they have certainly done well.  Anyone who visits Bunratty folk park, the industrial estate or any projects with which SFADCo have been involved will see that they were careful in attending to details. They have ensured that projects in which there was State investment have been well taken care of.  I have found this ever since I was elected to the House.</P>
      <P>I compliment the staff and management of the board who have always been courteous to public representatives.  On numerous occasions we have to deal with them about various issues relating to our constituencies.  They have always been helpful and courteous and so enabled us to resolve many problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Their most outstanding success in recent times has been that of the small <Col N="1537" /> industries programme.  It is acknowledged that small industry has very high job creation potential.  More attention will have to be paid to outlying areas rather than the Shannon triangle.  In my constituency in north, east and west Clare while there has been continued expansion and job opportunities in the region as a whole we have not seen the type of development we want.  It is essential to provide job opportunities so that rural communities will remain in their own areas.  Through their advance factory programme SFADCo have expanded their industrial base into remoter areas. They built factories in Ennistymon, Lisdoonvarna, Kilmihil, Kildysart, Killaloe, Kilkee and so on.  Unfortunately many of these are now vacant.  We must see how these buildings can be used.</P>
    <P>I support the views expressed earlier about the need to develop our natural resources.  The timber industry has not been fully developed or exploited. Upwards of £4 million worth of timber products are imported.  As regards fishing, the company together with BIM and other interests could see where job opportunities could be created, for example, in fish processing.  This would provide opportunities in remoter areas such as Doolin, Quilty, Carrigaholt and other areas along the Clare coast.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for the company, together with other organisations and associations, to see what action can be taken with regard to the advance factory buildings.  Companies in the mid-west region were always assured that if they got into difficulty they would get careful attention from SFADCo.  In recent weeks two major industries have closed down. One was the Interton industry in Ennis. It employed over 100 people in high technology. There is need for agencies to move in quicker than they have been moving when a viable project gets into difficulty due to problems in the parent company which is often located outside the State.  When it becomes evident, as it was in the case of Interton, that there are serious problems which would have repercussions in local industry, action should be taken &mdash; indeed, it should have been taken much earlier &mdash; in an effort <Col N="1538" /> to avoid the present situation there with over 100 people out of work.</P>
    <P>The same applies in relation to the recent closure of the ceramics factory in Kilrush where again over 100 jobs were lost in the pottery manufacturing industry which has been operating successfully for many years.  There is no doubt about the demand for their product.  Their books are full of orders, yet for some reason associated mainly with the agencies acting for the company outside the State, whatever difficulty they have the company is now closed and over 100 people are out of work in Kilrush.  The closure of a company with 100 employees in Kilrush, where the work force is small anyway, is a major disaster for the town.  We have heard a great deal of publicity about the closure of some companies nationally and the effect that that will have on the economy of the city of Dublin, but 100 jobs in Kilrush is almost equivalent to 10,000 jobs in Dublin city.  If an industry with employment potential for up to 20,000 people in Dublin were to close the country would come to a standstill. Nevertheless, very little action is being taken in relation to the closure of this pottery plant in Kilrush which is causing major hardship for the young people employed there, many of whom will not get other employment opportunities in the area.  Consider the effect that that has not only on the employees and their families but on business generally in the whole area.</P>
    <P>I want to compliment in the highest degree the work force in my constituency and in the whole mid-west region.  They are a credit to the region.  Unfortunately, issues outside the control of these dedicated workers, some of them very highly skilled and experienced, are putting their jobs at risk.  Not only SFADCo but all the development agencies and the State agencies involved in industrial promotion, expansion and development have a responsibility as a matter of grave national urgency to get together to deal with this nervousness, this instability which is affecting industry in so many ways.  Industries which could quite well expand now are afraid to do so.  There is <Col N="1539" /> a need for confidence in industry generally and we must instil this confidence into the workforce and assure them that people in Government and in the State agencies care about them, are committed to them and are prepared to make sacrifices in order to resolve their problems.</P>
    <P>Another area of tremendous potential is the attraction of the new service companies into the regions.  The special 10 per cent rate for those companies must be fully exploited.  Through the good offices of Deputy Barrett we have seen the re-establishment and relocation of the vehicle registration unit at Shannon and a major influx of highly skilled civil service personnel into Shannon town. This indication of how successfully a Government agency can operate in a town the size of Shannon is a further attraction to the service type operations to expand and develop further.  I would like to see more emphasis on the promotion of this 10 per cent tax rate.  More aviation oriented operations especially in Shannon would create further employment opportunities there and that will have a spin-off effect on the rest of the area.</P>
    <P>In recent times the development company have decided to spread out their offices into the region and to establish field officers in towns such as Ennis, Nenagh and Birr.  This worthwhile exercise would be of very great importance for the development of industry in the region.  We need closer liaison between agencies in the region working through the field officers and the county development teams, and especially the local development organisations who in many respects have the knowledge and experience of many years to promote industry in their own areas.  They can be a major influence in helping industry to locate in the various areas.</P>
    <P>The development of tourism-related projects is very important to the whole development of the economy especially in the western counties, the tourist counties. I congratulate SFADCo on the work they have done not only at Bunratty but also at Knappogue and other castles in the mid-western area and especially the <Col N="1540" /> development of the folk park in Shannon which is a credit to the personnel involved in the planning and execution of the work.  Above all, it is a centre of attraction, a holding point for tourists passing through the airport.  The collection of various historical indicators of life in the rural communities is an incentive to many tourists to go further afield to see at first hand what is depicted in this small park development in Bunratty.</P>
    <P>There is an example of what can be done with a little imagination and investment. The development company have a number of sites in various locations in the region which have not been developed up to now but they have the potential for development.  It should be possible with the assistance of private enterprise to involve in either joint ventures or co-operative organisations of one kind or another between the State agency and local private enterprise to develop tourism facilities and amenities in these areas. Where I live near Miltown Malbay is a sizeable site in a very scenic area of enormous potential for the development of tourist amenities.  Also some private investors are prepared to share in an operation of this kind.  Much can be done here to develop this type of project, and the small village hotels with proper facilities could accommodate the passing tourist trade.  Some work has been done by SFADCo already in this regard in an effort to exploit more fully the tourism potential of this area.</P>
    <P>I have always been pleased at the co-operation between the development agencies and Shannon itself and also the co-operation between Aer Rianta, SFADCo and other agencies.  All this is vital if we are to get an overall strategy for the development of the airport, the industrial complex and Shannon town. Now the commissioners, the various public representatives bodies and agencies should come together to plan an overall strategy to exploit more fully the potential here.  If international companies who were involved in air freight came into the area and if there were customs clearance facilities there would be an increase in traffic to the airport generally, which would have enormous repercussions, <Col N="1541" /> both in job creation and in the economic structure of the region.  There must be more involvement by the agencies, not only in industrial promotion but also in airport promotion, to make a further onslaught on international business which could be brought to this airport. Indeed, some of the other international airports are looking for places to move to because they are under pressure in their own countries.</P>
    <P>I fully support the views which have been expressed about the need for the linking of the estuary with the development of the whole region.  Although the estuary has not been developed, everybody knows its potential.  So many reports have been written on the Shannon Estuary that people are confused by them.  However, the necessary legislation does not seem to be there to provide for the major development which is needed in the estuary as one unit.  You can look at all the separate ports like Cappagh Pier, Foynes Harbour development, Tarbert development or the Limerick Harbour development, but there is a need for an overall strategy to ensure that the estuary is developed to its maximum capacity.</P>
    <P>Over the last number of years there has been tremendous interest in off-shore oil exploration and I know the Minister has a special interest in this.  A number of tests and explorations have been carried out in the Porcupine and it is well known there is oil potential in that area. It is not clear how soon and to what extent it can be developed but in any off-shore oil development in the Porcupine off the west coast, the Shannon Estuary must play a major role.  At present the infrastructural development which needs to be done on the estuary is not being done and the removal of the sandbar has not taken place.  These areas need special and urgent attention and the estuary must and will fit into the overall development, not only of the mid-west region but also of the whole country.  The Shannon Estuary can be the Rotterdam of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate Shannon Free Airport Development Company for their commitment to young people.  They <Col N="1542" /> have always been concerned about the interests of young people and they have appointed youth officers in the airport and in Shannon town.  The fact that there are now over 10,000 people living in the town is an indication of good planning and proper development.  However, there is a need for further sport and recreational facilities because we have heard successively from community leaders, politicians and others in Shannon that although there has been tremendous development of the industrial base and of the town itself, the people do not have the sporting and recreational facilities which are so essential in a town like Shannon. Development in this area has been a little haphazard with individual clubs and organisations doing their own separate development.  There is a higher proportion of young people in Shannon town than in any other part of the country and, while the company have been committed to young people, they need to provide recreational facilities.  The lack of these facilities has been a major cause of discontent.</P>
    <P>One welcome development, as mentioned by the Minister, is that roughly 60 per cent of housing stock is privately owned.  There is a need for development of the housing stock in Shannon and I know the county council are already engaged in building houses there.  I welcome the Bill.  I want to encourage the various people in the Shannon development company to carry on the magnificent work which they have been doing up to now.  I assure them of our co-operation on this side of the House in helping them to deal with the various problems that affect that region.  I hope there will be many more successes in the future.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have this opportunity to contribute again to a debate on the role and functions of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited. Over the past 22 years I have spoken in every debate in this House on SFADCo.  Sometimes there is a little friction between Clare and Limerick people, when Clare people question the right of Limerick people to talk about Shannon affairs and SFADCo.</P>
      <P>SFADCo are now a regional development organisation with functions extending throughout the mid-west region. Recently they were given functions in relation to parts of County Offaly.  I am not too clear about this extension of their activities.  I want to refer to it later in the context of regional development.  There is no doubt that the development and the whole operation of the SFADCo complex have been a striking and remarkable success story.  There were problems from time to time.  We can go back to the establishment of the airport at what was then Rineanna, the development of air traffic and the industrial estate, and the extension of the company's activities to promoting industry in County Clare, County Limerick, Limerick city and North Tipperary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I support the purpose and the objectives of the Bill.  I endorse the Government's decision to give additional funding to SFADCo.  As I said, the company have been a striking success and a remarkably successful regional development agency working within the rather limited terms of reference assigned to them.  The success <Col N="1544" /> of SFADCo can be illustrated by the number of requests to the company from newly emerging African nations and from many parts of South America for professional advisers to go out and advise on regional development in those countries. The work of SFADCo has been inspected and examined by delegations from many countries.</P>
    <P>We must put on record our recognition of the fact that, as a regional development agency, SFADCo have been highly successful.  In the Bill before the House it is proposed to increase State funding to SFADCo from £80 million to £120 million in the aggregate of the amounts which the Minister for Finance may subscribe in taking up shares in the company. There is a proposed increase from £40 million to £60 million in the aggregate amount of grants which may be made to the company.</P>
    <P>I have praised the work of SFADCo and acknowledged the progress made by the company and the contribution they have made to the economic and social development of the mid-west region.  I have noted in particular the statement by the Minister that a study to chart the future of the industrial estate over the next 20 years is being undertaken by the company.  The Minister said the findings of this study will determine the kind of industry that Shannon will endeavour to attract over this period and the promotional strategies the company will need to use.</P>
    <P>It is very important that a reassessment should be made periodically of the aims and objectives of any State body.  I am disappointed to note that this study is being confined to the future of the industrial estate, rather than having a comprehensive study of the future role of SFADCo as a regional development agency extending throughout the entire mid-west region.  I find it difficult to understand the reason for confining this study to the industrial estate.  The Minister might rethink this.  I should like to see a comprehensive report on the progress made to date and signposting the future of the company as a comprehensive regional development agency. SFADCo are not just an industrial development <Col N="1545" /> body.  They are a broadly-based regional development agency covering a wide spectrum of economic and social activity.</P>
    <P>This brings me back to the point I have already made.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Factors to be examined in the course of this study include technological developments, the micro and macro environment, demographic trends and educational developments all of which will have a bearing on the future development of the industrial estate.</P>
    <P>That is valid, but these factors will also have a vital bearing on the future development of the entire mid-west region, Ennis, West Clare, Limerick city, Nenagh, North Tipperary and Shannon town. I want to emphasise that, while I believe this type of study is desirable, rather than confining it to the future of the industrial estate at Shannon it should be broadened to include the entire geographic area over which the company have jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to a very controversial matter, the decision in 1978 by the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, to confine the industrial promotional activities of SFADCo to the development of small industries.</P>
    <P>Debate adjourned.</P>

      <P>Before Question Time begins, a Cheann Comhairle, may I have your guidance, please?  I submitted a question to the Taoiseach for answer today.  I note from the Order Paper that that question has been changed from the Taoiseach and appears as Question No. 287 to the Minister for Justice.  In addition, the wording of the question has been changed.  I want to draw your attention to the Official Report of 21 April when the Taoiseach specifically replied to me on questions arising from the leaking of confidential Government documents <Col N="1546" /> and made certain commitments to this House about investigations being carried out.  Can you explain to me, Sir, please, when I want to pursue that matter further with the Taoiseach and put down a question, why it is that the Taoiseach does not answer the question but transfers it to the Minister for Justice?  I suggest, Sir, that this is not in accordance with the normal transfer of questions.  I think it is because it relates to the referendum on the amendment to the Constitution that the Taoiseach is now distancing himself from the problems he created at that time.</P>

      <P>The Deputy cannot make a speech on this.  The Deputy is now going a little too far.  He is making a speech.  I do not know whether the Deputy was here in the House yesterday when this same matter was raised.  The Chair made it perfectly clear then that in accordance with precedent going back, as far as the Chair knows, to the foundation of the State, the Chair has no control over the transfer of questions. The Deputy did raise another matter &mdash; that his question had been altered.  I do know that, for the convenience of Deputies and indeed in the interests of Deputies, sometimes questions are slightly altered in the office.  If the Deputy likes I will have inquiries made into that but I cannot help him in regard to the other matter.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of his written reply to Parliamentary Question No. 255 of 16 February 1983 in which he stated that all health boards have arrangements for providing shelter and maintenance for homeless persons, he is aware that in the North Eastern Health Board area the only official arrangement is referral to the sometimes overcrowded Dundalk Simon Community; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Shelter and maintenance for homeless persons in the North Eastern Health Board area is provided at present in two locations.  The Simon Community provides accommodation in Dundalk for about 25 persons with assistance from the health board.</P>
      <P>In St. Mary's Hospital, Castleblayney, the health board provides seven places for homeless men.  This provision is regarded as sufficient for that area.</P>
      <P>I am at present considering a proposal from the health board to assist the St. Vincent de Paul Society to provide a hostel for homeless people in Cavan.</P>
      <P>In general the health board is doing its best to provide for the homeless in its area within the restricted resources available to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The funding which is provided to the Simon Community in the Dundalk area is entirely inadequate for the service it is expected to provide.  Can <Col N="1548" /> the Minister indicate whether it is intended to provide additional funds to the Simon Community in Dundalk in order to meet the responsibilities which the health board is asking them to meet?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in the health board area is undoubtedly more evident in Dundalk than elsewhere.  The Simon Community has provided accommodation for about 25 people there and the health board assists Simon in providing, to the greatest extent possible, accommodation.  Many places in the Dundalk premises are occupied by semi-permanent regulars which at times results in overcrowding.  The health board does its utmost to assist in the area. Likewise in Drogheda a survey carried out about three years ago established that many of the casuals who use the centre are transients en route from Dublin to Northern Ireland and vice versa.  There are difficulties then in providing accommodation for homeless persons in both Drogheda and Dundalk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of his written reply to Parliamentary Question No. 255 of 16 February 1983 in which he stated that he was not aware of hardship caused to single homeless people through the non-availability of casual facilities in some county homes and geriatric facilities, he has read the report produced by the Simon Community entitled <i>Closing Down the County Homes</i>; if he is aware of the information contained in that report that up to ten men have been sleeping rough in Carlow as a result of the closure of the Sacred Heart Home there; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Col N="1549" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the Simon Community's paper <i>Closing Down the County Homes</i> and I am familiar with the section on the closure of the Casual Unit at the Sacred Heart Home in Carlow.  I am most concerned about this report and the Health Board is taking steps to rectify the unfortunate situation that obtains since the closure of the unit at the Sacred Heart Home.  The Health Board is at present having discussions with a local voluntary group knows as the Carlow Christian Care Group with a view to organising a facility for homeless men. The board will be prepared to grant-aid the provision of accommodation and to contribute to the running costs.</P>
      <P>I will keep the Deputy informed of developments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that the report from the Simon Community entitled &ldquo;Closing Down the County Homes&rdquo; was in the possession of the Department when the reply was given on 16 February 1983 and would he not agree that there was at least a falling down on the part of the Department in not advising him that hardship was being caused for single homeless people when that report was in their possession?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept the Deputy's view on this.  There is pressure on all areas for accommodation for those who are homeless but in relation to that health board area I pointed out that in Clonmel there are eight places, in Dungarvan ten, in Waterford 40, in the Regina Coeli Hostel, likewise in Waterford, there are 18, in Wexford 24, in Kilkenny eight, in Talbot House in Kilkenny a further three and in Thomastown there are six.  It is in the Carlow town area that there has been a particular problem.  I am familiar with the report and it undoubtedly pinpoints the casual unit at the Sacred Heart Home in Carlow. At the time of preparing the original reply I was aware of the intense efforts being made by the health board to cope with the situation which largely arose <Col N="1550" /> from the Sisters being unable locally to continue to operate that facility.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.</P>
      <P>The <i>ad hoc</i> committee has invited submissions from a number of voluntary organisations involved in the area of homelessness.  The committee also indicated that it would be pleased to meet with representatives of these organisations who might wish to give oral evidence. One voluntary organisation so far has indicated that it wishes to make an oral submission and arrangements will be made to meet its representatives.</P>
      <P>I expect the <i>ad hoc</i> committee to report within six months.  The report will be made available to all statutory and voluntary agencies involved in caring for homeless people and to anybody else who wishes to obtain a copy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Three months ago the Minister indicated that a report from the <i>ad hoc</i> committee would be available soon.  I understood it would be available in a matter of weeks.  Now it appears it will be available in six months.  Could the Minister indicate what organisation have been contacted by the Department and which ones have agreed to make submissions? Could he also indicate if this report will be made available to Deputies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The report will certainly be made available to Deputies.  The committee met first on 4 February.  It was set up by me because the health boards have been finding increasing difficulty in providing accommodation for homeless persons and because neither the health nor the housing legislation provides clear guidelines as to the division of responsibility between local authorities and health boards.  The three Departments involved are Health, Social Welfare and the Environment, together with the health boards and local authorities, and submissions have been received from Simon, from the housing centre in Liberty Hall and a submission is also expected from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.  The Simon Community have also expressed an interest in making an oral submission.  I expect the report will be received around September.  It is an informally established <i>ad hoc</i> committee on homelessness.  I will certainly urge them to expedite the work but it will certainly take that time to have a report.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>They quite definitely have.  Under the Act they have a specific responsibility but there is a need to coordinate activities in this area between the Department of the Environment, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of Health and the local authorities and health boards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like the Minister to give a direction to the health boards because there is a great deal of buck-passing between the various bodies in regard to housing the homeless and I believe a direction should be possible at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree this is an anomalous situation which should not be allowed to continue indefinitely and will he make every effort to resolve the conflict as to which Department carries the responsibility?  This difficulty <Col N="1552" />&mdash; I am sure the Minister is aware of this or is he &mdash; was identified over 12 months ago.  Which authority has responsibility for homeless persons?  I am sure the Minister will agree these people are a most deserving section and deserve more attention from his Department and the Department of the Environment than they have seemingly received up to now. I ask the Minister to give an assurance that every effort will be made to resolve the conflict immediately and provide accommodation for the numbers of homeless persons in the State.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to commend the health boards because within their limited resources they are providing accommodation.  Last Friday in Tullamore I went to the night centre there and I saw the accommodation provided.  It is excellent.  A number of health boards are providing accommodation to the tune of about 1,750 places.  The problem is a growing one and because it is, the first meeting of this <i>ad hoc</i> departmental committee was held on 4 February last.  They have been working on the problem since. Health boards find that the problem of homelessness is becoming increasingly part of their responsibility and because it is they expressed concern to the Department. There will be no delay in bringing forward the recommendations of the committee and no reluctance on my part to publish those recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that what is required in this area is a national policy to deal with the 3,000 approximately homeless persons who have to be given temporary accommodation of one kind or another?  Would he also agree that the money provided by the health boards is totally inadequate? I refer to the Dundalk situation where £5,000 is provided to assist in the provision of accommodation for 25 homeless persons.  The <i>ad hoc</i> committee which was set up in February last contacted the Simon Community only last week for a submission and there does not seem to be a proper degree of urgency in dealing with this problem.</P>

The type of accommodation to which the Minister referred is merely a shelter and it does not assist these people to create homes.  It is a temporary, stop-gap solution to a very difficult human problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr B. Desmond Mr B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr B. Desmond</NameTxt>

I am personally opposed to the question of drug pushing being encompassed &mdash; I presume the Deputy is referring to the Special Criminal Court &mdash; in the Special Criminal Court.  I am personally opposed to that. <Col N="1556" /> I am not opposed to particular scheduled offences in another context encompassing drug-pushing.

      <P>On 6 May last, which is very recently, the health board wrote to the Department asking for my approval of the appointment of an obstetrician-gynaecologist at Bantry Hospital.  I have received a report dated 29 April from the chief executive officer of the Southern Health Board and I am currently considering this report.  It is stated in the report that in 1982 there were 191 births assigned to mothers normally resident in the catchment area of Bantry General Hospital &mdash; 93 in Bantry, 20 in Castletownbere, one in Clonakilty, 35 in Dunmanway-Drimoleague, 11 in Skibbereen, 11 in Schull, Goleen and Ballydehob and 16 in the Kenmare-Sneem area.

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>This refers to a county physician who is also acting as county obstetrician.  When these people retire their replacements do not have expertise in obstetrics and surely there must be a <Col N="1563" /> policy in the Department of Health to counteract this situation.

      <P>The Minister has referred to a report of 29 April from the Southern Health Board which states that 191 births took place in Bantry Hospital. I would refer him to the fact that 823 births occurred from that catchment area and the fact that no obstetrician-gynaecologist was available in Bantry meant that the number there was reduced.  I would ask him to recognise the humanitarian problem in Bantry and to treat the matter as being extremely urgent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that the reason the maternity unit at Bantry hospital was not utilised to the full was that an obstetrician-gynaecologist <Col N="1564" /> was not placed in that hospital?  Why was it that the Southern Health Board did not make application to the Minister for Health until the evening they closed the maternity ward in Bantry?

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>One has to appreciate that as far back as 1972 the Department of Health refused to give approval for the appointment of a consultant obstetrician-gynaecologist in a permanent capacity in the area.  Comhairle na nOspidéal, of which Deputy Ormonde was a member, also refused to approve the creation of the post.  One has to be very careful about taking policy decisions on this matter.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 to 12 inclusive together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have established a Special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse because of their concern about the growing drug problem.  Its terms of reference are to review and report on the question of drug abuse, with particular reference to the inner-city <Col N="1566" /> area of Dublin.  The Government will then decide what should be done to tackle the drug problem, based on whatever recommendations are in the task force's report.</P>
    <P>The membership of the task force is the Minister for Health who is chairman but I have delegated that to the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy O'Brien, the deputy chairman. The Ministers of State at the Departments of Justice, Deputy Fennell, Education, Deputy Creed, Foreign Affairs, Deputy J. O'Keeffe, Environment, Deputy Quinn and Labour, Deputy G. Birmingham are also members.  The first meeting of the task force was on Thursday, 28 April 1983.</P>
    <P>On the question of giving assistance to the community in the north centre city area of Dublin, I recently gave £20,000 to the Eastern Health Board for a youth development project in this area.  This project will consist of an advisory and educational programme which is being established as a response to the special needs of the children in the area.</P>
    <P>As I expect the task force to report in about five weeks, there will not be a need for the submission of an interim report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TonyGregory" hpid="Mr. Gregory-Independent Mr. Gregory-Independent">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is familiar with the recent report of the Medico-Social Research Board which stated that more than 10 per cent of young people in one parish in the centre city area are using heroin.  Given the evidence in that report, does the Minister consider there is an immediate emergency need for a special rehabilitation programme and centre to cater specifically for the needs of those heroin addicts in the centre city area and also in view of the fact that many of them are under the age of 18 years, for whom there is no centre relevant to their needs?  The existing rehabilitation centre based at Coolmine is not specifically relevant to children from that cultural background.</P>

They <Col N="1567" /> did not come to fruition for various reasons, none of which was the fault of the Department of Health or the Eastern Health Board.  Finally the health board wrote to my Department requesting £20,000 to enable a drug advisory treatment centre at Jervis Street to establish a service in association with a local committee. I gave my approval on 27 April and the project, which will be of a pilot nature, will be reviewed after one year. I am particularly concerned about the situation in the inner city area of Dublin. The Deputy knows the ward area well.  I have also taken other immediate action such as referring a number of doctors to the Medical Council for investigation.  So far I have referred three doctors and I have issued temporary directions in relation to one doctor in the Dublin area.  I can assure the Deputy I am taking every immediate action possible.  A number of other doctors will be investigated in the coming weeks.</P>

      <P>I hardly think the Minister is seriously suggesting that the allocation of £20,000 for what amounts to an information centre in the centre city area is a treatment or a rehabilitation centre for those addicted to heroin. Regardless of the £20,000 that seems to have been mentioned everywhere by the previous Government and by this Government, I am sure the Minister is aware that it will not make any special impact on the problem &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am leading to it.  I am sure the Minister knows that the allocation of £20,000 will not have any impact on the problem as outlined in the report of the Medico-Social Research Board.  Will he respond specifically to my question, namely, does he see the need for a special re-habilitation centre?  Does he see the need for further treatment facilities, given the overcrowded pre-fabs that exist at Jervis Street being the only treatment facilities available for heroin addicts?  Does he see <Col N="1568" /> an immediate emergency need for the expansion of treatment facilities as distinct from a rehabilitation centre?  The Minister has told us that he has referred a number of doctors to the Medical Council.  I am aware that this relates to the availability of the drug diaconal to heroin addicts &mdash;&mdash;</P>

I am trying to be helpful and to ask specific questions related to the Minister's area of responsibility.  Has the Minister anything in mind to ensure more stringent control over the availability of the drug diaconal other than referring two or three doctors to the Medical Council?  Also, has he anything specific in mind in relation to more stringent control over the availability of hypodermics that are readily available to the youngest of adults in the centre city of Dublin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has referred to a number of questions.  All of these questions are currently being considered by the special committee of the Ministers of State.  They are now consulting with the various statutory and voluntary bodies in relation to those questions. I readily accept the inadequacy pointed out by the Deputy in relation to the current drug advisory and treatment centre in Jervis Street.  I am aware of the inadequacy there despite the fact that it rather heroically tries to provide a 24hour day, seven-day-a-week out-patient and advisory service for drug abusers. The more recent report came to my attention on 18 April 1983 and within a matter <Col N="1569" /> of a few weeks I enabled the publication of this report.  I brought it immediately to the attention of the Government and emergency action is being taken in this area.  There are so many questions raised by the Deputy that I strongly suggest that he should make contact with the special task force, have a meeting with them and give them the benefit of his views and information on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware that the matter largely relates to the regulations under the misuse of drugs legislation and to what is known as irresponsible prescribing.  I am precluded from giving further details because there are a number of appeals and a number of committee of inquiry proceedings going on at the moment.  I assure the Deputy that in any incident where the Garda investigations have brought to my attention irresponsible prescribing &mdash; I have now had at least five such incidents throughout the country &mdash; I immediately took action on it, either reference to the medical council or took temporary directions under the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to my earlier questions, how soon will the Government task force be reporting? How quickly does the Minister feel he will be able to respond to the specific questions I asked?  Is he concerned that the concentrated use of heroin seems to be confined to areas of acute social disadvantage? I am sure the Minister sees a link between the two.  Is he concerned that his Department withdrew funds from community projects operating in that specific area?  Will he consider the reallocation of funds to a specific project, of which he is well aware, which was working with young people who, in many cases, were involved with heroin?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct in relation to the socio-economic groupings involved.  The most recent report shows that only six of the 88 heroin abusers between the ages of 15 and 24 had gone to a secondary school and ten of them could not read or write.  Of the 88 only four were employed and a very large number of them had been in prison at one time or another.  I would not agree with the Deputy that I have in any way diminished the availability of funds to the inner city area of Dublin.</P>

As part of the ongoing review of entitlement to the general medical service, the number of medical cards issued in the South Tipperary area since 1 December 1982 is 1,130.  The number issued in the South-Eastern Health Board region for the same period is 5,566.  The number of medical cards withdrawn since 1 December 1982 in the region is 3,011 of which 764 were in South Tipperary.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there appears to be a pretty concerted and well organised campaign through South Tipperary and in the <Col N="1571" /> South Eastern Health Board area &mdash; the figures he has given bear this out &mdash; to withdraw medical cards from all and sundry?

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that I did not issue any specific instructions. Any married couple with £77 a week, as the Deputy knows, has eligibility. In addition, the allowance for a child under 16 is £8.50 and the allowance for other dependants in addition to the £77 is £10.  In relation to outgoings on the house anything over £8.50 is allowed. Likewise, in South Tipperary, reasonable expenses incurred in travelling to and from work together with heavy medical expenses are allowed.  By and large, there is substantial cover in relation to medical cards.  I have not issued any special instructions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the figures speak for themselves when 2,000 medical cards have been withdrawn in South Tipperary since the Minister took over his Department. Is there any specific reason for this?  Is it because certain categories of people who held cards before are now excluded?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to inform the House of the outcome of the meeting of the Council of Agriculture Ministers, which concluded in the early hours of yesterday morning.  I shall deal mainly with the aspects of particular concern to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will remember, the Commission's proposals on agricultural prices for 1983-84 and on related measures were put forward in December last.  They were discussed by the Council of Ministers at seven meetings, during the course of which certain modifications and adjustments were made.  The most important of these were in the agri-monetary sector and arose primarily from the realignment <Col N="1606" /> on 21 March of currencies within the European Monetary System.</P>
    <P>Yesterday morning agreement was reached on an overall package consisting mainly of price increases, agri-monetary adjustments and various related measures. The most significant of the changes so far as Ireland is concerned will come into force next week-end.</P>
    <P>The overall result for Ireland is most satisfactory.  The green rate for the Irish pound has been devalued to give a price increase of 3.8 per cent now and a further devaluation of 1.2 per cent is in prospect after next month's Council of Agriculture Ministers meeting because of an adjustment in the ECU to take account of the recent upward trend in the value of the £ sterling.  These devaluations coupled with the increases in product support prices will result in an average price increase for the 1983-84 marketing years of some 9½ per cent for Irish agriculture. The increases for our main products will be milk 7.5 per cent, beef 10.8 per cent, sheepmeat 13.7 per cent, cereals 8.2 per cent, pigmeat 10.8 per cent and sugar 9.2 per cent.  I might say that, pending the further green pound devaluation of 1.2 per cent next month, the 1.2 per cent will be available to Irish exporters as a trading advantage.</P>
    <P>In the case of beef the price increase of 9.5 per cent will apply from next week-end with the effect of the further 1.2 per cent devaluation coming along next month.  This contrasts with the two-stage basic increase in some previous years when part of the increase was postponed until the end of the calendar year. The buying-in co-efficients for intervention beef here are being increased by 3.3 per cent which means that the effective intervention support price will go up by over 14 per cent, a very substantial boost indeed for our beef industry.</P>
    <P>The calf premium and the special additional FEOGA financing for suckler cows, which were due to expire, are being continued for us despite some opposition during the negotiations.  Together these are worth about £47 million.</P>
    <P>As regards the UK variable premium for beef, I pressed for the introduction of a clawback of the premium on exports of <Col N="1607" /> beef from the UK.  While the Commission were not prepared to take this action, they are to review all premiums in the beef sector and to report to the Council.  I shall be continuing to follow up this matter and there are to be further contacts with the UK about it.  I had a meeting on Monday afternoon with the British Minister and we are to arrange some talks to see if we can reach a reasonable and just solution to the problems which exist.</P>
    <P>As regards milk, the price increase is below the standard level because of the operation of the production threshold arrangement provided for in last year's price settlement.  Nevertheless it represents an extra 5.3p per gallon for the dairying industry with a further penny per gallon next month.  I should like to say here that the production threshold arrangements have serious implications for future price changes.  The existing arrangements for the milk co-responsibility levy and the special aid for small milk producers continue unchanged. There is to be increased FEOGA financing for school milk and for the consumer subsidy on butter.  These latter changes will benefit this country by some £2½ million.</P>
    <P>Our special AI and ground limestone subsidies were also due to expire and these too are being continued.  In addition, to meet requests by me, the Commission have agreed to examine the problems of the Cheddar cheese market and to give special consideration to pig processing projects in allocating certain FEOGA grants which this country obtains for marketing and processing activities.  Also, at my request, the Commission have undertaken to examine the arrangements whereby FEOGA contribute towards the interest charges incurred by member states in financing intervention purchases.  At present these arrangements involve a substantial cost for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In a full year the price increases themselves represent some £190 million extra for the Irish farm sector while the other measures account for a further £65 million. These are very significant advantages <Col N="1608" /> for the agricultural industry and should give a definite boost to farm production. The balance of payments benefit is estimated at about £180 million.  These cannot but be reflected throughout the economy generally and especially in rural areas.</P>
    <P>The effect of the price increases on the consumer price index is estimated at about 1 per cent in a full year.  I have seen reports which contradict this and say that the figure is closer to 2 per cent.  However, we calculate the figure on the basis that a 1 per cent increase in prices affects the CPI by .1 per cent.  That basis has been used for many years past and has proved to be reliable and accurate.  On the basis of that figure the CPI should increase by .95 per cent, not actually 1 per cent.  Therefore, I do not see why there should be such a divergence of opinion when the system has proven to be correct in the past.</P>
    <P>This is a modest impact for a deal which is of such substantial advantage to the agricultural industry and the country as a whole.  Here I would like to stress again the favourable overall effects of the settlement. The additional money that will be brought into the country will have a most useful stimulating effect on the entire economy in terms of trade, output and employment.</P>
    <P>Just as Ireland secured special measures for dealing with particular problems here, some other member states have obtained some special arrangements for dealing with their particular problems.  In this respect we have fared at least as well as, and probably better than, the others. Indeed, when account is taken of the real value of the price increases we certainly fare better than all the others.  In fact, for Irish farmers the price settlement is the best in real terms since 1978 and puts their price rise very close to our projected inflation, even without taking the special measures into account.</P>
    <P>The delay in reaching agreement on the prices this year is regrettable but a combination of factors beyond our control resulted in that delay.  I assume that Members of the House are aware of the reasons.  Initially it was due to the German general election and more recently <Col N="1609" /> it was due to the dispute between the Germans and the French over their MCAs.  Fortunately these difficulties were resolved before Monday's meeting. I should like to point out that the value to Ireland of the special improvements that arose from this week's negotiations &mdash; in particular, the further devaluation of the green rate and the rise in buying-in co-efficients for intervention beef, which together are worth about £25 million &mdash; offset the impact of the delay on farmers' incomes.  Also, the date of settlement this year was in fact the second earliest of the past six years.  Believe it or not, it was earlier than last year's.  Several other Ministers and myself stressed the need for the Council to ensure that in future the price settlement is arrived at in time for the start of the marketing year for milk and beef at the beginning of April.  One of those Ministers, the German Minister, Herr Kiechle, was President of the Council.  I hope that as a result of our objections on this occasion a new mechanism which will lead to an earlier settlement will be arrived at.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I should like to reiterate that this is a very satisfactory outcome for Irish farmers, for those engaged in the various sectors of the agricultural industry, and for the economy as a whole. The results far exceed what very many people expected three or four months ago, particularly against the background of large surpluses of certain products and the Community's difficult financial position.</P>
    <P>In supporting the whole package, and in particular in their immediate acceptance of the devaluation of the green rate for the Irish £ to the full extent warranted by the 21 March realignment of EMS currencies and the latest adjustment of the ECU, the Government have demonstrated their absolute commitment to Irish agriculture and their determination to ensure the continued development of the industry.  Coupled with the Government's success in tackling the problem of inflation, which has had such an adverse impact on our agriculture, the arrangements agreed upon yesterday will make a significant contribution to raising farm incomes and to achieving renewed progress <Col N="1610" /> and expansion in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to thank Members from all sides of the House for their kind, gracious words of congratulation on the result which was achieved in Brussels yesterday. It was a magnanimous gesture on the part of all of them.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The belated agreement on farm prices by the EEC Agriculture Ministers is welcome in so far as it has reached its completion.  To point out that this is the best price increase since 1978 is a distortion of the truth and I hope to show that during the next few minutes.</P>
      <P>The long process of negotiations was severely damaging to our agricultural economy.  The Minister failed to outline that the £.5 million loss per day to Irish farmers &mdash; due to the protraction of the negotiations &mdash; now amounts to a total, which is irrecoverable, of something in the region of £25 million.  This is in a year when farmers' real incomes are already substantially down due to the recession, the cutbacks introduced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, in his budget which has cost Irish farmers £146 million, and also, of course, the unprecedented weather conditions &mdash; for which I will not blame the Minister.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> As I was trying to say before I was rudely interrupted, this agricultural price package was bought in its entirety by an Irish Government at a loss.  I am referring to the devaluation of IR£ in mid-March <Col N="1611" /> which occurred because the Minister for Agriculture was getting nowhere in Brussels. The estimates are that in a full year the total price package will be worth £255 million to Irish farmers.  The cost of devaluation this year, and I am using the Minister's own figures which he gave to this House on 3 May last, are that the increase in total foreign currency debt this year will be £276 million.  He stated that increases in foreign interest payments is £17 million, that increases in debt of semi-State bodies is £77.9 million and that increases in foreign interest payments are in the region of £4.7 million, which is a total of £375.6 million.  In other words, an agricultural price increase of about 9½ per cent, which is worth about £255 million to Irish agriculture, has cost us approximately £376 million in order to save the political face of the Minister for Agriculture, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach.  A massive increase in foreign borrowing has been resorted to in order to get a reasonable increase for Irish farmers.  The public should understand that what has been achieved in Brussels is not a triumph but a defeat for the Government.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I did not interrupt the two Ministers.  If one removes the effects of the green £ devaluation resulting from the devaluation of the Irish £ from the farm price increases, one is left with the result that the Minister for Agriculture has negotiated only a 5.7 per cent increase in farm prices.  This is anything but an impressive result compared with an average increase of nearly 11 per cent in 1982 and over 13 per cent in 1981 negotiated by Fianna Fáil Ministers for Agriculture.

It would have been better economics if the Government had spent or even borrowed £100 million for domestic measures instead of resorting to a prohibitive method of topping up the EEC price increases.  Irish farmers should not be deceived by the increases now achieved.  The result can give no confidence in the negotiating ability of the Minister, Deputy Deasy, and they cannot rely on the Government resorting to expensive devaluation each time the annual price fixing comes up for consideration.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The actual increase for milk is as low as 2.3 per cent.  This price increase is determined by reference to a threshold fixed for production of milk by the community as a whole.  Apparently this principle of production thresholds is to continue while Ireland's milk output is less than 5 per cent of that of the ten member states.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Dairymen have already lost over £28 million due to the delay in reaching agreement and it is disappointing that no compensation has been made for this loss to farmers.  It is also disappointing that our Minister failed to secure a special deal, as the Italians did.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister how confident he is that our farmers will get the benefit in actual price of the further devaluation of 1.2 per cent in the green £ next month.  I should also like to know if there is a commitment to continuation of the existing special measures beyond another year.  I am referring to calf premiums, suckler beef cow subsidy and the ground limestone subsidy.  If so, I urge the Minister, in the interest of stability and of the future development of the cattle industry, to secure agreement to a continuation of these measures for at least another four or five years for good planning in agriculture.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is humiliating, notwithstanding what the Minister stated, that the British should get away with the variable premium, which is contrary to EEC rules.  It gives an unfair advantage to British beef exporters and is well on the way to wrecking our beef export trade.  Surely the time has now come for positive action.  Instead of talking to the British Minister, this issue should be submitted to the European Court of Justice without delay and no more time should be wasted on useless discussions with the British.  The delay in fixing these price increases has caused unnecessary damage to the farmers.  It <Col N="1614" /> would seem far more appropriate if in future the Community would arrange for negotiations to be started and finished long before the 1 April deadline.  It would be appropriate for the Community to examine the feasibility of long-term price agreements, say, over a period of two to three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>During a time of recession it is good to see any section of the community getting some benefit, because very little is coming to anybody in these times.  Like others in the House I congratulate the Minister on getting something from the EEC.  This must be put in context.  All these benefits to farmers are seen as coming from the EEC when, in fact, most of them are coming from the Irish consumers.  In this case most of the benefits to the farmers have to come out of the pockets of the Irish consumers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The point must also be made that this type of across the board arrangement affects a relatively small number of farmers and cannot be seen as being of benefit to all farmers.  Last year out of approximately 180,000 farmers, about 40,000 farmers came within what is referred to as the taxable income.  These 40,000 farmers make all the major decisions. They control the IFA.  They control the farming lobby in Brussels.  They will benefit mainly from this bonanza, as it was called.  As the Minister said, it will mean £190 million extra to the Irish farming sector this year from the price increases, and a further £65 million from other measures.  Does anybody really think this £255 million will be divided equally amongst all farmers, large farmers, small farmers, and so on?  Some are doing very well and developing their farms very well. Because of increased income they are able to invest more in their farms, whereas the vast majority, well over 100,000 farmers, will gain little benefit and are in fact sliding further downhill. We in The Workers' Party are regarded as attacking farmers, but we are attacking the larger farmers who are making the major decisions in Ireland and in the EEC.  They are also refusing to pay any <Col N="1615" /> taxes, and they are the ones we will continue to attack.</P>
    <P>A major point which was referred to last year and was referred to on a few occasions in this House since I came in here is that farm incomes must be related to increased productivity in the future, just as workers' increases in wages are related to increased productivity.  This should also be the case in relation to farmers.  In future they will have to do that because the good times are over. There is tremendous scope for increased productivity in Irish farming, in the dairy industry, and in the cattle and tillage sectors.  This has not been forthcoming. In our ten years in the EEC the level of productivity in Irish farming has not increased significantly, if at all.  We have the lowest productivity of any farming community in the EEC.  Productivity has not been developed by our Department of Agriculture who have produced no plan for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Only two weeks ago the Labour Court granted an increase of 11 per cent over a period of 15 months to the co-op workers. Donal Cashman of the IFA condemned this and called on co-ops to refuse to pay their workers the amount decided on by the Labour Court.  This figure works out at around 7½ per cent in annual terms. The farmers have now got an increase of 9.5 per cent.  I ask Donal Cashman to withdraw that call to farmers who control the co-ops to refuse to pay that increase to their workers, and to ensure that the workers are paid the amount the Labour Court decided on.</P>
    <P>It is time the farming community shouldered their responsibilities as employers in the meat industry.  The meat factory in Midleton has closed down and the one in Leixlip is on short time.  The farmers have a responsibility, as employers who operate these factories and as suppliers of meat, to ensure that these factories are brought back into production.  That is the least they can do, having got the largest increase of any group this year.  The least they can do is to shoulder their responsibility to the workers in the processing industry.</P>
    <P>In view of the grave impact on consumers <Col N="1616" /> and workers &mdash; and I do not accept the Minister's 1 per cent in a full year; the exact amount will probably be revealed within the next week or two &mdash; I ask the Taoiseach to see to it that the Government withdraw their call for a pay pause and allow workers to try to maintain their standards by getting at least an increase which will cover the cost of living increase.  This agreement will affect the price of the staple diet, bread, butter and milk, of more and more people, more and more unemployed.  The Minister should look at the need to increase welfare benefits particularly for the elderly and large families, and enable people to maintain their families and pay the increased food prices which will result. That is the very minimum the Government can do.  I hope they will remove from the Cabinet for all time the suggestion that food subsidies should be reduced.  Any reference to food subsidies should be in the context of increasing them.</P>

      <P>I want to draw the Minister's attention to what is, perhaps, an inadvertent omission from his opening speech.  He referred to the main headings of expenditure as being land acquisition, factory construction and main infrasture work in Shannon town and said that a small proportion of share capital is also expended on aviation-related tourism projects of a capital nature.  I should like him to give us a breakdown of these allocations and the apportionment of the money now being provided under the various headings. For example, how much is being provided for new housing?  Could the Minister give us a breakdown of the expenditure and the estimated expenditure under the different headings to which he referred.  This is important in relation to a comprehensive development programme of this kind which involves housing, the acquisition of land, factory construction and other infrastructural work.  The Minister also referred to the fact that a small proportion of share capital is expended on aviation-related tourism projects of a capital nature.  The House should have some information as to what precisely is meant by expenditure on aviation-related tourism projects of a capital nature.  That is a very broadly based concept.  Is it for hotels and so forth or is it for the further development of the castles or what is it?</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to community building and the provision of house loans under the company's tenant purchase scheme.  If possible we would like to have further information on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before lunch I was speaking in a general way about the role of the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  I said it was a unique approach to regional development.  SFADCo is unlike any other State company in this country or perhaps in any country because it is accountable to several different Government Departments and several different Ministers.  The Minister for Transport has a function in relation to the aviation aspect of development at Shannon.  The Minister for Industry and Energy has a <Col N="1619" /> function.  The Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism has a function, and of course the Minister for the Environment has a function <i>viz-à-vis</i> the development of Shannon town and so on.  This accountability to different Departments and different Ministers raises problems. I can understand a multi-purpose State body which has functions which impinge on different Departments but perhaps at this stage it might be appropriate to review the role and the functions of SFADCo as a regional development organisation.  Initially its function was to generate traffic through the airport.  Then the industrial estate was established.  In the 1960s the late Donagh O'Malley and I strongly advocated the extension of the role of SFADCo to include the mid-west region.  That was subsequently done. More recently the area under the jurisdiction of SFADCo was extended to include south and west Offaly.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Free Airport Development Company has had remarkable success. Its pioneering work in the field of regional development, particularly in regard to aviation-related activity, has been very successful.  It has been very successful in tourism &mdash; the development of the castle tours and so on.  It has been very successful in relation to industrial development, particularly the small industries programme for which it was assigned special responsibility in 1978.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of the work of SFADCo which I regret is not referred to in the Minister's brief.  It is an area that SFADCo have begun to look at over the last couple of years and in which they are beginning to play a more active part. That is the field of local community development. This is a very important dimension in relation to regional development.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased to learn recently that SFADCo now have one senior executive who has been assigned special responsibility for the promotion of community development co-operatives and for the encouragement of community development work.  I am aware that in the Slieve Phelim area, which is in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency, there is a local community development <Col N="1620" /> co-operative, and some years ago, in order to assist this new co-operative in its early stages, SFADCo made a managerial grant available which enabled the co-operative in this mountainous, underdeveloped area to appoint a full-time manager.  His salary and the management expenses were paid for by SFADCo.</P>
    <P>I understand that a similar co-operative at Anglesborough on the Cork-Limerick border is now being assisted as well and more recently a very exciting new approach to the problem of massive unemployment in urban areas has been initiated in the South Hill area of Limerick assisted by SFADCo.  The intention is to operate a training programme for young people.  South Hill has a 51 per cent unemployment rate.  One out of every two people under 25 years is unemployed there.  SFADCo have gone in there in co-operation with the local development or community organisation and are engaged in a programme of training which we hope will lead to the formation of a community or a workers' co-operative.  This is an area with exciting possibilities.  I understand that SFADCo recently assigned one of their executives to monitor this type of development.</P>
    <P>There is vast scope for this type of work throughout the country.  It has been very successful in the Gaeltacht regions.  I suggest to the Minister that the Government should take a very careful look at this and that SFADCo should be given the maximum assistance to encourage the formation of local community co-operatives, particularly co-operatives set up by young people who have completed AnCO training courses.  There is an experiment being launched in conjunction with the comprehensive school at Shannon.  Selected young people will be put through a special course of training and at the end of it is hoped they will set up a co-operatively organised industry. I make no apology for emphasising the importance of community co-operatives, the importance of encouraging young people who have second or third level education and have undergone an AnCO training course.  They should be encouraged to set up co-operatives and do their own thing.  I am very pleased <Col N="1621" /> that SFADCo are going into this area. Their work and their involvement in community development is very important.  I am very conscious of this because of my experience in the Gaeltacht where I have seen the results of community development co-operatives.  Properly organised co-operatives and properly managed co-operatives can create employment and generate jobs.  It is the formation really of an economic and social structure in a particular area.  Now west Clare is very similar to the Gaeltacht areas in which co-operatives are working very successfully and the Minister should encourage SFADCo to form co-operatives in both west Clare and north-west Clare.  There could be development in forestry, fisheries, tourism and agriculture.  We have before us the dreadful spectre of growing unemployment and a lack of jobs and we must use our imagination and all our energies in finding a solution to this terrible problem.  There is in every community latent talent only waiting to be tapped and the potential is there to create jobs if there is proper organisation and proper development.  What is really important is indigenous development and this is the kind of development that should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>SFADCo had been responsible for the development of industry in Limerick, Clare and north Tipperary with an extension to west Offaly.  One of the greatest potentials and one of our greatest national assets is the Shannon Estuary. The potential for development there is paramount.  The area of jurisdiction of SFADCo should now be extended to embrace north Kerry because north Kerry forms part of the Shannon Estuary. If we are to survive as a nation we must do everything we possibly can to ensure that survival.  Numerous reports have been formulated and all that is necessary now is the formulation and implementation of a proper development and marketing programme designed to achieve the potential that lies in the Shannon Estuary.  SFADCo has participated in these reports.  More attention should be paid now to community development work and SFADCo should be given greater scope and greater flexibility in the <Col N="1622" /> development potential of the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a development in which SFADCo had played a very important role, namely, the Innovation Centre and the National Micro-electronics Application Centre. SFADCo work in close liaison with the National Institute of Higher Education in Limerick.  There has been a continuous interplay between these bodies.  The need for a close liaison between technology and industrial development is beginning to be recognised.  May I express publicly my disappointment and the disappointment of everyone in the mid-west at the postponement of the establishment of the IRS Microelectronics Test Centre at Plassey, Limerick.  This is a very important element from the point of view of the development of high technological industry in the mid-west.  We are very fortunate in that we have succeeded in attracting a tremendous amount of sophisticated high technology industry to the mid-west region.  A site has been acquired for the Microelectronics Test Centre but the plan has now been deferred by the Government.  I hope it will be possible next year to give the green light for this very important service being provided by the electronics industry.</P>
    <P>I recall, in 1978, when the then Minister for Industry, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, came into this House and, on a Bill similar to this one, announced that SFADCo had been given a new directive to confine their activities almost exclusively to the development of small industry and the IDA was given responsibility for large-scale industry.  I was completely opposed to it at the time. Despite the excellent progress that has been made by the small industries programme I still believe that was a major mistake at that time.  When SFADCo had complete responsibility for industrial development in the mid-west region through an agency arrangement with the IDA, they were highly successful.  One thinks immediately of the major industries in that region, Syntex at Clarecastle, Burlington Industries (Ireland) Limited, Analog Devices BV and a whole lot of <Col N="1623" /> other industries attracted to the region. I would prefer to see SFADCo still having overall industrial development responsibility for the mid-west region.  I acknowledge that the small industries programme has been very successful.  As the Minister said in the course of his introductory remarks:</P>
    <P>The number of persons employed in small industry increased from 3,480 to 4,800 and the company expects that by the end of 1987 7,000 people will be in full-time employment in small firms in the region.  The actual number of sustainable jobs created is the true test of SFADCo's endeavours.  Therefore it is satisfactory to report that nearly 2,000 new jobs have actually been created and sustained.</P>
    <P>The Minister goes on to refer to something of which we are already aware:</P>
    <P>On the Shannon Industrial Estate total employment at 31 December 1982 was at 4,300, which was slightly down &mdash; 6 per cent &mdash; on the 1981 level.</P>
    <P>There is absolutely no doubt whatsoever that small and medium-sized industries have a vital role to play in job creation. Because SFADCo were able to concentrate on this aspect of industrial development they have acquired a lot of expertise and a lot of information in the course of establishment of these small projects. Indeed perhaps the lessons learned could be applied in extending the development of small industries throughout the country.</P>
    <P>Of course SFADCo still have responsibility for the Shannon Industrial Estate. Despite the fact that there has been a slight fall in the number of jobs, bearing in mind the industrial recession throughout the western world, the Shannon Industrial Estate appears to have survived reasonably well.  It would have been too much to have expected that there would be no job losses.  I am particularly pleased that an industry sited there &mdash; which was the subject of an enormous amount of controversy a year ago &mdash; the bus-building company, Bombardier <Col N="1624" /> (Ireland) Ltd. is now on the verge of a major breakthrough on the export market. I understand that a prototype bus is on trial in one country and that negotiations are well advanced for a major export order to a European country.  My colleague, Deputy Prendergast, has been very concerned at some adverse publicity this company has received.  It is very important, particularly during a recession, that problems which industries encounter should not be magnified by the media.  It is important that the media remember that they have a very serious responsibility in situations like that.  I congratulate the management and staff of Bombardier on the manner in which apparently they overcame the worst difficulties and problems they encountered. I sincerely hope the company will effect the desired breakthrough into the export market resulting in the assured future of the company and their employees.</P>
    <P>Again I congratulate SFADCo on their progress to date.  In particular I congratulate them on the manner in which they have succeeded in the very wide area of responsibility assigned to them.  I want to direct the Minister's attention to the need to give SFADCo maximum encouragement in the type of community development work in which they are engaged, for example, in their pilot projects at Slieve Phelim near Nenagh, at Anglesborough and South Hill.  I hope the Government will encourage SFADCo to formulate and implement comprehensive development programmes in areas like West Clare, North Clare and other under-developed areas throughout the mid-west region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SylvesterBarrett" hpid="Mr. Barrett (Clare) Mr. Barrett (Clare)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> I welcome this Bill which provides further finance for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company.  Of all the State or semi-State bodies it can be truly said that any moneys made available to SFADCo to date have been really well spent for the benefit of the region.  They have been in existence for well over 20 years now and their achievements have been outstanding.  To really appreciate what has happened in that part of the country one would want to remember what was there before the <Col N="1625" /> airport got under way.  It was just a big open marsh of slob lands, flooded for part of the year which was eventually drained with pick and shovel; there was no machinery utilised.  Then the airport came into being.  That saw the beginning of development in our country which spilled over into the region and the west generally.  It all began with the transatlantic airport.  The airport developed, after which the industrial estate and SFADCo came into being.  The industrial estate grew over the years to the extent that they now employ well over 4,000 people.  Indeed it is very heartening to realise that they had a net loss of some £200 in 1982, in this period of deep recession throughout the western world, particularly when compared with the unhappy experiences of other areas during the same period.  They have worked hard to maintain employment, by creating new jobs, having as few redundancies as possible, and have done so with success.</P>
      <P>After the establishment of the industrial estate we saw the beginning of the new town which commenced with the building of a few flat complexes by SFADCo from which developed the town, planned and constructed under the auspices of SFADCo.  That town now has a population of something in the region of 9,000 and is the second largest town in county Clare, with apologies to Deputy Taylor-Quinn from Kilrush.  In recent years it has become the second largest town in the county and has developed more and more a community spirit in recent years.  The advent of the town commissioners, which it was my privilege to grant when Minister for the Environment, has proved a great success and played a leading role in knitting together the community there, giving them a real community spirit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unlike other towns where families have been established for generations, the population of Shannon is drawn from many parts of the country and from abroad and it took a while for them to identify as a community on their own. There is no better way to assist this process than to have local representatives who can be elected at each local election.  It is <Col N="1626" /> the right of the elected representatives to speak for the people who elect them, as it is the right of every public representative to make representations for his constituents, despite what other people might think.  That is built in to the whole democratic system.  However, I do not want to seem to be selling myself.</P>
    <P>The only decentralisation in recent years, since that to Mayo and Athlone, has been to Shannon town and this is very much appreciated.  Part of the registration unit of the Department of the Environment is now located there and this has added further to the importance of the town in the eyes of the community.</P>
    <P>During the period of the setting up of the town commissioners, which is a longer process than some people realise, no people could have been more co-operative and helpful than SFADCo. They assisted in every way possible and they co-operate with the town commissioners at all times on any problems.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have played a major role in the development of the mid-west.  They had a great supporter in the former Minister for Industry and Commerce, the late Seán Lemass, who believed in the whole concept and did not hesitate to help them financially.  There is one other man who deserves mention in regard to the airport development and SFADCo.  He is Brendan O'Regan, who is now semi-retired. He was at first head of sales and catering in the airport and he achieved tremendous success.  He was also the first chairman of the Shannon development company and retained that post until four or five years ago.  He had such a creative and progressive mind that his chairmanship made a great difference to the entire region.  I hope the work and creativeness of this man are appreciated.  Apart from industry, the castle tours were also his brainchild and SFADCo stepped in to develop them.  These projects are now operating very successfully and it should be remembered that Brendan O'Regan was the principal driving force behind them.</P>
    <P>In 1978 SFADCo were given the responsibility for small industries by my colleague, Deputy Desmond O'Malley. The decision was criticised at the time, <Col N="1627" /> not only by Deputy O'Donnell but also by a number of others.  SFADCo have overcome all criticism due to their tremendous success in promoting small industries in such a short time.  They retained responsibility for development in the industrial zone at Shannon and this responsibility was not given to the IDA. Deputy Carey said today that the IDA had obtained no further industry for Ennis since that development in 1978. That is not quite correct because I launched one project, Unitrode Ireland Limited, under the auspices of the IDA, which is now flourishing in Ennis.</P>
    <P>During the course of their development of small industries SFADCo have introduced many innovations, ventures and ideas and put them into practice. Mention has been made of joint ventures which serve to improve technology and marketing, as well as the new matchmaker service.  This is not to be confused with Lisdoonvarna; it is a SFADCo innovation for the promotion or improvement of industry in the mid-west region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Clare):</i> This service has played a very important role in connection with import substitution, which I understand has amounted to £6 million. This is an appreciable sum.  They give advice to smaller industries on serving large industries and these smaller industries are now supplying components which were formerly imported.</P>
      <P>SFADCo have also initiated a task force and community programmes to assist people who have ideas for industries to put them into practice.  The service is designed to assist local communities to help themselves and it is becoming effective.</P>
      <P>They have also a new concept with regard to work space.  The idea is to provide common services, such as secretarial services, for several small units using one large factory, thus cutting down costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Shannon Estuary has also been mentioned.  There are difficulties in the <Col N="1628" /> coming into being of an estuary authority. Until such an authority is set up, SFADCo could be enabled to play a greater role.  I am sure the IDA would not object.  They were involved in the Alcan Project and the ESB are involved at Moneypoint.  They are usually highly efficient.  A greater role for SFADCo in small or large industries along the estuary would be beneficial.</P>
    <P>Several speakers have said that the sand bar off Loop Head will have to be removed.  It is not necessary in order to develop the Shannon Estuary to involve ourselves in the large expenditure that would be needed to remove it.  At the moment the estuary can take bulk carriers of 300,000 tonnes without the removal of the sand bar.  If it were removed it could take 500,000 tonne bulk carriers but that is not necessary in order to develop industry.  A few years ago there was no industrialisation along the north and south banks of the Shannon other than the ESB station at Tarbert. Now there are two major heavy industries, Alcan and the ESB station at Moneypoint.  The estuary has greater potential than any natural waterway in Western Europe and this is widely accepted.  It is high time that further industrialisation be carried out.  It could be a major distribution port because of the use of the bulk carriers, for redistribution throughout Western Europe. That would be feasible even with 300,000-tonne carriers.  Some organisation should be asked to develop this concept and there is no better organisation than SFADCo because their experience and achievements can be readily appreciated. They should have some role with regard to development of the Shannon Estuary.  That fine waterway is awaiting development and we must be glad that something has happened in this area.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to the achievements of SFADCo with regard to small industries.  What they have done is well known to the House and is appreciated. When money was made available to them it was used in a proper way.  I do not wish to insult any other region but it must be said that because of the efforts of SFADCo in particular, the mid-west <Col N="1629" /> region is more developed economically than any other region.  I hope the development will continue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I am pleased that the Minister of State has seen fit to allocate money to the mid-west region.  I should like to thank him and to congratulate him for the interest and initiative he has shown in this area.  It is vital to the region that this action should continue in the future.  He has suggested an increase of about £40 million in the taking up of shares, a £20 million increase in the amount of grants and a £3 million increase in the aggregate advances that may be made by the Minister for Finance to the company.  This is a substantial amount of money but it will provide the necessary finance needed for the expansion and development of the region.</P>
      <P>The work of SFADCo in the past has been tremendous and they must be complimented. The dedication and skill they have used in promoting the region has been beyond comparison with any other semi-State company.  Initially they had the responsibility of getting Shannon off the ground from the point of view of industry and also of forming a community at Shannon and providing housing for the people involved.  Now Shannon has the highest rate of private house occupancy in the country, with a total of 58 per cent of the people owning their own homes. Perhaps the time has come for SFADCo to hand over their housing responsibility to Clare County Council and to concentrate on the industrial development of Shannon and the mid-west region.  To date they have done an exceptionally good job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time has come when we have to realise that the entire south coast from Loop Head to Limerick city is Clare territory and there will be major development in that area in the next 15 or 20 years.  As Deputy Barrett has pointed out, there have been two major heavy industries in the region in the past few years, one at Moneypoint and the other at Aughinish.  If that type of development is to continue and to be monitored in a professional and skilled manner we need <Col N="1630" /> someone to take responsibility for it and there is no better organisation than SFADCo in conjunction with Clare County Council and the county development team.  I hope the Minister will take this into account.  SFADCo have created a community at Shannon and last year the first elections for town commissioners were held.  I think that Clare County Council should take responsibility for housing and allow SFADCo to concentrate on the industrial area.</P>
    <P>Many speakers mentioned the setting up of an estuarial authority at Shannon. I have spoken on this matter on the Transport Estimate.  It is vital to the development of the region that such an authority be established.  I hope that the Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy will do everything to assist the Minister for Transport to ensure that this is done.  The Kilrush harbour area should be extended to include the area to Moneypoint and it should be under the jurisdiction of the Kilrush harbour authority before further negotiations proceed regarding an estuarial authority.  I am sure Deputy Barrett agrees with me.  The Shannon runs along lands in Clare and if we have an estuarial authority we would want to be in a very strong position.  Today Deputy Prendergast said it was vital to have an estuarial authority.  The people in Clare are not prepared in future to continue to accept a situation where Limerick would have a monopoly in Clare and, as a public representative for Clare, I should like to put that on record.  I was interested to note Deputy Barrett's comments regarding the sand bar across Loop Head.  I am not as knowledgeable as was the Deputy about the tonnage of bulk carriers but I was interested to hear his remarks.  I ask the Minister to take note of them.</P>
    <P>We have been very fortunate in the personnel who have been involved in SFADCo during the years.  Initially Brendan O'Regan got things off to a flying start and SFADCo have been lucky in the personnel who followed him. Recently I was pleased that the Minister for Industry and Energy had reappointed Frank McCabe as chairman of SFADCo. It is nationally and internationally recognised <Col N="1631" /> that he has one of the finest brains in this country or indeed in Europe and America.  He is a well-known international industrialist and we are fortunate to have him chairing SFADCo.  I welcome his appointment by the Minister.</P>
    <P>With regard to housing it has often been difficult for Clare County Council to provide houses in the outlying regions particularly in the rural villages.  Father Harry Bohan and SFADCo are to be complimented for the great development which has taken place right through County Clare.  It is a remarkable project which has been very successful and is one which many other counties could copy.  It has made it possible for young couples to get their own houses and become owners of them at much lower cost than the ordinary market.  This is to be highly commended.</P>
    <P>It is not usual, as other speakers said, to compliment people on the Opposition benches but Deputy Dessie O'Malley deserves praise for the initiative he took in 1978 by giving SFADCo the responsibility for initiating small industries in the mid-west.  That project has proved remarkably successful.  In most cases the people involved have been local people, from Counties Clare, Tipperary and Limerick.  They started up small industries, employed a few people and gradually expanded.  The Minister's speech today highlights the degree of success of this.  In 1978 there were 300 small firms in the mid-west and by December 1982 there were 650 and, an increase of nearly 2,000 jobs in small industries.  That is very vital, particularly to rural scattered areas. Everybody concerned with this must be complimented for its success.</P>
    <P>The Minister and SFADCo should do everything possible to ensure the continued growth and expansion of that particular area.  There is room for progress in areas that as yet have been relatively untapped.  We are basically an agricultural community in the mid-west.  We have not a very extensive food processing industry but at the same time we find ourselves importing a lot of food. SFADCo could seriously examine the <Col N="1632" /> potential in the food processing industry right around all the small towns and villages of the mid-west region.  Deputy Prendergast mentioned this when he spoke this morning and I concur with him.  I ask the Minister and SFADCo to please examine this area soon because there is a real potential there.</P>
    <P>An attempt has been made at involving more craft workers in small industries. This has been successful, but there is room for far greater expansion.  Those type of industries can be located in the most remote parts of the region and can be successfully operated from those areas.  We need to keep people in rural areas rather than have them migrate to Dublin, Limerick, Cork or overseas or sit at home unemployed.  This is a sad situation for far too many.</P>
    <P>There is a vast area of water right around the coast of Clare.  This has not been successfully tapped to date.  There is a large fishing population in that area that we have not successfully made use of over the years.  I believe the fishing industry and the fish processing industry could be developed because we have the facilities in Clare.  There are quite a number of small harbours around the coast like Carrigaholt, Doonbeg, Doolin, Liscannor and many other places.  This should be seriously considered in relation to small industries.</P>
    <P>I find that people in the Shannon region are not happy about Sisk having a monopoly in relation to the leasing of property in the Shannon town centre. They find it is difficult to lease premises. A further complication often is that somebody who wishes to set up a small shop in the other areas around Shannon finds it difficult to get planning permission. Clare County Council have been willing to give planning permission in many cases for shops in the areas around the town but when it came to SFADCo they were reluctant to allow that permission to be given.  There is a conflict of interest there and many feel there is not free competition.  This should be examined because competition makes good business.  I would not like to think that any particular group would have a monopoly in an area and could maintain <Col N="1633" /> that monopoly.  If we are living in a democratic system there should be the opportunity for competition.  I hope to see the people of Shannon given that opportunity in the future.</P>
    <P>The remarkable success of Shannon Airport is to be highly complimented. The personnel in Aer Rianta have done a tremendous job.  Even last year, when world air traffic was substantially reduced, Shannon had an overall increase of 11 per cent.  There was a throughput of over one million passengers in Shannon.  That was a very significant growth considering the economic climate.  It was due principally to transit passengers where there was an increase of 25 per cent.  Shannon is seen as a North Atlantic gateway.  Shannon will have to continue to be the North Atlantic gateway to Europe as well as to Ireland.  I urge the Minister to do everything possible to ensure that continues.  I know that various airlines are making an attempt to overfly Shannon but this cannot be allowed to happen because the future success or failure of Shannon will depend on maintaining the North Atlantic routes and Shannon as the first stop when they get to Ireland.</P>
    <P>The people in the region around Shannon appreciate the interest the Minister has shown.  We hope he will continue to show that interest by co-operating in every way with SFADCo and giving them the necessary money and incentives to go ahead with the type of development necessary in that region.  It is a new region for industrial development and has a very young population.  He need only go to the Minister for Education to find out all the proposed new schools in the region and he will know exactly the extensive young population there is in the region and the number of jobs that will be needed in the future.  A new comprehensive school is to be built shortly in Shannon. Sixmilebridge have applied for a college to be built there.  Extensions continue to be built to the schools in Ennis. There will be a very real necessity around County Clare for a lot of new jobs in the future.  I believe we can be successful, with the help of SFADCo, in producing <Col N="1634" /> those new jobs.  I look forward to the Minister's co-operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been unreserved praise by all of the speakers, mainly from the constituencies surrounding the area, for this Bill.  It is very seldom that any subsidised company or State body deserve such unreserved praise on close examination.  I believe that in this instance the praise is well deserved.  I am probably the only speaker from outside the area and certainly the only one from Dublin who has contributed.  One might ask why I should bother speaking on this Bill.  There are obvious and simple reasons, but the main one is because this is an area of success.  It is a self-sufficient region and, contrary to the trend in recent years of everything coming from Dublin, it is delightful to see initiative from a different part of the country without dependence on so-called Dublin expertise.</P>
      <P>Another reason for my interest is because of the development of high technology in the region and particularly that associated with the NIHE.  In many ways Ireland was fortunate that the Industrial Revolution passed it by to a large extent. With advances in communication we can now reach every country in the world. There is no better placed region than Shannon to take advantage of the high technology.  Due to the foresight shown in the educational area, people were prepared for the advent of technology.  Shannon with its airport is a gateway to the world and is well situated to take advantage of markets in America, the Far East and other places.  It is on an international flying route and so it is convenient for business people to operate from that region.  It has succeeded in attracting research and development to the area from different parts of the world.  People have come from America and Europe and set up there.  The courses NIHE are providing for students and the opportunities provided for training in business and research have been tremendously successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am disappointed at the short notice Deputies were given in relation to the Bill.  This happens in the case of most <Col N="1635" /> Bills.  One only gets short notice about them.  Not many people touched on the costs involved.  If I have any criticism of the Minister's speech it is that there are too many generalities in it.  It appears to be the general form that Ministers ask for large sums of money without making any real effort to justify the amounts.  I am not saying the amounts involved in this case are not justified.  The Minister is asking for grants, subscriptions and advances.  He wants an increase from £80 million to £120 million in the aggregate of the amounts the Minister for Finance may subscribe in the taking up of shares in the company.  As regards subscriptions he is talking about £40 million to £60 million of grants which may be made to the company.  As regards advances, he is talking about £22 million to £25 million which may be made by the Minister for Finance to the company.  It is just giving him authority to go up to that amount.</P>
    <P>If we had more notice of the Bill we would have been able to look at the performance of SFADCo.  Most Deputies have assumed &mdash; perhaps from their local knowledge &mdash; that it is a rip-roaring success. We should not assume that the amounts of money asked for, probably prepared by civil servants who are very expert, should be automatically given. For those of us who handle £13,800 in our wage packets a year &mdash; I know the media thinks it is outrageously high &mdash; to be throwing around hundreds of millions of pounds and lightly passing them through the House is not very responsible. I know accounts are published, but when Bills of this nature come before the House Deputies should be given an opportunity to examine them.  I am not saying they would necessarily change them, but this is where legislation emanates from.  It is important that we know what the money is for and how it will be spent.  We should also know how it was spent in the past, given the stringent times in which we live.</P>
    <P>As regards SFADCo, it is no harm to repeat that it was a very successful venture from the beginning.  Other Deputies referred to its pioneering days and how it managed to last through.  Now we are <Col N="1636" /> in the age of high technology and it is good that it has been able to survive on its own and make such a great contribution to the rest of the country.  I should like to see much of their work extended throughout the country.</P>
    <P>I do not know how the figures which are in the Bill were arrived at.  I am sure they were not picked from the sky, but we are left with little scope for debate when we do not know what the money will be spent on.  There are too many generalities in the Minister's speech. Even the future of SFADCo and the Shannon area is dealt with in general terms.  The Minister spoke about 20 years hence.  As there will be no commitment to pass money this year and next year because of the state of the economy, I do not know if there is any point in talking about 20 years hence.  However, I am glad that thought is being given to the future and to the likelihood of change in industry.  I was glad to see a report on the types of industry that exist in the area.  I should like to see more information on the type and amounts of grants made, the people who received them, how the money has been spent and how successful companies which were awarded grants have been.  Early in his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>It is, therefore, necessary that these statutory limits be now increased to enable the company to continue its operations.</P>
    <P>No reason is given as to why it is necessary. He merely said that it is necessary to do so.  He said also:</P>
    <P>Expenditure by the company under the heading of share capital, grant-in-aid and repayable advances to 30 April 1983 are as follows: Share Capital, £77.3 million; Grant-in-Aid, £38.5 million; Repayable Advances, £19.1 million.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary to talk about this kind of money in such general terms without giving us enough detail to discuss the merits and demerits of the amount.  The only reason given is that on the basis of estimates of expenditure available, the proposed new limits will be sufficient <Col N="1637" /> until 1987.  Should we not have these so that we can examine them?  We are talking in global terms about a successful operation.  I doubt if any of the Deputies from the area would be crazy enough to criticise this Bill.  This begs the question, is it success at any price or is there a price on the success of this operation?  I have mentioned already what is relevant here, that we are inclined, without a very close examination of them, to take many of our agencies as being successful.  This refers even to institutions like the IDA and CTT.  Some of them have grown so big that they have their own public relations departments and they do a very good job in selling themselves to us.  It is time for a very critical examination of these institutions and of the one we are discussing so that they do not become lax and will continue to be as successful as they have been in the past.  It is important that we do not just take them for granted but that we keep them on their toes. Bodies such as SFADCo, the IDA and CTT have enormous resources at their disposal.  They have large teams of sales people selling here and practically all over the world.</P>
    <P>However, I wonder is it not better to enable small companies and their personnel sometimes to go on these selling trips abroad.  For example, it would be very interesting to know how much money is made available and how much money is spent by the marketing and sales of such institutions.  Very often small companies such as we are talking about whose operations are being assisted by the innovation centre cannot finance their sales people to go abroad to sell their product. In my estimation nobody is better able to sell a product than the people who know most about it, the people who make it, who very often depend on the good offices of somebody from one of these institutions to do the work for them. More often than not they fail, and that is the reason they fail.  That applies not only to their products and services but to the research and development contracts with foreign government companies.  The EEC grants applicable must be obtained through the National Board of Science and Technology.  People who try to win <Col N="1638" /> research and development contracts through the EEC must observe this ridiculous code whereby the person who is doing the research and development cannot present his own case to the EEC; it must be presented by somebody from the NBST on the person's behalf.  Such people start off at a distinct disadvantage.</P>
    <P>In the development of client and local community relations SFADCo require a number of years before they can produce worthwhile and lasting results.  However, they have made enormous strides in this area in a very few years.  I would like to see the operations of a pilot scheme that has been set up in the Shannon area expanded throughout the country.  Operations such as those of the innovation centre should be expanded from the Limerick area throughout the country. At present the centre takes in the mid-west region and parts of Offaly.  Anybody who has worked with it has had 100 per cent co-operation from the personnel there.  They are easy to deal with, mainly because they started off in a small way themselves dealing with small companies. They understand indigenous business, the small businessman and the graduate engineer who is trying to get out on his own, whereas the IDA themselves operate on a far bigger scale.  The two should be kept separate.  If possible this institution should not be diluted.  I would hate to see interference with it from the Dublin area.  I am glad the money is being made available for the expansion.  I know that the accounts are produced every year and are there to be seen.  I hope that the operations of the centre will increase at a greater rate although the danger in that is that some of the infrastructure that has been slowly built up might be destroyed.</P>
    <P>SFADCo were set up to deal with the development of small indigenous industry, air traffic and the industrial estates. I intend to confine my remarks to small indigenous industry and to small businesses, because there is enormous potential for small businesses and if they are promoted, they will play a very big part in the recovery of our economy.</P>
    <P>The approach which this company have adopted has very successfully manipulated the small business sector <Col N="1639" /> and has shown in a few short years the success rate that can be achieved.  That is why it should be encouraged to expand and to take on other regions, and I hope the Minister will do that.</P>
    <P>I should like to applaud the Minister's approach when he spoke about the national role that we must not lose sight of.  He said this intensive experimental role requires resources and expertise over and above that needed in solely direct promotional work.  Perhaps this is what the Minister has in mind, and I hope that is so.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to the study which is being undertaken in the Shannon area.  I hope it will be published soon and that the House will be kept informed of the operations in this region.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is right that I should speak briefly on this Bill because, from the discussions so far, one would think that North Tipperary was not included in the mid-west region.  There was talk about whether Clare or Limerick owned the Shannon and whether the estuarial responsibilities should lie in Kilrush or Limerick.  The Shannon flows through North Tipperary, which I consider to be one of the finest beauty spots in the country, even taking Killarney into account.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister on increasing the capital from £80 million to £120 million.  As a public representative, I have seen what SFADCo have done in the region.  It started with the transformation of the slob lands of Rineanna into Shannon Airport, which is now our major international airport.  SFADCo have been involved in many aspects of Irish life, including industry and tourism.  We have considerable development in North Tipperary in the RHO housing schemes. I compliment Fr. Harry Bohan and the people supporting him in their efforts to provide sites and houses for people who would not normally be housed by local authorities.  Many schemes in North Tipperary have considerably improved the environment and have provided services and houses for people who are <Col N="1640" /> working in Limerick or Nenagh but who prefer to live on the lakeside of Lough Derg.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>They have even moved as far as Longford.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="Mr. Ryan Mr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>They have moved even further afield.  Emphasis was laid on the role which SFADCo can play in the recession. With regard to small industry and support for local entrepreneurs, the North Tipperary officer, Mr. Tomás Ó Domhnaill, has made extensive efforts to try to foster enthusiasm among local industrialists to avail of the services and facilities that are in SFADCo.  I should like to compliment him on the many successful efforts he has made in North Tipperary. Emphasis was laid on the need for SFADCo, in conjunction with the IDA, to play a major role in the development of food processing.  While Limerick and Clare may claim the Shannon, we in North Tipperary claim we have the natural resources in land and livestock to provide resources for the development of food processing.  We have a factory run by Erin Foods in Thurles and this is an area where SFADCo and the IDA could ensure that the natural resources of North Tipperary are utilised to the benefit of the region and also to the benefit of employment in the area.  In the last 12 months we have suffered traumatic effects from the closure of a major industry. Deputy Daly referred to the loss of 100 jobs in a small town.  Mogul in Nenagh lost 600 jobs and that compares with the loss of anything up to 15,000 jobs in Dublin.  If such an industry had closed in the city, the workers would have been marching.</P>
      <P>I know that SFADCo appreciates the needs of industrial development in North Tipperary and I appeal to the Minister to ensure everything possible is done to assist small and medium sized industries to come to this area.  At present in the Nenagh Labour Exchange there are about 1,100 people registered as unemployed. This has a very serious effect on many people and also on the commercial life of the town.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been often said that North <Col N="1641" /> Tipperary is the poor relation of the region and at times I readily agree with that.  The core of the region seems to be Limerick, Shannon and Ennis and the periphery is the major part of North Tipperary.  Now that the region has been extended as far as Offaly, I hope the many pleas which have been made on behalf of North Tipperary by the various commercial bodies, such as the Chamber of Commerce and Trades Council, will not be overlooked.  I appeal to the Minister to see that everything possible is done to lighten the very serious unemployment situation in my constituency and to ensure that the many public bodies who for years have stated that we are the poor relation will reaffirm the interest of SFADCo and the IDA in the region.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As our spokesman and other speakers on this side of the House have done, I welcome this Bill for what it is doing for the Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited in the taking up of shares, in the increase in the aggregate amount of grants, in the increase of £3 million in the aggregate amount of advances which may be made, and also in that it is giving statutory authority for SFADCo in Offaly west and south.</P>
      <P>It is in that connection that I should like to reiterate points some people made including the Acting Chairman when he was speaking.  This company have set a headline which might usefully be followed elsewhere.  Some speakers referred to the possibility of a Derry-Donegal company for development in that area.  I should like to widen that suggestion and ask the House and the Minister to consider the whole Border situation as of now.  Such a development company, with a brief for the whole Border area, with the exact same terms of reference and powers, could be a very powerful force for developing that area which has specific problems as of now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know the political problem of a Border which was artifically created and should never have been there.  This is not the place or the time to comment at any length on that.  It was not there by the will of any section of the Irish people <Col N="1642" /> when it was set up at least.  It is on the economic aspects that I should like to comment.  SFADCo are an engine for economic advancement.  The encomia we heard in the House today are well deserved by that company.  At the moment we have excise problems.  We have VAT problems.  We have punt problems. We have decentralisation problems.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>SFADCo also earned praise in this House today for their work in the development of certain tourism ventures.  In particular, a reference was made by the Acting Chairman to the development of the castle industry in the Clare and Shannon region.  This too is a headline for other parts of the country. In view of what I have said already, I do not think I have to underline which part of the country I am referring to in particular. The Acting Chairman and our spokesman, Deputy Reynolds, emphasised the importance of one industry for the Shannon region, that is, food processing. I agree wholeheartedly with what was said on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that, if the canning of beef and the processing of broilers &mdash; I want to keep to the point but incidentally County Monaghan is an area which produces 40 per cent of the country's broilers and 100 per cent of the duck development <Col N="1643" />&mdash; are desirable in the Shannon region, and if this Bill which is providing money for that development is in aid of food processing, we could apply it elsewhere. Good example is being given by people who have taken an initiative, for example, in the mushroom exporting business. Dairy products are the same.</P>
    <P>Shannon lies in one of the richest dairying regions in Europe.  I agree that something is radically wrong with our economy and with the way we look at things when we are importing large quantities of food while we have the raw materials, so to speak, for the finest food in Europe waiting to be processed.  I cannot understand what is wrong.  When the Sugar Company developed an arm for processing, it went wrong.  Why it went wrong I cannot say.  All I know is this.  If you go to any of the Mediterranean resorts you can buy tinned beef, tinned lamb and processed meat from Belgium, Holland and Denmark.  We have very fine products here, but you will search in vain for our products on the shelves of supermarkets in the various areas which have been developed with apartamentos, and so on, in Europe.</P>
    <P>This is a puzzle, but it is a puzzle which should be solved.  We should know why we are not succeeding.  In fairness to Kerrygold, you can get butter, salted and unsalted, and Kerrygold can hold its own with Lurpak from Denmark and other brands.  Why is it that, with the raw materials we have, we cannot do the same from Shannon, or the Border region, or other parts of the country?  There is something radically wrong with our thinking on the matter.</P>
    <P>I am glad to hear from the Minister that a 20-year study is being undertaken in that region.  The Acting Chairman asked me not to refer to other regions but, if I were allowed, I could mention another region where a 20-year study is in progress at the moment on industrial development.  I welcome the Bill for its goodness <i>per se.</i> In particular, I welcome it for the kind of headline it could set for a development company in other parts of the country which are crying out for that kind of development, some for <Col N="1644" /> artificial reasons, one of which I mentioned, and others because of the general unemployment situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>First may I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate?  In particular I want to thank Deputy Reynolds for welcoming the Bill in the manner in which he welcomed it.  We got a deep insight into the problems of the region in general from the Deputies representing the area.  The only request I did not get was for the restoration of the west Clare railway.  It was obvious that the Deputies in the region are <i>au fait</i> with the problems of the region and the workings of SFADCo.  The Bill is a reflection of the Government's commitment to SFADCo and the development of the mid-western region.</P>
      <P>A point of procedure was raised by Deputy Skelly, who said that there was not sufficient time given for him to study the Bill.  I must disagree with that.  The Bill was published and circulated two weeks ago and there was ample time given for all Deputies to consider the Bill. Indeed, in his remarks he seemed to be querying the ability of Deputies to question the operations of SFADCo.  I would also reject his comments in that regard on a number of grounds.  The company publishes an annual report which is quite comprehensive and one of the more detailed reports which we get in this House.  That report is laid annually before this House for the consideration of the Members.  Secondly, in the annual budgetary estimates moneys are provided for expenditure and all Deputies have ample opportunity in the budget debate to query the activities of the company. Of course, the Deputy can also at any stage contact the company, put down a parliamentary question or raise any matter with regard to the company on the Adjournment.  His remarks were slightly out of line with what I believe to be correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an enabling Bill which increases the funds available to the company.  The basic idea in the Bill is to finance the company for approximately three years <Col N="1645" /> in order that we in the House can have a further review of the company's operations when the limits of expenditure are reached again.  That is another safeguard which this House has with regard to the operation of the company.</P>
    <P>The Bill reflects our commitment to the company.  The company has been exceptionally successful with regard to Shannon Airport, the industrial estate, the evolution of Shannon town, the promotion since 1978 of indigenous small industries in the mid-west region and in developing community affairs.  They have been extremely successful in that regard and I would reject any criticisms of them.</P>
    <P>The company have also been successful in innovation and in this regard Deputy Reynolds's remarks were particularly constructive and far-seeing.  I welcome his attitude towards industrial policy.  He has obviously had experience as Minister for Industry and Energy and he is aware of the rapidly changing needs of industry. His constructive approach today to industrial policy is somewhat in contrast with stands of attitudes he takes on other occasions when he can be very negative in his thinking.  Judging by his contribution today he obviously has an insight into the problems of the country.</P>
    <P>Our industry has over the past ten years suffered structural damage primarily for two reasons &mdash; the first being two energy crises in the seventies and then the tremendous worldwide recession we are currently experiencing.  These have done tremendous damage and have tested our industrial base very sharply. Since we entered the EEC we have had to dismantle our system of protection. That has caused certain long-established industries to open their minds and their doors to competition.  Some of these industries have not been successful.  We are now certainly seeing a new generation of industries &mdash; high technology industries, industries based on chemicals and advanced engineering.  The IDA and SFADCo are very much aware of the type of industries that are needed to serve the industrial needs of this country in the future.  I can assure the House that this Government are also aware of the industrial needs of the country and also the <Col N="1646" /> need to ensure that we have the environment for successful industry.  The environment for industry has not been good in the past few years.  Damage has been done to the environment for industrial expansion and this Government are committed to restoring that environment.  I was on an industrial promotion visit to the United States recently and they are certainly questioning the environment for industry here and that is why investment from that area has not been at as high a level as it was in the seventies.  It is this Government's task to restore that environment, which has been lacking since 1977.</P>
    <P>SFADCo have been a pioneering company and continue to be a pioneering company.  The innovation centre and the micro-electronic application centre are two examples of very forward thinking on the part of SFADCo.  They have not been slow in applying new concepts to the needs of industry.  Deputy Reynolds spoke about some of the concepts.  The policy now in relation to advance factories is to build smaller ones because we feel there is a greater potential for employment in smaller industries.  The IDA's Enterprise Centre in Pearse Street Dublin is modelled on the work space concept in Limerick where a whole range of services are provided for small industries on a shared basis.  SFADCo's Shannon service programme is based on the IDA's international services programme which is aimed at promoting high grade white collar employment such as computer software industries and the incubator units now being established in Galway and Dublin are based on the SFADCo/NIHE initiative and go some way towards meeting the ideas put forward by Deputy Reynolds and other Deputies.</P>
    <P>The innovation centre is linked into a worldwide data information system and SFADCo are working very closely with MIT in Boston.  This allows them to search out new product ideas by an internationally based method.  This again reflects the forward thinking of SFADCo, a forward thinking which is to be encouraged.  We in this Government <Col N="1647" /> shall continue to encourage forward thinking and new ideas in SFADCo.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of the food processing industry.  Deputy Brennan suggested that the Department of Agriculture's interest in agriculture should end at the farm gate and post-gate and that a different Minister should be in charge of the food processing industry.  This is an ongoing argument.  Certainly the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Energy closely co-operate in regard to development in the food processing area.  It is a disappointment that our food procesing industry has not developed as rapidly as it should have done and some attempt to have an added value content in the industry has, indeed, met with failure.  It is certainly one of the disappointments on the industrial scene but that has been the case.  Why it has been the case it is difficult to know.  There are perhaps certain reasons, that the IDA are aware of the present and future needs of the processing industry and are applying their minds in that area.</P>
    <P>It has also been stated in the course of the debate that SFADCo has a special programme for matchmaker linking the requirements of large firms with small industry in the mid-west region.  This is an attempt, a successful attempt, to ensure small industry in that region has an opportunity of meeting the requirements of large industry.  SFADCo have set a target of £5 million worth of business for small industry in the region for 1983.  Much more, of course, can be done and will be done in this area.  It is interesting to note, again in the context of the food processing industry, that SFADCo is about to develop a specialised food processing enterprise centre in the Limerick area.  This will be an initial development in this area.  It is recognised that the heavy capital investment involved is a prohibiting factor for small food processors.  This again is an example of the innovative approach evident in SFADCo and we will certainly watch with interest the evolution of the specialised food processing enterprise centre.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1648" /> Some Deputies raised the question of the review which is constantly ongoing in the company.  The purpose of this is to ensure that the result and the promotion of areas are fully geared to meet the challenges.  There is a three-year review taking place.  This year the company have engaged external consultants to have a look at the company's operations.</P>
    <P>It is always interesting to have consultants come in periodically to look at the company's operations and the way it is going.  It is also interesting to note that the company is undertaking a study for the future of the industrial estate over the next 20 years.  That is a process of long-term forward planning which is very important in a rapidly changing industrial world.  This attitude to the company's activities from within the company itself is certainly very welcome.  They can lay down short-term reviews and override them with a long-term review of developments. That is something to be welcomed. It is something other State bodies could copy with advantage.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey mentioned large industry. So did Deputy O'Donnell.  They argued SFADCo should have a wider role.  It should be understood that SFADCo operate on the basis of referral by the IDA of new projects for the Shannon Industrial Estate and that estate has done well in the context of the country as a whole.  Last year employment fell by only 6 per cent.  It is holding up extremely well in the current recession.  It must be said, however, that the IDA must continue to have overall responsibility for industrial development in the mid-west region as a whole, especially in relation to large industry.  I do not think they would like to see a duplication of resources and development in the mid-west region or that they would like to develop SFADCo into a regional development operation.  I do not think that was intended and I do not think it is the correct direction for the company.  The IDA are a very professional body and they are well aware of the needs of each region.  There is also close co-operation and contact with SFADCo on an ongoing basis.</P>
    <P>The question of an estuarial harbour <Col N="1649" /> board was raised.  I understand that Deputy O'Malley in the 1970s made some attempt towards the unification of the existing port authorities but did not meet with any great success.  In fairness to Deputy O'Malley, I can see the very complex problems that exist there.  It is really a matter for the Department of Transport. I do not wish to comment on the correctness of SFADCo taking over a unified estuarial board.  I doubt there would be any great advantage in that.  I appreciate the complexities involved and the matter is one which should be properly adressed to the Minister for Transport.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey also referred to the question of the Westinghouse Company not being competitive enough in regard to tenders.  I think Westinghouse accept the position that arose in the case the Deputy raised.  They brought in a vacuum interruptor project to replace the industrial systems project.  The company currently employs over 65 engineers and scientists at Shannon.  It would be only right for me to say that Westinghouse are committed to this country and that is something to be appreciated.  They have up to eight plants now in the country and are showing themselves to be very interested and confident in the future of Ireland as their European industry base.  One should point out that they have been very successful in this regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cowen raised the question of extending SFADCo's responsibility to all of County Offaly.  It is not possible to do that now.  West and south west Offaly are a natural extension of North Tipperary and SFADCo's assignment in Offaly is temporary.  One should say also that designation of an area for higher grant rates does not necessarily assure that area of new industry.  Indeed SFADCo have shown that intensive promotion is the best method of getting industry into an area.  I might point out also that SFADCo give the same rate of grant as the IDA for small industries in Offaly so that there would be no great advantage in extending SFADCo's remit to the complete county of Offaly.</P>
    <P>I think it was Deputy Daly who raised the advance factory situation.  The position <Col N="1650" /> in County Clare is as follows &mdash; the question was asked in relation to County Clare &mdash; as at May 1983 there are 120 units with a square footage of 218,537, completed, of which 94 units are occupied. The square footage involved there is 160,043 which gives an occupancy rate of 78 per cent, which is high.  There are also a further 13 units allocated with a square footage of 32,547 or 11 per cent of the total square footage, which leaves 13 units with a square footage of 25,947, or 11 per cent of the total completed square footage built there and ready for occupation.  I consider that rate of occupancy and allocation is very high by national standards.  There are still advance factories available in County Clare for occupancy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly also raised the question of the closures of Kilrush Pottery and Interton.  The Industrial Development Authority are actively promoting both those companies and are now talking to potential buyers.  While one must always be conservative in what one can say, I am aware that the IDA are very actively involved in both of those companies. Indeed I should like to thank Deputy Daly for his kind works and wishes.  From his time in office he is obviously aware of the very difficult time industry is going through.</P>
    <P>A question was raised regarding planning permission for a shop near Bunratty.</P>

      <P>I have never visited the premises.  It is primarily a planning permission matter and properly one for the Department of the Environment.  However, I understand that SFADCo is taking legal advice on whether the permission is valid on the basis that the location was inadequately identified in the original planning application and that Clare County Council failed to notify the prescribed bodies about the proposal.  I do not wish to get involved in it; that was merely by way of giving the House that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of extending the remit of SFADCo to the entire mid-west region.  I cannot accept <Col N="1651" /> his philosophy in that regard.  Apart from the small indigenous industry and the airport the IDA have responsibility for industrial development in the mid-west region.  In my opinion that is as it should be.  I do not foresee any policy change in that regard in the near future.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is perfectly entitled to express a different opinion with regard to his region.  I am merely making the point that it is not the intention of the Government to extend the remit of SFADCo to the entire mid-west region.  To a certain extent it would be a duplication of resources which I am sure nobody in the House would desire.  Of course, with regard to Deputy O'Kennedy, he has not always been at one with his party leaders either.  Perhaps we should not go into those personal matters at all.</P>

      <P>The new strategy that will emerge when the 20-year review takes place will no doubt benefit the entire region.  The question was raised of the actual expenditure on certain items; I think it was Deputy O'Donnell who raised it.  The information he sought was as follows: in industry, in 1983, expenditure on the Shannon Industrial Estate factories is £3.341 million; for small indigenous industries, that is land and factories, £4.983 million.  Expenditure on Shannon town community works is £870,000, house loans £400,000 and on medium and large IDA works in the region £1.556 million, giving a total of £11,150,000.  That is a considerable sum to be expended and demonstrates the <Col N="1652" /> commitment of this Government to the mid-west region.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Donnell also discussed at length the development projects of SFADCo.  These projects, to which an officer of the company was assigned very recently, are still at a very early stage.  It would be too early a stage to say how far SFADCo would get involved in community development projects or how successful they might be.  Again this is a reflection of the original thinking, if you like, on the part of the company.  It is something we, as a Government, welcome and shall continue to encourage.</P>
      <P>Shannon town itself had a successful election apparently for the Opposition party not so long ago.  Of course it will continue to receive the attention of SFADCo.  There is a need for planning the provision of community services parallel with the development of industry. This makes it necessary for SFADCo to continue to be deeply involved in the development of the town.  Common services such as water and sewerage systems have been developed both for the town and the industrial estates.</P>
      <P>Those are the main points raised by Deputies and I have tried to answer them as best I can.  I am very pleased that the Bill has been so well received by the House.  It reflects the success of the activities of SFADCo.  The company can go on now with the good work they have done since 1959 in the interests of Shannon and the mid-west region.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the first debate in this House specifically on this company since early 1978 when we had a livelier debate than appears to have been the case today.  I put forward some proposals which were the subject of very considerable criticism in this House and elsewhere, particularly in the region, and it is gratifying to me as a mere human to read some of the figures given by the Minister today which were achieved as a result of the policy change made in 1977 and 1978.  That is now five-and-a-half years ago and it is time there was another major shake-up of this company.  One of the reasons I felt it was necessary at that time was that the company had got into something of a rut. They had been doing the same thing for quite a long time, admittedly successfully enough.  It is important that both small and large State companies should have to rethink their position or have somebody rethink it for them at suitable decent <Col N="1654" /> intervals like five or six years.  This is a suitable decent interval.</P>
    <P>Although it was not adverted to today by the Minister of State, I understand there is something of a shake-up going on and this time it is self-generated by the company.  This is a good thing.  It is a pity the Minister of State did not go into this matter in more detail.  I simply advert to the fact that it is happening and it is causing certain tensions within the company. That, in my experience, is a good thing.  It will get that company back to looking at realities again in a vivid way and I feel they will respond on this occasion as they did in 1977 and 1978.</P>
    <P>There is a danger always with State companies that the company itself, its very existence and the welfare of those who are in it will begin after a period to become superior to the purpose for which it was founded.  We have all seen it happen in other companies and it is good that it is not the case in this company.</P>
    <P>If there is any one objective to which this company should address itself at this stage of its existence and in the circumstances of the region it services it is the whole question of the Shannon Estuary and its development.  It is tragic that the estuary is as relatively underdeveloped as it is.  The airport has existed for close on 40 years but there is inevitably something slightly artificial about the airport.  It has been preserved and will be preserved, but there is a certain artificiality about it from which one cannot get away.  There is no artificiality about the finest deep water natural harbour in western Europe.  God put that estuary there; Seán Lemass or whoever put the airport there. Seán Lemass's work could be undone by circumstances but God's work will never be undone.  If I were Minister for Industry and Energy at present I would tell the company &mdash; and if necessary bring in enabling legislation &mdash; that their task is to tackle that estuary, develop it and make it in practice what it is by nature, the finest deep water port in Europe.  If we as a nation fail to develop that most valuable asset, we have only ourselves to blame for a lot of the problems we face today.</P>
    <P>Unhappily there are many jurisdictional <Col N="1655" /> disputes going on in relation to the estuary.  We had the standard pat reply from the Minister of State today when he said that it is really a matter for the Department of Transport.  It does not matter a damn what Department are supposed to deal with it.  Are we so insular in our thinking that we have to keep fobbing off a problem or, in this case, an opportunity from one Department to another, each saying that technically it is the responsibility of another Department? We will make no progress if we continue to think on those lines.</P>
    <P>As a first step towards the development of that estuary I made an effort over a couple of years to get the various harbour authorities to co-operate and there is a long, sorry history to it.  I failed to get one of them to co-operate.  I got other able people to try and they failed too. There is only one way that the development will come about and that is by the Government as a whole, not just one Department or one Minister, taking the problem by the scruff of the neck and saying &ldquo;Look, if you do not agree we will bring in legislation and it will be law whether you like it or not and you had better agree&rdquo;.  That is what I put to them in 1981 but a general election was held and the Government changed and they breathed a sigh of relief.  When I was back in Government I was not there long enough to do anything towards bringing the matter to fruition.</P>
    <P>That is the approach that should be agreed across the floor of the House, that irrespective of which of us are in Government in the next three or four years we will see this thing through, that some small parochial objection will not be allowed to stand in the way of a major national development that will benefit not just the region but the entire country. It will bring business and traffic into the country to an extent not known up to now and it will generate an enormous number of jobs and very considerable commercial and industrial activity.  I think we could agree that simple matter across the floor of this House and not allow some very small local, unelected <Col N="1656" /> body to stand in the way of that type of progress.</P>
    <P>There is a somewhat unhappy history of the efforts made by numerous people to bring about unity in the estuary, which looked like coming to fruition in March 1977 when a Bill was published.  Unfortunately the Bill which was published by the then Minister for Transport and Power did not reflect the agreement that had been reached after laborious negotiations during several previous years between the parties involved.  In particular, it sought to undermine the position of one of the authorities concerned and as a result, that authority has been reticent &mdash; one might almost say obstructive &mdash; since then.  It is not fair to blame that authority as if there was no background to the whole business.  The authority were badly treated.  People gave their word to them and they entered into an agreement, but people other than those at Foynes broke their word.  That is why Foynes has been so unenthusiastic in recent years.  It should be explained to those people that there will not be a repeat of what happened at the beginning of 1977, that agreements reached will be honoured, that a Minister will not change an agreement behind closed doors as a result of certain local pressure and that a Bill, as agreed, will be implemented. That would be an important stage, but only one stage.</P>
    <P>In a region as divided in terms of counties, local authorities and harbour boards as is the mid-west region and the Shannon Estuary what is needed is a slightly independent body to act as a catalyst and SFADCo are the ideal catalyst in this situation.  There is a limit to what that body can do in the airport, with regard to industrial development in the estate and in relation to the development of small industries, although they have not reached that limit by any means.  They need a task to which there is no foreseeable limit, which will be a major benefit to the country and which will confer enormous advantages to the entire nation. That task should be given to them.  It should not be looked at in a compartmentalised, departmentalised way by Departments.  It should be looked at by <Col N="1657" /> the Government as a whole, who recognise this outstanding natural asset and who want to develop it for the benefit of the country.  I suggest to the Minister of State that this is an opportunity that should be taken.  We can indicate agreement across the floor of the House, that, irrespective of whatever changes in Government may take place in the months and years ahead, a programme of the kind broadly outlined by me will be followed through.  It will inject tremendous vigour into the area and will re-inject vigour into the company which is the subject of this debate.  It will give them a real worthwhile national challenge to pursue.</P>
    <P>On the question of urban renewal, which was dealt with by the Minister and which is paid for under moneys authorised in section 2, I am pleased at the success of the work undertaken by the development company in Limerick city. This was done jointly with the corporation at my suggestion some years ago and I am happy to have seen it come to fruition.  The work which has been done in the Granary is worth inspection by any Member of this House who wishes to see what can be done with the restoration of an important old building, not just as a museum piece but as a living commercial entity.  I would like to think that the Kilkenny Design Workshops, particularly after the passage of recent legislation, might be in a position to help more positively.</P>

      <P>I am about to seek to install this worthy body in my own region and to suggest that they take up the 10,000 square feet reserved for them in the building I mentioned in Limerick city. The taking of other space is contingent on the Kilkenny Design Workshops going ahead with their original proposal to take a lease of a significant part of that property.  Perhaps I am better aware than most of the reasons why the Department of Industry and Energy and the Department of Finance should have considerable reservations about the Kilkenny Design <Col N="1658" /> Workshops entering into retailing, but I think circumstances have changed and at present such a venture would be justified. The Dublin shop is now profitable and the capital situation of the organisation has been properly restructured by the recent legislation.</P>
      <P>Without dwelling too much on it, I should like to come back to the perennial problem so far as Shannon Airport is concerned, namely, Aer Lingus.  The latest news I have with regard to the transAtlantic situation is that at the end of this week Aer Lingus are terminating their cargo service from Chicago and Montreal to Shannon, which is very regrettable.  It puts the always difficult situation at Shannon into even greater difficulty.  It is a pity that the national airline does not utilise this airport to a greater extent.  I have heard all the arguments for and against trotted out time and again in this House in the past decade or more.  Essentially they have not changed, but neither have my views on the matter.  Aer Lingus can hardly claim that by their action they are making or saving money because their losses on the Atlantic route seem to get greater with every year that passes.  It is very disappointing that the cargo operation at Shannon is so limited.  It is very disappointing to hear, as I did over the last year or so, instances of industries in the west using Gatwick as their air base.</P>

It is a pity that the cargo operations are so limited, that the opportunities seem to be diminishing rather than expanding and that the service to industry is limited to the extent it is. There are other matters I would like to refer to but I will not trespass further on the time of the House at this stage.  I would like to thank the Chair for its tolerance in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley, being a former Minister responsible in this area and representing the region like I do, has made a very significant speech in regard to the further role of SFADCo in discharging their responsibilities under section 2.  I want to make some comments regarding the difficulties they will have in areas other than those which have been touched on in realising their full potential in the next few years in the same way as they have done, as shown by the Minister's figures, in the last few years.  The Chair must be aware, living like myself in Nenagh on the perimeter of the region, that the climate for industrial development at this stage is very unhealthy.  The role of SFADCo has always been to promote the small indigenous industries in the region.  I am all too aware unfortunately &mdash; as the Chair must be &mdash; that in North Tipperary, particularly in our home town, that the indications clearly are over the last few months that far from there being developmental activity in the region we are now witnessing closures instead of openings and we are not seeing anything to encourage the entrepreneurial activity and the spirit which was essentially the role of SFADCo in their extended activity throughout the region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We can give all the money we wish through extra share allocations to SFADCo, and even give them extra powers, but unless the climate for industrial development in the region and throughout the country is healthy, I am afraid SFADCo will not be able, even with the extra capital we are voting to <Col N="1660" /> them, to do anything like as much as they have done in the last few years under the Fianna Fáil Government.  The unfortunate fact is that what we are witnessing in the Chair's and in my home town at this stage is quite the opposite.  I wish it were not so.  The Fianna Fáil record, through the development of new industries, whether by SFADCo or the IDA, has been one of consistent progress.  The record of the Coalition, on the other hand, has been negative.  I hope a group as committed to development as SFADCo are will at least be able to generate more hope than is currently in the region and throughout the country. Words, votes and new developments alone will not solve this if the climate nationally is for industrial development where the entrepreneur will not be able to feel for one reason or another he is a self-employed person who is only interested in lining his pocket at the expense of other taxpayers.  That is a view which is conveyed all too freely at this stage.</P>
    <P>We witnessed some exciting developments over the last few years in North Tipperary when we extended the role of SFADCo.  One of the significant things was the natural competition between SFADCo and IDA in the region.  The region has benefited from that.  You must always have an incentive to keep everybody on their toes.  I have seen in relation to the developments which have taken place, particularly in Nenagh and in North Tipperary, what has come about by way of industrial development either through the IDA or SFADCo arising from the fact that they were both vying with each other to demonstrate what can be achieved.  I am afraid that even that kind of competition is not likely to give rise, in the current depressing economic climate generated by this Government, to any development of new jobs to take up the unemployment in what is regarded as a wealthy, prosperous region such as the mid-west.</P>
    <P>There are a few other points I want to make in relation to the development of SFADCo and what might be achieved.  I agree entirely with what the former Minister said.  I would like to make a point, following on what the Leas-Cheann <Col N="1661" /> Comhairle said in relation to our natural indigenous industries in the region, particularly food processing, which is essential if we are to come through the recession, that marketing is one of the weaknesses of the food processing industry although the Co-op society have demonstrated that they can branch out into new markets.  They are a great credit to all concerned.  We have seen some examples of that recently in relation to the prize which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle presented to the Nenagh Co-op creamery. This shows the marketing expertise they are developing.</P>
    <P>We have other food processing industries in the region, such as Erin Foods, which could do with a great injection of management expertise, particularly in the marketing area.  Under the new policies which were proposed at a time when I had some involvement in Europe, one of the areas seen as essential was management training for small industries from the Social Fund allocations.  Hitherto this was channelled mostly through AnCO.  I would like to see it being channelled from AnCO to shop floor employees. We need to keep management abreast of new techniques and developments, especially in relation to marketing, accounting, which many of them find to be complex provisions, such as we will find in the Finance Bill, which are more than they can cope with.  We need to support management in dealing with these areas.  I hope SFADCo will be given very significant encouragement to strengthen that element of their activities.</P>
    <P>This section extends the capital to SFADCo.  That said, let it be clearly understood that if the Government say or do anything to dampen the spirit of enterprise and fail to encourage investment then not even SFADCo with the extra money they are being given will be able to correct the decline we have seen in our constituencies.  There is no point in asking them to achieve the impossible. We must create an environment in which they can discharge the role we are encouraging them to undertake.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest <Col N="1662" /> to the Minister of State's reply but did not get a clear answer as to what the Department's attitude might be to extending the role of SFADCo to pioneer the development of the food industry. Perhaps he might be able to respond if he feels it is a worth-while idea to appoint a Minister with a single responsibility.  He might convey that idea to the Minister and to the Government.  This is a nettle which has not been grasped.  We need action in this area.  I made moves in that direction when I was Minister.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would let the House know the present position regarding the cross-Border study for free port development between north-east Donegal and the Derry region?  I understand the Government would back it. There are non-quota funds available for the project from the EEC.  It probably only remains for the British Government to back it.  What stage is it at now?  The study was initiated a few years ago.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I shall deal with the point about a uniform harbour board for the Shannon Estuary.  I am not against the innovation and accept the philosophy of Deputy O'Malley.  However, one must also understand that self-help is best help. If the people of the region are not willing to see their future in the context of a unified harbour board it makes it more difficult for the Government to be of assistance to them.  When the three-year review being carried out by the consultants and when the 20-year plan are completed if any suggestions regarding innovations in the area are made we will consider them.  If there is dissension locally it will make it more difficult for moves in that direction.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley suggested that Aer Lingus are to terminate the Chicago-Montreal cargo service.  My information is that SFADCo are not aware of the termination.  Flying Tigers, a cargo airline, have recently commenced a weekly cargo flight from Shannon to the United States.  As regards the Kilkenny Design Workshop, I am not familiar with the details of this but I will make inquiries and contact the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1663" /> As regards Deputy Reynolds's query about the food industry, as former Minister he is aware of the debate which was going on.  There was no conclusion to it but I see the sense of having a single Minister in charge of the food processing industry and will bring this matter to the notice of the Minister.  In relation to the cross-Border study I do not have the information sought by the Deputy.  I will convey his query to the Minister and have him contact the Deputy directly.  Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the environment for industry.  An environment for industry is not created by a Government in six months.  This Government are not in power for six months and cannot be blamed for our adverse industrial climate. I do not wish to be political but nobody on the other side of the House is entitled to blame the Government for our industrial climate.  However, we can deal with that on another day.</P>

    <P>In whatever minutes I have remaining. I will first of all recap on what I said in relation to the school bus charges.  These charges were imposed by the Coalition Government on Christmas Eve 1982 and thereby a precedent was created because charges on school buses had not been made up to then.  The scheme, which was to operate from 1 January 1983, was implemented in an amateurish fashion, creating confusion and chaos all over rural Ireland.  Some parents paid, some did not.  All parents and all pupils were treated with similar disdain.  Leaving certificate pupils due to start examinations on 8 June will not now be able to sit for their examinations because of this ill-considered bungling.  Deputies on both sides of the House are on record as supporting the move to revert to the concept of free education which was introduced and maintained by successive Fianna Fáil Governments.  Are these Deputies saying now that they agree with the Government's decision to leave children at crossroads crying in bewilderment and despair about their future?  For the rest of their lives they will say to the Minister that she blatantly discriminated against them and gave them a lesser <Col N="1665" /> chance in life.  Was it because of her ignorance of the scene in rural Ireland?</P>
    <P>At a meeting in Taghmon, County Wexford, Fine Gael had nice, polite representatives who will not take too kindly to being referred to as Nazis.  The school bus transport scheme was discussed.  On that occasion I myself counselled caution and parents representing many areas of County Wexford, to whom Deputy Avril Doyle last night referred as Nazis, behaved responsibly even though their children were being prevented from attending second level education.  The people of Taghmon in Wexford are fine, decent people.</P>

Sooner or later she must admit that she has made a blunder, and if she does we will forgive her.  Only today I learned of a man coming to the city in the morning. On the way he picked up three children who were hitching a lift to school. Imagine that in this day and age.</P>

      <P>No subject has had more time in this House than the matter of school transport.  This is about my fourth time here debating school transport by way of parliamentary questions, debate on the Adjournment and Private Members' Time.  I have no objection to that but I maintain that many other matters need to be discussed here for which the opportunity has not been given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must accept when we talk about free school transport, free health services and so on, that nothing is free.  Always somebody must pay and this was accepted not alone by this Government but also by the Government whom this Government replaced.  Somebody must pay and that applies to school transport. I want to deal with the motion, but before I do so, because allegations were made <Col N="1667" /> by the two speakers across the way which were serious reflections on the officials of my Department, on myself and on those charged with the administration of the school transport scheme, I want to deal with those serious allegations in case they would go unchallenged without a proper reply to them.  The most serious was presented here last night by Deputy O'Rourke.  It was an allegation that a child with only one arm was put off a bus. I want the House to take note of my reply to that before I deal with the motion itself.  Representations on behalf of this pupil were made by Deputy O'Rourke and she was also the subject of a Dáil question put down by the same Deputy. The position is that exemption from the charges may be allowed in the case of severely handicapped pupils who use school transport.  Where such exemption is claimed it is necessary, however, that medical evidence of the pupil's disability be forwarded to the Department on the official medical form for submission to the Department's medical adviser.  In the case mentioned by the Deputy the necessary form of medical certification was sent to Deputy O'Rourke on 29 April for completion by the child's doctor.  I understand that the completed form has not yet been returned to my Department.  The ordinary certificate does not suffice in these cases.  I assure Deputy O'Rourke that when the completed official form comes to hand the question of waiving transport charges for this child will be considered sympathetically, but I underline that until such time as that certificate is before my Department a decision cannot be taken.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has been informed.  It is possible that the child in question, presumably not having paid the fare and thus not holding a valid ticket, would have been refused transport.  It would have been more helpful if Deputy O'Rourke had acceded to the request in my letter to her of 29 April to have the required medical certification form completed by a doctor and returned to my Department without delay.  I have no <Col N="1668" /> doubt that the matter was urgent but I cannot understand why Deputy O'Rourke did not comply with my request.  I cannot understand why she did not reply to my letter and give that certification. I may be wrong, but it appeared to me that she was waving that certificate here last night.  If it had been with my Department I would have taken action on it.  As the Minister responsible I can say that my officials are considerate and would respond to a case such as that almost immediately.</P>
      <P>Another point made here should be clarified.  Here the allegation was made by Deputy Byrne and mentioned also by Deputy O'Rourke.  The question related to Wexford and other areas and Deputy Byrne was particularly emphatic.  One would get the impression, listening to his charges, that we were highlighting and embarrassing those children whose parents had medical cards and that other children were ridiculing them because their parents had medical cards.  I refute that allegation.  There was no poor law stamp on that ticket to indicate that those children's parents had medical cards.  I emphasise that because that allegation was made here and is completely without foundation.  In other areas the medical card must be produced to act as certification for the services it is presented for, but in this instance there is no necessity to do that because the ticket is exactly the same as that provided for children by CIE even if their parents are millionaires. There is no indication on the ticket to say it is held by children whose parents have medical cards.</P>

      <P>This was a Government decision which was announced on 23 December 1982.  It was made perfectly plain by every means available where each category of post-primary student stood.  Application forms to be filled in by parents were sent out.  The categories and amounts were clearly set out.  The whole process received widespread publicity in the media.  A large majority of parents paid in the Christmas to Easter term.  In the current term, arrangements were notified as follows: on 1 March 1983 <Col N="1670" /> CIE sent out forms to post-primary schools in connection with charges for the summer term.  The deadline for the receipt of charges was 8 April 1983.  On 20 April 1983 notices were placed by CIE in national and local newspapers extending the deadline for payment to 27 April 1983 and warning that transport would not be given to those without validation tickets after 6 May 1983.  On 21 April 1983 there were radio advertisements giving the above message and on 22 April there were more television and radio advertisements giving the same details and warning parents of the situation.  On 27 April 1983 all part-time school bus drivers and school bus contractors got a letter from CIE asking them to give a gentle reminder to those who had not paid.</P>

I appealed and I warned and I had no alternative and I think any fair-minded people in the House will agree with that.  We will have to get on with the vote.</P>

      <P>I was dealing with the issue of tickets and applications for tickets when I was interrupted.  I made a statement that in the applications made prior to 27 April, the tickets issued prior to 6 May.  There may be a few exceptions. I repeat that in almost all cases unless there are extenuating circumstances, and there may be such circumstances in some applications, tickets are issued within a maximum of six days.  I venture to say that the picture I have drawn of information available in regard to the scheme of charges and the procedures to be followed in making payments and submitting medical cards is certainly not one of confusion.  It is a straightforward procedure that has been made clear to all concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was dealing with the subject matter of the motion in which it is implied that the procedure has created chaos and confusion. It was alleged last night that the scheme is not working.  It is hard to know what Deputy O'Rourke meant in her statement that the system does not work. I have explained at length what people <Col N="1679" /> have to do to get school transport.  The majority both in the winter and the summer terms made valid application for their children and established their entitlement to the continued use of school transport.  Those who have been refused admission to school buses are those who have not made the valid application in due time and have not yet got the appropriate validation ticket.  The buses are running and those entitled to use them are being transported to schools.  How then can the Deputy maintain the system is not working?</P>

      <P>In most cases it is because the necessary charges were not paid for them by their parents that they could not avail of the school transport.  What does Deputy O'Rourke want?  Does she want these pupils taken up in the buses without paying and without regard to the unfairness of such an action towards the parents of those who made valid application?  It should be borne in mind that those who have paid have got transport and those who have not paid are not getting transport.</P>

Indeed, were such an action taken, it could then be fairly said by the <Col N="1680" /> Deputy that the scheme is not working. I say the scheme is not working because it is being obstructed by some who are not prepared to pay.  Let me remind Deputy O'Rourke and her colleagues in opposition that the charges are now a fact.  If you do not pay your telephone bill or your ESB bill you are cut off.  If you do not pay your television licence you are prosecuted.  We are not talking about prosecuting anybody.  What we are saying is that if you are qualified for transport&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>There are others who are not so concerned.  Deputy O'Rourke claimed last evening that such a scheme would not have been implemented by Fianna Fáil.  What is it possible to make of such a statement?  What does the Deputy mean when she says it would not be implemented?  We know Fianna Fáil framed and published Estimates which contained a shortfall of £5.4 million for school transport.  We know the Fianna Fáil Minister for Education, Mr. Ger Brady, announced publicly on 18 November there would be charges for school transport and for post-primary pupils with a lower charge for junior pupils and a concession to take account of circumstances of members of large families.  I should note at this stage that in all the discussion and in all the debate here it is quite extraordinary that not once has Deputy Brady appeared to take part in the discussion, to offer a contribution, or give an explanation.  It is very strange.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position here is that the amount we are asking the parents to contribute for school transport is somewhere in the region of £4.4 million.  The provision made, and it was not contradicted by Deputy Brady, in the Book of Estimates, demanded a £5.4 million contribution from the very same parents and now we have all the furore because we accepted £1 million less.  Is the Deputy now saying that Fianna Fáil in office framed Estimates <Col N="1681" /> which they subsequently ignored and announced schemes which they had no intention of implementing?  If that is the case no wonder they lost the confidence of the people in the last general election.  Granted they would not have implemented the present scheme because in their plans they gave no thought to questions of hardship and their proposals contained none of the concessions for the less well-off families which are contained in the Government's scheme.</P>
    <P>The Government through the introduction of such a scheme is asking parents to contribute for school transport a not unreasonable amount.  It is a question of providing and keeping the system in operation because the Government could have taken a decision to keep to the shortfall in the Book of Estimates, which was inherited by the present Government, not created by them, and could have said they would discontinue school transport to the tune of £5.4 million or else impose charges.  That was the decision the Government had.  I supported the Government's introduction of charges and I, as Minister responsible for school transport, will operate the scheme to the best of my ability despite the fact that there is opposition from the Opposition Deputies and there is also, I understand, organised opposition elsewhere to the school transport system.  I would say to those Deputies who are actively organising opposition to the implementation of the school transport scheme that they should think again because what they are doing is, in fact, encouraging people to break the law.  First of all, let them examine their scheme and the provision of £5.4 million.  It is extraordinary that throughout this debate we have had no concrete proposals from them as to how they proposed to collect that £5.4 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke stated that heretofore Irish-speaking schools had positive discrimination in their favour by way of a transport subsidy and that this had now disappeared.  She made <Col N="1682" /> a strong plea for its continuance.  There was and is no such subsidy.  Transport to these schools was formerly free to eligible pupils, as it was to eligible pupils attending schools other than all-Irish schools. The all-Irish schools, in the matter of transport as indeed in relation to grants and staffing, had and still have particular advantages not enjoyed by other schools. People attending such schools are regarded as eligible for transport by virtue of distance to the nearest all-Irish school notwithstanding the proximity of other schools.  There is no discrimination in favour of all-Irish schools in the scheme of transport charges.  The pupils, who are generally carried much longer distances than other pupils, are expected to pay the same charges and benefit from the same concessions as do other pupils. To waive the charges in the case of pupils attending all-Irish schools would be invidious and unfair to the users of that service.  If there were concessions of that type the amount would have to be met elsewhere.</P>
      <P>We heard a lot from Deputy H. Byrne and others in relation to a specific case in Wexford.  In this connection I want to quote from a letter I have received from that particular community in Wexford.  I am sorry, I appear to have mislaid that letter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall conclude because I want to give Deputy Doyle ten minutes. We have heard a lot about Taghmon, about the discrimination against pupils there and the position in relation to the obstruction of the school bus.  I am sure Deputy H. Byrne knows all about the obstruction.  I might read an extract from <Col N="1683" /> a letter I received from the people in Taghmon:</P>
      <P>A small charge should be payable by all parents regardless of their circumstances. The decision to exempt the children of medical card holders was arbitary and not necessarily equitable.</P>
      <P>The people who have paid &mdash; in many cases at very considerable personal sacrifice &mdash; feel duped when they realise that many who could afford it better simply have not paid and are still availing of the service.</P>
      <P>I have no argument with Deputy Byrne or with the good people of Taghmon regarding the latter sentiment.  The only difference is that the Government have taken action to meet this point and this action is now being deplored by Deputy Byrne.  We now know where he stands. He was all talk with no action.  Does he support those people or does he disagree with them?</P>
      <P>With regard to the first point made in the letter, the Government categorically do not agree with the levying of a charge on all parents and will continue to have regard to levels of education and parental circumstances in regard to the school bus charges.  That can be the only equitable approach to take into account the circumstances of parents.</P>
      <P>I want to give ten minutes to Deputy Doyle so I shall conclude&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We are facing, and have faced, a situation in which it is not possible &mdash; because of the economic situation of the country &mdash; to maintain services at the level available in the past without asking for an extra effort from all concerned. It is the view of the Government that the school transport service should, if possible, be maintained at its present level and, in order to do so, they have asked for a contribution towards the running of the service from those who avail themselves of it.  Generous concessions have been made to take account of the circumstances of large families and of families for whom the payment of school transport charges would constitute undue financial hardship.  Those who are withholding and encouraging the withholding of school bus charges must examine their hearts in this matter.  If the contributions are not paid, if the applications are not submitted &mdash; and this is a point I want to issue a warning on &mdash; then it will not be possible to continue the school transport service on its present basis within the resources available.  I would advise parents and those Deputies who support parents to obstruct the school transport service to think again because, unless this contribution is made, it is possible it could jeopardise the whole school transport system in the future.</P>

      <P>I should like to refer to the last point raised by Deputy Browne before he left the House.  As the record of last evening's debate testifies beyond doubt &mdash; and as I believe Deputy Byrne referred to earlier this evening &mdash; what I said last evening was in reply to a remark addressed to me and my colleague, Deputy Yates, by Deputy H.

      <P>I accept your ruling on the matter, Sir, and I am prepared to stand by it.  I accept the Chair's ruling on that completely.</P>
      <P>While we are on this point &mdash; and a lot has been said about it by both sides of the House &mdash; I would point out that parents and children who had paid their tickets for this term were intimidated into getting on the school bus in the last fortnight in Taghmon.  They were called scabs if they got on the bus, and did not stand to the side, and they were called blueshirts. I do not condone this type of behaviour. Any legitimate, democratic protest I will accept, discuss and try to resolve as I would any problem, as I have always done while I have been involved in politics. I abhor any type of activity that would put our children in the frontline when the argument is between politicians and parents in this country.  Our children should be left out of it; the harsh realities of life will come to them soon enough.  I deplore such tactics and anybody who would try to condone them.</P>
      <P>I should like now to get on with the real matter before us.  There were many areas in Wexford with genuine and legitimate problems.  I am afraid Wexford seems to have been prominent in this debate.  I would point out that in Tagoat, Clonroche, Adamstown and Rathangan there were small problems which were resolved satisfactorily by any TD who happened to be in the area and could help.  That will always be the case.  Any genuine problem will be listened to and fairly resolved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I must refer to what Deputy Gerard Brady said last November. The short memory of the Opposition would be amusing if it were not so serious.  He said that consideration was being given to the question of arrangements to be made for the implementation of such a <Col N="1688" /> charge at secondary school level.  He never even mentioned medical card exemptions.  How far down the road this Government have come in being humane and trying to see that those who can least afford the charges will not have to pay them.  There may be problems with just exempting medical card holders but the medical card system ensures, in principle at any rate, that those least able to pay will not have to do so and this Government will stand behind them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt anybody and I hope not to be interrupted again.  The Minister of State, Deputy Creed, is a sound, sane, sensible man. <Col N="1689" /> When he sees so many Deputies coming into this House and making these complaints he should realise that they are not artificial complaints.  I would totally reject the allegation that we on this side are trying to organise obstruction of the operations of the school transport scheme.  There is no need for us to do it.</P>
      <P>I will not talk about what happened in other areas but I will give some examples which I can stand over as factual, having spoken to the parents and children concerned. I will hand the names and addresses of these people to the Minister or his officials if they wish to check them out.  The Minister should not bury his head in the sand and think that everything in the garden is rosy.  Far from it.</P>
      <P>Somebody said that this was a mismanaged, bungled operation.  I could not give it a proper description.  The Minister gave details of dates of applications.  I can give him details of a family, the names of whom I can supply after the debate, who not only sent in their money at Christmas but paid £10 too much.  No ticket was issued for the Christmas to Easter term. They subsequently sent in the money for the Easter to summer term, notwithstanding the fact that they had not received either a ticket or a receipt for the money paid.  Nothing happened for the first term and the children travelled on the bus, as did other children who had not paid.  No attempt was made to sort out the problem, with the result that some people paid and travelled on the bus while children from families who did not pay travelled on the same bus.  By the end of the term no action had been taken, except for U-turns and changes of decision and the Minister knows quite well what I am talking about.  He stood up in this House to answer a debate on the school transport system at the same time as his Minister was outside in the public arena pulling the rug from under him and making a different decision.  Is it any wonder that the management of this whole operation has been bungled when there is no co-operation between the Ministers? That is a fact which cannot be denied denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people who had paid the money <Col N="1690" /> without receiving a ticket or a receipt decided to pay by cheque for the Easter to summer term.  The cheque came back to the parents in the normal way through the bank but again they did not receive a ticket or a receipt.  Last Monday week the child who had been carried into Lanesboro was left there in the rain to find her own way home without having any means to contact her parents, together with almost all the other children who had travelled on the bus.  She was taken to school and left in Lanesboro to find her own way home, yet she had overpaid her money.  Nobody did anything about it.  The following day her father took a day off from work and drove to the relevant office to get a ticket.  He was told there was no trace of the money so he produced the cheque showing that the money had been paid through the bank.  He then paid again but did not get a ticket.  He had to make three trips to get a ticket for which he had already paid twice, having overpaid by £10 in the first instance.  This is a factual case and I can supply the name and address.</P>
    <P>Two buses went into Lanesboro last Monday week and the children were left on the road to find their way home.  One bus passed by with four passengers and the other bus went by another route without any passengers.  The children had to walk home in the rain and no attempt was made to contact their parents. Whoever made this decision is guilty of gross irresponsibility and should resign or be fired.  That is the only answer the parents and children will accept.</P>

What sort of Government would attempt to implement such a scheme and tell us in the House that it is working?  It is not working. When they made decisions, why did they not stick by them?  The pressure came on and they changed their decision.</P>
      <P>In a written reply to a question from Deputy Hugh Byrne the Minister for Education stated that anticipated revenue from additional subscriptions this year would be in the region of £1 million. How was that figure arrived at?  In the very first week that the Government were in power the Minister for Education, the Minister for Labour and the Taoiseach gave a commitment to pay £1 million to the Avoca miners in County Wicklow who are breaking the law and would not allow in a receiver.  They gave that promise during the general election campaign.</P>

      <P>The Government threw away £1 million to a few hundred workers in Avoca Mines who refused to obey the law of the land.  Over there sits the party of law and order.  It was stupid of the Government to implement this decision a few weeks before the end of term.  As the matter had not been sorted out the Government should have let it run for the last two weeks of the term.  People who paid their money in the first term did not get receipts or tickets and they waited to see what would happen.  They saw that people who had not paid in the first term got free transport and this continued for part of the second term.  What were the people who had paid originally supposed to do?  The Government have said that they gave a gentle hint about what would happen but what happened was that children <Col N="1692" /> were left on the roadside after school.  The situation was scandalous. The people who made the decision were irresponsible and uncaring.  In this, as in many other cases, the Government made the wrong decision.  The sensible thing for them to have done was to leave the matter run and to sort it out before next September.</P>
      <P>Parents are well aware of what happened to their children.  I am speaking only of the Longford area and other Deputies can say what happened in their areas.  However, the fact that so many Deputies have spoken on this matter is a clear indication that there is a serious problem that needs to be dealt with.  The whole affair was badly handled.  Children are suffering and they are looking to us for a solution.  The Government should have allowed the matter to run in the same way for the remaining two weeks. They should pay the costs and we will applaud them if they do that.</P>

      <P>9 May will go down in history as a black day for the children of Ireland.  I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate in defence of children in my constituency and in my county.  I am sure that Ministers and Government Deputies who toured Donegal in the past three weeks got the message from parents with regard to the Government's proposals concerning school transport.  The result of the by-election reflected the attitude of the people in Donegal in relation to the Government's handling of the matter.  That should have encouraged the Government to rethink their present attitude but I do not think they have done so.  They will insist on going ahead with something that the people totally reject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1693" /> If the Government and the Minister had any political wisdom they would not have introduced charges for school transport for pupils in second-level education. There is bitter resentment among parents about this matter and this is quite natural. Parental instinct is to move in defence of one's offspring when an injustice has been done against them.  The charges discriminate against rural children irrespective of what the Government may say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of this charge in relation to the way it applies to catchment boundaries will discriminate against some children.  In many instances children have been compelled to go to schools outside their catchment boundaries and this is a matter the Government should consider seriously. Pupils who have to travel outside their catchment boundaries should get the same facilities as those who can stay within their own areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is wrong to use medical cards as a guideline in determining whether a child should have free transport.  A medical card is granted to the holder purely for health purposes for himself and his family.  It should be checked only by the doctor or personnel from the health board.  It is reprehensible and degrading for any family to have to present their medical card to a public transport company. It is wrong that officials from a semi-State body, in this case CIE, should be in a position to examine medical cards <Col N="1694" /> with a view to deciding what charges to impose for transport.  I disagree totally with the use of the medical card as a guideline in determining whether a child should have free school transport.</P>
    <P>Free education was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government and was based on the republican ideal that all children of the nation should be treated equally. Does the Minister consider that the way this scheme has been applied is treating all children equally?  I do not think it is. I ask why children from towns where most of the secondary schools are situated should have free education irrespective of means?  Fianna Fáil are committed to equality in the matter of education but is there equality in the present system? There is none.  There is discrimination against rural children.  This seems to be the policy of the Government.</P>
    <P>The Minister visited County Donegal for the opening of an extension to the Carndonagh Community School, one of the largest community schools in the Republic.  She also opened an extension to Buncrana Vocational School.  Both extensions were provided for and built under the Fianna Fáil Government.  The Minister had the privilege of opening them.</P>
    <P>On the Minister's visit to Donegal she met a deputation from ASTI and the Teachers Union of Ireland who made her aware of the attitude of the teachers and the parents to this particular scheme the Government have introduced.  The following was stated in the document on school transport charges handed to her:</P>
    <P>The introduction of bus charges mocks the principle of free education and their implementation will prove laborious and uneconomic.</P>
    <P>Inishowen is the most northerly point in the country.  The area has a population of approximately 24,000 people.  The only thing they have is a good comprehensive educational system.  It is unfortunate that the Government should penalise the many underprivileged people in that area by depriving them of the right to free education.  The agreement to establishing the community school at Carndonagh <Col N="1695" /> was conditional on the availability of free transport for all.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to reconsider her attitude to this scheme, scrap it, consider the attitude of the parents to the scheme and introduce a new scheme between now and September which will give equality to all the children.  That is all this side of the House are asking for.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to take up the point made by Deputy Conaghan.  The basic philosophy behind the provision of school transport was that the poor man's child would have an equal chance with the wealthier man's child.  This scheme does not do that.  No amount of talking, shouting, propaganda or agitation will disprove my statement.  If you take the catchment area scheme, £150 per annum is a serious imposition on a working man and his family.  Nobody can find a scintilla of evidence in what Fianna Fáil said they would do indicating that the catchment boundary area pupils would be charged anything like £150 per annum.</P>
      <P>Remarks were made on the opposite side of the House that required a degree of audacity which is hard to understand. Nobody for one moment could suggest that Fianna Fáil would impose £150 per annum on any working man to take his children to school.  The Minister's statement last night shows she has not the remotest clue what the conditions are in rural Ireland regarding transport to schools.  It is so cosy, it is so bourgeois, it is unbelievable.  She said they chose to go to school outside the area in which they live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Conaghan has already pointed out some instances where this is not true. I know it is not true.  Some areas started sending children to a school where there was a post-intermediate certificate course available when no such course was available in their catchment area.  People are <Col N="1696" /> being penalised to the extent of £150 per annum because there was not a senior cycle available in their area when this scheme started.</P>
    <P>We are told there is no hardship or confusion.  My opinion is that there is hardship.  The whole scheme has caused chaos because of indecision; the name of the foal is hardship.  Hardship is being experienced up and down the country and in my county.  It is being experienced in County Clare, as Deputy Daly could tell if he had time, in County Donegal in the area Deputy Conaghan spoke about, and in the area we were operating in for the by-election.</P>

      <P>Longford and Westmeath have been very well documented already. There is, without a doubt, the poor law syndrome operating here.  If Oliver asks for one more term free transport to school he is subjected to this examination. The medical card holders are identified. I will tell the House where.  The Ceann Comhairle knows where I am talking about.  There is a comprehensive school in Cootehill and one bus went to that school with 12 people out of 45 when this scheme began to operate.  Will the Minister tell me that those people were not picked out, that the finger was not pointed at them, that we were not back to the old poor law system where there was one law for the rich and another for the poor?</P>
      <P>One of the most confusing things that has happened is that pupils whose parents did not pay for the second term but paid for the third term were given transport to school.  When the people who paid for the second term saw this and that they were being discriminated against, they no longer paid any money.  They found they could not get on to the bus.  The Minister referred to this in her speech but she did not resolve the problem.  How could one expect a man to pay a second time when he knew his neighbour had got away without paying for the second term immediately after Christmas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1697" /> Is that indecision?  Is that clear administration? What is it?  We are told there is no trouble, there is no confusion, that everything is all right.  Everything is not all right.  This House knows it and I am sure, everybody, apart from the nucleus of people based in Dublin 4, who have not the remotest idea what happens once you go west of the Castleknock gate, knows it.  The rest of the country knows it and so do the rural Deputies of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    <P>The examinations were mentioned. They are only round the corner.  Some people are very robust and can take examinations in their stride.  Some are sensitive and cannot take examinations in their stride.  Pushing them off a bus, causing them confusion at this time shows a hard-hearted approach that should not be found in a Department as sensitive as the Department of Education.</P>
    <P>I submit that the Minister is culpable. I know the Minister of State is not responsible in this regard, that the Minister goes her own way.  I know, for example, she changed the scheme while he was defending the old scheme in the House.  The poor man escaped out of here with a face as red as a beetroot.  I do not blame him but he has manfully tried to remain loyal to her.  I do not know how he could in the circumstances.</P>
    <P>Let the Minister, for God's sake, have another look at the catchment area problem, let her try to realise that £150 per annum is too great an imposition on a working man just because he is sending his children to a certain school and has established that tradition.  In her speech the Minister shows a complete ignorance of what is happening in schools in rural Ireland.  The father of two haemophiliacs in Cavan town was in touch with me and was more than upset because one of his children had to be taken to hospital in Dublin as a result of what was done on the side of the road due to the hamfisted way in which this scheme was put into operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>We appear to be in calmer waters but they are just as troubled in another way.  I have never spoken on an Adjournment debate before but I will not take 20 minutes to say what I have to.  There is a firm in Athlone called CMI which was previously called Gulf and Western.  There were great hopes for the firm when it started.  CMI is a subsidiary of a very large American company with its home base in Oklahoma.  Hopes were further raised when they announced their plans to go ahead in Athlone and said they hoped to increase the work force.</P>
      <P>The work force in CMI has steadily diminished since last autumn and there are now approximately 54 people employed.  This company make gear cutting equipment and one of the main reasons for the proposed closure is that stock is piled up in America and has remained so due to the oil glut on the international market.  The stock-piling is in Oklahoma and it will take 18 months to clear.  As a result, the Athlone plant is to reduce its work force to about six employees.  The fears of the work force are very real.  I met them, the managing director and representatives of the staff associations and unions in the factory. They are, as the Minister will understand, in common with other workers who face unemployment bewildered and troubled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The workers have a strong sense of purpose.  I know they met the Minister recently and were very pleased with his kind reception of them.  They found him very well briefed and aware of what was happening.  They have the most up-to-date equipment and machinery in the world for this operation.  They have the skills needed.  They have put it to me and to the Minister that they are available to do subcontracting work.  There are markets available for this product but they must be identified.  The workers cannot go out and seek markets but they believe they have a good product.  If they could get subcontracting work to tide them over the 18 months it is estimated will clear <Col N="1699" /> the Oklahoma pile up, CMI would then be able to use the machinery and the work force could perhaps be expanded so that what started out as a disaster could become a productive plant.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is as eager to help as I am and that he is fully aware of the position.  I was born and bred in Athlone. It is an area which has a long tradition of factory work.  My father was managing director for a number of years of General Textiles Limited.  We lived over the shop so to speak.  We grew up in an industrial atmosphere.  In its day this cotton industry employed over 980 people.  It was the mainstay of the industrial life of the town.  However, with the advent of new fibres, particularly synthetics, the factory employed fewer people until now only a few remain.  Athlone got replacement industries which are good employers but in the last few months there has been a decline.  We had the near disaster of Athlone Apparel which at present is just about there.  This shock and the shock of CMI have sent great waves of disquiet through the town.  We are reminded of the bad old days when Gentex deployed its work force and practically had to close its doors.  As one who grew up in the industrial scene I want to see the jobs stay in Athlone.</P>
    <P>The work force of the factory are highly skilled.  As I said, they are utterly bewildered particularly some Scottish workers who were only recruited in the last few months and told that their future was bright.  It may sound naive to the Minister but the workers think CMI can be viable in the short term if they get subcontracting work.  They want the Minister to liaise with other agencies who can go out and find markets for their products.  They have been told by the managerial staff that the long-term prognosis for CMI when the Oklahoma pile up disappears is good.  However, in the meantime the factory will close and only a skeleton staff of five or six people will be kept for a few months.</P>
    <P>I tried to raise this matter by way of Private Notice Question yesterday but it was judged not to be so urgent.  Tonight was the best occasion on which to raise it <Col N="1700" /> because there are still two weeks of reprieve for this factory.  I ask the Minister to please do what he can.  They are a highly trained and skilled work force. It is a very modern plant and kept in an immaculate state.  Most of the work force are young and have families.  They have settled in and around Athlone and many of them have mortgages.  We have an industrial work ethic in Athlone.  I ask the Minister to please try to do everything he can in the fortnight which is left.  Athlone is depending not alone on the retention of what is already in CMI but ultimately on the growth promised for this factory.  They have been told that £5 million of special investment was put into the plant and machinery in CMI to enable the company to have, as they have, the most advanced machinery and most highly skilled work force possible.  I will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say.  The staff and the unions were glad to meet him recently and I hope that his interest in this industry has been maintained.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to add my voice in support of Deputy O'Rourke in asking the Minister to do all he can and to call on all the agencies at his disposal in an effort to put something together in a rescue bid for CMI.  I was at the opening of that plant, which I believe is one of the finest engineering plants set up in this country, and it was said at the time that it had the most modern engineering machinery ever to be installed in any factory here.  Hopes for it were high at the time and I remember banner headlines in the papers about Deputy Keating &mdash; who was Minister of State at the time &mdash; saying that this was the big one for Athlone.  Gulf and Western came in originally with heavy investment and an international name.  The Minister and everybody knows that when you project an employment target for a company like that within the overall plan of the IDA for a region like Athlone, the town is reckoned to be well catered for.  As we all know, it did not turn out as everybody expected despite the attraction of Gulf and Western at the time.  Subsequently they went and they were taken over by CMI who held out hopes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1701" /> We must be realistic and recognise the downturn in the type of activity that is part and parcel of that company's operations. Perhaps the Minister will have more information available to him than we would have as to the real problems of CMI.  Is it a question of lack of orders?  Is it, as in some other American corporations, excess capacity elsewhere and the international subsidiary offshoot must pay the price for it?  The Minister might be able to enlighten us.  Is it a question of a financial position?  I am not aware that it is.  Perhaps the Minister can say if any application was made to Fóir Teoranta, the rescue agency, to come to their help in the short term.  Nobody would disagree with the notion that there will be a market for engineering products when the upturn in the economy comes about and that the products, of that plant will be on demand, whether they be the type of products that have been made there or a new range of products.  Maybe the market for their products has taken a very serious downturn and perhaps the Minister's agencies in looking at the situation will see serious overstocking.  Whether that was in anticipation of orders to be received or bad management &mdash; as happens many times in Irish industry &mdash; I do not know.  Maybe it is not a major problem.  Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Rourke, I would like to see the situation there maintained because the plant has a contribution to make to the overall economy here, particularly to the midlands and to Athlone. The skills that have been developed there should not be scattered to the four winds or wasted.  Perhaps there is an area here for a joint venture with somebody else to ensure that that fine plant is not allowed to close and that the skills in which a big investment was made are not wasted.  The families involved face social and economic problems when they get notice that within a couple of weeks they will be out of a job.  Unfortunately that is an everyday occurrence in Ireland at the moment.  We in this House and the Minister with responsibility in this area should be seen to spare no effort whatsoever in trying to put a rescue package together, whether by a joint venture, <Col N="1702" /> financial aid or whatever it is, to keep that fine engineering works in operation. We will need it in future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment and for giving me an opportunity of stating the position as I see it.  Like the Deputies, I would like to express my disappointment at the recent announcement by this company of their intention to halt manufacturing operations in Athlone for the moment and to effect a moth-balling situation.  My disappointment is all the more keen because of the promise which the establishment of the firm held for Athlone at the beginning of 1982 and for the creation of a substantial number of high quality and much-needed jobs in Athlone.</P>
      <P>I know that the disappointment is shared by the promoting company, the CMI Corporation of the United States, who have been forced by unforeseen circumstances into taking this decision.  Like many other firms engaged directly or indirectly in the oil exploration business, the CMI Corporation have been seriously affected by the dramatic and unforeseen decline in the number of oil rigs being used.  This decline has been brought about by the reduction in oil supplies worldwide.  Some indication of the size of this decline can be seen from the fact that in December 1981 when CMI were about to be established, the number of oil rigs in operation in the US was estimated at an all-time high of 4,600 and at that time projections were for even a greater number of oil rigs to be in operation.  The fall in oil prices then occurred and by December 1982 the number of US oil rigs in operation had fallen dramatically to 1,900.  Some analysts of the industry are forecasting that this could drop even further in 1983 if oil prices remain soft.  That will give an indication of the demand for the company's product, which has also fallen dramatically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The inevitable consequence of the fall in the number of oil rigs in operation has caused serious problems for the oil rig equipment component manufacturers such as the CMI Corporation of the <Col N="1703" /> United States who have experienced a loss of $19.8 million in 1982 and who in the same year have had a reduction in their US work force of some 50 per cent, from 2,200 to around 1,100.  The experience in Oklahoma of the parent CMI company is fairly representative of that of similar companies in that state. As a result of this fall in the number of oil rigs stocks of components have built up until in the case of the CMI Corporation the parent company stocked at least 12 months' supply at present levels of demand, perhaps even more.  It is this development which is at the nub of the present difficulties of CMI Athlone and which have resulted in the short-term working and early redundancies in the company which began in September last year.  However, the substantial investment in equipment at Athlone which has been made by CMI, and their recent announcement that they intend retaining some workers to safeguard and maintain the plant so that it will be available for reopening at a later date, represents a very positive indication of the commitment of the United States company to the plant in Athlone.  We all share their optimism that it will have a long-term future as soon as the world economy picks up.</P>
    <P>One of the disappointing aspects of the latest development is that the engineering workshop facilities at CMI, Athlone, are probably second to none.  It had been hoped that the establishment of a company and the project would provide a basis for a further development of our mechanical engineering industry.  This is one of the developments which the Telesis report is very anxious to see here. I hope and believe that this can still be achieved and I should like to assure the House that no effort will be spared by the relevant State agencies, such as the Industrial Development Authority or my Department, in seeking a solution to the company's problems.</P>
    <P>One such solution would be the availability of sufficient suitable subcontract work.  This is a possibility which has been and will continue to be explored by the Industrial Development Authority and <Col N="1704" /> by Córas Tráchtála who, working with the IDA and local management, will examine the possibility of subcontract work abroad as well as seeking subcontract work at home.  However, the specialised nature of much of the equipment at CMI, and the high level of orders which would be necessary to maintain a viable level of production at the plant, makes the securing of subcontract work a difficult proposition.  Based on inquiries to date, there does not seem to be a great possibility of securing a high level of suitable subcontract work from Irish firms, but there is a faint possibility, which the IDA will continue to explore.  I have asked them to maintain the closest liaison possible with the work force and the company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cooney consulted with representatives of the company last week and has also met IDA officials recently.  He has asked them to set up a task force to seek and gain subcontract work for the company.  He has taken a personal interest in this matter and has discussed it with me.  The Deputies can be assured that we are very anxious that this company will stay open.  While we have to understand the parent company's position, which is primarily a matter of finance, we must understand that the demand for the product is not there at present because of over-stocking in America.</P>
    <P>In reply to Deputy Reynolds, the company have approached Fóir Teoranta with regard to a loan and I am sure that when finances are considered by the board of Fóir Teoranta the company will be given a sympathetic hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand they have. The high stock level in America and the fact that they have lost $19 million constrains the American company also to a large degree.  We have a difficult situation but I feel it will be resolved as soon as oil exploration and the world economy pick up.  We will use our best endeavours to win some subcontract work for the company, but it is not going to be easy because of the complex nature of the <Col N="1705" /> plant.  However, all the resources of the IDA and Córas Tráchtála will be used in an effort to get subcontract work for the plant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the sentiments of Deputy O'Rourke and I acknowledge that Athlone in recent times has diversified.  It used to be deeply dependent on textiles but in recent years <Col N="1706" /> it has expanded its industries.  I cannot give any guarantees but I will use my personal best endeavours and those of the IDA and Córas Tráchtála to seek subcontract work.  With regard to the long term future of the plant, the fact that the company are mothballing, rather than closing the company or putting it into receivership, is a positive indication that they want the plant.  Obviously, they have invested a lot of money in it and as soon as oil exploration picks up they will again use the plant.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is employed for two days each week as a mart worker and exhausted his title to unemployment benefit on 29 October 1982 when he received 390 days of benefit. He will not requalify for benefit until he obtains a further 13 weeks of insurable employment with contributions paid at a class which provide cover against unemployment.</P>
      <P>He claimed unemployment assistance and following an investigation of his case means were assessed at £12.50 weekly derived from the value of his land.  He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £45.45 being the maximum rate payable to him £57.95 less £12.50.  All arrears of unemployment assistance due in respect of four days of unemployment each week were paid to him on 24 March 1983.  Further payments at the daily rate of £7.58 continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>Arising from the provisions of the Social Welfare Act, 1983, the amount of pay-related benefit was reduced to £12.87 per week from 4 April 1983 and his overall payment is now £65.02 per week.

      <P>The person concerned claimed old age contributory pension in November 1982.  Since he will not reach pension age until January 1984 his claim was treated as a claim for retirement pension.</P>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of retirement pension in the case of the person concerned is that he must have a yearly average of at least 24 contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1962 contribution year, the year he entered into insurance, to 5 April 1982. His total of 443 contributions in this period gives him a yearly average of 22. He does not therefore qualify for retirement pension.</P>
      <P>The decision that he does not qualify for retirement pension has been upheld by an appeals officer whose decision in the matter is final, unless new evidence which was not previously available comes to light.</P>
      <P>When he reaches 66 years of age the person concerned will, however, qualify for old age contributory pension for which the minimum yearly average is 20 contributions.  He is advised therefore to submit a claim for this pension at the end of October 1983.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the Deputy's earlier allegations against the Taoiseach, may I make it quite clear that when I say &ldquo;a Department of Justice copy&rdquo; I mean that the originating documents in both cases were not documents that were submitted to me, not to mention the Taoiseach, but were to be retained in the custody of departmental officials.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1581" /> The initial investigation was carried out within the Department on the basis that such an investigation would maximise the likelihood that there would be an admission or other statement that would show where the problem lay.  I wish to make it quite clear that this was an entirely proper procedure that was adopted after consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions.</P>
    <P>It was not successful in finding an answer but it has nevertheless been useful and has served to clear the way for further inquiries that are now to be carried out by the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 505 and 506 together.  Estimated receipts from Bord Gáis Éireann in 1983 in respect of surplus profits to be surrendered under section 11 (2) of the Gas Act, 1976 are £63 million.  A further payment will arise in respect of corporation tax on 1982 profits, the amount of this payment will be settled in the normal way.</P>
      <P>The increase in natural gas prices to the ESB effective from 1 April 1983 will result in estimated extra Exchequer receipts from BGE of about £29.8 million in 1983.  No estimate is available in respect of 1984 because the Government decision referred to was specific to the current year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department were not directly involved in uranium exploration in County Donegal, but facilitated prospecting for uranium in the county by exploration companies, through the issue to them of minerals prospecting licences. This activity was funded by the private interests themselves aided, in the case of three companies, by the European Economic <Col N="1584" /> Community under Article 70 of the Euratom Treaty.</P>
      <P>There has been no active exploration for uranium since 1981 and I understand that there is little prospect of such activity being resumed in the foreseeable future. If it were to resume it would be funded by exploration companies aided, possibly, by the Community.</P>

In reply to the second part of the Deputy's question, as Minister for Finance I have overall responsibility for the co-ordination of economic and social planning with respect to the different regions of the country and the Western Development Fund is also my responsibility. Furthermore, there is a regional dimension to the policies and operational activities of most Government departments. This is particularly so in the case of the Department of Industry and Energy (in regard to its responsibilities for industrial policy and the promotion of industrial employment), the Department of the Environment (in relation to physical planning and the provision of infrastructure) and the Department of the Gaeltacht.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated in the course of the interview referred to by the Deputy that the interest rates of the Associated Banks are determined with reference to the interbank market and that the rates in this market move in response to the supply of and demand for funds.</P>
      <P>Since the EMS realignment there has been a reflow of foreign exchange which has contributed to some easing of domestic liquidity conditions and, accordingly, to a fall in interbank and Associated Bank interest rates.  The prime lending rate of the Associated Banks fell by 1½ percentage points from the close of business on 20 April from 16¾ per cent to 15¼ per cent, more than halfway back to the former rate of 14 per cent which applied prior to 18 March.  However, the foreign exchange outflows prior to the realignment have yet to be fully reversed, so that there are continued pressures on domestic liquidity and interest rates.  To date there has not been sufficient scope for a further reduction in Associated Bank interest rates.</P>

      <P>The provisions of the Arterial Drainage Act, <Col N="1591" /> 1945, require that the Commissioners of Public Works issue demands on the relevant county councils based on the next succeeding year's estimate of cost of maintenance of arterial drainage projects, adjusted by the difference between the estimated and actual cost in the preceding year.  Last year the commissioners were instructed to recover from the councils amounts less than had already been demanded.  The maintenance programme undertaken by the commissioners was accordingly reduced.  The demands in respect of the current year reflected the volume of maintenance requirements in 1983 following the reduction in the 1982 programme and, in the case of Galway County Council, represented an increase on the revised 1982 demand approximating to that mentioned by the Deputy.  The 1983 programme of maintenance and its estimated cost are at present under review.</P>

The person concerned is at present receiving unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £14.45 being the maximum rate in his case £43.95 less weekly means of £29.50, derived from his wife's earnings. He has applied for a re-assessment of his means and his case has been referred to a social welfare officer for investigation.  His entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the social welfare officer's report.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 14 December 1982 but her application was disallowed on the grounds that she had failed to show that her means did not exceed the statutory limit in her case of £2,350.40.  She appealed against the disallowance and her case was sent to a social welfare officer for further inquiries before being referred to an appeals officer for determination.  The social welfare officer made numerous calls to the applicant's address but has not so far been able to contact her.  As soon as the inquiries have been completed the papers will be referred to an appeals officer and entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of his decision.</P>

      <P>The means of the person concerned derived from farming were assessed at £30.75 a week.  As this exceeds the maximum single rate of unemployment assistance payable in his case, £25.45, he is not qualified to receive payment.  He has appealed against the amount of means assessed and his case has been referred back to the social welfare officer for review before being sent to an appeals officer for determination. His entitlement will be considered in the light of the appeals officer's decision.</P>

      <P>Under Government decisions taken in connection with the 1982 Estimates local authorities' annual contributions to expenditure by health boards on supplementary welfare allowances may no longer increase at a rate greater than the increases in income allowed to those authorities by the Minister for the Environment. The total amount payable in 1982 was accordingly limited to £11.55 million, an increase of 18 per cent over that in the previous year, corresponding to the increase in rates income with an allowance for buoyancy.  With regard to 1983, the matter is still under consideration and final decisions have not therefore yet been taken.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for financing in this area have proved unsatisfactory and they are being reviewed with a view to devising more satisfactory arrangements for the future.</P>

    <P>In 1982 the increase sought in these contributions was 5 per cent as compared with the increase of 12 per cent in rates, as was permitted by the Department of the Environment.
