      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  The last reported increase in Soviet military activity in Afghanistan took place in April and May of this year with the severe bombing and shelling of the city of Herat and of the Shomali region.  My information is that there were between 3,000 and 6,000 casualties as a result of this Soviet action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government issued any public statement of condemnation of that activity?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's position in relation to the conflict generally was set out by the Minister in the course of his address to the UN General Assembly on 3 October.  He indicated that a political settlement to that conflict was desirable, based on UN resolutions.  Of course our attitude to the infringements of the rights of the Afghans is well known.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>My question asked <Col N="460" /> whether representations have been made to the Soviet authorities in regard to those incidents but the Minister has not replied to that.  Have any representations been made to the Soviet authorities in regard to the escalation and the massacre of between 3,000 and 6,000 people?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should point out to the Deputy that the events in question took place last April and May.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any information that any individual representations have been made by the Government, but representations were made through the Presidency of the EEC.  Generally in matters of this kind Community action is what we regard as most appropriate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the progress that was made at the meeting of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe held in Strasbourg on 28 April 1983 in the humanitarian sector of the Helsinki Final Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>At their 72nd Session, on 28 April 1983 at Strasbourg, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe discussed, among other things, the Madrid Follow-up Meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, The Committee of Ministers were agreed in stressing the importance of reaching a successful conclusion of the Madrid meeting as soon as possible on the basis of a balanced and substantial document which would provide, among other things, for substantial progress in areas covered by the humanitarian sector of the Helsinki Final Act.  These views were reflected in the communiqué of the Strasbourg meeting, a copy of which is to be found in the Dáil Library.</P>
      <P>The Madrid Follow-up Meeting of the CSCE concluded on 9 September last.  It is the view of the Government, and that of the Governments of the other member states of the European Community, that the Concluding Document of the Madrid Follow-up Meeting is both substantial and balanced.  I have arranged to have copies of the Concluding Document placed in the Dáil Library.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In a general review of the state of East-West relations the Foreign Ministers of the Council of Europe discussed the situation in Afghanistan.

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the functions military attachés in foreign embassies in Ireland fulfil; and if he is satisfied that the activities of these attachés is consistent with Ireland's policy of neutrality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have indicated in my written reply yesterday to the Deputy's Question No. 253, two foreign embassies in Dublin have resident military attachés on their staffs.  The attachés represent their countries in accordance with normal diplomatic practice, particularly with regard to maintaining liaison with the Irish Defence Forces and attendance at military ceremonial occasions as these arise.</P>
      <P>In answer to the second part of the Deputy's question, I am satisfied that the activities of these attachés are consistent with the purpose of their presence here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As the two countries which have military attachés attached to diplomatic staffs are both members of the NATO alliance, could the Minister indicate what kind of liaison is involved between Great Britain and the United States with the Irish Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject any implication that there is any significance in the fact that these two attachés are from countries which are in NATO.  I understand that attachés from these countries were present in this country long before NATO came into being.  There are numerous small ways in which they can be of assistance in maintaining liaison.  Traditionally, members of the Defence Forces have gone on courses of training in different countries, including the two countries which have attachés here and the presence of the attachés has helped to simplify the making of arrangements for our personnel going on these courses. There is nothing sinister or significant in their presence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will recall that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was out of the country at the time this major diplomatic offensive took place.  He was in Japan, as I recall.  Does that mean that the Minister for Foreign Affairs was not aware that the expulsion of these diplomats was about to take place or was it a hasty and sudden decision taken while he was away?  Did the Minister for Foreign Affairs consider that the security of the State was endangered from whatever activities were taking place or was it the security of some other State?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>While appreciating the Deputy's sensitivity with regard to the people who were expelled, I think it is an exaggeration to describe this as a political offensive.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was fully aware of what was involved and the Minister of State at that Department took charge of the matter in his absence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say, in regard to the implication in Deputy Mac Giolla's second last question, that different considerations would arise &mdash; and much more venial ones &mdash; had it been another country's security which was being imperilled by these diplomatic activities rather than our own, whether it would make any difference in the eyes of his Department that an ordinary diplomat should be imperilling anybody's security here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that other people attached to embassies accredited to Dublin are not involved in unacceptable activities that would undermine the Government's confidence in them or involved in the intelligence activities of other diplomatic sources in Dublin?  Is he aware of suggestions that MI5 and MI6 are involved in espionage here?  Does he feel that the British Embassy may have something to do with this?</P>

In so far as this transit involves the use of foreign military aircraft, permission has to be sought in each case from my Department, who consult with the Departments of Transport, Defence and Justice in each case.  Requests for foreign military overflights and landings are considered in the light of long-standing procedures and criteria applied by successive Irish Governments.  These criteria include:</P>
      <P>&mdash; that clearance should be consistent with the Government's foreign policy as expressed in Dáil Éireann, in the United Nations and elsewhere;</P>
      <P>&mdash; that the overflight or military landing must not be an integral part of training manoeuvres by foreign military aircraft; likewise, clearance is not granted where a troop-carrying aircraft is en route to military exercises;</P>
      <P>&mdash; that clearance be in no way prejudicial to the security or safety of the State.</P>
      <P>While the clearance of commercial aircraft is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport, these same criteria apply in the case of commercial aircraft in military service.  I am satisfied that in all such cases considered by my Department, these criteria were met.  The granting of requests for such overflights or landings in accordance with these procedures and criteria has no implications for Ireland's neutrality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The application for permission has to contain a declaration to that effect and the authorities have to be satisfied having regard to the bonafides of the people making these applications that the criteria are being met.  It would not be physically possible to search every plane carrying a military person from tail to tip to ensure that there were no armaments aboard.  I am not aware that there are any instances in which armaments have been discovered or that there has been any suggestion that armaments have been carried.  This practice has been going on for a long time without any complaints or abuses and the people making the applications are bona fide and responsible people and we have to rely on that, as well as on our own procedures.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of public concern on the matter, the Government have made or plan to make any representations to the United States concerning the proposal to site Cruise and Pershing missiles in Europe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The parties to the Geneva negotiations on intermediate-range nuclear forces (INF) and strategic, or intercontinental-range, nuclear forces (START) have been made aware of the Government's concern that these negotiations should succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a general debate statement at the United Nations on 3 October, I said that we shared the concern of the UN Secretary-General at the failure so far to achieve substantial progress in the bilateral negotiations at Geneva, and I emphasised the need for renewed determination on the part of both sides to <Col N="471" /> move these talks forward.  In pointing to the need for early progress in the START and INF negotiations, I added that reductions in strategic and intermediate-range nuclear weapons are clearly indispensable, and I expressed my belief that the success of these negotiations would also have a positive impact on other arms control and disarmament negotiations in which there has been scant progress in recent years.  I shall be glad to make a copy of my UN statement available to the Deputy.</P>
    <P>The Government's concern about the growth in nuclear forces, including intermediate-range systems, is not of course confined to the weapons of one military alliance.  The Minister of State at my Department, in a speech at the Tipperary Festival of Peace on 5 September, referred to the hundreds of SS-20 missiles which, beginning in the mid-seventies, have been targeted on Western Europe by the Soviet Union, when he said: &ldquo;... The quest for nuclear superiority is a dangerous illusion... and at the regional level the introduction in recent years of new missiles which in turn has evoked a perceived need to match these deployments presents great dangers for peace and reconciliation &mdash; in a word&mdash;for <i>détente</i> in Europe&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not accept that the siting of Pershing and Cruise missiles in Western Europe would be an escalation of the arms race and nuclear missiles?  For that reason, does he consider that it upsets the equilibrium which exists at present and to which the Minister referred in his speech on the Estimates before the recess?  Would he make representations to the USA urging them not to site these missiles in Western Europe?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations concerning the entire area of arms limitation are proceeding and, in that sense, the Deputy's question is hypothetical.  Of course any increase in the nuclear forces now deployed in Europe would be a matter for concern and the Government hope that the parties to the Geneva negotiations <Col N="472" />&mdash; and there are two sides to those negotiations &mdash; will show the necessary determination to make these negotiations succeed.  In that regard it was distressing to learn in recent statements from President Andropov that there are unhelpful developments taking place in the other alliance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are opposed to any escalation of the stock of nuclear weapons and we have made this clear but we are not party to the negotiations.

Is the Minister aware that in the last week millions of Europeans have been demonstrating against the deployment of Pershing, Cruise and SS-20s?  Will the Minister accept that this is not simply a matter of East or West; it is a question of the survival of Europe and whether Europe will face yet again another war?  The super powers have honed in once again on Europe, threatening that Continent's stability and peace.

      <P>Without wishing to avoid the implication of the Deputy's question I must point out that that is a matter for the Minister for Transport.  As far as the Department of Foreign Affairs are concerned Aer Lingus are the contractors and have the obligation to collect and deliver routine diplomatic correspondence. Aer Lingus are the concern primarily responsible to the Department.  It is a matter for Aer Lingus as to how they carry out their contract.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the deteriorating situation in Chile and the increasing number of deaths at the hands of the military regime, the Government will consider the introduction of selective trade sanctions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government are concerned at the continuing denial of democratic freedoms to the Chilean people, and at the abuses of human rights which occur in that country.  We regularly discuss the situation in Chile with out nine partners in the framework of European Political Co-operation, and have joined with them in public expressions of concern <Col N="478" /> at that situation and at particular instances of government repression.  We have also supported consistently at the United Nations resolutions concerning human rights in Chile.  The Deputy will understand that trade sanctions, if they are to be effective, require to be applied in a concerted way by the international community.  The application of such sanctions by one country, particularly a small country like Ireland, on its own would have no effect on those whom it was desired to influence.  I see no evidence, just at present, that the international community is prepared to impose trade sanctions on Chile.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister has said, the question of adopting trade sanctions on our own would have very little effect on the situation in Chile.  However, can he indicate that this country is raising the matter of trade sanctions with our EEC partners?  If we have not done so already, will the Minister state he will raise the matter with our EEC partners?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">

      <P>I can tell the Deputy that the possibility of such sanctions has been raised in discussions among the Ten but a decision to impose them has not been taken.  Such sanctions to be effective would require a wider international consensus than just from the Ten.  On the matter of whether we would join in such a consensus if it emerged, that would be a hypothetical situation but I would find it difficult to imagine we would not.</P>

He complained of symptoms that appeared to indicate indigestion and was given tablets for indigestion.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept there is concern regarding the use of informers.  The danger of uncorroborated evidence is a well-known feature and obviously trials that are based on the uncorroborated evidence of accomplices have to be looked at with great care and caution.  I am aware that there are many people in the other jurisdiction equally concerned about this method of criminal proceedings.  On the other hand, governments traditionally have paid for information as long as governments have been in power.  Successive Governments here have used information in criminal trials &mdash; not in the same way, I might add.  The procuring of information through payment is not new in police investigative proceedings. Nevertheless, because of the circumstances surrounding the use of that information in Northern Ireland, the procedures give rise to some apprehension regarding the whole aspect of criminal jurispruduce involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be a matter for the trial court.  It is not something to which I could give an omnibus answer. One of the things that would assist the trial court in deciding whether to disregard such evidence totally would be whether the people against whom it was given were prepared to give evidence to controvert it.  From my recollection of <Col N="482" /> newspaper reports of these trials, I am not aware that the defendants were prepared to controvert the evidence.  I offer this only as a hypothesis, but that may have been a factor that weighed with the courts in deciding to accept the evidence. There have also been instances where the courts have refused to accept the evidence on the grounds that they regarded it as unsafe.  As a general rule, it is evidence that has to be approached with great caution.</P>

      <P>I do not have any information which would suggest to me that if the Government were to arrange for electricity costs for Clondalkin to be reduced, that would necessarily mean that this project would become viable. Such a course of action would, of course, raise the question of precedent in that if one were to reduce electricity prices for one industrial consumer one would have other consumers, for whom electricity is just as large a proportion of their costs, <Col N="486" /> making similar requests.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that the creation of precedents of such a kind are very dangerous indeed.  However, as he is aware, my ambition is to secure a long-term reduction in electricity prices generally and I have taken a number of steps in that direction.  As far as the Congress of Trade Unions is concerned I am aware of the statement that was made.  The commitment given by the Government in this regard to the congress &mdash; I am speaking now of the present Government &mdash; was solely to the purchase of the assets of Clondalkin Paper Mills.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister telling us now that Clondalkin Paper Mills is bought, paid for by the Government and closed down on a permanent basis?  When he says there are no proposals for reopening Clondalkin Paper Mills on a viable basis, does he mean that other private firms have not come forward with such proposals?  Has there been any proposal by the Government or the IDA for reopening the mills with the work force who are available and waiting to work in the mills?  Has any proposal been put before the Minister?  There have been suggestions of a figure of £8 million or £12 million being required over X number of years.  Was this in relation to a specific proposal for reopening the mills? Could the Minister compare whatever the particular figure was with the figure which would be paid out over a similar number of years by the Government to the unemployed workers, added to the lack of revenue to the Exchequer from those workers if they were employed, and give us some indication of what the difference would be?  Does the Minister realise now the total lack of credibility which the Government now have particularly from the organised work force in the country, the workers in Clondalkin and the public in general?</P>

      <P>I am glad Deputy Mac Giolla asked all those questions and I will endeavour to answer them.  A very great effort was made by the IDA to obtain a viable project for the mills.  They circularised, or in some way contacted, approximately 120 firms throughout the world who had an involvement in papermaking. Out of this very extensive trawl, only one active, apparently viable project emerged.  That was examined in detail by the Industrial Development Authority over the summer.  To ensure that they examined it properly and took a very correct and informed decision on it, they commissioned international consultants, the Boston Consultancy Group, which had previously examined the situation with regard to the Clondalkin Paper Mills, to examine this new proposal.  On foot of the most recent report of this consultancy group, the Industrial Development Authority decided against giving grant assistance in this case on the ground that there was only approximately a 20 per cent chance of this being viable &mdash; in other words, an 80 per cent likelihood of it not being viable.  The House might be interested to know what had changed in the meantime.  Between the two reports from the Boston Consultancy Group there had been a substantial deterioration in the world paper market.  In real terms, the price fell by approximately 35 per cent over that period.  There has also been a much higher level of integration of paper making in Europe and a number of rationalisation schemes in Europe&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We contacted 120 firms world wide, arranged for three site visits and carried out a detailed consultancy study on the only serious proposal which emerged and we continue to make whatever efforts are available to us to have the mills opened on the basis of any proposals which may be received.  Indeed, if any Member of the House has knowledge of private companies interested in becoming involved in this, I can assure the House that I shall ask the Industrial Development Authority to give these proposals the most serious consideration. However, I want to make it clear that I am not prepared to stand over a situation in which the Government put the taxpayers' money into an industrial project which they have been advised by independent advice and by the Industrial Development Authority has an 80 per cent chance of failure and only a 20 per cent chance of success.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann recommend Michael Mills for appointment by the President to be the Ombudsman.</P>
      <P>Deputies will recall that I announced in the House on 8 July last that arrangements were being made for the appointment of the Ombudsman from the 3 January next, the first working day of 1984.</P>
      <P>The House will be aware that the Ombudsman Act of 1980 provides that the Ombudsman is to be appointed by the President upon a resolution passed by the Dáil and Seanad recommending the appointment of the person concerned.</P>
      <P>This motion is the culmination of a series of events beginning in 1975.  In that year a motion requesting the appointment of an Ombudsman was tabled in the Dáil by Deputy Fergus O'Brien following which an All-Party Informal Committee was established.  I had the honour of serving on that committee.</P>
      <P>I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to Deputy O'Brien, now Minister of State at the Department of Health and Social Welfare, for his commitment to, and dedicated pursuit of, the concept of an Ombudsman for Ireland. It is to his commitment, and indeed that of former Deputy Richie Ryan and the late Deputy George Colley, Chairman and Vice-Chairman of the Informal Committee, that we owe today's resolution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The 1980 Ombudsman Act was based largely on the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on Administrative Justice, to which I have referred.  The remit of the committee was to formulate proposals to meet the needs of citizens aggrieved by administrative actions posed by the continually expanding activities <Col N="606" /> of Government across the whole area of the public sector.</P>
    <P>The recommendations, published in May 1977, had the backing of all parties in the Dáil and, although they were subsequently refined and modified somewhat, when they were put into legislative form I think it can safely be said that the institution of Ombudsman which we now have has the support of the parties in the House today as evidenced by the unanimous recommendations of the All-Party Committee.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an Ombudsman will, I am convinced, be a significant advance in the practice of public administration in Ireland.  Definite steps have at last been taken to provide the citizen with a means of redress &mdash; a means which, I might add, has become the hallmark of the more developed countries.</P>
    <P>This appointment will undoubtedly be of major significance for politicians, administrators and for the general public. By his availability to the citizen, coupled with his direct reporting relationship to the Oireachtas, the Ombudsman will provide a direct link between the people and the Legislature.</P>
    <P>Not only will he provide a means for the remedy of grievances about administrative actions, or lack of action, but he will also help us as legislators to become more aware of the effects of the legislation which we enact in this House.</P>
    <P>I hope the Ombudsman, through inquiring into particularly difficult questions or grievances laid before him by members of the public will, in the course of time, have this effect of lightening the load of inquiries and representations to Members of the House and afford them more time to devote to the Business of Parliament.</P>
    <P>He will have the onerous duty of speaking and acting on behalf of the individual citizen in his everyday contact with the administration.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman under the Act is empowered to investigate complaints from members of the public against the actions of administrators.  He will examine the actions of public officials in their handling of particular cases and seek a satisfactory remedy in those instances <Col N="607" /> where he finds that a citizen has a genuine grievance.  He may begin an investigation on his own initiative &mdash; arising out of a newspaper report, for example.</P>
    <P>The Act allows him to establish his own procedures for the conduct of investigations. It also outlines the main stages which the Ombudsman is required to follow in investigating a complaint.  At each stage in the investigation where he makes a finding or criticism adverse to an organisation or person, he must allow that organisation or person to consider his finding and make representations to him about it.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman will be independent in the performance of his duties and will report annually to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In addition, he may, from time to time, make such other reports to the Dáil and Seanad as he thinks fit.  This, I think, is sufficient evidence of the importance of the office in our administrative machinery.</P>
    <P>In view of the Ombudsman's influential position, therefore, and in view of his wide range of contacts with the public and with the administration, it is of vital importance to choose a person of the right calibre.  The post demands someone with the qualities of tact, diligence and a common sense approach to officialdom, allied to a commitment to the basic rights of the individual.</P>
    <P>I must admit that it was not an easy task to find someone with all the requisite qualities.  Over the summer I looked at eight different areas from which suitable persons might be selected &mdash; the Law Library, the Civil Service, the wider public sector, private business, the media, the political field, the trade union movement and academic interests.  Following very careful examination of all of these areas I have no hesitation in saying that I believe Michael Mills to be the most suitable and best qualified of the various names which I considered.</P>
    <P>In addition to the qualities which I have mentioned earlier as being necessary, he possesses two other &mdash; and in my view, vital &mdash; qualities, those of compassion and a well-developed sense of humour, qualities which stand many politicians in <Col N="608" /> good stead and help to keep them at their task.</P>
    <P>I believe he will bring distinction to the office and help in the initial years to establish very firmly the office of Ombudsman as having a central role in the conduct and improvement of public administration in this country.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the commitments made during the passage of the Bill through the Dáil and Seanad in 1980, and specifically my own commitment here in the House on 8 July last, I have consulted with the Leader of the Opposition in advance of making known the nominee.</P>
    <P>I am sure the House will agree with me when I say that we have been very fortunate in finding someone as well suited for the position as he is.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, I consider this recommendation to be an imaginative one and I am particularly pleased that the announcement has received such widespread commendation.  Michael Mills has been a journalist for 30 years and has been a senior distinguished political writer and commentator with <i>The Irish Press</i> for the past two decades.  He has written extensively on matters relating to Government, politics and administration, and his is a household name as a current affairs commentator on both radio and television.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, as well as being a recognition of Mr. Mills' substantial contribution to Irish politics and journalism, his nomination might also be regarded as a particular recognition of the important and vital role which responsible journalism plays in helping to explain and debate the political issues of the day.</P>
    <P>I am completely satisfied that he will prove to be a worthy Ombudsman and, accordingly, I confidently recommend his appointment by the President to that Office.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I was Minister for the Public Service when the then Minister of State Deputy Calleary, steered the legislation through the Dáil enabling the appointment of an Ombudsman to be made.  I am glad of this opportunity to make a few comments on this appointment, and of reiterating the importance <Col N="609" /> of the post and the qualities needed by the occupant.  What we are doing today is the easiest part of this exercise.</P>
      <P>The appointment of Mr. Michael Mills to the post of Ombudsman is welcomed by all.  The Minister must make available the necessary staff and accommodation to enable Mr. Mills to make a success of his office.  Perhaps the Minister would tell the House if such accommodation has been provided and where.  If Mr. Mills is to take up his appointment in January sufficient staff must be provided.  What arrangements has the Minister made for staffing in view of the present embargo?</P>
      <P>I agree that the office needs a certain amount of flexibility in its approach to the public and it must be able to provide guidance for all.  Despite attacks on politicians, I believe we have provided an information service and a complaints bureau for our constituents and it is to our credit that so many members of the general public feel free to come to us to help them get over their difficulties.</P>
      <P>Although I am praising a Bill introduced by my party, I still regard it as a welcome move to give the general public direct access to the Ombudsman, unlike the United Kingdom where this is not possible.  When the Bill was going through the House an undertaking was given that the Leader of the Opposition would be approached about the appointment. We are not opposing this appointment. Mr. Mills must appreciate the onerous responsibilities being placed on his shoulders, and I wish him well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I have said already, the Minister must provide the necessary accommodation and the staff to service this office, but it is important that the public have the right concept of the post of Ombudsman. They must know what the office means.  It is an appeals commission where complaints can be investigated and where certain alleged deficiencies in the system can be examined to see if the allegations are valid.  We must strive to avoid the Ombudsman becoming an additional Member of this House or, worse still, an additional administrative layer.  It is extremely important that the Ombudsman be seen to be independent but he should have the accommodation and staff <Col N="610" /> to meet the requirements of the office. He should not have to appeal to the Minister of the day to provide him with an adequate staff to serve the public.  If he were not independent, it could lead to an undermining of the post.  He must be seen to be, and he must be, in an independent position to comment on complaints, problems and allegations brought before him.</P>
    <P>I hope Members of this House will not avoid work by referring difficult problems to the Ombudsman because that would be very unfair, although there might be the temptation to do so.  It might happen that from time to time we will have to bring to his notice problems we hear from our constituents.</P>
    <P>A very welcome provision of this Bill is that a member of the public does not have to approach a politician first.  The Ombudsman should be available to all, whether a person be from Cork, Tipperary or Galway.  I envisage that there will be a presence in our second city and occasionally in other major centres. It should not be necessary for my constituents to have to write to Dublin; they should be able to get in touch with a local office.  Depending on the number of cases involved, it might be necessary to have offices nationwide.</P>
    <P>I wish Mr. Michael Mills well in his task.  I look on the appointment of an Ombudsman as a positive step forward because it will provide the best possible service for the customer &mdash; in this case the ordinary taxpayer, the ordinary citizen.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very happy debate because it is not often a Government can make two good decisions at the same time.  There has been a very general welcome for the decision to go ahead with the establishment of the Ombudsman. This will bring us into line with some of the more advanced countries around us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been universal praise for the person chosen to fill the office.  Rarely have we seen so much agreement on the choice of person to fill a high office.  We all know the person chosen very well and it is not my intention to embarrass him <Col N="611" /> today, but the fact that Michael Mills was chosen is vital to the success of the office. It is important that the first holder of the office be seen to be of the highest calibre, a person who would from the beginning give the office standing and credibility in the community, and also give it acceptability. Unless this happens, for many years to come the office of Ombudsman will be fighting for the type of recognition and profile needed to give it the degree of public acceptability which is vital.</P>
    <P>The Minister has given that office, an office described by a word unfamiliar to most of our people, a word which might take quite a long time to get across, a face and identity, an identity which will be very acceptable and which will be likely to commend it and the office to the public.  Almost no amount of advertising or public relations work could achieve so effectively what the Minister has done by one stroke in this appointment.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister says so himself, he can rightly claim that the appointment was one of imagination.  Already some commentators, in writing about the Ombudsman, have begun to apply to him the term invented by Professor Basil Chubb to describe the work of TDs many years ago, when he said that most of our time was spent going about persecuting civil servants.  I hope the Ombudsman does not see himself in that role and I feel fairly confident that he does not.  It would be very easy for a new Ombudsman to seek the headlines in the early days by waging a selective campaign against civil servants, by appearing as the fearless confronter of the bureaucrats. That would be too easy an approach and would be destructive ultimately.</P>
    <P>Obviously while the Ombudsman must have the confidence of the public, if he is to succeed, he must also enjoy the confidence of the civil servants.  Their confidence in him is as important as that of the general public.  Civil servants who will be investigated must have the right to expect fair play, no more, no less &mdash; they are certainly entitled to that &mdash; and to know that complaints made against them will be investigated in an orderly, procedural <Col N="612" /> way, that they will have the right of reply, that there will be no question of any arbitrary decisions taken against them. That is part of the provisions of the Act and also part of the personality of the person who will be the first Ombudsman. They are entitled to feel that the Ombudsman will not begin with an anti-Civil Service bias, will not seek easy victories or cheap headlines at their expense.  They can now feel assured that they have someone who is fair, somebody whose professional background has given him a good nose for the cheap headline seeker, for the false and spurious claim. I feel certain that anybody who approaches the Ombudsman with that sort of intent will get very short shrift indeed.</P>
    <P>In mentioning the number of categories from which the Minister sought an Ombudsman, he was wise not to appoint somebody from within the Civil Service. There are extremely good people within the Civil Service, some perhaps with greater technical expertise than the person appointed, some with the technical competence to fill this office in an exemplary way.  But to appoint somebody from within the Civil Service would be to damage the entire concept of the Ombudsman as somebody independent of the Civil Service.  A person appointed from within the Civil Service very probably, because of his or her background, would become a scourge of civil servants, perhaps all the more effective because that person would know the short-cuts, would know some of the tricks of the trade and where some of the bodies were buried. No matter how hard that person tried, the very fact that he or she came from the Civil Service, probably from the early stages would damage their acceptability with the general public.</P>
    <P>Likewise, from among the other categories mentioned by the Minister, he was very wise not to go for a judge or a lawyer, not because there are not excellent people in both categories but because the office must not appear to be as remote as a court of law; above all else it must be accessible.  People must have the confidence that they can approach the Ombudsman without the fear of <Col N="613" /> incurring great cost, long delays or the need for all the panoply of the law. Obviously bringing in a person from the courts almost inevitably would bring in many of the manners and attitudes of the courts and would not be beneficial to the office in its early stages.</P>
    <P>All in all the Minister has made a most commendable choice.  He has chosen somebody who is pre-eminently fair, who will give cothrom na féinne all round, who will be seen to do so.  He has chosen somebody who is humane, who will see that the administration is tinged with compassion, somebody whose experience will not be easily fooled and, most of all, somebody who is tough when it comes to defending principle or exposing maladministration.  Of all the fine qualities which repose in the person who has been chosen as Ombudsman it is this core of toughness about principle which will give the office the impetus and boost it will need in its early stages and ensure that it will succeed.</P>
    <P>I might make three brief points to the Minister.  The first would be an appeal first made by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald which I would make to all TDs and all public officials, that is not to overload the system, especially at the beginning.  They should pick out the real cases rather than using the office as a dumping ground either for impossible cases, which we all have, or for trivial ones.  We should not go around using the Ombudsman as a scapegoat for the cases which we cannot solve, for cases which cannot be resolved, using the Ombudsman as the person to whom we will refer them in the hope of putting off the giving of bad news for a further few weeks or months.  I hope we will not go around blaming the Ombudsman for decisions which were refused elsewhere and which we, in conscience, could not in any reasonable way refer to him.</P>
    <P>The success of the Ombudsman is vitally important in the interests of this House and of administration generally. By using the office sparingly at the beginning, by using it carefully, by picking out the right cases, not making false claims about it, by not building expectations too high we can contribute to its success, even <Col N="614" /> if there will be a temptation, which we may all feel from time to time, to refer cases to the Ombudsman to keep some of our more difficult constituents at bay for a while longer.</P>
    <P>I also support the plea of Deputy Gene Fitzgerald &mdash; and I know the Minister is fully behind this &mdash; that from the beginning the Ombudsman be given the proper back-up services, the proper type of resources to ensure that his attentions and energies are focused on doing the job properly and not on scavenging around for the resources in order to make the office effective.  I know the Minister is fully aware of that and will give it every support.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister also to ensure that there will be a fairly frequent review, especially in the early stages, of how the office is working.  In the debates on the Ombudsman Act there was a teasing out of what would or would not be done. Reading over it today it was a very effective debate in the course of which many issues were raised.  Undoubtedly there will be teething problems.  I hope that, after the first year or so, there will be a fairly comprehensive review to ascertain what, if anything, needs to be done, to ascertain if other areas need to be brought within the scope of the provisions of the Act.  I am sure the Minister will be open to that proposal.</P>
    <P>In congratulating the Minister I join with him in his praise of Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  Going back over the debates one can see, at the early stages, the idea of an Ombudsman was almost a one-person campaign by Deputy Fergus O'Brien to ensure that this new layer of administration would be set up.  At times it must have been a fairly lonely campaign; he had great difficulty in explaining what was involved in the office and in winning public support.  But he did so and if any one person is to be singled out for praise on this appointment it is Deputy Fergus O'Brien.  I am glad the Minister mentioned him in his speech.  I should like to be associated with those remarks.</P>
    <P>Finally I think I am expressing the sentiments of everybody in wishing Mr. Michael Mills well as the first holder of this office.  I hope and know that the <Col N="615" /> confidence which this House is reposing in him will be fully honoured.</P>

      <P>Níl sé ar intinn agamsa mórán moille a chur ar an Teach ach ba mhaith liom a rá cé chomh sásta is atá mé go bhfuil an tairiscint seo os ár gcomhair. Ba mhaith liom an tAire a mholadh as ucht a bhfuil á dhéanamh aige, agus fáilte a chur roimh an té atá ceaptha aige, Michael Mills, agus tá súil liom go n-éireoidh go geal leis sa mhéid a bheas á dhéanamh aige.</P>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl dó roimh ré go mbeidh mise ag breathnú air agus go mbeidh súil agam nach mbeidh sé i gcónaí ag sodar i ndiaidh rudaí a bhaineas go díreach leis an gcorp, go bhfuil rudaí a bhaineas le anam na tíre seo agus scaití déantar dearmad orthu, agus go mbeidh mé ag ceapadh go mbeidh sé sásta bheith freagrach as ceisteanna, clamhsáin agus rudaí mar sin a cuirfear os a chomhair amach anseo.</P>
      <P>Sílim gur chuala mé an tAire ar raidio agus é a rá go raibh díomá air nach bhféadfadh sé teacht ar focal i nGaeilge a bheadh oiriúnach don cheapachán seo. Nuair a bhí mé ag éisteacht le Maurice Manning ansin luaigh sé &ldquo;cothrom na féinne&rdquo; agus sin díreach atá i gceist. B'fhéidir go bhféadaimis teacht ar focal mar &ldquo;cothromaí&rdquo; nó &ldquo;cothromthóir&rdquo; nó rud éigin a bheadh níos oiriúnaí do shaol na tíre seo seachas an focal atá os ár gcomhair.  Sé an rud is tábhachtaí ná go bhfuil sé os ár gcómhair agus go n-aontaíonn an taobh seo den Teach leis an fhear atá ainmnithe ag an Aire.  Rud eile, tá dóchas againn go mbeidh rudaí níos fearr sa tír as seo amach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the times in which we live we must agree that one of the major frustrations suffered by citizens here at times is the feeling of hopelessness and helplessness in respect of the power machines, whether they be political, educational, commercial or ecclesiastical, which seem to have so much power and control over persons' lives.  Having listened to people outside, I suggest that this feeling of helplessness among citizens leads to more distress than do most things.  I will call the Ombudsman a &ldquo;cothramaí&rdquo;, especially <Col N="616" /> in the person of Michael Mills. People will now have an opportunity for the first time to seek redress from the Ombudsman.  This load was carried by politicians, but from now on the people will see in the Ombudsman the person from whom they will get redress on occasions when those powerful organisations seem to be doing them injustices.</P>
    <P>That is a great step forward in an effort to humanise those frightening institutions that exist.  One can recollect the latest occasions when one had to make representations to one of the big institutions, the big Departments, and how difficult it has been to get anybody at the other end of the telephone, or to get a reply to a letter which would accept responsibility for information given or for the approach which the official may have to the matter brought before the institution or Department.</P>
    <P>I hope I will not be doing what Deputy Manning asked us not to do, that is, bringing trivialities before the new Ombudsman.  In a democracy we must allow each person to decide what is trivial and what is major to the person involved. People come to us and, having listened to them, we may think that what is agitating their minds may appear to be trivial. However, that may be of major proportions to the people troubled by it. Even though to me a matter might appear to be trivial, I should not like to think there would be a prohibition on me in the matter of transferring that problem to the Ombudsman.  That would be his function rather than mine.  Of course, I am sure we would all use our discretion about conveying to the person with the grievance that we might think he or she should not proceed further.  I have said at seminars and elsewhere that problems referred to us often are regarded by intellectuals and others as village pump matters, but if a matter is causing pain or worry to a person it deserves consideration. We cannot dismiss matters in that way.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I hope the Ombudsman will not always be dealing with purely material matters.  In Ireland there has been neglect of matters which could be described as culture, language, music, <Col N="617" /> etc.  If it can be demonstrated to the Ombudsman that constitutional questions in relation to our language are not being attended to by some culpable agent, he should attend to these matters, some of which could be described as spiritual.</P>
    <P>Ní ocáid í seo chun óráid fada a dhéanamh.  Is ocáid í dúinn a rá go beacht cé chomh sásta is atáimid go léir go bhfuil ar tairiscint os comhair an Tí agus cé chomh sásta agus atáimid leis an fhear cáiliúil atá ainmnithe chun na cúraimí seo a thabhairt air féin, agus cé chomh dóchasach agus atáimid gur ar mhaitheas na tíre a bhéas sé ag obair amach annseo.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other speakers in complimenting the Minister for having brought this motion before us.  I also congratulate him for having made a commonsense choice, a person whom all of us admire for his reporting during the years.  In these times it is important that such a person will be there, easily available to the public, and that the public will have ready access to him and an opportunity to put their complaints, their side of the story, and that they will get replies and in many cases redress of their complaints.</P>
      <P>There are two sides to the role of the Ombudsman.  He will be dealing with individual complaints and from his experience in dealing with such complaints, listening and evaluating people's comments, his annual report to the Oireachtas will be of great value to us. The Minister for the Public Service has expressed concern at certain inadequacies in the whole public service area and perhaps now improvements can be attained so that people who have had their rights infringed in the future will have redress available to them.  In turn that will mean that we will be able to legislate in a manner that will ensure people will be treated fairly, because there will be accountability in the various public service bodies from whom people seek help and information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The word &ldquo;commonsense&rdquo; would seem to epitomise the choice made by the Minister for this post.  The person chosen will not be too academically-minded or <Col N="618" /> legalistic.  He is not a person with a Civil Service mentality.  I hope the Civil Service will take these words in the manner in which they are meant.  At times there is too much overloading of the bureaucracy and from that point of view the Minister has made a good choice.  It is important that the Ombudsman should be a person with a developed sense of humour, a person who will understand problems and the workings of the political systems and the bureaucracy, so that people will have easy access to him.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would indicate when replying what offices and staff will be at the disposal of the Ombudsman when he takes up office in January so that he can get to work immediately.  It is important that he should not have a developing entourage during the first six or eight months which would impede the proper carrying out of his functions.</P>
    <P>I agree that Deputies and others who deal with various problems should not try to offload all of them on the Ombudsman. Inspectors should be appointed who can examine various cases, picking out those which can be readily dealt with and investigating the remainder.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his sensible choice and wish the person named every success in his job.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I join other Deputies in welcoming the appointment of Michael Mills to the position of Ombudsman and I wish him every success in his new job. It was suggested in a number of newspaper reports that the appointment was made following consultation with all parties in the Dáil.  While that is not strictly true, if we had been consulted we would have agreed enthusiastically to the proposal. It is hard to think of an appointment to a public position which has received such a widespread welcome. Michael Mills has carried out his responsibilities as a political commentator with independence and integrity and I have no doubt he will bring the same qualities to his new and demanding position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest benefit I see deriving from the appointment of an Ombudsman is the possibility that it may reduce the degree to which our political system relies on <Col N="619" /> clientelism &mdash; this business by which Deputies are expected to act as messengers for constituents.  That should not be taken as meaning that Deputies should not be concerned about the problems of their constituents, but a properly developed Public Service with adequate forms of redress would reduce the load with which Deputies have to deal.  It would help to combat the attitude that Deputies can gain favours for constituents and that for this reason they should be supported. Hopefully the appointment of an Ombudsman and the reorganisation of the procedures for dealing with complaints in other parts of the Public Service and in the legal area will force Deputies and parties to concentrate more on the policies they are promoting and on their political programmes rather than acting as elected social welfare workers.</P>
    <P>The appointment of an Ombudsman will be futile if the Government and the House do not pay attention to the reports which the Ombudsman will be required to place before us.  We will be codding ourselves if we do not pay attention to any alterations he may propose. Experience in the area of consumer affairs is a good indication of the way in which a good idea can be rendered useless by failing to give powers to the people appointed, failing to provide the proper legislation and failing to respond to their reports.  The effectiveness of the Ombudsman should reduce his workload rather than increase it, provided we pay attention to the reports he produces.  He should also reduce the workload of Deputies.  Matters should develop to a point where a constituent will go direct to the Ombudsman rather than to his local Deputy who would then refer the problem to the Ombudsman.  A proper public education programme must be carried out.  The problems brought to the Deputies should then be more of a community and political nature.  For that reason I am sure most Deputies will welcome the appointment of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>While I stress our welcome for this appointment, I have reservations about the manner in which the appointment <Col N="620" /> was arrived at.  The Minister has explained that he went through the various areas of public life to find someone for the job.  We have no quibble with the person proposed but section 2 of the Act says that the appointment shall be made by the President upon a resolution passed by Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. This gives the Government of the day the power to appoint the Ombudsman.  In this case the process has worked well and we have a very good person to fill the job but we have no guarantee that future Governments will act in the same way or arrive at the same worthwhile decision. We have no guarentee that in future political patronage will not enter into this area.  For that reason I would suggest that we should consider recommending to the Minister that before the forthcoming six-year period elapses the Government should consider entrusting to the Civil Service Commission or some other independent body the task of finding a suitable person or compiling a short-list of such people to be considered by the Minister. The procedure as used by the Minister will be open to the charge of political patronage, no matter how honest or clear thinking the Minister of the day may be. I would urge that in future the Civil Service Commission or a similar body should be asked to recommend a person to the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a word or two to say in relation to the appointment of an Ombudsman.  There was a time when I had very grave reservations about this matter.  So few re-echoed my sentiments that I saw the merit in the case they put forward and gradually came around to the view that such an appointment might not be any harm.  An Ombudsman is new in this country, but 4,000 years BC the Greeks had advisers and counsellors and people came from all over their empire to have their grievances investigated and remedied.</P>

    <P>In the year 250, during the height of the Roman Empire, the consul sat regularly and met all classes and creeds for the purpose of hearing their grievances. I presume that it was in those early days, in which there were devoted people <Col N="621" /> trying to solve difficulties, grievances or injustices imposed on their fellow men, that such an appointment took root.  I thought perhaps we were too small to appoint an Ombudsman; but, nevertheless, the appointment seems to have general agreement.  I wholeheartedly support such an appointment in the hope that it will be extremely successful.  There are two aspects which we must debate calmly: first, the duties, responsibilities and position of the Ombudsman and, secondly, the quality of the person who will undertake the task.</P>
    <P>We are now going to pass this resolution asking the President to appoint a nominee of this House as Ombudsman but we have not gone very fully into his duties and responsibilities.  According to the terms of reference, the Ombudsman will be responsible for the investigation into the problems of perhaps 65,000 or 70,000 people who are subject to the Civil Service and who may have a problem or a grievance of a public character to be investigated.  However, 360,000 to 385,000 people are left out and will not have redress to the Ombudsman or his Department.  If we are going to have an Ombudsman, he should have free rein to deal with grievances, problems and injustices. His hands should not be tied. Efforts should be made to have his activities extended &mdash; not confined &mdash; as widely as possible.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the Ombudsman dealing with the activities of all Ministers and civil servants, especially where an injustice has been created, where someone has been deprived of their rights and denied what they feel they are justly entitled to, and where a Minister has made an order accordingly denying such person the privilege and the rights to which they are entitled.  The same applies to all activities where a citizen may feel he has been victimised by a ministerial order, if a citizen feels he is a victim of a decision made by a civil servant and is doing it at the behest of his Minister, he too should be able to appeal to the Ombudsman.  I presume the Ombudsman will have power to send for persons, papers and records to query the Minister in regard to his actions in so far as any <Col N="622" /> alleged injustice is committed against a citizen.  No person in authority should be free from the careful, watchful and independent eye of the Ombudsman.  Full powers should be vested in him and people who deal with matters pertaining to the public should be fully investigated if a grievance is brought to his attention.</P>
    <P>Of course, there is always the citizen who suffers from an imaginary grievance and we, as Members of the Dáil, have to deal with problems of that nature with courtesy, understanding and tact.  I presume the Ombudsman will have access to experts who will be capable of immediately identifying the genuine injustice.  I had hoped that the terms would be wider in relation to the activities of all State Departments.  However I am glad that after a while health boards will also be subject to the Ombudsman, because in the past there have been extraordinary decisions taken by health boards.  If there are to be investigations into the actions of Ministers and higher civil servants, surely we cannot deny the Ombudsman the right to facilitate the citizen by also investigating fully the actions of county managers, chief executive officers and those responsible for the administration of health boards.  I am dealing with civil servants longer than any other Member of this House.  In recent years I have dealt with civil servants in other European countries and in the United States and Canada and the Irish civil servants must rank as the most courteous and efficient taking into account their restricted financial means, their limited office accommodation and the limited assistance they receive.</P>
    <P>It has been said in many countries that Irish civil servants are top class administrative personnel and I can recall when attending a meeting of the World Food Organisation in Washington that officials of our Department of Agriculture were looked to to give a lead to civil servants from other countries.  What ever else may be said about our civil servants we must accept that they are highly efficient, courteous and understanding.  They seldom receive the tributes they are entitled to. The debate on this motion gives us an opportunity to salute the quality and calibre <Col N="623" /> of our civil servants.  They are outstanding. It may not be possible to get them all in step but those who are responsible for the administration of public services are outstanding.</P>
    <P>Since I was first elected to Dáil Éireann many years ago I have been dealing with civil servants and I have yet to find complaint with them.  I must salute their dedication to duty and commend the work they perform.  Our civil servants are dedicated to their work irrespective of the party in power.  Their allegiance is to their Department, the people and the country in preference to the political party that may be in power.  On occasions since the forties I have expressed my admiration for the dedication of our civil servants and I am sure the person appointed to the post of Ombudsman is aware of their ability.</P>
    <P>Numerous citizens feel aggrieved about the administration of health boards, local authorities and the work of city and county managers.  However, the Ombudsman should have some powers in regard to the Prison Service and the Garda.  Many gardaí have grievances but they do not have any way of having them resolved.  The same applies to the Prison Service.  What about a prisoner who may feel that an injustice has been done to him?  Is he to be deprived of his rights the moment he is put in a prison cell or should he have the right to consult with the Ombudsman if he feels an injustice has been done to him?  Army personnel should also have the right of appeal to the Ombudsman.  On another occasion I hope to have an opportunity to deal with the need for a complete review of Army law.  In the short period when I was Minister for Defence I made inquiries about this matter.  If senior officers or enlisted personnel have genuine grievances or feel they are the victims of discrimination, the doors of the office of the Ombudsman should be open to them so that their problems can be investigated.</P>
    <P>We do not seem to place the same importance on the provisions in our Constitution as other countries do.  Our Constitution gives our citizens certain privileges and rights.  If we feel those rights <Col N="624" /> are taken from us we are told to apply to the courts.  It is easy to say that and to tell citizens that our courts will ensure that their constitutional rights are protected, but many people are not in a position to adopt that procedure because of the heavy legal costs involved.  Our legal system is so complicated that it is seldom possible for a citizen to ventilate a grievance within his lifetime.  I hope the Ombudsman will have power to investigate such complaints and so ensure that all citizens get fair play.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister examined the Act operating in New Zealand, which gives the Ombudsman wide powers.  I hope there will not be any question of restricting the activities or the powers of the Ombudsman.  The Act operating in New Zealand is democratic.  The activities of the Houses of the Oireachtas, the Army and the Garda should be subject to careful examination by the Ombudsman in the event of an injustice being alleged by any citizen.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the person nominated by the Government, Mr. Michael Mills.  His appointment has been widely applauded.  It has been said that the appointment of the Ombudsman will mean less work for TDs.  I do not think that will be the case.  On the contrary it may mean more work for them because they will have to make inquiries regarding cases.  If it becomes known that the Ombudsman comes from my town, that we both went to the same school and so on, I can see everyone from the four corners of Ireland who have a grievance writing to me in order to get the goodwill and support of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mills is the most suited and the best possible person for this post.  I take great pride that he comes from Mountmellick. I remember him as a little boy and at that time he was as conscientious, honourable and courageous as he is today.  From his early school days he was looked on as a person of outstanding integrity and was highly respected and liked by his school friends.  Mr. Mills has been selected for the post of Ombudsman because of his qualities.  He has the great qualities of understanding and of patience, the ability to listen and, above all, <Col N="625" /> he is an extremely courteous man.  He comes from a family who have the highest standards of integrity.  Mr. Mills has been absolutely impartial in his profession as a journalist.  He may have had his own views but in his dealings with people he has shown understanding, care, friendship and courtesy.</P>
    <P>Above all, Mr. Mills has been a great credit to the profession of journalism with which he has been so prominently identified.  He belongs to the old school of journalists and they are very few nowadays. He followed in the footsteps of people like Paddy Quinn, Joe Dennigan, Jim Doyle, Hugh Curran, Michael McInerney and the other great men who sat in the Press Gallery here.  All of them were journalists of integrity.  I knew of one case where great publicity was given to a person in the public eye.  Mr. Mills was known to say he was not worried about the manner in which the material was published but he was extremely worried because it was not the truth.  Mr. Mills has always been concerned about truth and it is fitting that he is now selected for this most responsible post of Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I have been reading the work of political correspondents and journalists since the 1940s.  I have never seen an article by Mr. Mills in which he belittled Parliament or cast a reflection on the rights, privileges and the dignity of Members of Parliament. He has never belittled the office of President or the rights of Parliament. He has upheld the institutions of State with pride, admiration and respect while many others tried to belittle them and pull them down.  Not so with Mr. Mills because he realised the importance of upholding the dignity of Parliament.  That is a quality that is disappearing rapidly in the world of journalism today, not only in this country but elsewhere.  Mr. Mills was one of the old school who respected and loved the institutions of State.  I do not know of any Deputy who ever suffered from the pen of Mr. Mills.  He always respected the dignity of Members when others tried to belittle them.</P>
    <P>I am proud of Mr. Mills and I say this as a fellow-county man.  He has been an outstanding journalist.  It gives us all <Col N="626" /> great confidence in the office of Ombudsman. He will have to take on the great responsibility of investigating the grievances of the ordinary citizens, the poor, the semi-hungry, the ill-clad and the ill-shod as well as the fat and rich who may drive up in their Rolls Royces to have their problems investigated.</P>
    <P>I am confident that we are starting on the right footing in creating the office of Ombudsman.  I join with other Deputies who have appealed to the Government not to place restrictions on staff, accommodation and money.  I ask them to give a free hand to a completely independent person of solid integrity to investigate the injustices of which our people may complain. There is no man in this State more suited to the post than Mr. Mills.  He has commonsense, intelligence, sympathy and understanding.  All these qualities are still evident in his aged mother who lived in my constituency.  Mr. Mills has inherited these worthwhile qualities not only from his parents but from his grandparents and great-grandparents.  His family have always been held in the greatest esteem.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the appointment of Mr. Mills will ensure that people have confidence in the Office of Ombudsman. The Irish people can always say: &ldquo;We now have an organisation led by a man of integrity who believes in justice and honesty and who will see that we get a fair crack of the whip&rdquo;.  I hope that when the Ombudsman decides that there has been an injustice against a citizen there will be adequate means for ensuring that the injustice is put right and that ample compensation is paid by whoever is responsible for causing the wrong to the citizen.  When the Ombudsman reveals that such a thing has taken place it should be put right and the law should enable it to be put right.</P>
    <P>I know Mr. Mills for a long time and I know he will not be satisfied by just saying that an injustice has been done against a certain person.  I do not believe he is the type of man who will say: &ldquo;You are right but we are very sorry and there is nothing we can do about it&rdquo;.  That would immediately handcuff the office of <Col N="627" /> Ombudsman.  Not alone should the injustice be exposed but if the good name of the citizen has been tarnished he should be adequately compensated for this injustice. Such a person should not be at any financial loss because of the injustice done to him.  If a job has been lost the job should be restored on the recommendation of the Ombudsman.  If a citizen has been deprived of X£, that money should be readily available on the recommendation of the Ombudsman.  No matter what the grievance or the injustice carried out against the citizen, it will not be enough for the Ombudsman to say: &ldquo;I have investigated it, you are quite right, an injustice was done to you&rdquo;.  The injustice must be rectified.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman we are now appointing can be described as a family man, a man who believes in family life, who believes in the rights and the protection of the family and a man who believes that a citizen should not have to take drastic action in order to obtain his rights.  Now that the Ombudsman-elect is leaving the Press Gallery I hope he will be able to whisper a word into the ears of some influential people about the necessity for a press council here.  This is very necessary. I have been speaking about this for years but my plea has always fallen on deaf ears.  Maybe we will hear more about that as times goes on.</P>
    <P>The Minister said today:</P>
    <P>The remit of the committee was to formulate proposals to meet the need of citizens aggrieved by administrative actions posed by the continually expanding activities of Government across the whole area of the public sector:</P>
    <P>That covers what I was referring to a short time ago, that the many branches of the public service should come within the scope of the Ombudsman.  I do not know what the views of the Garda and the Army authorities would be in relation to this matter but I believe it is always better to have Army and Garda grievances dealt with by somebody who is not directly involved in either the Garda or the Army.  What better person to deal <Col N="628" /> with the growing number of injustices springing up in our Defence Forces and in the Garda than the Ombudsman?  He should be permitted to look at some of those problems.  Not only will he provide the means for remedying grievences in relation to administrative actions or lack of action but he will also help us as legislators to become more aware of the effects of the legislation we enact in this House.</P>
    <P>Parliament is proceeding to set up an Ombudsman for the first time and we are appointing a man who has been sitting for many years in the Press Gallery watching legislation going through.  He has praised and condemned legislation. There is no man better qualified to address himself to any Government about the need for legislation in certain fields of public life than the man who is now being appointed.  There is no man more qualified to say that the legislation which he saw going through is now causing injustice to people than the man who is now being appointed.  I am convinced that if Mr. Mills sees there is need for any legislation or amending legislation or if there are people suffering an injustice because of the lack of legislation, he will have it suitably noted and ensure that the attention of the Government, no matter what Government are in power, is called to it and that such legislation is implemented.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>He will have the onerous duty of speaking and acting on behalf of the individual citizen in his everyday contact with the everyday legislation.</P>
    <P>Members of this House have the closest possible contact with the ordinary citizen. The appointment of an Ombudsman will not lessen the volume of work of TDs.  I do not believe any TD seriously believes that because an Ombudsman is being appointed he will have less work to do. Our job is to speak for and look after the interests of all our constituents.  If the TD or Parliament fails, if the parliamentary question fails, if the Minister remains silent when he should have spoken, if the civil servants have not responded satisfactorily, the Ombudsman can act.  There <Col N="629" /> is no point in any TD going to his constituents and saying: &ldquo;The Ombudsman is there and you should write to him&rdquo;. Those constituents would then say to their TDs: &ldquo;We voted for you, we did not vote for Mr. Mills&rdquo;.  It is the man who goes round seeking votes who is expected to look after his constituents.  Any TD who wants to pass that work over to Mr. Mills is not doing his job.</P>
    <P>The TD who says that he is only here as a legislator, that he is not there as representative for his constituents is not doing his work properly for the people who voted for him.  We must represent the people in every way possible.  We only resort to the Ombudsman when everything has failed in order to get a satisfactory response to our representations. I am glad the Minister referred to this in his speech.  At the moment we seem to forget the individual.  We speak of wealth, riches and property.  All these things fade into insignificance in comparison with the importance of people. There is nothing in the world more important than people.  The individual, whether he is dressed in rags or in silks, whether he is hungry or overfed, is still an individual.  It is our job to protect and look after the needs of the people.</P>
    <P>People are now being looked on as numbers.  I am saddened by people at medical clinics being called by numbers. People in the Army and in the Garda are also called by numbers.  People in the prison service have their numbers.  The ordinary individual is more than any number.  We are human beings and we have the right to life, to speak, to understand, to be given a standard of living.  It is the voice of all the individuals together that can create a loud voice.  The voice of one person is not heard.  There is nothing more important than people.  No matter what one's walk of life is, whether one is a university professor, whether one sleeps under canvas or in a caravan, one is still a citizen with rights.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman will protect and look after the rights of our people.  I hope Ireland will be one of the first countries in the near future where the number will be removed and where everyone will have the privilege of being called by his <Col N="630" /> name and not a number such as XY8574. I have always maintained that it is wrong to describe a man or a woman by a number. They all have names which should be used and respected.</P>
    <P>More than once in the Minister's speech he referred to the right of the individual.  Nothing is more important or more vital than the right of an individual in a democracy.  For the time being we are a democracy.  While we are a democracy let us protect the rights, privileges and the entitlements of the individual. The individual should be looked on not as a number but as a person with a place in society.</P>
    <P>The Minister said:</P>
    <P>He will examine the actions of public officials in their handling of particular cases and seek a satisfactory remedy in those instances where he finds that a citizen has a genuine grievance.</P>
    <P>That is the kernel of the responsibility of Mr. Mills.  No man in Ireland today is more qualified to deal with that aspect of the problem than the man named in this motion.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>He may begin an investigation on his own initiative, arising out of a newspaper report, for example.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mills will have plenty of scope if he commences investigations into newspaper reports.  There have been reports from time to time which were not very accurate.  I am sure the man we are now vesting with these powers will carry out his duties with credit and distinction.  I have no hesitation in saying that.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman will be independent in the performance of his duties and will report annually to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I hope that when his report comes before us the debate will not restricted to ten, 15 or 20 minutes or half an hour.  Reports relating to the activities of the European Economic Community come before us frequently.  I have not heard long debates in this Parliament on those matters, even though they affect the lives of every citizen. The agricultural community, the <Col N="631" /> industrial community and the consumers are all affected, yet reports from the European Economic Community seemed to be passed over with haste and with a great lack of concern and interest.</P>
    <P>When the Ombudsman's report comes before us I hope we will debate the grievances he has solved, grievances which should never have existed.  I am sure he will point out in his report who was responsible, whether it was a senior civil servant, a Minister, a county manager, or a chief executive officer.  He will spell out who was responsible for the grievance which caused embarrassment and injustice to the individual citizen.  In a democracy this will give us an opportunity to ventilate the problems.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Michael Mills has been a journalist for 30 years and has been a senior distinguished political writer and commentator with <i>The Irish Press</i> for the past two decades.</P>
    <P>I will not repeat what I have said about Mr. Mills apart from saying that as a journalist he has had the highest standards and integrity.  He has shown respect and admiration for the institutions of the State.  Nobody inside or outside of Parliament was ever belittled in any way by the writings of the Ombudsman elect, who always wrote with clarity, impartiality, understanding and a very high degree of justice and fair play.  He did not take that from the ground &mdash; I have known his family for my lifetime.  I wish him every success in his job, for which he is well able.  He will tackle the problems and he is a good sympathetic listener with plenty of courage and he will not be afraid to put the blame where it should lie.  A man of his type will set the office of Ombudsman on a solid foundation.</P>
    <P>For the record, as a fellow townsman and as everybody from Mountmellick does, I rejoice in his appointment.  There are not many Laoismen who get to the top, which sometimes makes us envy the Dublinman and Corkman his success.  He will succeed.  As a family man he will protect the rights and interests of the individual against injustice.  I wish him <Col N="632" /> the best of success and the height of good luck.  Because of his past record of justice and honour, respect and dignity, his efforts will be crowned with the success which he so richly deserves in the highest post which could be given to him at present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  I do not intend to detain the House for very long.  It is with some personal satisfaction that I welcome this motion as I had the privilege of piloting the Ombudsman Act of 1980 through the Dáil and the Seanad. It was with some surprise that I and many others heard the announcement of Mr. Mills' appointment.  However, on reflection one came to the opinion that this was an excellent appointment, which ensures that the experience and expertise which have been garnished by Mr. Mills over very many years will now be put to use on behalf of those who feel that they have not been given a fair deal by the various Departments of State.</P>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on this appointment and I am very glad that he has upheld the commitment which I gave to this House on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Government at the time of consulting with the Leaders of the Opposition in relation to the appointment.  The House has heard very eloquently from Deputy Flanagan and I shall not elaborate on the various complaints which may be put to the Ombudsman.  These are well documented in the Bill and were discussed in detail when the legislation was going through the House.  However, I would ask the Minister to implement the other commitments given at the time, in particular in relation to the health boards, harbour boards and so on.  I further ask him in 12 months or so, when he has gained experience of how the Act is operating, to look at the other sectors of State not now included in the Schedule of the Act but about which great concern was expressed by many Deputies during the debate of 1980.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like the other Deputies, I congratulate Michael Mills.  His qualities have been well enumerated at this stage and the Minister spoke very highly of him in the Bill.  May I add two other qualities of <Col N="633" /> which I have experience &mdash; his approachability and his calmness?  When one adds these qualities to his integrity and compassion, his common sense and tact and the enormous experience he has gained over the years in writing about politics and politicians, one comes to the conclusion that he will be a very capable and formidable Ombudsman whom future Ombudsmen will have to work very hard to emulate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur with the commendation of the other Deputies on the appointment of Mr. Mills as Ombudsman and I welcome the appointment.  I congratulate the Minister on bringing this motion before the House.  While not a fan of the organ for which Mr. Mills has worked, mainly because of its flagrant bias over the years &mdash; this being something of which I was aware even before becoming a member of a political party &mdash; nevertheless it is significant that a person of his calibre was able to promote his brand of integrity in his reporting of debates on the political scene over the years in that organ.  This has won the respect of everybody both inside and outside the House.  I have made it a habit from time to time to consult his paper in order to see what he had to say about different matters.</P>
      <P>This was the most universally acclaimed appointment in years.  It will mean an advance in the practice of public administration and will be a means of redress for citizens long overdue.  It may contribute to the dilution of the drab constituency duties of TDs who can be deflected from their rightful duties as legislators. In these times particularly we need to devote more of our time to tackling the problems of the country while, as Deputy De Rossa said, no one disagrees with having to help constituents in every way possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The significant appointments of An Bord Pleanála, of the DPP and of the Ombudsman have been made while Fine Gael and Labour were in office.  I invite Fianna Fáil to join in the process of cleaning up public life.  Much more remains to be done.  Last week all sides of the House came together to put forward another <Col N="634" /> important piece of legislation for the advancement of public life and the security of the citizens of the State.  I hope we shall see more of this in the future.</P>
    <P>There have been criticisms in this House in the past that the Minister has aped British legislation.  I was delighted that he did not make it a condition that the complaints of the members of the public should have to go through TDs or public representatives as is the case in Britain, or was the case in Britain.  I am glad that the Minister, when deciding on the appointment, gave careful consideration to many walks of life and that although he considered an appointment from the Law Library, they lost out on something.</P>
    <P>It appears that nothing can be done without considering somebody from the Law Library.  Never before was such a dose of realism served to the Irish public than by the appointment of a journalist of standing to the post of Ombudsman. Journalists have their feet on the ground. They are realists and very much in touch with what is going on.  I hope in future an embargo will be put on appointments from the Law Library to positions like this and that consideration will be given to people in other walks of life.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons why this appointment should be welcomed.  It was a departure from normal practice.  For example, the appointment could not have been made from the Civil Service because there could be a conflict of interests, but that is not to say that it would not have been possible to get a suitable person from the Civil Service and we must be seen to be fair when making this appointment. It is to be welcomed that the position was not filled from the political field for the same reasons.  This would have been the most unsuitable arena from which to select a candidate.  I hope the Government will bear this fact in mind when making future appointments, particularly when they are appointing judges.  The appointment of an academic would also have been unsuitable because, like the clergy, they are not in touch with reality.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>From where else but the profession of journalism could this appointment have been made?  The public need this further boost of confidence in impartial appointments.  As every Deputy knows who holds clinics and listens to complaints from ordinary decent and, perhaps, uneducated people who do not know where to turn, this is a particularly welcome appointment which will do a lot to restore public confidence and eliminate a lot of the bitchiness that goes on with people constantly complaining about one thing or another.  This simple method of letting it be known that this office is available to the public will do much to get rid of a great deal of this unpleasantness and will help people to become more positive in their daily lives.</P>
      <P>In the British Parliamentary Commissioner's Annual Report for 1982 he said:</P>
      <P>I received several visits during the year from representatives of other countries having (or planning to have) ombudsmen.  But the main opportunity of establishing and renewing personal contacts with other ombudsmen was provided by a Seminar which I and my deputy attended in Siena at the end of October.  This was organised jointly by the Council of Europe and the University of Siena and had as its theme &ldquo;Non-judicial means for the protection and promotion of human rights&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>It appears that the Ombudsman can play an international as well as a national role. This will give him the opportunity to liaise with international ombudsmen.  I hope our Ombudsman will attend the next four-yearly gathering of ombudsmen planned to be held in Stockholm in June 1984.  Edward Gibbon said, &ldquo;All that is human must retrograde if it does not advance&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of Ombudsman is an important step forward for us.  If he issues a statistical report at the end of the year it will enable us to compartmentalise complaints and to deal with them quickly. This will also help reduce a great deal of <Col N="636" /> the moaning and groaning done by the ordinary people and it might even eliminate this grumbling altogether.  At the end of the year we will be able to examine the report and see where there seems to be most difficulty and this will give us an opportunity to take action to correct the situation.</P>
    <P>For these reasons I welcome this motion.  I congratulate Mr. Michael Mills wholeheartedly on his appointment and wish him every success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a short contribution on this appointment and to pay a tribute to an old associate, Mr. Mills.  A number of Deputies have made comments which should not be left unanswered but in the absence of ministerial intervention, I feel I should correct the record.</P>
      <P>The previous speaker said Mr. Mills' paper was guilty of flagrant bias.  I would not say that about <i>The Irish Press.</i> As a reader of <i>The Irish Press</i>, and the other Irish newspapers, I want to put on the record that it could bear scrutiny for editorial balance and could compare favourably with any European paper.  It is a good newspaper, although it may not have the highest circulation in Ireland. Nevertheless, it is only fair to say that it is not a bad newspaper by any means.  I want to put on record my appreciation of <i>The Irish Press</i> for its journalistic balance over the years.</P>
      <P>Deputies commented on who might apply for the position of Ombudsman.  In my view any citizen should be allowed to apply for a job whether he is a Law Librarian, an academic or a politician.  A person's profession should not preclude him from applying for a job because every person has the right to apply for any position and each applicant should be considered on his merits.  They have their rights as citizens, they must exercise those rights and be given equal treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In defence of the Law Library &mdash; of which august institution I happen to be a member &mdash; there are many people in the Law Library who could well qualify for the position of Ombudsman.  The suggestion that politicians are in some way <Col N="637" /> unsuitable public representatives, or in some way unsuitable for the position of Ombudsman underrates, undermines and understates the role of politicians in this country.  What is wrong with our politicians is that their critics are mainly politicians.  I strongly object to my position as a politician being undermined by politicians.  The people from whom most criticism emanates are the politicians themselves in relation to the profession, trade or call it what you will, of politics. Politics is an honourable profession.  I am proud to be a politician.  I am proud to have served the people of Dún Laoghaire for the last 20 years.  I will serve them in that capacity as long as they want me and, when they cease to want me, so be it; I will not shed any tears.  In the meantime I will serve them, that is what democracy is all about.  I find it distasteful that politicians undermine the profession of politics.  If we do not stand up for ourselves here, nobody else will do so.  I might bring that to the attention of the previous speaker.  Our politicians have served this nation well down the years.  I do not think we have anything of which to be ashamed.</P>
    <P>I agree that, as Dáil Deputies, we should be seen as legislators rather than as mediators.  I do not think we should be grievance men or women.  Unfortunately the situation has arisen over the last 15 years in which the clinic system has emerged under which we have to present ourselves at such clinics on a weekly or monthly basis throughout our constitutuencies. This is the type of service people want or appear to want.  I am, in inverted commas, &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; of practising within that system.  I often wonder whether I am wasting people's time in that practice.  What happens is that Mrs. Murphy comes into Deputy David Andrews saying she has not received her pension for some reason or other.  I will say to Mrs. Murphy that certainly I will write to the Minister about it.  A standard letter comes to me saying that the matter is being attended to and that I will hear from the Minister in the next week or two.  Inevitably the follow-up arrives setting out the reasons Mrs. Murphy is not entitled to her pension.  I will already <Col N="638" /> have told her the reasons she was not entitled to her pension when she came to me in the first instance.  That is a waste of Mrs. Murphy's time, of my time and of the taxpayers' money.  The reality is that the taxpayer is paying for the time taken up by that individual bureaucrat responding to a query, the answer to which was known in the first instance.  That is not good practice.  The reality now is that unless Dáil Deputies serve the people at local level they will not be re-elected to this House.</P>
    <P>If the appointment of this Ombudsman achieves one goal, that of bringing about in the minds of people that we be seen as legislators, not middle men between the bureacracy and the Dáil, or between Government Departments and the people, if this appointment brings about an honesty of service to the people it might eliminate the unreality in which Dáil Deputies operate.  In saying that I am not underrating the role played by us at local level.  We have now a sophisticated, young and very educated electorate. If the electorate examines what I have to say they will see that it is an honest expression of a point of view they would themselves accept.  I may well be talking myself out of the Dáil by expressing such views; so be it but I do not think so.  In the meantime if the Ombudsman can bring about a situation in which he will deal with these grievances, real and unreal, expressed by individuals to him in relation to grievances they may have arising out of some piece of bureaucratic bumbledom it would be a good thing.  For that reason alone I welcome the appointment of this Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I do not like feeding off other people's speeches because that is not fair.  Nevertheless Deputy Oliver J. Flanagan made the point that the Ombudsman should have some role to play in relation to the performance of Dáil Deputies.  He did not mention Senators specifically.  I think what he meant were Members of the Oireachtas.  I would reject the idea of the Ombudsman having any role at all in that regard.  I see the Ombudsman as a creation of this House, a creature &mdash; and I say that with the greatest respect to the Ombudsman-elect &mdash; as the servant of <Col N="639" /> this House.  I do not think any Dáil Deputy should be answerable to the Ombudsman.  Rather should the reverse be the case, that the Ombudsman be answerable to this House and I am pleased to note that he will be reporting to this House on a regular basis.  That is as it should be.  As I see it the role of the Ombudsman is clearly defined by the Minister in the course of his introductory remarks when he said:</P>
    <P>The remit of the Committee was to formulate proposals to meet the needs of citizens aggrieved by administrative actions posed by the continually expanding activities of government across the whole area of the public sector.</P>
    <P>It is my view that that remit should remain within those parameters.  I do not think we Deputies should be subject to this individual.  Coming to the merits of the individual sycophancy is not my strongest point.  I was never a great man to proclain my own virtues or those of others.  But what I say I say with, I hope, a measure of sincerity, that is in regard to the individual who has been appointed as Ombudsman.  I have been a Dáil Deputy for 20 years now.  Over those years, Mr. Michael Mills has proved to me that he is one of the most decent men I have come across in journalism.  He is a man of the very higest journalistic standard, as I understand journalism.  In the main the journalists in this country adhere to those standards, those to which Mr. Michael Mills, the Ombudsman-elect, adheres.  That is how it should be. He is not of the &ldquo;peep-hole&rdquo; variety of journalists.  Thanks be to God there are few of that variety in this country but there are a few and they make me quite ill.  A number of them do not understand or would not recognise the truth if it was presented to them.  Mr. Michael Mills has been a representative of the Press Gallery in the Dáil, which has been staffed by men and women of the highest journalistic integrity.  I am pleased for Mr. Mills personally.  I wish him well in his new appointment.  I have no doubt that from time to time we here are seen as miniombudsmen <Col N="640" /> or women.  I wish him all the best, in a deeply personal way, because I have been associated with him for years. His standards have been of the highest order.  I wish him every success in this new position.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by taking up where Deputy Andrews left off.  I welcome this appointment personally.  I know Mr. Mills fairly well.  I have known him for ten or 15 years and have the same high regard for him as other Deputies have expressed here.  I do not want to imply that his colleagues in the press are all different from him, because they are not, but he has been very conspicious as a serious journalist.  In a sense, that may be a weakness in a journalist because taking issues 100 per cent seriously and not being diverted by the anxiety to make catchy headlines from the raw material of the news may mean that his name is not as much a household word as those of some of his colleagues.</P>
      <P>In saying that, I do not intend criticism of journalists whose talents lie in another direction because, of course, it is a talent to make the raw material of news, which may be pretty dull to the man in the street, suddenly interesting, colourful and alive.  I am not belittling the other kind of journalism but it is fair to Michael Mills and those who are like him to say that his brand of journalism takes every issue as being deadly serious and keeps it as that, and does not look at it in that awful Irish village-street-squinting-windows way in which the whole thing can be explained through referring to whom a person is married or where he came from Mr. Mills has not any of that.</P>
      <P>A month ago one might have been surprised at the prospect of discussing the likely performance of an ombudsman in terms of his performance as a journalist, but I think that quality is a pointer to the inner man, and if the innerman is a grave, honest character, as I believe he is, then the office which he will fill will be given a very good start.  Some Deputy earlier said it will be a start which will set a standard which his successors will have great difficulty in keeping up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without going back on the grounds <Col N="641" /> which we argued when the Ombudsman Bill was before the House, I must say that I am afraid he will have a rough time to start with, because most people have only the faintest idea of what an ombudsman is &mdash; I do not mean those in this House but most people in the world generally. An ombudsman seems to have come into the public consciousness as being to the administration what Santa Claus is to a child's weekly pocket money: he is something over and above the usual pocket money, someone who showers benefits regularly, even though one has not had to budget for them.  In the public perception, an ombudsman is a person who will produce results from the administration which the administration itself has been powerless to do and which even the intervention of Deputies and Senators going around the country have not been able to do.</P>
    <P>I want to strike a note out of compassion for Mr. Mills, and I do not want him to become dejected early in his career, but I am afraid he will be unavoidably the necessary source of a good deal of disappointment in the months ahead.  I do not know when it is planned to equip him with the apparatus of office, the familiar wall-to-wall carpeting, the stainless steel plate and the graphic artist-designed annual report &mdash; I do not know when all these things will begin to happen &mdash; but the very moment he will take up office he will get the standard Stationery Office baskets which will groan with post. In the post I get from my constituency &mdash; a lot of it comes from throughout the country as well &mdash; I have yet to be able to recognise the handwriting on many of the letters.  There are chronic grievances from people and I do not mean that they are all nut cases, though that category is well represented among them, but there are people who simply cannot be persuaded that the law applying to their cases is a proper law.  Of course it may not be a proper law and Mr. Mills will have the heartbreaking experience of writing to people who genuinely feel that the world has done them down, to tell them there is nothing he can do to help them because he is not empowered to change the law &mdash; he cannot tear up the <Col N="642" /> law in the way Santa Claus can make confetti of a child's budget in Christmas week.  He will have to stay within the four corners of what the law makes possible in regard to social benefits or grants or amenities and so on.  He will have to steel himself &mdash; I do not think any speaker has said this today &mdash; to being the conveyor of a lot of what will come across to the people as bad news.  People are inclined to turn ungrateful quite quickly and Mr. Mills may find his name being bandied in the correspondence columns in the next six months or 12 months as a by-word, as somebody who can do nothing.</P>
    <P>I hate to strike that unhappy note so early in the career of Mr. Mills, before it has begun, but it would be cruel of this House to do otherwise because all of us, collectively and individually, have a far wider experience of observing the things that come across to the ordinary voter as grievances.  I do not think it would be a bad thing for Mr. Mills to ask some particularly busy Deputies, some with particularly big posts &mdash; I would not be one of those, I am not in the class of some of my colleagues on the Fine Gael floor &mdash; to see their post.  It might not do him any harm to come in and look at such post for a week or so.  By all means let him go to Deputy Calleary's rooms where I am sure he will be facilitated by one of the ladies or gentlemen there.  He could go to the Labour Party rooms to get some kind of clue about how helpless people are about going after their rights.  He would also learn about how difficult it is to persuade people that they have got, not perfect justice because the world does not provide that, as much in the way of rights as the law affords them.  He will find it difficult to persuade them that no one from the Taoiseach down can do more than to ensure that they will get the rights the law affords them.  The office of Ombudsman is not giving any extra dimension to that picture.</P>
    <P>I have said all that because it would have been cruel to allow Mr. Mills, who is flesh and blood like the rest of us, to read the reports of today's proceedings here and then travel on the wave of euphoria that I would feel if I had so many ladies and gentlemen speak well of <Col N="643" /> me for nearly three hours.  I am just warning him that he is bound to cause a great deal of disappointment.  He will have a great deal of drudgery and many angry telephone calls and abusive letters from people who will be saying, &ldquo;Have we added you to the list of well-paid State servants who can do nothing about my grievance?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I am sorry to be so brutal about it, but that is the kind of stuff he will get, perhaps not very much of it.  Knowing him, I appreciate he has the strength of character not to be worried about it unduly but it is fair to tell him he will have a rather up-hill climb, perhaps even emotionally, in this job in trying to give a character and a profile to what must be a useful addition to the scene here.</P>
    <P>If he looks at section 4 of the Act under which he is appointed he will find the criteria on which he will be allowed to condemn or denounce or find fault with some administrative actions.  There are seven in number.  There is reference to action taken without proper authority, taken on irrelevant grounds, the result of negligence or carelessness based on erroneous or incomplete information, improperly discriminatory, based on undesirable administrative practice, or otherwise contrary to fair or sound administration.  At least four and possibly six of these grounds are already grounds in law for having an administrative decision struck down or invalidated.</P>
    <P>I hope Mr. Mills will not resent my stressing that he is not a lawyer.  He is too intelligent to be under the impression that it is at present possible for an administrative authority to get away with an action taken without proper authority or a decision taken on irrelevant grounds, or negligently or carelessly.  He would be under an illusion if he thought it was possible to get away with being discriminatory from a legal point of view or with an undesirable or unfair administrative practice.  The legal system, not merely in our own time but even when the British were here, always regarded these as criteria which would suffice to have a decision declared void before a court.</P>
    <P>To some extent Mr. Mills is being <Col N="644" /> asked to duplicate, by a quasi-administrative process, namely that of his own office for which no strict guidelines have so far emerged, what is already being done in the courts.  It is true that one might have to start in the High Court, which is an expensive business, and I do not suggest that the widow who cannot understand why she should not qualify for free fuel should be sent to the High Court to prove herself right.  I have suggested before that we might have a simplified, very cheap administrative process of a judicial kind within the familiar dimensions of the legal system to apply to all kinds of humble administrative decisions like the refusal of the welfare officer to put someone on the free fuel list.  That may be too humble a thing to take to the High Court but it may be the only grievance that an old lady has.  We ought to have an ordinary legal process, without any bowing and scraping and wigs and gowns, built into the legal system which will get to the bottom of these things quickly and with the minimum building up of files.</P>
    <P>What will Mr. Mills be doing?  He will be administering criteria which are essentially legal criteria which the courts already apply but he will not have quite the same preemptory engine which the court represents. People are inclined to complain about the old fashioned panoply and intimidating formality of a court.  I think it is a damn good thing that to some extent courts should be intimidatory.  My experience in practice is that witnesses are a bit over-awed by the look of a court and perhaps this is no harm.  It makes them slower to tell the lie they would tell in any other kind of setting.  When they do tell a lie it is easily detected by the sixth sense of even a dull advocate.  I have no objection to that slightly over-awing dimension of a court, although I do not mean it to intimidate poor, simple people.  On the contrary, it is the gougers and the scroungers who deserve to be intimidated.  That is why it is a good system.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mills will not have any of that.  He will be simply Mr. Mills, admittedly an Ombudsman with statutory powers of <Col N="645" /> some kind.  He will not be equipped with the peremptory and very tough powers which a court has in order to compel obedience to its orders.  This will require from Mr. Mills &mdash; and I am sure his character is up to that measure &mdash; unusual firmness and persistence to extract from the administration the kind of result which a court would get by a three-line order.</P>
    <P>I will not go to the same fulsome lengths as Deputy Flanagan in praising public servants because I have known a few bad apples as well as all the good ones.  My experience and impression from reading the law relating to times earlier than our own is that maladministration in the sense of dishonest or recklessly bad government at Civil Service level is very rare.  Most of the mistakes of the kind which come under these criteria in the Act, most instances of something being done without proper authority or on irrelevant grounds, occur in practice by accident, not by design.  They may occur because an official is in a hurry or is overworked.  He may be lazy or careless or perhaps he is cutting a corner.  Perhaps he is sick of the sight of a particular problem and thinks of a quick way out of it.  These are the kinds of mistakes that anyone makes and civil servants are not necessarily immune.  The sort of bad government one might have expected in some remote province in eighteenth-century Russia does not exist here or at least exists to only a marginal extent.  I believe it is extremely rare.  Most forms of error which will come under these criteria are not of a malicious nature.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman will not be equipped with the same peremptory powers as the court.  He will be duplicating work which the courts do but he will be dealing with humble people who are afraid to go to court and could not afford it.  He will be up against a bureaucracy which by and large is extremely honest.  Some Departments are slow and perhaps not 100 per cent polite.  Some are not free of the taint of bloodymindedness in certain sections or contexts but by and large we have an extremely honest administration which is one of the more shining parts of our <Col N="646" /> national picture and we are lucky to have it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mills will find it a pretty depressing job.  He will go through the motions of trying to find whether So-and-So ought to have had a pension and he will get a letter, which in almost all cases will rest on a correct appreciation of the facts, signed by a responsible official who will not attempt to conceal his name.  I welcome the recent announcement by the Minister for the Public Service that the giving of officials' names will now be standard.  That is a good move.  I am not trying to imply that I have had any difficulty in trying to extract an official's name.  I find them quite willing to give their names when I am discussing something with them on the telephone.  I am sure you have found that too, Sir.  The full responsibility will rest with him to track down a supposed injustice in an individual case and I have the impression that he will be fighting his way through a tunnel stuffed with cotton wool.  He cannot see the light at the end of it.  It does not offer much resistance, but neither is it very easy to get to the end of it.  There is no malice, dishonesty, no recklessness or anything like that, but it is just desperately difficult to get to the rights or to prove that any wrong has taken place in even the simplest instances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews might have said, when he mentioned telling the applicant that she was not entitled to a pension, that he told her so before she started and that his words had been confirmed by the Department, that the lady's next act would be to go to Deputy Desmond and, if she has the same experience with him, she will than go to Deputy Barnes, Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Barrett.  I am afraid that the Ombudsman in the eyes of the people &mdash; unless Mr. Mills has an unusual flair for explaining himself loudly and clearly so that it lodges with everybody before disillusionment sets in &mdash; will find he is looked on as a sixth wheel in the Dún Laoghaire constituency or some other constituency, another string to the complainant's bow.  Whether they will try that wheel before going to TDs or the other way around naturally <Col N="647" /> will depend on chance, but I am afraid it will turn out like that.</P>
    <P>I want to make a suggestion to Mr. Mills for saving himself from that fate, which will break his heart if it descends on him, and the heart of his staff also.  He would give great example by spending as little as possible and ignoring the appeals which, I am sorry to say, came from my own benches, for unlimited State expenditure on offices, equipment and staff. There is no need for him to build an empire; but what he could do, with even a fairly skeleton apparatus to serve him, is to hold as many press conferences and explanation sessions as he can.  They will be glad to have him on RTE programmes for a certain time and it is only thereafter that bodies like An Coimisiún Dumpála decide they have to spend £1,000 buying four square inches of space in the daily papers because no one is interested in having An Coimisiún Dumpála on &ldquo;The Late Late Show&rdquo; or whatever.  For a while he will have instant access to publicity and he should use it.  This is well meant advice.  He should try to damp down expectations of what he can do and explain to the public that there are things he cannot do and that, if one or other office has repeatedly said that a claimant is not entitled to something and if Deputies and Senators and so on have also said so, there is no use coming to him because perhaps in only one case in 10,000 will he get a different answer.</P>
    <P>People will be scrutinising the Act with a high powered lens to try to find some way of defeating the Ombudsman and he could interpret the word &ldquo;action&rdquo; in section 4 as meaning action of a Department or an official in drawing their salaries and taking their holidays but in not doing what they are there to do.  That could be done.  I hope that the people in the press and the public galleries will not misunderstand what I am saying here.  I am not suggesting that that is a posture or a frame of mind characteristic of the Civil Service but there are times and contexts in which the Civil Service, or elements of it, do not seem to be producing the goods. The output at one end of the apparatus does not seem to justify the volume of <Col N="648" /> money put in at the other end.  The Ombudsman could invite people who are owed liquidated, settled, uncontested sums of money by State bodies that are within his remit &mdash; a very large number of them, of course, are not &mdash; and where there is no dispute any longer about entitlement, to let him know if they are experiencing delay in extracting their money from a Department.  That is a humble suggestion.  He will not have to break many lances or conquer many dragons to do that, but it seems to be something about which no argument is possible and on which there can be really no excuse except some form of administrative constipation which he should be able to clear out of the way.</P>
    <P>Departments which do not provide adequate explanations for some step which they have taken, which is, in essence, a step of a kind they are perfectly entitled to take, could be challenged and asked to provide an adequate explanation. The simple instance here is the telephone billing system.  I know that a Department would suffer a rush of blood to the head if they were personified here as having anything wrong with their billing system.  However, the other day I received a letter from the man in charge of the money at a boy's school.  It was an account of his differences with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in regard to the telephone bill.  He was so uneasy about the billing that he had a private monitoring system inserted into his own telephone to monitor the number of units consumed and the discrepancy disclosed between what the Department were trying to charge him at the end of the quarter and what his own monitor had recorded was 10,000 units.  It is a big, busy school and undoubtedly the telephone is heavily used.  I think I observe some activity here on my right in writing down that figure.  But I want to stress that I am not accusing the Department of being wrong.  Perhaps the Department are right in sending him that bill and maybe his monitor is at fault; but it is wrong that he should have to go to the rounds of writing to a Deputy, getting the Deputy to make photocopies of the correspondence, sending it in and even <Col N="649" /> then perhaps not getting a satisfactory explanation.  That case has nothing to do with the group called Telephone Protest who exist for no other reason than to extract some sense from the Department in regard to their billing processes.  That is something the Ombudsman might go into and get his teeth into and not relinquish them until he has broken whatever is causing the trouble in that Department. Although the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are, in schedule 1, one of the Departments which he may investigate, there is no mention anywhere of the two giants, An Bord Telecom and An Bord Poist.  They do not figure anywhere in the legislation.  It is possible that the reason is that they did not exist when the Bill was passed in 1980.  It may be that there will be amending legislation in the Bills to establish the two boards putting them into one schedule or another in the Act. I had better not be positive about that, but the Act does not contain any mention of the two bodies I have referred to although they will in a short time have charge of two important functions.</P>
    <P>That must be regularised because I would bitterly object and oppose any suggestion that an Ombudsman worth the name should have the workings now with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs withdrawn from his scrutiny.  In my constituency &mdash; it may be that in Deputy Nealon's constituency there are other problems; I know they have telephones now &mdash; there is no single matter I get more post about than telephone grievances. I am referring to real grievances, such as complaints from people who have paid deposits on the undertaking that they will get something within a certain number of months.  The Department have their £60, £80, or whatever figure, but they do not have a telephone and there is no question of paying interest on the money held by the Department either.  We all know that the telephone system here is the source of the most universal grievance and anything which would withdraw that from the Ombudsman's purview would take a lot of use from the Ombudsman as far as my constituency is concerned.</P>
    <P>People talk as though people in Dublin <Col N="650" /> suburbs do not have any right to call themselves part of the country, but they are Irish also.  Many of them come from the constituencies represented by the two gentlemen behind me.  They pay their taxes and are entitled to the same considerations as any other citizen.  Their votes, funny enough, are just as good as the votes of Mayo or Sligo in putting a Government in or putting one out.  They are entitled to expect that, when they are going to have to pay for the apparatus of an Ombudsman, that Ombudsman would not only be permitted but encouraged to put his nose, as a first priority, into the telephone service to see what is going on. We have poured hundreds of millions into that system and we are entitled to know what has happened to it.</P>
    <P>Mr. Mills might say &ldquo;Do not expect too much from me in the way of individual cases about this or that because there are a couple of big things I want to try to understand, without condemning anyone unheard, without coming to any rash conclusions and I want to try to understand what they are all about.  I want to see what exactly is wrong with the telephone system and why this country, after all the expenditure, is unique in Europe in the awfulness of that system&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>My first suggestion was that the Ombudsman should invite the public to let him know when they have a claim that is no longer in dispute, when they are simply waiting for a cheque and are told by telephone that the cheque is on the Minister's desk awaiting signature. There is no reason why any person should have to wait for money which is due to <Col N="651" /> him now.  An Ombudsman ought to be able to put an end to anybody having to wait for money from any of the Departments under his scrutiny.  That is something he can do and for which he will be thanked.  It is not spectacular.</P>
      <P>For so long as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is under the charge of the Ombudsman he should say &ldquo;Let us understand that the thing which is the biggest source of grievance &mdash; it can be multiplied over and over again from individual instances &mdash; is the telephone service&rdquo;.  He should say he would like to meet everybody involved in that service from the Ministers down to the linesmen laying the cables, those out on the job and those who are now working in the new suburbs in my constituency marching up the Dublin foothills.  People in that area have been waiting many years for a telephone.  If I am not mistaken somebody connected with Minister of State O'Brien has been waiting six years for a telephone in my constituency.  If I was the Ombudsman I would like a briefing on this.  I would like to know what this is all about because I would expect many complaints about telephones.  I would like to have my own picture of what is going on and why there is such colossal expenditure in a country of our size with a growing population but not growing quite like rabbits.  I would like to know why it has produced such a poor result.</P>
      <P>I am sorry if I have struck a different note to other speakers and that I have gone on longer than I intended.  I wish Mr. Mills every possible success.  I have had an opportunity to convey that wish to him earlier.  I know I speak for every Member when I say that anything any of us can do in an unpartisan way to help or advise him will be willingly at his disposal. I should like to congratulate him on being the first holder of an office I hope will develop.  He has a chance to make it into a most important and valuable office, an office which will be a friend to liberty and decent Government.</P>

      <P>I am happy this appointment has been made.  In 1975 a <Col N="652" /> Private Members motion regarding the appointment of an Ombudsman, which I tabled, was passed by the House.  Subsequently, an all-party Committee considered the matter for a number of months and produced an effective report which was adopted by the Government. It has taken a number of years to get this far, but I believe all Members welcome the appointment.  I am not saying that the delay was deliberate; it was one of those things that had to be processed.  I should like to compliment the Minister for the Public Service on his prompt action in making the appointment.  It is in line with his thinking on the review of the public service and the role it should be playing. Deputy Kelly in his contribution gave the distinct impression that he was in favour of the appointment of an Ombudsman and expressed a view that he had a useful role to play.  I agree with those sentiments and that was why I was keen that the appointment be made some years ago.</P>
      <P>There is a view that everybody with a grievance or a problem runs to their local representatives.  While we deal with many of the problems the great majority of people plough their own furrow and feel frustrated and alone.  For the good of the public service, and confidence of the general public, it is important that people should not have to run to politicians if they have a grievance.  It is good that there will be a person they can go to, a grievance settler.  Deputy Kelly made the point that in 90 per cent of the cases the Ombudsman will have to write back to say that people were not entitled to the assistance sought but the important thing is that people will have had recourse to an independent person to investigate their case.  That will give people a sense of confidence in the whole area of public administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The appointment of Mr. Mills was a wise one.  Like Deputy Calleary, I was surprised when I heard the name of the person to be appointed but on reflection I viewed the appointment as a good one because Mr. Mills has tremendous experience.  He has the humanity to deal with problems and will not have a cold calculated legal outlook on matters.  He will have a common-sense approach to <Col N="653" /> problems.  Long may he hold this important position.  I do not intend to go into the merits or demerits of the position and I am happy that the matter has been resolved.  The appointment of an Ombudsman will be most worth while and well justified.  The public service will know now that somebody will be able to see both sides of the coin and this will make the whole administration more streamlined and efficient.  It will also engender a greater degree of respect for the public service and those who work in it.</P>
    <P>I am happy this appointment has been made and I congratulate the Minister on taking such swift action and on making such a fine appointment to this post.  I wish Mr. Mills well.  I am sure he will bring all the qualities he has shown as a political correspondent to his new job and that he will be well respected.  I am sure this first appointment will set a high standard with regard to the post of Ombudsman.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the numerous speakers who have contributed to the debate.  I am heartened by the positive response that has come from all to the nominee of the Government for the position of first Ombudsman.  A number of points were raised but many of them were much more relevant to the debate on the Bill relating to the Ombudsman.  As Deputy Calleary will recall, many of the points raised were dealt with comprehensively during the passage of the Bill in 1980.</P>
      <P>The order bringing into effect the office of Ombudsman was made last July and I spoke about this in the debate on 8 July.  Today we are dealing with a single motion putting forward the name of the person to be recommended to the President for appointment.  However, a number of points were raised that are worthy of comment at this stage for the purpose of clarification.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Gene Fitzgerald and others referred to the need to provide adequate accommodation and staff for the office of Ombudsman.  Both of these matters are well in hand.  I am particularly anxious <Col N="654" /> that the accommodation to be provided for the Ombudsman should be central and convenient to Government Departments, should be easily accessible to the public and preferably that it should be independent of any other Government office or Department so that the independence of the Ombudsman is emphasised even in the physical location of his offices.  Plans are well advanced for the acquisition of suitable offices and I hope we will be in a position to announce their location in the near future.</P>
    <P>The staff for the office of the Ombudsman will be appointed following recruitment by the Civil Service Commission. They are an independent body who will make impartial recommendations in connection with the appointment of staff. When appointed, the staff will be civil servants but applications will be invited from serving civil servants and members of the general public.  Following their appointment they will be civil servants but rather than being civil servants of the Government they &mdash; as is analogous with the staff in the office of Director of Public Prosecutions, the office of Comptroller and Auditor General and the staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; will be independent civil servants responsible only to the Ombudsman.  They will not be civil servants of the Government and any fears that in some way they will be responsible to a Department or to the Government of the day are ill-founded.</P>
    <P>There is an important difference in the manner in which complaints can be referred to the Ombudsman in this country as opposed to some of our near neighbours and that point was referred to by a number of speakers.  The provisions in our legislation ensure that any member of the public or any group or body who consider they have a grievance or a matter for examination may refer that complaint directly to the Ombudsman.  That is in sharp contrast with the practice in some other countries where reference must be through Members of Parliament. It was felt by the all-party committee and the Government of the day who put forward the legislation that that was not the most acceptable practice.  Consequently, the right of direct access to the Ombudsman <Col N="655" /> was provided for in the 1980 Act.  I think that is correct and I am sure the public will welcome their direct access to the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that Members of the Oireachtas cannot refer complaints or matters referred to them to the Ombudsman. I suspect that in particularly difficult cases or in cases where Members feel it might be especially appropriate that they will refer such matters to the Ombudsman.  There have been pleas that initially at least Deputies should not decide to send all their constituency correspondence in one large bag to the office of the Ombudsman.  That is self-evident. If we were to resort to that it would be an abuse of the system.  I hope that over a passage of time the more difficult cases which take longer for Deputies to resolve and which can be frustrating for the constituents and the Deputies might be referred by Deputies to the Ombudsman or in time, might be referred directly by the constituent to the Ombudsman.  If that should happen it would have a most beneficial effect on this Chamber.  It would allow Members to devote more time to the affairs of Parliament.  In that way the office of Ombudsman would have a positive beneficial effect that was not perhaps of prime importance when the office was established.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to a matter of great importance, namely, that there should be occasional regional appearances of the Ombudsman, that he should not be seen as somebody operating exclusively from an office in Dublin.  I subscribe fully to that belief.  One of the reasons why Deputies from outside Dublin have received so many representations is that their constituents are aware that they travel regularly to Dublin and are in contact with Government Departments. Quite understandably there is an impression throughout the country that all decisions are made here and that the more removed one is from the seat of decision-making the more difficult it is to get simple administrative decisions put into effect or to make complaints and appeals against such decisions.  For that reason people in the parts of the country <Col N="656" /> removed from Dublin have recourse to their elected representatives more frequently and ask them to operate as ambassadors of appeal for them in their dealings with Government Departments. The provision whereby the Ombudsman will have the right to travel to any part of the country in connection with his investigation of any matter is important and I am sure the Ombudsman will respect that provision.</P>
    <P>I would like to think in time to come &mdash; I am expressing here a personal opinion &mdash; and in the light of experience of the operation of the office of the Ombudsman and after his remit has been extended to take in areas other than the Civil Service proper, that there might be consideration given to the establishment either of regional offices for the Ombudsman or of regional Ombudsmen who would deal mainly with problems that arise in the regions.  If that development occurred over a period of time it would radically change the perception of the public service in the minds of the public and also the role, requirements and demands placed on elected representatives in the various regions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning reminded the House of a description, which, perhaps, it would prefer not to be reminded of, that is the description given by Professor Basil Chubb to Members of the Dáil as being perceived in their main role as persecuting civil servants.  We all know that is not the role that Members of Parliament should have.  The Deputy suggested it is not the role either which is appropriate to the Ombudsman.  I do not believe that if the person we are selecting is a suitable candidate for the office he either would perceive his role as being that of persecuting civil servants.  His role must be to ensure that the administration is being carried out properly and fairly and that he can adjudicate upon complaints and grievances made to him, that where those grievances are upheld the wrong is put to right and where those grievances are found to be without substance the correct decision of the Civil Service and the public service is identified and made clear and the proper action of the service is also highlighted.  The role of the <Col N="657" /> Ombudsman, as well as being a protector of the public's right to fair administration, I would also see as being a role of ensuring that, where the administration is operating fairly and is proven to be so, as a result of his investigation, proper administration and the proper conduct of public servants in relation to their duties are also referred to and highlighted.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies asked that the operation and the remit of the Ombudsman should be reviewed after a certain length of time.  I have mentioned in the House previously and in other places that it is my intention, after the Ombudsman has been operating for some time, to extend his remit to the area of the local authorities and the health boards.  It is also my belief that after some length of time, whilst he operates the wider remit, the area of at least some State bodies should also be included within the remit of the Ombudsman.  It is our intention that the extension of the remit to local authorities and health boards should take place preferably some time within the first year of operation.  It is important, however, that we should allow the Ombudsman some months in operation so that he can gauge the volume of complaints being submitted to him and the length of time it takes to investigate them, and that the Ombudsman and his staff are absolutely satisfied of their capabilities to take on and investigate thoroughly and efficiently additional complaints before the remit is extended.  It would be unfortunate if we placed a burden on the Ombudsman and his office which meant that none of the work he is charged with doing could be carried out properly.  I understand that recent experience in some other countries where the remit was too wide perhaps initially has led to some administrative difficulties, to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>I understand it was for that reason that the right of the Ombudsman to investigate complaints dates only from the date upon which the office is established.  If that were not the case I suspect that he might well be snowed under with complaints dating back not to 1922 but, perhaps, even as far as the Act of Union, and the sheer difficulty of sorting out the <Col N="658" /> volume of paper that would descend on the unfortunate incumbent, if there was not a cut-off date from which he began his investigations, would be a serious problem indeed.  From that point of view the appeals which have been made that Members of the House also should not over-burden the Ombudsman in the initial months needs to be respected.  A number of Deputies spoke about the fact that from time to time, and as a minority, thankfully, proportion of our constituency representations, all of us get complaints either from what have been referred to here as crank cases, or people who have become particularly obsessed with one matter or another and where all the normal courses of administrative justice have been resorted to without success for the simple reason that the persons are not entitled to what they have convinced themselves of entitlement to.  Rather than referring to them in the same manner as other Deputies have this afternoon, I refer to those cases in my own constituency as being the St. Jude cases. It would, indeed, be unfortunate if the many qualities outlined here this afternoon as being in the possession of the Ombudsman &mdash; and indeed of his forebears as well, as has been so graphically explained to us by Deputy Flanagan &mdash; were to be extended to the taking on, in addition, of the powers of St. Jude.</P>
    <P>Deputy Tunney spoke about the concern, which he heard me previously voice, about my disappointment that it had not been found possible to find a suitable Gaelic word to strike a chord with the Irish people.  I looked into the matter and discovered that a number of words had been suggested, each unfortunately having its own failing or connotation. Arriving late on the scene, I might have favoured the word &ldquo;cara&rdquo; but gather that that is being used as a trade name.  One must accept that the word Ombudsman, a Swedish name, is in normal usage in English and other languages. I understand that it is contained in most standard English Dictionaries.  It is, as a matter of interest, not a sexist word and means a person charged with authority to investigate on behalf of Parliament. <Col N="659" /> The person may be of neither sex.</P>
    <P>Deputy Liam Cosgrave referred, in particular, to the necessity for a person with the responsibility of Ombudsman to have, above all else, a common sense approach.  That is a quality which might be extended to many others in public life. It is one which I regard as a first prerequisite for the office of Ombudsman.  He also, as I have, mentioned that the nominee has a very well developed sense of humour.  I say that for a particular reason. As Deputy Cosgrave suggested, it is important that the nominee should understand the workings of administration and of bureaucracy.  I suggest that to understand the workings of administration and bureaucracy in this country one would have to have a sense of humour. To be able to follow the many varied and complicated paths and laneways which have been developed in the building of our administrative system over the years one would have to have, from time to time, the ability to smile wryly at oneself and at one's own capabilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa suggested that there should be a reorganisation generally in dealing with complaints made by the public. The establishment of the office of Ombudsman is the foremost and most important step which can be taken in allowing a new vehicle or access for complaints of the public which they feel are not perhaps being properly attended to. This was also referred to by Deputy Tunney. I might divert slightly to remind the House that during the last week I announced that, in future, officials within the Civil Service will be required, in connection with all letters they write, to sign their own names and have typed below their signature their names and ranks.  They will also be required to give their names in answer to telephone queries or conversations and those in public offices will be expected to wear name badges designating also their rank.  That is accountable management at the sharp end.  That step, of itself, will mean in many ways a reorganisation of the method by which people make inquiries or complaints.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="660" /> There is provision that the Ombudsman is obliged to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas annually.  I agree with the Deputy that those reports should be fundamental to the conduct of the Oireachtas and be given the closest attention and debated in the Houses.  I hope to ensure that when the first report from the first Ombudsman arrives the opportunity would be taken to have a full debate on the office and its operation.  If the House then identifies areas where the remit of the Ombudsman might be widened even further, the opportunity should then be taken to do that.</P>
    <P>A few Deputies, including Deputy De Rossa in particular, inquired as to the method of appointment and suggested that perhaps the Ombudsman might be appointed by the Civil Service Commission. I sometimes suspect, as mentioned by Deputy Andrews, that politicians' worst enemies are, in fact, politicians. There is a school of thought which, if followed to its logical conclusion, would result in the self-abolition of this Chamber and all political institutions by the politicians on the basis of transferring all powers &mdash; which are really responsibilities &mdash; from the Parliament and the elected Members to other people.  It is a poor parliament indeed which is not mature enough to come, on a consensus basis, to the choice of an impartial and well qualified person to act as Ombudsman in the public interest.  To suggest that this Chamber is not in a position to do that is unworthy and totally contradicted by the contributions from Deputies on all sides of the House this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I have no intention of changing the system whereby the House jointly recommends to the President who the Ombudsman should be.  I would be more than surprised if ever there arose a need for a vote on any nominee.  I would assume that the Government of the day, according to the undertaking given when the Bill was going through and as was complied with by a subsequent Government, would consult with the Opposition and ensure that the name put forward was generally accepted.  In that regard, Deputy De Rossa suggested that I did <Col N="661" /> not consult with all the Opposition.  Of course not.  I have more to do than consult with 80 or 90 members individually. I gave a specific undertaking at column 2602 in the Volume of 8 July as follows:</P>
    <P>I will therefore consult with the Leader of the Opposition before bringing any such resolution before the House.</P>
    <P>I complied with that undertaking, which was the appropriate undertaking to give and the appropriate method by which consultation would take place.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flanagan, being from the same town as the nominee, knows more about the Ombudsman and his antecedents than perhaps most of the House do &mdash; or did until this afternoon.  He has given the House the benefit of his intimate knowledge of the town of Mountmellick and the family of the Ombudsman.  Listening to him, I could not but be even more convinced of the correctness of our choice, on hearing the very many admirable qualities surrounding the nominee, even in his earliest and school days.</P>
    <P>The Deputy pointed out that he was originally opposed to the concept of Ombudsman but over the passage of time and listening to his colleagues he had changed his mind.  I am glad that we have managed to change the Deputy's attitude through these contributions and greater enlightenment.  The Deputy spoke of a number of exclusions provided in the Act.  Most of those are as a result of the All-Party Committee's recommendations, except in one or two cases &mdash; and in particular the case which he mentioned, the area of the prisons.  That area has been excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman for a specific reason.  The office of Ombudsman should be available to allow people with a genuine grievance to have that investigated impartially and adjudicated upon.  Unfortunately, the difficulties in our prisons today stem in large measure from a large part of the occupancy being reserved for subversives of one type or another.  For the Ombudsman to be a vehicle by which subversive organisations endeavoured to gain for their cause particular or strident publicity would be a direct abuse of the office of <Col N="662" /> Ombudsman.  I am inclined to agree with those who first framed the Bill that so long as our prisons are heavily populated by subversives or people who are there for political reasons, it would be wrong to make the office of Ombudsman subject to political pressure from people, many of whom have the intention of overthrowing not just the Ombudsman but the State itself.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly mentioned that two new boards intended to come into operation to replace the Department of Posts and Telegraphs from the beginning of next year were not mentioned in the Act.  That is because they were not in existence at the time of the passing of that Act.  The remit of the Ombudsman can be extended by ministerial order and I have already indicated that I intend doing that in relation to local authorities and health boards.  When we come to consider the area of the State bodies, there is no reason why the Ombudsman's remit should not be extended to one or other, or both, of these bodies.  My personal inclination would be that this ought to happen at that time.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also said that the term &ldquo;action&rdquo; should also have been extended to include inaction.  It does have that meaning, in fact.  Deputy Kelly said that Government Departments should issue cheques when they are due.  I could not agree more.</P>

      <P>This specifically is the sort of case where action and intervention by the Ombudsman is envisaged as being particularly effective.  The Deputy suggested that advance publicity regarding the role of Ombudsman was essential and that that should include outlining the extent of what the Ombudsman can or cannot do.  I am very conscious of this need in the run-up to the taking of that duty at the beginning of January.  There will also be some provision for advertising subsequent to the appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the fortunate side-effects of the existing profession of the nominee is that <Col N="663" /> he has, I would hope, rather close contacts with the media in general.  I would hope that, with the amount of publicity engendered over the next months, the Ombudsman might be in a position to arrange that sort of publicity at less cost to the State than might otherwise have been the case.</P>
    <P>I thank the House for the very fulsome support to the nomination of Michael Mills to the President for appointment to the position of Ombudsman.  I ask that the House agree to the passing of the resolution.</P>

      <P>If this Bill is supported it will effect a long overdue reform in Irish land law legislation.  It will end both the principle and the practice of an outmoded feudal concept and allow Irish democracy to be exercised for the first time on a relic of the colonial past.  It will do more than that.  It will end an ongoing injustice against hundreds of thousands <Col N="664" /> of Irish people who have been battened upon by land speculators, avaricious people and opportunists in the legal profession since the foundation of the State.</P>
      <P>Legislation to date has conceded the principle of termination of ground rent but it has devised schemes designed to feather the nests of the landlord class who have exploited householders over the years.  The buying out procedures introduced in 1967, and repeated in the 1978 legislation, involve the giving of a golden handshake to the ground landlord.  As well it involves spending taxpayers' money in handing out titles over the counter to those persons who can be intimidated or enticed into the process. That process has failed.</P>
      <P>Despite the prohibition on future ground rents contained in the 1978 legislation, out of 400,000 people entitled to buy out, only 10 per cent have availed of it.  The nest feathering aspect of this long overdue reform is also illustrated by the half measures contained in the 1979 legislation. Eviction for non-payment was abolished in 1978, years after the ACRA campaign had killed it stone dead because they could not succeed in doing so in any case.  The landlords could still use the courts established by the people to threaten them with sheriff's seizures and even imprisonment for continuing with the strike against this unjust and unjustifiable rent.</P>
      <P>As recently as May 18 of this year four jail sentences were imposed on Tallaght residents at Kilmainham Court and at Sutton Court.  On May 26 three housewives were sentenced to from ten to 14 days in jail for non-payment.  In fact, only today 1,200 signatures were handed in to a number of Deputies &mdash; Deputies from the south west area, myself and Deputy De Rossa &mdash; from people in the Tallaght area who were subjected to harassment and intimidation by a company in that area owned by the McInerney group. Thousands of cases have clogged the courts as the McInerneys and the Gallaghers and even the Irish Life Assurance Company &mdash; all behind various front names &mdash; have sought to intimidate householders into payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill covers only those entitled <Col N="665" /> already to the protection of the various Ground Rent Acts from 1967 to 1978.  It is the best possible start in that it sets the date for total termination of those rents and the ending of the many complications involved.  After this there will be a need to legislate to help the many thousands of tenants on expired ground rent leases who are not protected by existing legislation. These include householders whose leases have expired and who can be and are asked by the likes of the Earl of Pembroke for the full value of the premises they and their families have lived in for generations.</P>
    <P>This category also includes people whose rateable valuation is less than their ground rent and who are thereby bereft of any protection.  All the parties in this Dáil have pledged themselves to move against ground rent to a greater or lesser degree.  This consensus should be exercised on this occasion if the Dáil is to be seen as effective in legislating against this admitted social wrong.</P>

      <P>I can anticipate that any Bill like this one will be objected to by propertied interests and that the Irish Landowners' Convention, as well as various ministerial speech writers, will be quick to cry &ldquo;confiscation&rdquo; and to say that not even this pariah of the private property spectrum can be got rid of without compensation.  I agree that compensation should be paid and so does ACRA but it should be paid to the aggrieved parties, that is, the householders who have borne the weight of this unjust feudal tribute over the years.  Happily the present Bill is more than covered by the terms of the Constitution in that Article 43 on private property states that the exercise of rights to private property ought, in a civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I think it would be fair to say that, if existing ground rents could be terminated simply by the enactment into law of a Bill declaring them to have been terminated without unacceptable consequences or implications, we would not still be discussing the matter; this Government or any Government over the past ten years or more would have done so.  The fact is that, as a practical matter, existing ground rents can be terminated or abolished only by purchase. The single alternative to purchase is confiscation. It does not matter in what clothing a proposal for confiscation is presented, any scheme for the termination of existing ground rents that does not provide for the due payment of fair purchase prices to ground landlords amounts to confiscation.</P>
      <P>The scheme may propose a termination date, as some people call it, some time in the future and may propose that the ordinary payments of ground rents falling due in the meantime are to be treated as the ground landlord's purchase money.  However, payments of rents are not payment of purchase money.  The ground landlord's property right is no greater than that of anyone else and likewise it is no less than that of anyone else. Until he is paid the purchase price, he is entitled to be paid his rent as it falls due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The same holds for a scheme that would declare the fee simple to have vested in the ground rent tenant.  That would propose that the parties thereafter would negotiate on purchase price.  If the former ground rent tenant already had his fee simple, why should he negotiate with anyone?  If, on the other hand, the payment of the purchase price is really intended to be made how can any such scheme be preferable to the Land Registry scheme which is still open to those <Col N="667" /> who genuinely want to terminate the ground rents on the dwelling houses?</P>
    <P>At the technical level, any scheme which proposes the abolition of ground rent by waving a legislative wand is open to one serious objection, that is, the difficulty and uncertainty it would create in the future.  If a blanket change of status is to be conferred by legislation, it is essential that the scope of the legislation be quite clear.  It is not always quite clear who is and who is not a ground rent tenant.  Any one who was affected by such legislation, and who subsequently tried to sell his house or raise a loan on it, could perhaps find that he had been landed with an expensive legal tangle.</P>
    <P>However, technical objections to this Bill, while they may be important, do not go to the heart of the matter.  The heart of the matter is that confiscation, whether open or disguised, is wrong in principle. I find it necessary to say this over and over again.  I am not enthusiastic about referring to the Constitution in this context. Of course, confiscation would be unconstitutional.  We have the opinion of successive Attorneys General on that.  To those who see the Constitution as a merely technical obstacle to the abolition of ground rents without compensation, and who believe that a referendum on a proposal for the amendment of the Constitution is the way forward, I say this is not so.  Confiscation is wrong in principle and would remain wrong regardless of constitutional considerations.</P>
    <P>I have already said that purchase is the only legitimate way to abolish ground rents.  It is now clear that the majority of persons accept this.  Already upwards of 40,000 persons have abolished their ground rents by purchase under the Land Registry scheme.  Many more are in the process of doing so.  Apart from the Land Registry scheme, still more have bought out or are buying out in private conveyancing as well as under the purchase scheme which applies to ground rent tenants of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The issue here in the vast majority of cases is that people with surburban property want to acquire the fee simple by buying out their ground rent.  At present <Col N="668" /> the general run is £12, £15, or £20 in ground rent.  This can be bought out by a capital sum of somewhere between £130 and £160 <i>in toto</i> depending on the ground rent.</P>
    <P>As for the comments made by the Deputy on the rights of private property, what we are talking about here is people who have ownership of their own houses and a ground landlord who has the right to collect rent.  This means there is a conflict between interested parties both in possession of private property.  I do not follow the line of argument the Deputy put forward.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann rejects the proposal to close in whole or in part 14 <Col N="670" /> power stations and calls on the Government to give priority to indigenous fuel in its national energy policy and in particular because of the employment they provide in the midlands and the west, to ensure that the ESB's peat fuel stations are kept fully operative.</P>
    <P>In my experience this motion has aroused more interest than most because I have been inundated with requests from Deputies to speak.  I understand it has now been agreed between the parties that this debate will continue next week in order to accommodate some speakers on both sides, but certainly those on the Fianna Fáil side.  There is a very long list indeed of Deputies who want to speak on this motion which they regard of crucial importance.</P>
    <P>Is it not a remarkable thing that we are debating a document which none of us, with the exception of the Minister, has seen?  We are debating a leaked document, leaked in the best traditions in which certain documents get leaked for certain purposes from certain quarters.  It is very unsatisfactory that this House should have to have a major debate of this kind lasting for two weeks on a document no Member of the House other than the Minister has seen.  In any sort of normal democracy, such plans &mdash; which have such fundamental and far-reaching effects on different parts of the country &mdash; should be laid before Parliament so that we might debate them openly without having to have recourse to information from leaks and surreptitiously.  That is not good enough.</P>
    <P>I shall set out for the House the contents of this proposal so far as I am aware of them but of course I cannot guarantee absolutely their accuracy.  In the interests of worthwhile debate here &mdash; and the Minister is responsible also for Dáil reform and the improvement of procedures here &mdash; I would invite him forthwith to lay this document, which I think the ESB call their five-year strategic plan, before the House so that even though I do not have the advantage of reading it before the debate at least other Deputies who may contribute tomorrow or next <Col N="671" /> week will be in a position to refer to it for that purpose.  Since its essentials have been so well leaked, since it will have to be published at some time, the Minister would be only serving the best interests of this House and useful parliamentary debate if he were to publish it now and enable Deputies, other than myself, to avail of its contents.</P>
    <P>Because this proposal, in the form of this motion, is now before us the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Government will have to take into account what is said in the course of this debate before taking any decision on it.  They will not be doing so in a vacuum.  The consequences of what the ESB propose &mdash; about which the Government have conveniently kept entirely quiet in an endeavour to distance themselves from it &mdash; will be spelled out in the course of this debate.  The Minister and the Government will be aware of it.  If they adopt this set of proposals from the ESB they will do so in the full knowledge of what are the circumstances.</P>
    <P>I propose to put on the record of this House the basic proposals of the ESB. Therefore, they will have to take a decision whether or not to acknowledge what are the economic benefits of refusing what the ESB propose.  Allowing these 14 closures, if they consent to this programme, or to much of it and allow the closures, that will serve as an indictment of them, a monument to their insensitivity. It will show a lack of realisation on the part of the Government to local, regional and national economic benefits.</P>
    <P>In the absence of the document we are debating &mdash; it is very unreal that it should be absent and that we should have to debate a document of national importance by way of reference to leaks and nothing better and I do not think there is a Parliament in the world that would not insist on a document it was debating being made available to its Members who have to debate it &mdash; it is particularly ironic that the Minister for Industry and Energy is the Minister who has been designated as the Minister responsible for Dáil reform and parliamentary procedures and that he should be the man who has <Col N="672" /> to reply to this debate.  It really is laughably unreal that this is the position.  But this it is and I have to devote five to ten minutes to setting out the contents of the document we have not seen.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and he usually finds himself at a different level.  The first of the proposed closures relates to the Ringsend station in Dublin city.  It is proposed to close the entire station.  It is a fairly big station with capacity in excess of 300 megawatts.  There are at present somewhere between 200 and 250 men employed there.  It has been a longstanding station in Dublin which has been modernised from time to time and is strategically located in the capital city where there is the major demand for electricity. The next station it is proposed to close in part at least is that at Tarbert in County Kerry.  It is proposed more or less straightaway to close down 120 megawatts of its capacity.  Tarbert is in a different situation from Ringsend because it is a very modern station.  I recall only a few years ago officially opening the second part of Tarbert.  I think it was within the last three years.  It is, therefore, one of the most modern oil-burning stations in Europe.  Its closure has started already. It is also proposed, in what the ESB describe as 1983 &mdash; but which I understand <Col N="673" /> means up to 31 March 1984 because that is the end of their financial year &mdash; to close half of the Great Island station in County Wexford, also a relatively modern station.  It is somewhat older than Tarbert; it was erected within the last 12 or 15 years.  It is not an enormous station by any means.  If half of it is closed down the argument will be advanced very quickly that there is no justification for keeping the remaining half going.  Of course this is part of a semi-State technique, that if you do not want to do something in full, you put the particular project into such a situation that it is rendered uneconomic and then you come along a year later and say, &ldquo;That is uneconomic, we are going to have to close the whole thing down.  We did not really want to at the start.&rdquo;  It means doing in two instalments what they really want to do in one.</P>
      <P>The next proposal for closures this year is part of Marina in Cork city.  It is then proposed to close one of the three units in Portarlington on the Laois-Offaly border and the entire turf fired station at Miltown Malbay in Clare, in this financial year.  One would consider that to be an adequate programme for closures, but it is only the first third of the subsequent three-year programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1984 it is proposed to close the remainder of Portarlington, all of Allenwood in Kildare, two sod peat stations which, it is alleged, are less efficient than the milled peat stations, and to close Cahirciveen, Screeb in west Galway and Gweedore in Donegal.  It is worth noting in relation to Cahirciveen and Gweedore that this year both had very substantial supplies of privately won turf, much of which had been harvested in the last couple of years as a result of the incentives contained in the Turf Development Act, 1981, introduced by the late George Colley as Minister for Energy.  It is particularly sad to see the proposal in relation to Cahirciveen, where 250 private suppliers, most of them local farmers, have become dependent to a fair extent on the money they can make from the supply of turf.  They supplied 17,000 tonnes to that station last summer.  I understand the situation in Gweedore is much the same <Col N="674" />&mdash; it is of considerable local social and economic importance.</P>
    <P>In 1985 it is proposed to close a major part of the station at Ferbane, a milled peat station.  It is also proposed in 1985 to close a major part of the station at Rhode and the whole of the station at Bellacorick in Mayo.  This is particularly difficult for that area because it is the only such operation in Mayo.  Indeed it is the only industrial activity of any kind in that remote area.  A substantial hinterland is entirely dependent on that station. In the same year it is proposed to close Arigna coal station.</P>
    <P>This is all in the context of a country like this, and it is frightening.  The 14 stations listed cover most of the country, much of the midlands and most of the west coast and places in the south east, east and south.  The consequences will be major.  The ESB estimate that 1,460 fewer men will be needed because of this programme, if implemented in full.  The consequences within the ESB will be very serious but they are even more serious for Bord na Móna because the midlands, which never got the level of development one would have wished for, is very dependent on the production of milled or sod peat produced by Bord na Móna. There is no point in producing turf in milled form unless it is burned by the ESB because there is ample capacity for the briquette factories which exist at the moment.  The consequences in the midlands, mainly in Offaly but to a lesser extent in Kildare, will be direct loss of employment for between 800 and 1,000 people in Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>We can take stations like Portarlington and Allenwood.  There is no possibility of them remaining in production of sod peat for sale to anyone other than the ESB because the market for that product is now being met by private producers.  I welcome that development but it makes it all the more important that the bogs associated with stations like Allenwood and Portarlington simply should not be closed down.  I understand there is some dispute about the exact life left in those sod peat bogs but it is estimated to be between five and ten years.  If, as it is proposed, the production of sod peat <Col N="675" /> from those bogs will cease next year it will mean we will have bogs that will not be one thing or the other &mdash; they will not be cutaway bogs that can be used for agricultural development and at the same time they will become sterile from the point of view of fuel production.</P>
    <P>The bogs associated with Bellacorick and Ferbane are estimated to have a life of 20 years.  If 20 years production of indigenous fuel in less developed parts of the country is to be thrown away because fashions have changed in the ESB, this House should say it will not tolerate it. In regard to Arigna, the position can be put in the same category.  It shows how unfeeling the ESB are in their proposals. I am informed there is a life of between four and five years left in Arigna.  The obvious thing to do is to mine that coal in the next four years, burn it and make electricity from it as has been the case in the last 20 or 30 years.  When the coalfield has been mined there is nothing you can do anyway because you have to stop generating electricity from it.  But when you have a mine almost worked out why do you go away and leave four years of coal in it?</P>
    <P>The small turf stations in the west coast serve a very important social purpose. That is why they were established.  When they were established originally, 25 years ago, the ESB opposed them, but later were very glad to have them.  In my time as Minister for Energy, as recently as four years ago, the ESB had a serious shortage of plant.  These stations can fulfil a purpose again in the future.  Emphasis should be laid particularly on the Gweedore and Cahirciveen stations where a significant amount of privately produced turf is being supplied to the ESB.  This serves to keep many people on the land.  It gives remunerative employment in the summer and enables the people to study during the winter or otherwise to live in those localities.</P>
    <P>The idea that many of our oil-fired stations are no longer worth keeping does not seem to gel with the optimistic noises that are being made in regard to the Waterford oilfield, because we might be lucky enough to be in receipt of our own <Col N="676" /> oil in the next few years.  We would look very foolish if we were to close down most of Great Island, which is only 20 or 30 miles from what we hope will be the first Irish oilfield.  We would look rather foolish if a station like Tarbert were mothballed and we discovered that oil is not the hated, feared thing to be imported from the Gulf and other inaccessible places but is an indigenous fuel of our own, just like turf.</P>
    <P>All these proposals need to be thought out and debated very fully but they cannot be debated fully here if the document which sets out the proposals is not published. It is a sign of the unreality of life in this House and Irish political life generally that we are holding a major debate lasting two weeks on a document which the great majority of us have never seen.</P>
    <P>It is worth looking at the strategy of the ESB as set out in this document. Their proposal is that they will use imported coal for a very large proportion of the generating capacity they need. They are rejecting indigenous fuels in support of that.  In furtherance of that policy they have undertaken a very accelerated construction programme at Moneypoint to ensure that a third unit or set will be brought on there as rapidly as possible.  The original proposals for Moneypoint were in respect of four units or sets of 1,200 megawatts.  It was agreed in 1978 when there was a tremendous shortage of capacity here and a very high demand for electricity that construction of the first two sets should start as soon as possible.  The third set seems to have slipped in somewhere along the line.  It was apparently agreed or decided to start that in 1980, a year when the demand for electricity fell away enormously.  Still for some reason the ESB decided to plough ahead.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>On inquiry to the ESB it appears that the level of commitment is so high that 90 per cent of the money will have to be spent anyway.  This is an old gambit of semi-State bodies when they want to do something.  They tell the Government of the day that they have <Col N="677" /> got into a position where they cannot back away because the level of commitment is too high.  When I sought to inquire what the penalty would be if they did not go ahead I was told that the figure would probably be £30 million.  The amount which will be spent will, however, be substantially greater than that. This is at a time when an inquiry has been set up by the present Minister to look into the cost of electricity.</P>
      <P>One of the most obvious reasons for the abnormally high cost of electricity here is the amount of capital investment particularly during the past five or six years.  There was enormous investment, some of which many people would question and some of which was unavoidable. One would question the spending of £50 million since 1979 on the building of ESB offices.</P>
      <P>It is somewhat disturbing to look at the breakdown of ESB borrowings and to find that 75 per cent of borrowings are made abroad.  The devaluation of the IR£ which took place in March this year with the encouragement and full approval of the Government has cost the ESB about £100 million in extra repayments because most of their borrowings are in US dollars, Swiss/Deutschemarks, sterling and Japanese yen.  The devaluation of the IR£ against these currencies has not been the 8.5 per cent average as against the EMS currencies but has been very substantially higher and in the case of the US dollar has been approaching 25 per cent over the past 12 months.  More than a quarter of the ESB's borrowings are in US dollars. People ask plaintively why our electricity charges are so high and this one of the reasons which is not often adverted to.  Further heavy investment will be funded primarily from foreign borrowing in non-EMS currencies where the rate of devaluation of the IR£ is extremely high.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth contrasting the attitude of the authorities to the utilisation of indigenous energy resources with that of authorities in other countries.  One country I visited recently for the purpose of looking at energy activities was Finland, a country not unlike ours in many ways, having a population roughly the same size and somewhat less well endowed <Col N="678" /> with indigenous resources.  It is a well-run and very successful country which is a leader in many aspects of energy technology and energy use and the electricity price to the consumer is substantially lower than here, in spite of their unfavourable climate.</P>
    <P>On 24 February this year Finland published a White Paper on energy and I should like to quote two passages from this report which show the attitude in that country to their domestic or indigenous fuel resources and to contrast it with the attitude here which is to close down things which come from Ireland and to put all our eggs into the imported basket, adding further to the import bill.  The White Paper states:</P>
    <P>Finland's main energy policy objectives continue to lie within a relevant frame of reference from the point of view of the national economy:</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensuring a secure supply of energy in accordance with the objectives established for national security and domestic economic activity.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the economic use of energy, i.e. efficient, economic uses of energy that avoid waste</P>
    <P>&mdash; increasing the share of domestic energy sources in the total supply by increasing the use of domestic sources and the share of other domestic production inputs in the energy economy.</P>
    <P>Part of the White Paper deals with peat. Many of us may never have thought in terms of Finland having any peat and we may have regarded ourselves as the principal producers of peat.  There are quite substantial reserves of peat in Finland, mainly in the northern part of the country around and inside the Arctic Circle. It is difficult to produce and the quality of the peat is poor.  It is very fibrous and has nothing like the thermal efficiency of our peat.  Notwithstanding that, the official policy of the Finnish Government as approved by the Finnish Parliament in February this year is as follows:</P>
    <P>The production and use of peat as a fuel have grown rapidly in recent years. The experience gained has been <Col N="679" /> encouraging.  A distinct increase from the 1982 level of c. 17 million m³ is feasible both in terms of peat resources and of its potential level of consumption.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure increased production of fuel peat, attempts will be made to secure in advance the availability of sufficient peatland for the producers. Possibilities for the acquisition of peatland by municipal and private peat producers and processing plants will be improved.</P>
    <P>Sufficient peat production potential will be created by setting aside production areas in case of long-term interruptions in the availability of imported fuels.  The readiness of consumers to use peat will be increased by installing stand-by equipment suitable for using peat, particularly in peat production, already at the construction stage.  Sufficient availability of peat resources will be secured to meet the needs of possible new, peat-fired condensation power plants and chemical processing plants.</P>
    <P>That gives an idea of the attitude of the government and the people in Finland today.  They used to lag very far behind us, have nothing like the value of our resources in peat and would gladly use our peat if they could.  They are using inferior peat that can only be recovered in difficult areas, some of it close to the Arctic Circle, and here we are with one of the mildest climates in the world and with the best quality peat in the world proposing to close down stations so that we can use coal from the United States which we will pay for in dollars, from Poland which we will pay for in sterling and from Australia which we will also pay for in US dollars.</P>
    <P>Finland would regard us as mad to be doing what we are doing.  If we have the opportunity to debate this programme properly, this House will be convinced also that we are mad to be doing what the ESB are now trying to do in this silly, surreptitious way.  Are they ashamed to publish what they want to do?  One of the reasons that the ESB have been given an <Col N="680" /> excuse to stop using peat is because of the pricing policy in relation to peat that has been adopted here in recent years. There has been a major price jump &mdash; I could not lay my hands on the exact figures &mdash; of something in the region of 115 per cent in the last few years.  The ambition, as I well remember, of Bord na Móna when I was dealing with them and when I said no to them every time, was to get the price of peat up to an oil-related level.  I ask the House to consider why should we, as a sovereign nation, able to make our own decisions, choose to price an indigenous resource at an arbitrary figure that is dependent on things like revolutions in Iran, the blocking of the Straits of Hormuz, the Arab-Israeli conflict and other factors which over the last decade have led to or can potentially lead to increases in the price of oil?  This is our resource which we should use for the benefit of our people.</P>
    <P>After I left the Depatment of Energy, Bord na Móna got a major price increase but the very thing I said would happen has happened, the ESB are given an excuse not to use it.  Our trouble in energy as in so many other things is that every body likes to see themselves as independent and autonomous and there is no drawing together of all these bodies to make their policies coherent and cohesive in the national interest.  Each one is allowed to bang and hammer off the other.  That is the function of the Department and the function of a Minister and I invite him, in this case in particular, instead of letting them bang against one another, contrary to the national interest, to bang their heads together and put some sense into them.  Unless they are treated that way they will develop a form of arrogant autonomy which puts their body before the national interest.  That cannot be tolerated and this House should not tolerate it.</P>
    <P>At present the delivered price of milled peat to ESB power stations is IR£15.90. The FOB ex-bog price is hard to calculate because it is never given but since the transport distances are only a few kilometres at most, it is probably somewhere in the region of £14 to £15 ex-bog.  It is interesting to compare the fact that the <Col N="681" /> ex-bog price in Finland of similar milled peat is £9.  If Bord na Móna, instead of striving for an enormously healthy profit and loss account and balance sheet, were to reduce the price of milled peat to their only customer, the ESB, by £5 per ton and bring it down to say, £11 or thereabouts, the ESB would have no excuse for not using a lot of it.  It would be in the national interest, both economically and socially, to do that and it should certainly be done because it is the only solution I see to this situation.</P>
    <P>It is projected that this year Bord na Móna will make a profit of £15 million on a relatively small turnover.  They are not in the same league as the ESB.  What is the point of Bord na Móna making a profit of £15 million?  The previous chief executive, now retired and I wish him well in his retirement, told me that unless they could make good profits of that kind they would not be able to build various major capital projects which they planned to do such as the Ballyforan briquette plant.  We know that Ballyforan is now off the map but they are still holding on to their £15 million profit.  What is the point of this kind of activity?  Why should a semi-State body unnecessarily generate profit of that kind?  If there has to be some external level to which the price of peat must be fixed, the obvious thing on which to peg it is the price of coal because it is much closer to coal both in thermal value and in the nature of the product. The price of coal in comparison with oil is about two-thirds or a little less.  If you had, therefore, a one-third reduction to the ESB in the price of milled peat, the ESB would have no reason not to continue to burn peat for electricity generation and not to do the very same things as Finland are doing, because I have seen them building peat burning stations in many parts of that country.  The economics of it are all against them because milled peat has to be transported long distances in that country.  It has only to be transported very short distances here and we are fortunate that most of our best milled peat reserves are in the centre of the country.  We have tremendous potential and we are throwing it away and going into enormous capital expenditure, <Col N="682" /> most of which is imported and has to be paid for in foreign currencies and tremendous loss to our economy, unemployment in the ESB and, more particularly, in Bord na Móna.  The ESB at least have some scope to offer to unemployed staff as they may be able to redeploy them elsewhere.  The people who are disemployed in Bord na Móna have no prospect whatever of employment in any other sphere of activity in that company. I wish to conclude by asking the House to pass this motion:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann rejects the proposal to close in whole or in part 14 power stations and calls on the Government to give priority to indigenous fuel in its national energy policy and in particular because of the employment they provide in the midlands and the west, to ensure that the ESB's peat fuel stations are kept fully operative.</P>
    <P>and to reject this amendment which we got in the last hour.  I do not know whether it was in order or not because I understood some notice has to be given with amendments.</P>

The amendment is a wishy-washy one to endorse the action of the Government setting up an inquiry to investigate prices and so on, a vague sort of amendment.  Anyone who has the interest of many parts of this country at heart and who has the interest of the sensible utilisation of our own resources as an independent nation and who rejects the unnecessary import sources of energy which puts our whole electricity generation scene under a certain amount of unnecessary strain and risk, must vote for this motion, to ensure that we will not in the eighties turn our backs on the very good work that was done by men of vision and idealism in the thirties, forties and fifties to ensure that our principal indigenous fuel would be <Col N="683" /> properly developed for the benefit of the country.  They did that at a time when that fuel was laughed at and was little more than a musichall joke.  The ESB's memory in this matter has been very short because four years ago they were more than glad of it.  My forecast is that in the not too distant future they may well be glad of it again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and insert:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;endorses the action of the Government in setting up the Inquiry to investigate systematically the reasons for the high cost of electricity, notes that the ESB has submitted to the Government a five year Strategic Plan and calls on the Government to have due regard to the social, regional and strategic implications of the use of indigenous fuel in national energy policy when considering this Plan.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>As I have made quite clear in a number of public statements since the matter was leaked, the Government have not made any decisions on these proposals.  I fully agree with Deputy O'Malley and others that they are proposals of serious implications in terms of employment, social implications and so on.  I also, however, have to concede, as I have said, that the cost of electricity is very high here.  As far as industrial consumers are concerned, of 16 major competing electricity utilities in Europe &mdash; I say competing because the people who use Irish electricity have to compete with whatever products they are selling with people who are using electricity generated elsewhere &mdash; Irish electricity was either the highest or second highest of all.  As a country which depends to the extent of 48 per cent of all we produce on exports we cannot afford to be carrying costs that are unduly high.  This is something which the ESB realise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Firstly, they realise that their survival as a public utility, and the survival of all <Col N="684" /> State companies, the ESB and those supplying that concern such as Bord na Mona, depends on the ability of the competitive export sector of our economy to sell abroad.  There is no doubt that this competitive export sector of our economy is handicapped by high electricity costs.  I have been at considerable pains to make the point that it is in the first instance the responsibility of the boards to take this matter into account. In the case of the ESB they have been appointed as the experts on electricity generation and, if they find that the cost of what they are producing is higher than the cost of other utilities with whom their customers must compete, it is undoubtedly part of the responsibility conferred on them by this House to do something about that situation.  The same goes for Bord na Móna and the other utilities.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley asked about the possibility of publishing the strategic plan.  It is not my document; it is the ESB's strategic plan.  They brought it forward as an internal document and sent a copy to me. I would be prepared to consider Deputy O'Malley's request.  Deputy O'Malley has not made an unreasonable point, but I would not like to give him a commitment about it this minute; I will need to have some consultations.  Deputy O'Malley put a lot of weight &mdash; I do not disagree with him &mdash; on the very heavy overcapacity the ESB have.  Their interest charges in respect of capacity at present represent 25p out of every pound a consumer pays for electricity.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley mentioned the Moneypoint situation.  I should like to say that the Minister for Industry and Commerce at the time, Deputy O'Malley, on 18 July 1978 announced that he had given approval to the ESB for this major coal-fired generating station at Moneypoint.  That was in regard to the general project.  As far as phase three, which Deputy O'Malley said the ESB have started, is concerned, the Deputy might have mentioned that on 28 March 1980 the late Mr. George Colley, who was then Minister for Energy, gave full approval for the third coal-fired 300 megawatt generating unit at Moneypoint, subject to the condition that it <Col N="685" /> would be dual-firing and would be capable, like the other two units, of operating on oil if circumstances so required. Deputy O'Malley also put considerable weight &mdash; I do not really disagree with him &mdash; on the question of oil-related peat prices.  It is no harm to recall that those prices were set by my predecessor, Deputy Reynolds when Minister for Industry and Energy.  I mention those matters to put the record straight. Deputy O'Malley's speech was a constructive and interesting one and it is one that will be helpful to the House in looking at this issue.  I hope I can respond in a similar manner.</P>
    <P>I should like to summarise the difficulties now facing the ESB and how important the different elements in this are. The board have submitted a strategic plan which represents their blueprint to solve their problems.  It has certain assumptions and one is that the recovery from the recession will be slow and, consequently, growth in electricity demand will also be slow.  Other assumptions are that the ESB will face competition from other energies, that foreign borrowings will continue to be expensive and that living standards will not rise as fast as they did in the sixties and seventies.  In all of those circumstances they say &mdash; and I believe they are correct &mdash; that they have to cut costs in their operation if they are to be able to sell the product and compete both with its competitors in Ireland and so that its customers can compete with their competitors abroad.  The board proposes to reduce costs by way of reduced staff numbers, improvements in administration and accounting procedures and the decommissioning of older stations.  These include some turf-burning stations which range in age from 25 to 33 years.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to put this debate in context and I urge Members to look at the most recently published annual report of the ESB when preparing their speeches.  At the end of that report there are statements about the relative costs, the works costs and fuel costs, of different electricity generating stations.  In a lot of the proposals that have been made by the ESB one can see how rational or not they <Col N="686" /> are by comparing them with the actual cost.  For instance, to take the oil-fired station in Great Island in Wexford, the fuel cost there is 3.9p and the other works cost 1p making a total of about 4.9p. Compare that with the small sod peat stations where the fuel cost is 4.9p but the other works cost per unit sent out comes to 9.3p giving a total cost per unit of 14p as against 4.9p in the other case. For example at Aghada, County Cork, a gas station, the fuel cost per unit sent out is 1.7p and the other works cost is 0.2p. We are talking there of a cost less than 2p.</P>

The ESB report for the most recent year will be available soon and Deputies will be able to verify the information I have given.</P>
      <P>The plan envisages a reduction in staffing numbers by 5 per cent per annum.  In marketing they envisage the maintenance of a strong presence of electricity in the energy market by developing new uses for electricity and the shaping of loads to give satisfactory financial contribution. Scope is also seen for developing tariff structures which achieve financial objectives.</P>

    <P>I have appointed an inquiry group of personnel from the Departments of Industry and Energy, Finance, and Trade, Commerce and Tourism with a representative from Irish industry.

      <P>I will raise my voice. The main terms of reference of the group are to identify costs which are higher in Ireland compared with other countries, to identify and analyse the reasons for those higher costs, to make recommendations to achieve lower prices in the short and in the long terms and to consider the scope for reducing prices arising from greater use of private electricity facilities.  The group held their first meeting early last month and are required to report finally to me within six months of that date on the outcome of their inquiry. However, the group are required to report to me within two months on those factors which, in their view, are susceptible to speedy quantification and early action.  The interim report will be due early next month.  Obviously I do not want to anticipate the findings of the group.  I have indicated already that Irish prices are considerably higher.  The unit cost to a representative industrial user was 5.62p in Ireland as compared with 4.44p in the EEC.  This latter comparison gives an excess for the Irish price over the European average of 26.6 per cent.</P>

      <P>It is true that decisions by successive Governments have affected the ESB's financial position.  Successive Governments have been reluctant to approve ESB price increases when recommended by the National Prices Commission. Those delays had an effect on the board's income.  Charges <i>in lieu</i> of rates have been levied on previously <Col N="689" /> exempted properties.  These costs represent a part of the picture which must be objectively assessed, but only part of the picture.  Compared with total ESB costs they are a very small proportion.  In the case of rates, the cost would represent only about 3.5 per cent of total ESB costs.</P>
      <P>The more important consideration is that the general recession has contributed to a cut in the yearly growth rates of over 8 per cent in electricity demand down to, or indeed below, zero.  Demand has picked up from this low point but future projected growth is nothing like what the ESB have become accustomed to.</P>
      <P>How do the various components of ESB costs measure up to each other in relative importance?  This is best illustrated by looking at the costs that have to be met from every £1 collected by the ESB from their customers.  Taking the 1982-1983 position, 42p went on fuel, 25p to service capital, 22p on payroll costs and 11p on miscellaneous expenses.  The ESB, understandably, have laid great stress on their fuel costs and suggest this is the critical variable.  It has also been the element for which they have tended to blame the Government of the day and this is something I should like to look at now.</P>
      <P>The 1982-1983 fuel bill was nearly £240 million.  These fuels were used to generate electricity as follows: natural gas provided 51.5 per cent of the units exported from generating plant and the fuel cost of these units was 1.79p per unit; oil provided 26 per cent of the units and the fuel cost of these units was 3.81p per unit, considerably higher than natural gas.  The ESB have tended to blame the Government for the high price of this fuel.  Peat provided 16 per cent for which the unit fuel cost was 3.20p in the case of milled peat, 3.77p in the case of sod peat and 3.28p per unit cost for all peat.  The figure of 42 per cent of all fuels, although it was the highest single cost component, was lower as a percentage of costs than it had been for the past eight years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus, while oil only provided 26 per cent of the units, its cost was 40 per cent of the fuel bill.  By contrast, natural gas which supplied over 50 per cent of the units accounted for only 37 per cent of <Col N="690" /> the bill.  Had natural gas not been available to the ESB, their fuel bill for imported oil would have risen by some £95 million.  This fact needs to be borne in mind when the ESB complain, as they sometimes do, about the price of natural gas to them.  The position has changed this year by virtue of changes in the price of both milled peat and natural gas.  The natural gas bill for the ESB will increase to £132 million in 1983-84, still £52 million below what it would be if oil had to be used.  In addition, a significant improvement in the efficiency of gas utilisation will occur both by virtue of the more efficient plant becoming available at North Wall and Poolbeg, and because of a reduction in transmission losses in sending power from Cork to Dublin.  The change in peat prices approved by the previous Government means an increase which will add 5.5 per cent to the ESB peat fuel bill in 1983-84, at 1982-83 levels of consumption.</P>
    <P>The ESB are at present getting an average of about 150 million cubic feet per day of natural gas.  This represents progressive increases over a period of years on their original allocation.  As I have indicated, last year they met about 51 per cent of their electricity demand from this fuel.  They are currently paying 24p per therm for the gas.  The price originally payable by the ESB was, effectively, a cost price and did not remotely represent the intrinsic value of this versatile fuel.  Although the price has since been adjusted upwards, it is still very low. If the ESB were getting no natural gas they would be using fuel oil which, on the basis of recent oil market prices, would cost them about 37p per therm as against 24p.</P>
    <P>Base load electricity generation is not the most desirable use of natural gas.  It can be far more efficiently used in the premium fuel markets which would include domestic, commercial and industrial heating and cooking and also certain industrial processes.  An advantage of selling gas in these markets is that we will be substituting it for the high-cost imported premium fuels which have been used by these customers.  In this way the most efficient possible use is made of the <Col N="691" /> gas, the impact on our balance of payments is maximised and the market can competitively bear a price which will generate much-needed revenue to the Exchequer for redistribution to the community, in respect of a commodity that belongs to them.</P>
    <P>I am not suggesting that the gas should not have been given to the ESB or that they should not continue to get gas for a few more years.  It is only within the past year that we have got the infrastructure to start distributing natural gas direct to the consumer.  The sale of gas to the ESB provided a basis initially for the development of the Kinsale Head field and for the extension of the distribution system which has been carried out.  I believe that the role played by the ESB in this has been very adequately recognised by the favourable price which they have enjoyed for a number of years and which they continue to enjoy at present.</P>
    <P>The board take the view that successive Governments have been treating them badly on the gas issue and they have proposed an additional short-term annual allocation of 30 million cubic feet per day at a price of 16.9p.  I do not accept that successive Governments have treated them badly.  This would constitute a further subsidy of around £20 million as compared with the price of HFO.</P>
    <P>There has also been reference to additional fuel oil costs arising from Whitegate although the ESB have not recently belaboured this point.  When Whitegate restarted it was locked into quite expensive crude supplies during the very turbulent period in the oil market before the reduction in official selling prices came into operation.  The purchase of Whitegate fuel oil involved a significant cost penalty for the ESB at that time.  Since then the fuel oil market has developed in a way that the HFO from Whitegate has a value as a feed-stock for further processing in modern refineries which is higher than its straight fuel value.  As a result most of the oil which the ESB would have taken has been exported and has reduced the impact of Whitegate on ESB oil to insignificant proportions.</P>
    <P>The development of our turf resources <Col N="692" /> has been regarded as a national objective on which there has been a large measure of consensus for decades.  At certain times this policy has served us particularly well.  At all times it has served objectives which some people would say transcend purely economic criteria.</P>
    <P>There is not, however, so far as I can ascertain &mdash; certainly not publicly available &mdash; an authoritative analysis of what the costs and benefits are of having turf-based electricity generation.  I am certainly not suggesting that it is a bad policy and that we should move from it.  It is simply that, in the absence of complete and objective information, everyone is free to take any view he likes without having to support it with the use of data. The starting point for the debate should be to establish clearly whether, and if so to what extent, ESB consumers are subsidising Bord na Móna's turf development programme.  If there is such a subsidy and the size of it can be clearly identified it would be a matter for the Government and, indeed, for the community as a whole to reach a conclusion on whether this subsidy was value for money in national terms.  The practice down the years when successive development programmes and projects have been launched, largely without full analysis in national terms, has clearly proved to be unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy O'Malley said about this matter, I have taken the unusual initiative of bringing all of these bodies together &mdash; for the first time they have ever to my knowledge been brought together &mdash; to discuss their overall corporate management proposals.  I believe, as I take it he does, that an overall view should be taken of the operation of these boards and their interactions and that they should not be allowed to treat themselves as independent republics.  They are part of this great republic of Ireland and they should be seen as such.</P>
    <P>In relation to the ESB strategic plan, and specifically to the ESB proposals to phase out certain turf-burning capacity, I will get the two boards to go, between them, into the whole area of turf usage and prices.  It may be necessary to bring other judgments to bear on what the <Col N="693" /> boards report to me but this is a necessary first step.  My own present feeling is that, given the relativities that exist today, the cost of peat-fired electricity is out of line as compared with electricity generated from other fuels and there may be a case for some reduction in the price of milled peat to the ESB.  Before arriving at a clear and final view on this I will need to have the results of the review which I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Clearly, if that were to happen it would change the economics of some of the proposals that are now being made in the ESB strategic plan.  That economic derives, as I have indicated, from a decision taken by the previous Government to raise this milled peat price charged to the ESB.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say how long the review is expected to take?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not like to say that now.  It is apparent from the 1982-83 published accounts of the ESB that 25p in every £ of income goes towards servicing capital.  As one looks ahead towards the completed costs of Moneypoint one observes that the ESB will have to cope with a capital investment totalling £800 million&mdash;£900 million.  This major extension to generating capacity will undoubtedly add to the security of electricity supplies to the country, based as it is on coal.</P>
      <P>It is worth recollecting that 80 per cent of the world's energy reserves are in the form of coal and only 20 per cent in the form of oil and gas hence coal generating capacity is an important strategic security consideration.  However, the cost of this major capital project will have to be borne by the ESB in high interest charges for many years to come.</P>
      <P>The third most important element in ESB costs arises in respect of payroll. This is an area where it is not realistic to look for quick and dramatic savings.  The ESB have, through natural wastage, secured certain staff reductions.  The board's strategic plan, however, intends to achieve further reductions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the time available to me.  I have attempted to put before the House a balanced presentation of the more important <Col N="694" /> elements affecting the ESB.  What is immediately apparent is the great number of significant variables in this complicated equation.  The interaction of all costs involved in the generation of electricity, together with regional and economic implications, is one that requires very careful consideration.  I would like to assure the House that I intend to ensure that all of these facts are properly considered.  I will not be rushed into hasty decisions on any proposals emanating from the ESB, whether they have been leaked to the papers or not.</P>

We must realise that (a) we have over-capacity, (b) some forms of generating electricity cost more than others and it is not possible simply to ignore these and ignore the cost imposed on the consumer.  If we are to have a useful debate I hope that the contents of the 1981-82 annual report and the appendix in regard to relative generating costs, both works costs and fuel costs, will be borne in mind by Deputies in their contributions.  If they do not do so I do not believe we will have a realistic debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising an issue of great concern generally regarding employment.  At the outset, I ask leave to share my time with my colleagues, Deputy Seán Walsh and Deputy O'Dea.</P>
      <P>I have acted very responsibly.  For seven weeks now I have been aware of an on-going dispute affecting industry throughout the length and breadth of the country.  This is causing lay-offs in some industries and protective notices being served in others.  At a time of serious and difficult economic climate it is creating and threatening to create further unemployment. I do not raise this issue here with any relish.  I sat in the Minister's place for many years, pilloried and attacked and advised by the experts then on this side of the House in regard to how problems of this nature could be resolved.  The <i>laissez faire</i> approach which has overtaken our industrial relations in the past year is unbelievable. Strikes and disputes are allowed to take place and to continue, no matter to what extent the public are inconvenienced.  No Minister for Labour can afford to say, in this House or elsewhere, that his policy is either non-intervention or intervention. No two disputes are ever the same, nor is the public inconvenience resulting from them the same.  One must take into account many factors before one decides whether or not to intervene in a dispute.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome to the House the Minister of State, who is a very hard-working Member.  I say that very sincerely because I am aware of the efforts which he is putting into his portfolio.  It is not <Col N="697" /> fair that he should be saddled with the industrial relations portfolio in this House tonight.  It is a very heavy one for any Minister to handle, but to apportion it to an already very busy Minister is not entirely fair.  I do not want to go into the details of the dispute, which arose mainly because of a consultant's report which created a new grading structure in the clerical staff of Irish Industrial Gases.  I know that they are a multinational company, part of the huge British Oxygen Company.  This is a dispute on the interpretation of salary structure.  There are two sides to every row of this nature &mdash; in this case the employer and employees. I have not the same access to the detailed information on this case as has the Minister of the day, but the seven weeks that the dispute has all been allowed to continue has caused immense hardship&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and a lot of uncertainty.  To a large extent a monopoly situation arises, although in my own constituency we have a small company producing industrial gas, a company which has a proud industrial relations record.  Despite that, they do not fill all the gas needs of my constituency and the area of Cork &mdash; an area at present ravaged by unemployment and neglected by this Government to the extent that one would think they were saying &ldquo;We are going to get you because you gave us a majority&rdquo;.  That majority has already been eroded and an election tomorrow in my city would yield a different result from that of a year ago.  I am glad to have been associated with and been a Minister of a Government which endeavoured to ensure that Murphy's Brewery during its period of turmoil over a year ago would be saved to the people of Cork and the tradition of a couple of hundred years continued.  How glad we were when the brewery was taken over by Heinekin's. What must the new management be thinking when they have decided to get their own gas unit, to invest substantial capital, following on what Guinness's did some years back?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to name the companies <Col N="698" /> in which protective notice has been served and people laid off, although I could list a large number in my constituency and throughout the country.  I raise this issue more to help the Minister and the Government to take cognisance of the existing problems.  Problems of this nature have not a habit of going away. Tradition has shown that the longer a dispute continues the more difficult and intractable negotiations tend to become. I am telling the Minister that a problem exists which is having far-reaching effects on very many people and will affect industry in the future.  I will not name some of the companies at present exporting for further processing abroad.  It is affecting the companies concerned and associated companies in other countries. This cannot be helping our image.  I am aware that the Minister has said that his policy is one of non-intervention, but the efforts at settlement have been unsuccessful to date.  These efforts may be continuing, but I am not aware of any worthwhile progress which might help towards withdrawing the protective notice already given.</P>
    <P>We are well on our way to an unemployment figure of 200,000 and before this winter is over that figure will have been significantly passed.  Why must we allow a situation to develop which will add and is adding further numbers to our unemployment figures?  I repeat that I am not here in any mischievous way.  I have had too long experience of the difficulties on the industrial relations scene.  I have been extremely patient, as Opposition spokesman, in this issue and am urging the Minister to take a greater interest and to ensure at least that efforts are made towards finding a solution at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Fitzgerald for sharing his time with me. He has outlined the background to this dispute and the reason for the present impasse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to refer very briefly to the consequences of this dispute being felt in my own constituency, the mid-West region. I was contacted this evening by the personnel managers of two factories which, <Col N="699" /> like Deputy Fitzgerald, I do not wish to name.  They have said that their work force have been put on protective notice from Friday.  In all, these two factories employ over 1,100 people.  They are two of the largest employers in my constituency. They are both located in one industrial estate on the verge of Limerick city.</P>
    <P>In the past few days I was contacted by other people in the management of various factories in and around Limerick city and in the mid-Western region generally. They told me they have put their employees on protective notice, or are about to do so if this dispute is not resolved this week.  It is deplorable and intolerable that people who hold positions which enable them to exercise a certain amount of industrial muscle are prepared to turn the screw at this stage of the country's economic history.  Like Deputy Fitzgerald, I appeal to the Minister not to look at this dispute in the narrow context of whether what he is doing is intervention or non-intervention, or in the context of the Opposition appealing to the Government to intervene in yet another strike, but in the context of the horrific unemployment figure and the devastating blows which have rained down on the mid-Western region.</P>
    <P>I can tell the Minister of State and the Minister for Labour that, if unemployment gets much worse, the future of the system under which we operate will be at risk.  This attitude of non-intervention and allowing unemployment to increase by default could almost be described as insane.  I have information which suggests that, if people are laid off in the next week or the next fortnight because of continuance of this industrial dispute, some of them will not be taken back again.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this in the broad context of the general unemployment situation.  I urge him, with all the eloquence and sincerity I can muster, to intervene in this dispute and bring it to an end before more people are laid off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little joy for us in having to raise this matter here tonight. This firm is located in the constituency <Col N="700" /> adjoining my own.  I am acquainted with this firm and I have been dealing with them for many years, I hope the Minister and the Government realise how serious the situation is for my constituency, particularly when we think of the numbers unemployed in the Walkinstown, Tallaght and Clondalkin areas.  Earlier today we heard about the Clondalkin paper mills.</P>
      <P>This strike has now been going on for over seven weeks.  Many people have been laid off and many people are on short time as a result of the strike.  Other industries are badly affected by the strike.  The garage business, which is practically nil at present, is badly hit. Engineering firms are also hit, not to mention hospitals.  I know there is a supply to the hospitals.  I urge the Minister to take the necessary steps in the hope that it might be possible to get the strikers back to work.  Over 200,000 people are unemployed.  Most of the unemployment centres around the Dublin area, and particularly the areas I have mentioned. This strike is making the situation worse.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Fitzgerald said, when we were on that side of the House he had to listen to advice about what should be done and the approach that should be adopted.  As I said, this strike has been going on for over seven weeks.  Some approach has been made but we heard very little about it.  I hope the Minister will tell us something tonight.  I recall seeing a programme on television some months ago in which the Minister participated. I think it dealt with his own constituency. Many young people asked him about work prospects.  He told them that, no matter how they had tried, they should continue to try harder.  If the Minister were in that position tonight what would he say to them?  I hope we will hear something encouraging from the Minister. I represent the constituency of Dublin south west.  Unemployment is rampant in Tallaght, Clondalkin and Walkinstown.  I appeal to the Minister to make a special effort to have something done about this strike.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy <Col N="701" /> Fitzgerald began his remarks by labelling the policy of the Minister for Labour on industrial relations as <i>laissez faire</i> and standing aside.  I want to say here and now that the Minister for Labour has a very clearly thought out position on industrial disputes which has been shown to work.  An examination of the statistics for this year shows a very favourable comparison with statistics for previous years.  I am making that general observation before coming to the specifics of the dispute.</P>
      <P>As of this afternoon my Department have not been notified of any loss in employment due to this dispute.  I do not say that to minimise in any way the gravity of the situation, because it is very grave.  Having listened to the contributions made by Deputies on the other side of the House, people who have doubts about the gravity of the situation will have had their doubts dispelled.  The situation is very grave.  But it is true that of this afternoon we have not been notified of any loss of employment due to this dispute.  Over the past few weeks we have had indications of possible difficulties and we have been informed of a number of cases of people being put on protective notice, but there has been no loss of employment as of this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Deputy Fitzgerald mentioned part of the background to the dispute and it might be helpful to the House if I filled in some of the details.</P>
      <P>The dispute at Irish Industrial Gases Ltd., which is a wholly owned subsidiary of British Oxygen Ltd., concerns a claim on behalf of about 60 clerical workers for improved salary scales.  The union's claim was turned down at a Labour Court hearing in February 1982 following which further negotiations took place between management and the union, and an interim settlement of 5.6 per cent was paid to all clerical workers.  The dispute continued, and threatened industrial action was deferred after the appointment of a mediator.  The mediator's findings were accepted by the union but rejected in part by the company.  Strike notice was served and the strike commenced on 2 September 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Court again investigated <Col N="702" /> the dispute and the court's recommendation was issued on 28 September.  The Labour Court's recommendation was rejected by the workers in a secret ballot. Following that rejection the Minister for Labour requested the Employer Labour Conference to convene as a matter of urgency to consider the dispute.  The steering committee of the Employer Labour Conference met on Monday, 3 October, and later that evening issued a statement to the effect that, as no grounds for negotiation existed between the parties, there was nothing which they could do at that stage.</P>
    <P>Following contact between the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers a further formula for settlement was put to a ballot of the workers in Cork and Dublin on 19 October.  The formula was overwhelmingly rejected by 57 votes to seven.  It would be helpful if I told the House the formula put to the workers:</P>
    <P>1.  Without prejudice to the decisions of the Tribunal referred to at (2) below, normal work will be resumed immediately on the terms and conditions of employment applying at 1 September 1983, subject only to the provisions agreed between the company and the union in respect of the employees named at Appendix 1 (28 persons).</P>
    <P>2.  An independent Tribunal consisting of Mr. Tadhg O'Cearbhaill, Chairman, Mr. Terry Baker and Mr. Harry O'Hare shall be established to decide</P>
    <P>&ldquo;having regard to all factors, including the application of Clause 6 of the Interim Agreement between the company and the union if and where relevant, the appropriate point on the individual's agreed scale for each of the 47 staff members listed at Appendix 2&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The company and the union shall each appoint a person to act as Technical Assessor to the Tribunal.</P>
    <P>3.  The decisions of the Tribunal shall apply only to those listed in Appendix 2 and shall be binding on both parties.</P>
    <P>The essential basis of the formula was <Col N="703" /> that an independent tribunal be established which would adjudicate on the dispute and that in the meantime normal work would be resumed immediately.</P>
    <P>The present position is that continuing efforts are being made to obtain a formula which will lead to a settlement.  The company contend that the workers concerned are paid about 20 per cent more than similar analogous employments.  On the other hand, the union are adamant that they are correct in pursuing what they see as a legitimate claim.  This has resulted in deadlock.</P>
    <P>I am concerned at the wider effects of this dispute and the facts I have given are evidence of such concern.  The details of interventions listed show clearly that every dispute-settling facility has been made available to both parties in this dispute.  Both sides are aware that the <Col N="704" /> industrial relations machinery of the State continues to be available to help them reach a solution.</P>
    <P>This dispute has highlighted the fact that an important part of our industry is dependent on one source of supply.  That I believe to be an unsatisfactory situation which requires careful consideration.  In those circumstances I have asked my Department to submit a report to me on that question and to do so in consultation with other appropriate Departments and State agencies.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the potentially very grave implications of this dispute, I appeal to both the company and the union to make every effort to reach a satisfactory solution.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 8.55 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 October 1983.</P>

      <P>Ministerial sanction would arise only in the event of an application by the local authority for approval to raise a loan for acquisition and development of any particular site.  There is no such proposal before my Department in respect of a site at Ballydineen, Doneraile.</P>
      <P>I understand that Cork County Council have passed a resolution under section 4 of the City and County management (Amendment) Act, 1955, directing the county manager not to proceed with the development in question.</P>

      <P>The plans for the scheme were approved on the basis that Kerry County Council would make a water supply available to the group from the Castleisland Regional Scheme.  Due to current demands being made on the regional water scheme it is understood that the council would find it difficult to supply the Ballybeg scheme.  Accordingly, negotiations were entered into between the group, Kerry County Council and Kerry Co-operative Creameries to obtain an alternative supply.  It is understood that negotiations have not yet reached a satisfactory conclusion, and that the group are now considering sinking a bore hole or well in the vicinity of the lough in the Currow area to serve the scheme.  Until a water supply is available to the group the scheme cannot be completed.</P>

      <P>I have received the request in question and have asked for a further submission from the group on the points they wish to raise to enable me to consider whether a meeting would be appropriate.</P>
      <P>There is a long tradition among local authorities of charging for services and I do not regard this as unsatisfactory, provided due regard is had to hardship cases.</P>
      <P>There are no funds available to me from which to provide additional finance to Laois County Council in relation to the matter in question.  I might mention that, since taking office, the Government provided an additional £31.5 million in rate support grants for local authorities, over and above the amounts provided for in the Public Service Estimates published in November last.  Laois County Council's share of this is over £340,000.</P>

      <P>My Department give every possible encouragement and assistance in providing accommodation for travelling <Col N="504" /> families.  In the case of families wishing to be housed, and entitled to housing, the local housing authorities have been encouraged to give the families due consideration in accordance with the statutory schemes of letting priorities.</P>
      <P>Accommodation provided under the regular housing programme for such families is financed in the normal way under that programme.  For those who cannot appropriately be housed, local authorities have been encouraged to make available places on serviced sites.  Capital is allocated by the Department for every approved proposal of a local authority for special accommodation schemes and for serviced sites and there is a 100 per cent subsidy on annual loan charges.  In addition, my Department provides 90 per cent financial assistance towards the cost of employing social workers engaged in the settlement programme.</P>
      <P>The Travelling People Review Group, which was set up in January 1981, presented their report last May.

      <P>I was extremely disappointed to learn, on 6 October last, of the announcement by Thomas De La Rue &amp; Co. Ltd., of its intention to close its factory at Clonskeagh early next month. Neither I nor the Industrial Development Authority was informed of the company's intentions prior to the notification to the workforce.</P>
      <P>There was no obligation on the company to inform me beforehand of what it planned to do.  Nevertheless, I would have thought it appropriate that I should be informed in advance, in view of the number of employees involved, the fact that there had been considerable redundancies in 1982, and the substantial State assistance given over the past decade for capital investment by the company.</P>
      <P>The company is part of the De La Rue group of companies and is engaged in the printing of bank notes for export markets. The IDA have had discussions with the group arising from the announcement of the intention to close the Clonskeagh factory.  The decision has been attributed to a continued decline in the market for its services.  The group has stated that this decline has also caused a reduction in employment in its UK operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="511" /> The group has agreed to retain the plant in Clonskeagh on a care and maintenance basis while it reviews its market position to see if new business could be generated that would justify a resumption of work at Clonskeagh.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Since drilling for oil and gas offshore Ireland began in 1970, it has <Col N="514" /> been the policy of successive Governments to ensure that Irish industry should benefit, to the fullest possible extent, from exploration and development activities. Section 62 of our Exclusive Offshore Licensing Terms of April 1975, which are embodied in all exploration licences granted since that date, provides that licensees shall use goods and services of Irish origin in their activities as far as they are competitive on quality, service, delivery period and price.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for implementation of this section of the terms has been assigned to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards who closely monitor all contracts awarded by the oil companies or their sub-contractors.  The success of the IIRS efforts is amply demonstrated by the fact that over the past seven years participation by Irish industry has increased to approximately 85 per cent of the total accessible market.  This represents earnings of £66 million or one-third of the total available business.</P>
      <P>It is unrealistic to expect that Irish goods could completely replace foreign goods and services, particularly at this stage of development of our offshore industry.  At present, Irish Industry is not capable of supplying the total requirements of the oil industry but I am confident that it can build on past experience and substantially increase its share of the market.</P>
      <P>As regards possible future production of oil it must be noted that no commercial oil find in the Irish offshore has yet been declared by any exploration company or group of companies and, consequently, I cannot say if oil will in fact be produced or brought ashore.  However, in the event of a commercial declaration, every effort will continue to be made to maximise Irish participation in such a development. While the provisions of section 62 of the licensing terms would apply in those circumstances, Irish firms would, equally, be required to compete realistically for any business arising.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the final analysis, the task of getting oil ashore would rest with the operating companies and if such a development is to be commercial, then the companies must be given the necessary freedom to <Col N="515" /> manage the project on a commercial basis, provided, of course, they act in the national interest.  Any greater constraints on exploration companies would be undesirable in that they could act as a disincentive to development projects and even to further exploration of our Continental Shelf and might conceivably be in breach of our international obligations under the EEC Treaty.</P>

      <P>There are three broad categories of persons liable for payment of the youth employment levy, namely (i) the PAYE sector, (ii) the self-employed and (iii) farmers.</P>
      <P>As regards the first category, the amount of levy collected in County Wexford is estimated at £383,000 in the 1982 calendar year and £571,000 up to the 13 October 1983.

    <P>
      <Col N="532" /> In addition to a retirement pension the taxpayer is thought to be in receipt of a social welfare pension, both of which are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with practice, the taxpayer's tax-free allowances are set off, in the first instance, against the amount of the social welfare pension to enable it to be paid in full without deduction of income tax.  In the present case there is no balance of allowances available for set off against the retirement pension and this accounts for the large tax deductions which are being made from that pension.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for deserted wife's allowance/benefit on 24 June 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the qualifying conditions for <Col N="542" /> receipt of deserted wife's allowance/benefit is that the claimant must make reasonable efforts to trace her husband and prevail on him to contribute to her support.  This condition had not been satisfied at the time the claimant was interviewed by a local officer of the Department on 25 July 1983.  The requirements in this respect were explained to her and she promised to take the necessary action.  Nothing was heard from her in this matter however and on 29 August 1983 she was requested by letter to notify the Department of the efforts she had made to obtain maintenance from her husband.  No reply to this letter has been received to date. As soon as a reply is received the claim will be dealt with expeditiously.  There was no question in this case of any papers being lost or of claimant being asked to complete a second application form.</P>

      <P>A qualifying condition for receipt of deserted wife's allowance/benefit is that the claimant's husband must have left her of his own volition. The circumstances of the case were investigated in detail and the investigations showed that this condition was not satisfied.  A further condition for entitlement is that the claimant must have made and must continue to make reasonable efforts within the means available to her to prevail on her husband to contribute to the support and maintenance of herself and her children.  It is clear from the investigations that the husband of the claimant has substantial means and his whereabouts are known to the claimant. <Col N="549" /> In these circumstances there is an obligation on the claimant to take all necessary steps including legal proceedings to obtain continuing maintenance from her husband.  It emerged from the investigations of the case that she was not disposed to do this.  The deciding officer accordingly held that the claimant was not entitled to payment.  She appealed against the decision and an oral hearing of her appeal was held.  The appeals officer, however, upheld the decision to disallow the claim.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of the Deputy's recent representations on behalf of the claimant, the case was again referred to the appeals officer concerned for further consideration.

He was also informed of his right of appeal and on 11 August 1983 a letter was received from his solicitors appealing on his behalf.  In connection with his appeal he was again referred for examination by a different medical referee who, following an examination on 20 September 1983, also considered him to be capable of work.  He was notified of the result of the examination the following day and supplied with an appeal form on which to set out the grounds of his appeal.  To date this form has not been returned.  On receipt of the completed form his case will be referred to an appeals officer for determination.</P>

      <P>Having previously had his qualification certificate revoked in October 1981 because he had refused to disclose the full extent of his means, a further application in October 1982 was also rejected by a deciding officer on similar grounds.  He appealed against this decision and, following his agreement to co-operate fully with the review of the case, a deciding officer assessed him with means of £41.00 per week from 15 October 1982 derived from his disablement pension and from his self-employment as a fisherman and fixing cars.  He is now in receipt of unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £41.95 being the maximum amount of £82.95 appropriate in his case less his means of £41.00.  Any arrears due to him will be paid after supplementary welfare allowance due to be refunded to the health board has been paid.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related benefit with flat-rate unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the weekly sum of pay-related benefit, flat-rate unemployment benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the net average weekly earnings of an applicant.  The 85 per cent limit applicable to the person concerned was £88.27 and as he was in receipt of flat-rate unemployment benefit at £81.25 during the period of his claim from 12 May 1983 to 30 September 1983, the rate of pay-related benefit payable to him was £7.02 weekly.

      <P>The person concerned claimed dental benefit on 23 July 1983. According to the records of the Department <Col N="552" /> he had a total of 41 contributions at PRSI Class J1.  These contributions provided cover for occupational injuries benefit only and are not reckonable for dental benefit.  Contributions at this rate were payable because the employment was for less than 18 hours a week and such employment is insurable at the Class J rate where the person is not mainly dependent on the remuneration received from it.  His employers have now confirmed that the nature of the employment changed with effect from 6 May 1982 and that contributions at Class A1 which give cover for all benefits have been paid on his behalf since then.  Therefore, he is now entitled to dental benefit and both he and his dentist have been notified.</P>

      <P>By subsequent deeds of transfer, he transferred the remainder of his holding to members of his family and the social welfare officer revised the assessment of his means from the date of these transfers.

      <P>The person concerned whose husband died on 8 July 1983 has been awarded a widow's contributory pension at the weekly rate of £40.60 with effect from 19 August 1983.  This is the maximum rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years with no qualified child.</P>
      <P>Her husband had been in receipt of unemployment assistance of £48.35 per week which included an increase in respect of his wife and she is entitled to receive this payment for six weeks after his death, in place of widow's pension. Arrangements are being made to pay arrears of unemployment assistance to her for the six weeks in question.</P>
      <P>A widow's pension book with orders payable from 7 October 1983 has been sent to the designated post office for collection by her and she has been notified accordingly.  The arrears of pension for the period from 19 August 1983 to 6 October 1983 will be issued direct to her shortly by payable order.</P>

      <P>When the reduced interest scheme for farmers in severe financial difficulty was introduced in 1982 it was estimated that the maximum cost to the State through direct payments or tax credits to the financial institutions concerned would be about £37 million.  In view of trends in interest rates in the recent past the actual cost is now likely to be somewhat less than that figure.  However, no specific allocation has been made for the overall cost of the scheme and the question of reallocating any unexpended balance does not, therefore, arise.</P>

      <P>The class of animal eligible for purchase into intervention is determined by the EEC Commission and at present intake is restricted to steers only.  When carcases or sides (as opposed to forequarters or hindquarters) are being purchased into intervention an intake quota of 50 per cent of the previous week's steer kill is applied.  In October/November 1980 in an effort to help heifer prices, credit was allowed for heifers in the determination of the weekly intervention intake quota but this did not have the desired effect on heifer prices and was discontinued after a few weeks.  As from 7 November intake into intervention will be confined to steer hindquarters only and the 50 per cent intake quota will again cease to apply.</P>
      <P>I recently introduced a modification into the calculation of the intervention deboning quota whereby it is now based on a factory's share of the total national kill of steers, heifers and cows instead of, as formerly, steers only.  This move was welcomed by producers' representatives and has been acknowledged as having had a beneficial effect on heifer prices.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 418 and 419 together.</P>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy is referring to the premium payable under the sheep-meat regime.  It is expected that the estimated level of this premium for the marketing year 1983-84 will be settled at a meeting in Brussels to-day.  Payment of an advance of 50 per cent of the premium will then be made as soon as the necessary implementing regulation is made by the EC Commission.  The balance, if any, will be paid next summer when the actual level of the premium is established after the end of the marketing year.</P>

The mere fact that someone has a suspicion that a person may possibly be in breach of the law would not be an adequate reason for taking an extremely serious measure against him, such as deportation.  Moreover, an alien who has resided here for five years may not be deported without three months notice unless he has been sentenced to imprisonment or his deportation has been recommended by a court.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The precise arrangements made for the allocation of manpower between foot patrols and other duties in any particular area are a matter for the local Garda officers, having regard to available resources, local circumstances and other demands on Garda services.</P>
      <P>The Garda authorities report that the Torquay Wood area receives as much Garda attention as practicable from foot and mobile patrols operating from Blackrock station.  There has been a substantial increase in Garda strength at Blackrock over the past 12 months and this additional manpower has enabled the patrolling arrangements for all areas served from the station to be improved.

In the case of other aliens, the law empowers an immigration officer to refuse leave to land to a person if he is satisfied that the person cannot maintain himself here and that power is exercised as the occasion arises.</P>
      <P>It is always possible that an alien who has been admitted here may run out of funds.  The question of the entitlement of aliens to monetary or other State benefits while here is not, of course, primarily a matter for me.</P>

      <P>The pre-paid voucher scheme to which the Deputy refers in her question has been in operation since mid-October. Under this scheme parents who are liable for school transport charges may purchase vouchers in units of £5 from designated CIE offices.  The vouchers may be used towards the payment of the charges when they fall due.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="601" /> The total charges must be paid in advance by the relevant closing date.  In the case of the Christmas to Easter 1984 school term, the closing date for receipt of the charges is 8 December 1983.</P>
    <P>Details of the voucher scheme have been issued to all post-primary schools and to the parents of post-primary pupils who are at present availing themselves of school transport.  Parents/legal guardians who are the holders of medical cards and whose children are eligible for school transport continue to be exempt from the charges.</P>
