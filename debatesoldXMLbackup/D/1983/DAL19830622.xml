      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 8 (resumed), 3, 4, 5, 6, and 11 (resumed). By agreement, the proceedings on all stages of the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1983, will, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion not later than 7 p.m.  The proceedings on Items 3 to 6 will, if not previously concluded, be brought to conclusion not later than 10.30 p.m. Private Members' Business will be No. 14 (resumed).</P>

    <P>The matter being raised by Deputy <Col N="2527" /> Wilson before I suspended the sitting had been ruled by me as not in order on the Order of Business.  When the 24th Dáil met, or shortly afterwards, I read out a statement made by one of my predecessors, intimating what was in order and what was not in order on the Order of Business.</P>
    <P>There are ways by which Members can explore the raising of matters of importance in an orderly way.  I appeal to Members to allow the business of the Dáil to proceed in an orderly way, particularly on the Order of Business, otherwise we would simply have nothing but disorder.</P>

      <P>The situation which has arisen as a result of what happened yesterday will be considered by the Government at their next meeting.  In the meantime I would hope that from all sides of this House a message would go out urging the trade unions and members of the public service to consider carefully the national interest in the matter and to reflect further before creating a situation which could be one of great difficulty to all concerned.  I hope that the approach of the Government to the negotiations will have the support of all sides of the House.  It is important that that should be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a few words concerning our support, in response to what the Taoiseach has said. We all, on all sides of the House, deeply regret that these negotiations have broken down.  In so far as we are concerned on this side of the House, we fully support the attempts which are being made to secure a satisfactory settlement.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach asks us to support the Government in this matter, we gladly do so; but we also must say that we support the public service unions in their legitimate claim.  However, we on this side of the House would like to say to both sides, to the Government being the protectors of the public interest in this matter and to the public service unions who are the protectors of their members' interests in the matter, that we urge both sides to resume negotiations at the earliest possible moment and come to a mutually satisfactory settlement.</P>

      <Col N="2531" /> Bill.  Deputy Keating spelled out in detail the recorded intentions of the Fianna Fáil Government to provide local authorities with general powers to make charges for services.  It cannot be questioned that this was the intention or that work was in hand in the Department on such legislation on the change of Government.  The facts and stated intentions give the lie completely to the shallow posturings of Deputy Flynn and others against the Bill.</P>
    <P>The need for a measure of this kind was recognised both by the previous Government and by this Government as a means of assisting the local authorities out of the serious financial position in which they found themselves.  This situation came about because of the failure to provide and maintain an adequate alternative system of income for local authorities to make up for the abolition of domestic rates.  That failure on the part of Fianna Fáil led to a situation in which the local authorities' financial position on current account&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am prepared to co-operate with the House and get through a considerable volume of business.  I would like to proceed.  The failure on the part of the Fianna Fáil Government, as every member of a local authority in the House knows, since 1977-78 when rates were abolished resulted in a position where local authorities had a credit balance of £7 million.  At the end of 1982 there was a deficit of £43 million.  That trend had to be arrested.  The Fianna Fáil Estimate proposals for 1983 made no provision for any increase for rate support grants for local authorities this year.  If that situation had been allowed to stand &mdash; many Deputies on the opposite side were anxious to defend it &mdash; over £50 million would now have to be raised through the system of new charges which this legislation will provide for instead of the £20 million it is envisaged will be raised by virtue of this legislation being enacted.</P>
      <P>This Government took immediate steps to provide an additional £31.5 million for the rate grants and in consequence the level of charges under this Bill is much less than would be the case if the policy and approach of the Opposition had been followed through.  This is the main background and we can have a more constructive and relevant debate on the Bill if the Opposition will face it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla seemed to misunderstand this Bill in a fundamental way. He implied that free water was guaranteed by the legislation of 1878 and 1962 and that this right was now being taken away.  The Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, made provision for a separate rate to be levied on premises supplied with water.  This was substituted for by a provision in the 1962 Act where water charges could be made except for domestic use in urban areas.  The logic of this exception was that in urban areas the town or municipal rate included an element <Col N="2533" /> in respect of water supply.  That was not the case in the counties because many houses there were not serviced by public water supply.  A water charge was allowed for those domestic premises outside towns which were so supplied.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, since most of the built-up town areas extend beyond the functional boundaries to the tune of approximately 30 per cent, there is an anomaly that people living in the town but in the functional area of the county council could be charged a water rate while their next door neighbour living just inside the boundary would not be charged a water rate.  That anomaly had to be rectified.  The abolition of domestic rates has resulted in a position where domestic water users in towns make no payment for it while those in the counties are liable for water charges.  Bearing in mind that a large proportion of towns people, especially those living in the suburbs of the large and expanding towns, are in fact living in county council jurisdictions, this is a highly anomalous situation. I am sure Deputy Mac Giolla and all other Members agree that this should be rectified.  This Bill enables that to be done.</P>
    <P>The Deputy suggested that water should be as free as air.  It is free if one is not taking it through a pipe system.  That would be nice but the reality of piped water, which is what we are talking about, is that the laying of new and extended water supplies is a heavy imposition on public funds.  The capital provision this year alone for sanitary services is £103.6 million.  I understand that the daily consumption of water in the Dublin area is 18 million gallons.  That does not come free in anybody's book and, therefore, it must be paid for from the public purse.  It is not unreasonable to request people to make a modest contribution towards the massive costs involved in paying for the development and maintenance of the system and the treatment of the water to keep it clear and pure.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that the Tánaiste, as Minister for the Environment, would soon be directing local authorities as to what charges are to be levied, that somehow <Col N="2534" /> the Department of the Environment would fix the level of charges and direct local authorities to comply.  This is completely false.  The Minister for the Environment will have no power to do this under this Bill.  Those who criticise imagined attacks on local authority powers should get their facts right.  Decisions on charges, the amount of charges and the relating of charges to circumstances and the provision for the implementation of the hardship clause or waiver scheme are all matters which this Bill will leave entirely to the discretion of the local authority.</P>

      <P>The local authority.  The local authority comprises the elected members and the manager.  I will deal with the point that Deputy Molloy is raising. I am aware of the concern, it is a valid concern but I will deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies expressed concern about trends which they see as threatening the powers and importance of local authorities in the life of the community. I am fully committed to doing all that I can, and indeed the Minister and this administration are fully committed to doing all that we can, to promote and enhance the standing of local authorities and to give them as much independence as can possibly be done.  There are, of course, limits particularly in a situation in which the local authorities are so heavily dependent on the Exchequer for funding. There cannot be a blank cheque approach.  That was never possible and it is completely ruled out now by the very difficult economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  From that point of view I see this Bill not as undermining the local authority position, but as introducing the possibility of greater financial and practical independence being achieved by them.  A point made by Deputy Bruton, in a very interesting contribution on Second Stage, is very relevant here.  This legislation is not just something which provides for the raising of funds.  The new powers to impose charges will also open up new scope for more effective management and cost-effective <Col N="2535" /> operations in the provision and operation of local services.  On the wider plane, I accept that the whole question of the structure and operation of local authorities is overdue for examination. This is a matter which has been raised and discussed on and off over the years but, in effect, nothing has come from all of it.  As the Minister said in the course of the discussion on his Department's Estimate, he intends to review this entire situation and already steps have been taken to provide for effective reform of local government during the course of this Government's lifetime.  This obviously will depend on the co-operation of the House but I can give on my own behalf an assurance that what the Minister said in relation to reviewing the structures and operations of local Government has begun with the serious intent of achieving the sort of progress we are committed to.</P>
    <P>I agree with the view put forward by a number of speakers that there is a need to review fully the whole question of the future financing of the local government system.  The Minister referred to it in his Estimate speech and when he was introducing this Bill.  At present an examination is being carried out into the workings of the existing finance system and the options which are available for future financing taking into account the various needs of local authorities.  They include the need to limit the Exchequer demand within manageable bounds, the need to ensure that local authorities will have adequate funds to carry out their responsibilities, the need to bring about a situation in which they will have a reasonable degree of financial independence.  The review will cover the question of the extent to which local authorities should or must look to local charges for future income and, related to that, whether the extended system of charges provided for in this Bill will need to be maintained.  It also covers a number of other points raised in the debate including the question of the various statutory and other financial demands which are made on local authorities and whether these, or some of them, should be modified or <Col N="2536" /> removed.  I am not suggesting, and it would be foolish to expect, that this examination will come up with easy answers or that local authority financing and spending can be freed somehow from the constraints that arise from the realities of the national economic situation. What we have to try to do is to devise a system which will bring greater stability into local authority financing while going as far as possible to meet the various criteria to which I have referred.  In the meantime, the Minister has secured agreement on a decision by which the Office of Public Works statutory demand for the current year will be limited now to 5 per cent compared with a 46 per cent increase which was being sought by the Office of Public Works.  This is a substantial modification involving a saving of over £1.5 million from local authorities in this year alone.</P>
    <P>Confronted with the extreme situation which I have described, this Government's first step was to inject £31.5 million into the local authorities current accounts this year reducing the total gap from £96.5 million to £65 million.  The next step that was necessary was to confer a discretion on local authorities in the amount that they would ask commercial and industrial ratepayers to contribute through a rate increase.  This was the first time since 1977-78 that local authorities had the discretion to decide what the commercial and industrial rate would be in their local authorities, the discretion having been taken away from them with the abolition of domestic rates in 1977. This Bill widens the discretion of local authorities to apply charges for local services and enables them to remedy the anomaly in the existing provisions as they affect, for example, the domestic water users in towns and outside them.  I believe these are necessary and important steps and that collectively they will make a significant contribution towards maintaining the solvency of the local authority financial position while the examination of the future system proceeds.</P>
    <P>I want to turn to the functions under the Bill and this brings us to what is the main point of contention in relation to the Bill, namely whether the local authority <Col N="2537" /> powers relating to charges should rest with the elected council members or with the managers as an executive responsibility. The Minister explained the proposals and the logic of the proposals in his opening statement.  A certain amount of confusion, and I accept it as bona fide confusion, has been brought about by statements made in the course of the debate.  Indeed the creation of confusion was possibly the objective of some, not all, of the contributions but in a spirit of co-operation let me again try to explain our approach to this matter.</P>
    <P>The amount of money to be raised by a local authority in charges is governed by the estimate which is adopted by the authority and the adoption of the estimate is exclusively the function of the elected members.  It is a reserved function. The total amount of money to be raised by that local authority is done by way of the estimate and that estimate has to be voted upon, as a reserved function, by local authority members.  By the exercise of this function elected members can determine the policy which the manager will have to follow in regard to the charges and the limits within which he will have to work.  They can set the outside amount of money that has to be raised by recourse to charges.  The implementation of that policy within the limits of the estimates provision will be an executive function of the manager.  It has been represented that this means a shift in responsibility from the elected council to the manager.  In our view that is simply not the case.  Existing charges, including the charges for water in county areas, which are operated by virtually all county councils with the exception of County Louth, are fixed by the manager within the estimates limitation.  Local authority members establish the amount that has to be collected and it is the manager who suggests the amount of money that has to be collected by way of local rate.  Those are the traditional lines of the division of function within the local authority.  As far as I know, the situation has not given rise to serious difficulties for members over the years.  Since we came into office we have not had any complaints about the way in which it works. <Col N="2538" /> Another suggestion is that the estimates control is not sufficient, that members hands are tied by what managers put before them at estimates time.  I do not accept this as so nor that it should be so. As a former member of Dublin Corporation I know that was not the case.  Members have a wide discretion under existing local government legislation to vary the estimates, so long as the discharge of responsibilities is provided for and the balance maintained between income and spending.  But if councils want a greater influence in the preparation of estimates there is a remedy in their own hands. Some of the larger local authorities operate an estimates committees procedure whereby they study the draft estimates and query with the managers and the officials why certain moneys are required and what revenue is to be raised in certain areas.  However, not all the councils do that and they are simply presented at the end of the day in full council with the estimates, having little or no chance at that stage to alter the breakdown of moneys.</P>
    <P>The law provides for the appointment of an estimates committee of the local authority.  If this is established in sufficient time within the local authority there is considerable discretion to local members to direct and suggest that the profile, the structure and the allocation of moneys within the estimates be varied.  This is a power that rests with local authority members and it will not be interfered with in any way by this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesNFitzsimons" hpid="Mr. Fitzsimons Mr. Fitzsimons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder if it would be welcomed by county managers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Many county managers would be more than happy to welcome constructive co-operation between themselves and the elected members.  Councillors have other ways also of monitoring how the manager performs his executive functions.  Under existing law, the council may require by resolution, to be informed in advance of the way an executive function is to be operated.  They may use this power if they so wish to monitor how the manager intends to pursue the question of charges and waivers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2539" /> All in all we are satisfied that the existing law provides adequate powers to elected members to control the policy to be pursued in relation to charges.  In other words, by way of resolution, a council may request the manager to come forward with the structure and the profile as to how, in this instance, he proposes to operate the water charges and as to what the system of waivers is to be because the system of waivers must vary as between one local authority and another, the needs in rural areas being different from those in urban areas and also some parts of rural Ireland being different in characteristics from others by virtue of the nature of the business engaged in and the kind of agricultural structure in the various areas.</P>
    <P>It is regrettable that there has been so much stress on the legalities of the system. One of the strengths of our system compared with other systems of local government in Europe is that there is a high degree of co-operation and consultation between councils and managers. We expect that that co-operative spirit and practice will continue to govern relations between them in the implementation of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>We were impressed by the weight of some of the contributions from both sides of the House and by the fact that Members come here with experience as members of local authorities.  Therefore, we are prepared to accept that, if the co-operation and consultation between councils and managers which we have in mind does not materialise, if the views of the elected members should not be taken into account, or if other serious problems should arise for elected members from the operation of the scheme, we should be and would be then open to changing the system and to making it entirely a council function in respect of schemes of charges and of waivers.</P>
    <P>In other words, if the traditional form of co-operation does not continue to operate satisfactorily, we will be prepared at the end of the day to transfer to elected members the entire responsibility for the total amounts and for the design of the waiver charges schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2540" /> Deputy Avril Doyle and others suggested that there may be a two-year life span for this legislation.  The Minister has referred already to the fact that the principle of charges will be included in the general review of local authority financing which is being undertaken at the moment.  To that extent this legislation must be regarded as an interim measure. The only point at issue in relation to the concern expressed by various Deputies was the question of a split between executive and managerial functions.  In the legislation that this House has passed we have power to enable the Minister by way of order to transfer the functions of making the charges, of setting the levels and of the design of waiver schemes from an executive to a reserve function.</P>
    <P>The Minister is prepared further to undertake to examine the operation of the system provided for in the Bill within two years with reference to this area of the balance of power and how it works out and to make whatever changes are found to be justified.  Under the County Management Acts we have the power to add by order to the list of reserved functions. I would say to the House and in particular to the senior members of the Opposition that we hope this compromise and undertaking will be accepted as indicating our concern to ensure that the rights of councillors as the elected representatives are properly brought to bear in the implementation of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to some of the points raised in the course of the debate.  Deputy Molloy asked how it is proposed to distribute the domestic rate grant to local authorities.  It is estimated that in all the £163.5 million provided for domestic rate grant in 1983 will allow local authorities to be compensated for rate increases of up to about 5½ per cent on current domestic valuations and not the 3 per cent which was mentioned by Deputy Molloy.  The estimates we have given already to local authorities are calculated on the basis of 5½ per cent.  The final payments which will be determined when claims are received from local authorities and audited may vary slightly up or down on the estimates.</P>
    <P>If the provision of £138 million for <Col N="2541" /> domestic rate grant which was included in the Estimates published by Fianna Fáil had been allowed to stand, instead of an increase of 5½ per cent in rates on domestic properties local authorities would have suffered a rate reduction on domestic valuations of 11 per cent.  These figures are published and the House may do its own calculations if it so wishes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy pointed out rightly that section 9 of the Bill is not specific as to the basis on which the grant will be distributed. This is deliberate.  While I have described how the 1983 provision of £163.5 million is to be distributed, it may be that for future years, different or additional criteria may become relevant.</P>
    <P>Deputies Bruton and Molony touched on this matter during their contributions. The question of the basis for central subvention to local authorities will be one of the matters considered in the review of local finances.  Therefore, it is necessary to have a flexible provision in the Bill on this point.  Deputy Molloy was critical also of what he read as a power of direction to be given to the Minister in section 9 (2) which would allow local authorities to be told what charges to introduce.  I said earlier that we have rejected this notion.  The power of direction contained in this subsection is a technical one which will affect only the format of local authority estimates.  It has nothing to do with the level of charges.  What I have said in relation to the operation of the charges stands.</P>
    <P>Regarding the liability to pay charges, I assure Deputies Molloy, Doyle, Flynn and Mac Giolla that a charge can be made only under the terms of the Bill where a services is provided.  Moreover, services provided on a general or community-wide basis, such as street cleaning, are outside the scope of this Bill.  In the case of services provided to premises such as refuse collection, we are advised that if a service is available in respect of a premises then the charge is payable by the occupier, irrespective of whether or not the service is availed of.  This is in reality the only way the system can work in the case of services which relate to premises.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy also raised the question of collection of water charges in urban <Col N="2542" /> areas.  Local authorities in these areas will have exactly the same powers of enforcement and collection as county councils have operated satisfactorily for years.</P>
    <P>With regard to the payment of charges by institutions such as hospitals, such institutions are liable for water charges under the existing legislation, whether located in urban or non-urban areas.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke about planning charges and particular reference was made to community centres and similar kinds of development.  Deputy Walsh mentioned planning fees for community halls.  Planning charges are a separate system and are not affected by this Bill. That said, we do intend to review the operation of the planning charges when we have gained sufficient experience of the operation of the system to enable us to evaluate it and we will take into account points that have been made here and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary suggested that there should be central guidelines from the Minister as to how the charges should be levied and collected.  Deputy Molloy, on the other hand, said that his party is all for more discretion for local authorities and, on this point at least, I find myself in agreement with him.  I believe that in matters of this kind as much discretion as possible should be left to be exercised locally.  If the Department can help with advice without infringing this principle, they will of course be ready to do so.  The principle stands that as much power and discretion as is possible within the constraints of operation will be conferred on local authorities under this administration.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies referred to the administrative arrangements necessary to collect charges and implied that the cost of collection would be enormous.  I am satisfied that this should not be the case.  Local authorities already collect a variety of revenues for a wide range of services through rates, rents, water charges and so on.  Various methods of collection have evolved to suit circumstances in different areas.  It would be quite wrong to seek to impose a standard pattern when it comes to collecting <Col N="2543" /> charges under this Bill.  I am sure that the best and most economic arrangement for this is something which the local authorities can best decide for themselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn, in a colourful speech, saw the payment of charges by instalments leading to all kinds of difficulties. It will be for the local authorities to decide whether or not to have a system of instalments.  It will be up to them to devise and operate a system and we have enough confidence in the elected members of local authorities and the managers to believe that the task will be well within their grasp.</P>
    <P>I hope I have covered points raised by Deputies.  Many of them are members of local authorities and are rightly concerned. We took some care in the preparation of notes for this speech but if there are some points which have not been properly clarified then the Minister will deal with them on Committee Stage. I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>The elected members of Cork Corporation decided to fix a certain commercial rate to be raised from industrial and commercial property.  The balance of the money needed for the provision <Col N="2544" /> of services and employment must be raised by local charges.  It was the executive function of the manager to decide the manner in which that money should be raised but the amount of money was determined in the first instance by the elected members.  The manager put forward his proposal because this was an executive function.  It appears from what Deputy Wyse is saying that the discretion of the members had been removed because they had left so much money to be raised by the manager through the imposition of charges.  I will make inquiries and get more detailed information for the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;reserved function&rsquo; has the same meaning as is set out in section 2 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963;'.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important that these words be <Col N="2545" /> inserted in the interpretation and definition section so that there will be no doubt as to the meaning of our subsequent amendments with regard to &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo;.  This means a function which is reserved to the elected members of a local authority.  Serious reservations have been expressed on all sides of the House about this Bill because the main provisions are to be executive functions rather than reserved functions.  We look upon this as interfering in a real and fundamental way with the power of locally elected representatives.  Unless the power to levy charges and decide on the level of those charges is reserved to the members of local authorities a new principle is being introduced to local democracy which we could not possibly support. I am asking in this amendment that the words &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; should have the same meaning as set out in section 2 (1) of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, in order to facilitate later amendments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I reject this amendment because on a technical point it is far more appropriate to consider &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; in the context of the management Acts rather than the planning and development code.  The allocation of responsibility is entirely in line with the existing division of functions in local authorities. Charges are already in operation in the countries and they are operated by the managers within the limits of the estimates as determined by the councils. There have been no complaints about this procedure which has existed for many years and no representations have been received to have that changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would say, on a point of clarification, that there is no question of taking powers away from councils and I believe it is wrong to suggest, as has been suggested, that councils will have no effective control. The manager cannot incur expenditure, whether funded from charges or otherwise, unless it is covered in the estimates provision which has to be approved by the council.  The council has wide discretion. It can change estimates; it can delete items in the preparation of estimates, <Col N="2546" /> including provisions based on income from charges.  Neither are councils tied down to what the manager puts before them at estimates time.  They can appoint their own estimates committee and they can have active participation in the preparation of estimates.</P>
    <P>The sensible line now is to proceed with the implementations, with the established statutory demarcation of responsibilities to minimise delays and the risk of revenue loss.  There is a clear undertaking which has already been given that if it proves unsatisfactory&mdash;and I am not convinced that it will &mdash; from the viewpoint of the councils, the power to change the responsibility from the manager to the council is there and certainly can be used in due course.  The principle and the practice as I have pointed out, at all times, of local charges, is that it will come up for re-examination in the course of reviewing local authority finance and we can certainly have a look at all the points that have been raised but I would suggest that at this time the amendment is not necessary and should not be pressed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has responded to my amendment in two ways, one, by stating that it would be more appropriate if the meaning within the City and County Development Act were referred to rather than the Planning and Development Act of 1963.  I would be very willing to accept the Minister's suggestion in that regard and he or I could put down an amendment at the next Stage to do just that, to include the definition in the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955.  In section 1 of that Act the definition of reserved function is spelt out possibly in greater detail than it is in the 1963 Act but the 1963 Act is the more recent enactment. However, if the Minister considers it more appropriate for my amendment to include the definition of reserved function contained in the 1955 Act I would go along with the Minister's suggestion and we could move from this amendment to the section, if that is acceptable to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point, as I have <Col N="2547" /> said, I feel the amendment is unnecessary and I am determined that the actual wording of the Bill as presented to the House stays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That brings me to the second part of the Minister's response to what I had to say, in which he sought to give the impression that no change whatsoever is taking place in the law governing the manner in which local authorities carry out their business and also that there is no change in the role of the elected member of a local authority.  To the uninitiated one could claim that what the Minister is saying is technically correct but anyone who knows the system and really understands the meaning of what the Minister is attempting to do in this Bill could not agree with what the Minister is saying, that there is no major change.  There is a very fundamental change about to take place if this Bill is allowed to pass into law.  Up to now revenue expenditure of local authorities has been funded by rates, by grant in lieu of rates from the Department and from miscellaneous receipts, including housing rents and other charges for services which the local authority can apply.  Those charges for services which have existed up to the present can be applied as an executive function by the manager.  They have never been a major source of revenue for the local authority.  In fact, they have been used to bring in very small amounts of money and that has been fully understood by elected representatives. That the decisions have been in the hands of the manager has been acceptable to the members because the charges have never been regarded as a major source of revenue for local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is about to change if the Minister is allowed to have this Bill and if, in particular, section 9 is enacted.  The obligation which rests on the State to recoup to local authorities an amount in lieu of the domestic and land rates will be removed if section 9 is passed.  Then the Minister will be in a position to decide on the level of grant to be made available to the local authorities in each year and in that way he will have full control over the <Col N="2548" /> funding of local authorities.  There will be no obligation on the Minister to provide any fixed amount.  There will be no obligation on him in respect of the moneys recoupable had domestic and land rates not been abolished.  The local authority will therefore be denied that positive source of finance in each succeeding year. It is proposed that the charges which can be introduced if this Bill is passed will eventually replace the Exchequer funding of local authorities to a very substantial degree.</P>
    <P>So, what we are talking about is a completely new method of local taxation to fund local authorities, not about the old system of a minor charge for services in certain cases.  We are talking about the prospect of substantial charges being imposed on householders and other members of the community who individually benefit from the services provided by local authorities.  This House must recognise that this is a major change taking place at this stage and that we must ensure that whatever legislation is introduced protects the householder and the community against this type of impositions; that the levying of taxation of that proportion should be rightly a decision for elected members of local authorities. They are the people who represent the local community.  They stand for election or rejection and they are charged to defend their decisions in regard to the levying of taxation.  The same applies in this House in the matter of national taxation. It is the elected Members of Dáil Éireann only who can decide on the level of taxation to be imposed.  The Department of Finance and civil servants in various Departments may make suggestions to their respective Ministers and to the Government but it is the majority of elected Teachtaí Dála who alone can decide on the level of taxation.  That principle must be upheld in local democracy. Therefore, it is only the elected members of local authorities who should have the power to levy this new taxation which the Minister is enabling to be imposed locally under this Bill.</P>
    <P>It is important that emphasis should be placed on the role played by the elected member of a local authority in the functions <Col N="2549" /> reserved to him which no manager can carry out.  These functions have been listed and are well known.  Because of the proposed change it is essential that this Bill should clearly and unequivocally establish that the levying of these charges, which is a new local tax, should be reserved to the elected members.  I am prepared to change the wording to City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, if that is more acceptable to the Minister.  We cannot accept the Minister's argument that there is no change substantially.  To the uninitiated that would appear to be technically correct but in effect it is not correct because we have here a Bill allowing for a completely new method of major funding by local authorities by way of charging substantial amounts for the services they provide. That has not been the practice up to now and our attitude is based on the existing practice and on what has been the traditional position whereby only very minor charges have been imposed at the discretion of the manager.  This is a major change.  This function must be reserved to the elected members.  We will go into this in greater detail later and explain why we think that is so.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's attitude especially when one recalls the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, earlier on Second Stage. He said if the majority opinion of this House favoured transferring this function to the elected members, making it a reserved function, he and his Minister would favourably consider that.  All the Deputies who have contributed so far and who have dealt with this matter have all spoken in favour of making this a reserved function.  All the members of the Fianna Fáil Party are quite clear about that and there is no question as to where we stand.  We have our amendments tabled demonstrating we are in business on this particular issue.</P>
    <P>All the Deputies from the Fine Gael Party who contributed to the debate said they were very disappointed about this proposal.  If the Minister wants the references they are as follows: Deputy Avril Doyle at column 303 of volume 343; Deputy R. Bruton at columns 317 and</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2550" /> 383; Deputy Owen at column 405; Deputy Kenny at column 427; Deputy Farrelly at column 430 and Deputy Keating made a qualified reference to it but it could be taken that he is of the same opinion at column 439.  The strange thing about this discussion so far is that no backbench Member of the Labour Party has made any contribution in the debate. The chairman of the Labour Party, of which the Minister is the leader, said he opposed the imposition of these charges in the local authority of which he is a member.  He made quite sure, however, that he was not present on the day the Bill was offered.  My reference is to what he said to the press when interviewed. Apparently there is no great desire on the part of backbenchers in the Labour Party to have these charges introduced. There is no desire on the part of the Deputies who have spoken in the debate and who have expressed serious concern at the levying of the charges being made an executive function.</P>
    <P>In view of the fundamental change proposed the response we had this morning from the Minister and the Minister of State is completely inadequate and takes no heed of the views expressed in this Parliment.  A statement from the Minister that in two or three years time he will favourably consider doing something else carries no weight whatsoever.  We are here enacting legislation and once the House makes its final decision the Bill becomes law and we have no control over the functioning and operation of the legislation. That is a matter to be interpreted by the courts.  We have an obligation and a responsibility to ensure that the Bill meets with the wishes of the majority of the Members of this House.  Later we shall have specific amendments and we shall go into this in greater detail.  At the moment the Minister and the Minister of State are flouting the express wishes of the members of Fine Gael who have spoken on the Bill.  We have had only silence from the Labour Party.  It is very difficult to assess where this idea came from.  If the Minister has studied his papers I am sure he will see it was never the intention of Fianna Fáil to allow the manager to make a decision in regard to the introduction <Col N="2551" /> of charges.  It is our view that that power should remain a reserved function of the elected representatives and the major change taking place will have to be written into any Bill introduced to bring in charges.</P>
    <P>Going back to my original point we are opposed to the introduction of charges if they are brought in merely to supplement existing sources of revenue.  If they are brought in as an additional source of revenue we are in favour of them, but it is clear here they will be introduced to supplement revenue.  I would ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in regard to reserved functions and accept our amendment.</P>

      <P>The Minister said this is a technical amendment and he suggested a possible alternative.  I am surprised to hear the Minister say he was determined &mdash;I did not take a note so he will correct me if I misquote&mdash;to see the Bill through as it stands.  If it will not make any material difference then why would the Minister not accept this very reasonable amendment tabled by Deputy Molloy particularly in view of the fact that the vast majority of the contributions here are opposed to this change?  In the interests of harmony the Minister should accept something which he himself described as a technical amendment.</P>
      <P>Section 9 should not, in my opinion, be the last section.  It should be at the beginning of the Bill because it is the section determining the various contributions and the rates being struck.  It is the kernel of the Bill.  I earnestly appeal to the Minister to accept this very reasonable amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority I support Deputy Molloy's amendment.  If this Bill becomes law as it stands the power of local authorities will be eroded.  This has been the function of introducing charges up to now. Recently the rate struck was decided by the managers and now the powers of local authority members are totally eroded. Section 9 of this Bill determines the situation. <Col N="2552" /> Members of local authorities will have very little say.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position and to accept the amendment.  The Fianna Fáil Party in Government did not intend to give these powers to the county managers; it was the intention of the party that the powers should remain in the hands of local authority members.  This is what democracy is about, and it should be the wish of everybody, as I am sure it is the wish of everyone in this House, that that will continue.</P>
      <P>On Second Stage, speaker after speaker spoke on the lines suggested by Deputy Molloy, who is supported by Deputy Calleary and by me.  Speaker after speaker spoke on the position that existed prior to the introduction of the Bill.  They all expressed concern and anxiety that that system of the past should continue.  The attitude of the Minister and the Minister of State is disappointing. If this Bill becomes law there is no doubt that power will lie in the hands of the managers, and that was made very clear in the discussion in Dublin County Council &mdash; to which I referred on Second Stage&mdash;when Council members of the Minister's party were utterly confused.  I hope the matter will be clarified here today and again I appeal to the Minister to reconsider the position and accept the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise to support Deputy Molloy in this amendment.  I say to the Minister that confusion exists up and down the country between managers and members of local authorities in relation to the function.  In the circular of 10 May last to local authorities on their functions, there appears to be ambiguity and contradiction, no matter what the Minister of State said on Second Stage.  The circular states: &ldquo;The charges functions assigned to local authorities under the Bill will as executive functions fall to be performed by the manager&rdquo;.  The managers will read into that that they have the executive function to put charges wherever they will.  The next sentence is: &ldquo;In practice, however, the amount of revenue to be raised by charges will be determined by the estimate adopted by <Col N="2553" /> the elected members and it will then fall to the manager to levy charges accordingly&rdquo;. That sentence also seems to indicate a contradiction, that the members have the power to raise local charges. This is further exacerbated and corroborated by what Deputy Wyse said in relation to the manager of Cork Corporation who requested to raise a certain rate.  The members disagreed and voted on the rate that they wished to have.  Subsequently the manager did not go along with the elected members' thinking on the matter. The third sentence in the circular is: &ldquo;It is expected that managers will consult appropriately with their councils in relation to charges which are being introduced&rdquo;. In the situation in Cork as instanced by Deputy Wyse, that does not pertain, and here lies the confusion.  On the one hand, managers are concluding from the circular that they have executive functions and, on the other hand, they are being told by the Minister and the Minister of State that the elected members have that function.</P>
      <P>Let us have the matter cleared once and for all.  We in Fianna Fáil never intended to take the function from the hands of the elected members.  The members of every local authority are elected by the people to govern their local areas and if that function is eroded, eventually there will be no point in having local elections because the managers will determine how the local authorities will be run in every urban council, corporation and county council.  Therefore, we have justified apprehensions in relation to the seriousness of this matter and we must support Deputy Molloy in asking the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleagues on this matter.  The Minister, a member of a local authority for many years, must be fully aware of the confusion that exists now not alone among members of local authorities but also among managers and county managers.  The Minister knows that we have information that city and county managers are at present making arrangements about the introduction of charges for water and refuse collection. Indeed, I have heard it said that they <Col N="2554" /> could impose a charge for people employed by local authorities to collect rent from tenants.  Members of local authorities believe that their rights to decide what charges a local authority will make are being infringed.  A recent case in Cork proved the confusion beyond all doubt.  The manager recommended to the council that a charge be made for water supply and refuse collection.  All parties by a majority vote rejected his suggestion.  Now they are asking me what the position is.  Can the manager now override the decision of the council who rejected by a majority vote his suggestion of introducing rates?  This pinpoints the confusion at managerial and council level.  Can the manager say now to the members of Cork Corporation that this Bill authorises him to introduce the charges?  I ask the Minister to give very serious consideration to the amendment put down by Deputy Molloy which I believe clarifies the position.  We will have something positive then and we can go back and say to the members of the council that they have the right to decide whether charges are to be made or not and it is not a managerial function.</P>

      <P>We are discussing a critical and important point and the Minister must make his position clear on this, the kernel of the Bill.  Deputy Molloy pinned his colours to the mast and made his point clear.</P>
      <P>The Minister may feel my interpretation of public opinion to be unsavoury but I am sure he will accept that there is a feeling that this move amounts to a reintroduction of rates.  That is generally accepted.  There has been a lot of discussion and newspaper comment about this matter but I am sure Members will agree if they reflect on this that these charges are wrose than rates.  In the case of rates elected members of local authorities had a direct role to play in the striking of those rates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After listening to the Minister of State this morning I was left in disarray.  His explanation may seem acceptable on paper but from a practical point of view it weighs the authority very much in favour of managers in regard to the levying <Col N="2555" /> of charges.  That is why it is important that the amendment should be accepted. With all due respect to the Minister, and his good intentions of trying to frame acceptable and worthwhile legislation, there is a danger in regard to this.  I do not like saying that the Minister is being hoodwinked in some way but at least, perhaps, he is not quite sure about this.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister cannot be certain because directions have not gone to the managers.  He is assuming that all will go well.  It would be very presumptuous of the Minister to say he is perfectly sure.  Deputy Molloy's amendment would act as a safeguard and strengthen local democracy, something the Minister agrees with.  That is most important.  I attended many meetings with the Minister of State with residents' associations and others and heard the point made that under no circumstances should any of us permit an erosion of the role of local public representatives.  This amounts to passing over the heads of local councillors. The Minister may argue that this will not happen but if he is that sure why is it that he is not prepared to accept the amendment?  It is a clear-cut issue.  The Minister does not have anything to lose and he would be safeguarding and strengthening local authorities by adopting this.  He would not be adding fuel to the doubt that exists in all local authorities. As Deputy Wyse said, this amounts to railroading these charges through.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make some comments on the section.  With regard to the amendment proposed by Deputy Molloy I should like to point out that the Bill does not explicitly mention executive or reserved functions.  It will always remain the right of the Minister to decide if the scheme should operate in a way contrary to the intentions of the Bill, namely to give an element of local autonomy. If that happened the Minister could change that into a reserved function without amending the legislation.  That is my impression of the provision and it is the <Col N="2556" /> sensible way to go about this.  There is a danger if we want to put through charges &mdash; there will be a need for them &mdash; that if we do not have a period when they are brought in through management setting up the structure of the charges and with the councillors deciding the overall level we could have long and tendentious debating on the structure without anything being put into operation.</P>
      <P>In the initial period the democratic rights of councillors are protected by the fact that they will always strike the amount in total to be raised from these charges.  It would be a very unwise county or city manager who would not listen to the views of local representatives when setting out the details of the charges. When the scheme is in place councillors should have a function reserved to them, perhaps some time in the future, to examine elements of the structural charges brought in by the manager and reform them at that stage.</P>
      <P>I should like to clarify a point in regard to the definition of &ldquo;service&rdquo;.  Will the definition as set out in the Bill mean services rendered to a particular premises only such as water or something like that, and not a general public service such as lighting?  I find it hard to see it appropriate that a lighting charge should be brought in under legislation like this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The debate is more appropriate to section 2.  The amendment is unnecessary in that the Bill is collectively cited with the local government Acts which contain a definition of reserved function.  I can appreciate the Opposition's concern but I ask them not to press their amendment at this stage.  It would be more appropriate under section 2 when we can have a fuller discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We consider the whole principle of whether the introduction of charges and the levying of charges is to be a function of the elected members or not to be a crucial part of the Bill.  We hold the view that the levying of charges which amounts to a new form of taxation should be a function performed by elected members only.  We are opposed to the Bill because it removes the obligation <Col N="2557" /> from the Minister for the Environment to recoup fully to local authorities the domestic and land rate reliefs he is required to give under the 1978 Act which abolished rates on houses.  I should like to re-emphasise that we are opposed to the Bill because it gives to county managers only the power to introduce charges and decide the level of new charges to be applied.</P>
      <P>We are also opposed to the Bill because it gives sole power to county managers to decide the terms of the scheme under which the collection of charges could be dropped in hardship cases.  It is clearly the Minister's intention to cut back severly on State grants to local authorities and that will have a chaotic effect on local authority services.  It will affect in a serious way the level of employment in each county council and corporation area.  The Bill diminishes the role of local authority elected members and is the most serious threat to local democracy since the State was founded.</P>
      <P>Only local authority elected members should make the decision to introduce major new local taxation measures such as charges for services.  We also believe that elected local authority members should decide the terms of the scheme to drop the collection of charges on hardship grounds.  If the Bill is allowed pass in its present form it will extend central control over the operation of each local authority and reduce the role of local authority elected members to being merely rubber stamps.</P>
      <P>The proposals contained in section 9 will alter in a fundamental way the method of financing local authorities.  At present the revenue expenditure of local authorities is got from rates, State grants and miscellaneous receipts accuring from such items as housing rents and other charges for goods and services.  State grants at present must include an amount equal to the rates relief on houses and land.  These grants have provided the major proportion of local authority revenue expenditure since 1978.  Even so, local authorities have experienced financial difficulties.  If the Minister's obligation to recoup domestic and land rates is removed altogether, as proposed in this</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2558" /> Bill, then the financial position of local authorities will deteriorate rapidly.  The annual Department of Environment grant will be an arbitrary one.  The local authorities will be in the vice grip of the Department of the Environment.  This House should protest and unanimously oppose this move.</P>

      <P>The media have paid scant attention to the real intention in this Bill. There is a lack of understanding in the community at large in regard to the intentions contained in this Bill.  If the Bill is not changed today it will be too late. There is very little point in the Minister saying that he will review it in two years' time or Deputy Bruton or his colleagues accepting this Bill in this form on those type of assurance which do not mean a thing, as we know in this House.  We are making law here; we are not making promises which might or might not be fulfilled at some time in the future.  Now is the time to ensure that what we are writing into the law of the land is what the House wants.  We should not accept something we do not want on the basis that the Minister might change his mind when he sees reserved function rather than an executive function.  We are making the legislation now and now is the time to make the decisions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The double talk the Minister has indulged in has fooled many of the Fine Gael members.  Unfortunately, the county councillors around the country do not yet know the full effect of this Bill. They do not understand the effect it will have on local democracy and on their role as elected members in local authorities. I do not like accusing the Minister of double talk.  All I can do is to go back <Col N="2559" /> to his speech when he introduced this Bill to the House.  He said:</P>
    <P>The basic responsibility for deciding on the amount to be raised by charges will fall to be exercised by the council members...</P>
    <P>That is not true.  The decision is a managerial function under the existing law. We want the existing law changed and put this way:</P>
    <P>The basic responsibility for deciding on the amount to be raised by charges will fall to be exercised by the council members.</P>
    <P>We should make that the law.  We do not want anything more added to that sentence. The statement I quoted from the Minister's speech cannot be accepted at its face value unless this amendment and the other amendments which we will be moving later are accepted.  If they are not accepted then it is a function of the managers. When I say double talk I mean exactly that because in the next paragraph the Minister, ignoring what he said in the first paragraph, said:</P>
    <P>It will be the function of the manager to give effect to those decisions in terms of the specific levels of charge to be applied.</P>
    <P>That is a lot of mumbojumbo.  The newspapers took it that the elected members would have the power to decide these charges.  The editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i>, which appeared after this debate took place in the Dáil, questioned if my interpretation of this Bill was correct.  The editorial said that if the Fianna Fáil spokesman was correct in his interpretation of the Bill the introduction of these charges and decisions in regard to the level of charges being a managerial function then the Minister has some explaining to do.  The Minister has a lot of explaining to do in relation to the confusion which he has created, possibly deliberately, throughout the country and in particular since those statements were being made at a time when the local authorities were considering the estimates for 1983 and were faced with making <Col N="2560" /> decisions.  It was clear to me, because I studied the matter in some detail, that councillors had absolutely no power whatsoever regarding the charges which would be levelled in their local authority areas and that the managers ruled supreme in this matter.  Many of the managers did not state that explicitly and unequivocally to their members at that time because the matter had not yet become law.  There was no great desire to expose the real intent behind this Bill at that time.  There was an effort to shuffle along and get the estimates adopted for 1983.  The Bill would be passed after that and next year they would rule with the iron first.  The county managers would decide the level of charges to be made.</P>
    <P>The managers in rural areas, if this Bill remains as it stands, can decide that the charge for water will be £100 per dwellinghouse and £100 per trough in every field of every farm in the country.  The members can come in and protest all they like and say that it is unfair to charge £100 for every trough when all the small farmers will have more troughs than the larger farmers and will not be able to pay this money.  They can protest that it would be a terrible imposition on those people but the managers can say: &ldquo;I am sorry but in my judgment this is the way it shall be.  Under the Act, which the Dáil passed in June, I am given those powers and I am proceeding accordingly&rdquo;.  The members at local authorities' meetings can protest all they like but they do not have the power to change this.  If we are going to sit here and allow that type of law to be introduced without protesting, we do not deserve to be here.</P>
    <P>We have had the extraordinary spectacle where speaker after speaker on the Government side, members of the Fine Gael Party, have stated exactly the same views we are expressing.  There seems to be unanimity on all sides of the House that this power should be a reserved power for elected members of county councils.  The Minister has offered as a sop to the Fine Gael members, upon whom the extent of the provisions in this Bill only dawned very recently that it might only be a temporary measure, that he is very disposed towards reconsidering <Col N="2561" /> his position in one year's time or two years' time.  That is not worth a thrawneen, as they say in my part of the country. The important task is to ensure that whatever is written into the law is the right thing.  We cannot write in ministerial hopes and wishes.  They do not count for anything.  Even when the Bill is passed the Minister's interpretation of it will not count for anything.  It will be up to judges, who will look at the cold print.  They will adjudicate that the Oireachtas gave this power to the county managers and denied it to the local elected representatives.</P>
    <P>In that way the role of county councillors and the corporation members throughout the country is being denigrated and their authority is being diminished in a very fundamental way.  Whatever complaints county councillors and corporation members have had since 1978 regarding the financial difficulties that have arisen they will pale into insignificance when this new regime is imposed on them.  In future there will not be any obligation on the Department of the Environment to give a grant to a local authority based on any particular matching. There is no obligation to relate it to the amount which might have come in by way of domestic rates or land rates.  That is being wiped out in section 9 of the Bill. The Minister can then allocate a sum to a local authority which could leave a very substantial shortfall.  Then the local authority are obliged to make up the shortfall by the introduction of charges. If the members refuse to do this the manager has the power to impose the charges.</P>
    <P>That is the intention contained in this Bill.  We see it as a fundamental issue. We appeal to the Government to have a rethink on this.  Who is rushing this aspect of the Bill through?  Who is it who wants the Bill in this form?  It would seem to me to suit more the views and wishes of the bureaucracy in the Department of the Environment rather than its political head.  I am surprised that the Labour Party are going along with this type of imposition, allowing local authorities to be destroyed in this way because that is what will happen; make no mistake about it.  There has been a gradual erosion of the role and importance of the elected <Col N="2562" /> members at local authority level in recent times.  However slow and gradual that erosion may have been, it will now take a major leap forward if this Bill goes onto the Statute Book in its present form.</P>
    <P>We are still only on section 1 and dealing with my amendment on that section. It is crucial to the whole thrust of our opposition to this Bill.  I cannot withdraw the amendment, as requested by the Minister. I shall have to stand over my amendment because it is important at the very outset to establish what we mean by &ldquo;reserved function&rdquo; and have it written specifically into this Bill.  It is crucial to the whole intent of the Bill that that aspect be written in and clearly understood at the outset.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Like previous speakers, I am very concerned about this Bill. There is no doubt in my mind but that the powers of elected representatives will be eroded under its provisions.  I take great exception to the Minister having notified city and county managers earlier in the year, informing them that he would be introducing a Bill later in the year and instructing them to go ahead and make provision for these charges.  That was wrong.  This House and its members should have been the first people to have been made aware of it and the first people to have been afforded an opportunity to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reservations of all concerned are becoming very clear here today.  We have had a discussion on this matter in Cork when it emerged that it was not alone Members on both sides of the House who did not accept the provisions of the Bill, did not think it was in the best interests of the people or public representatives, but these reservations were shared by members of the Minister's Party.  It is my opinion that this Bill is the brainchild of the County Managers' Association.  For a number of years they have been advocating local charges in order to render their job easier.  It should be remembered that it is very easy to do a good job when one has plenty of money.  It is in difficult times now being experienced here in all authorities, not alone local authorities, that the real mettle of managers should <Col N="2563" /> be seen to be operating.  It is my view that they are not the Minister's ideas being put forward here today but those of the county managers and I reject that totally out of hand.  There is no doubt but that the powers of local representatives are being eroded under these provisions.</P>
    <P>Where will such charges stop?  In Cork this week the city manager decided to increase the charge for parking discs from 10p to 20p.  One wonders what it will be next week.  We have genuine reservations and fears about the provisions of this Bill. I would ask the Minister to examine the amendment and ensure that public representatives have an input.</P>
    <P>In Cork we questioned the legality of the manager bringing in an estimate, including charges because, when rates on domestic dwellings were abolished in 1977, people paid extra taxes in order to offset the deficit created by their abolition. Will those taxes now be levied somewhere else or will people be expected to continue to pay the taxes imposed then and meet these new charges as well?  It constitutes a backdoor method of imposing additional charges and finding money for the deficits existing in local authorities throughout the country. That is wrong, the Minister should realise it, face up to that fact and to the managers themselves.  They have a job to do, as have the rest of us.  The power of elected representatives should be reinstated. However, it has not been spelled out for us here today and I would ask the Minister to bear my contention in mind.</P>

    <P>One thing I find rather amazing here this morning is that people do not seem to realise the situation in which local authorities find themselves and the difficulties they encounter.

I wonder where was the concern in 1977 <Col N="2564" /> because we would not be here today putting this bill through the House had not local authority financing being sold off in an election auction in 1977.  That is what brought us into the present shortfall in finances for local authorities.</P>

      <P>The luxury of being a new Deputy.  I find Deputy Molloy's concern about cutbacks in the rates support grants also very difficult to understand.  When we came into office this year his party in Government had provided £138 million for domestic rate grants for 1983.  This represents a reduction of 11 per cent in rate poundages on domestic property. Therefore how can he now criticise us for failing to fully recoup domestic rate reliefs when we increased that sum of money by £31.5 million for rates support grants for this year, which provides for an increase, though modest, of 5½ per cent in rate poundages on domestic property for 1983?</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy also contends that the charges to be imposed under the provisions of this Bill represent a large increase on nominal charges currently being levied by managers.  I must refute that.  The charges now envisaged are generally in line with those which have been levied for many years in many county council areas.</P>

      <P>It is a question of whether in practice, the councils find that they want to charge because of difficulties of operation.  I think it argues for a period of trial of a continuation of the established system. Deputy Molloy asked if I had looked up the files in the Department.  I have and certainly there was nothing in them which indicated that any change in the system of responsibilities would have been brought in had Fianna Fáil remained in office.</P>

      <P>That is correct.  The <i>status quo</i> has been maintained and that is my intention.</P>
      <P>In relation to the situation brought up in Cork Corporation, my understanding is that there is a global provision in the estimates for 1983 to cover income from charges.  Obviously there was confusion at the time &mdash; because the Bill had not been through the House &mdash; but the manager has made a provision and he will have to realise that sum of money during the course of the year.  It was not spelled out in detail but that sum of money has been provided in the estimates which the corporation accepted.  The final power is with corporation members in accepting the estimates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have said at all times that there is no change proposed.  I spelled out in detail in my introductory remarks on this Bill that we are giving the power to urban authorities.  I and other members in this Chamber who have served on rural county councils are well aware that there is no change whatsoever from the present situation whereby the level of charges is fixed by the managers in line with the estimates provision approved by the council.  The ultimate authority lies with the members of the council when they come to the preparation of rates. Any of us involved in the preparation of rates should be well aware that there are a certain number of areas in which money can be realised.</P>
      <P>It would not be necessary to look for any charges if the proper funding of local authorities was allowed to remain intact as it was prior to 1977.  It would be foolish for us not to realise that local authority funding has been slipping away since 1977.  That was when problems began to start for local authorities and I have said on numerous occasions we canot allow that situation to continue.  There has been much talk about reforming local government. It has now come to the stage where it is vital to strengthen and revitalise the whole system of local government and particularly its financing.  This is essential if we are to retain local democracy.</P>
      <P>When I introduced the Bill I said this was not the panacea for all the ills of local authorities but at least it is an attempt to make up the shortfalls that have been allowed to develop in the system. Another point raised was that the existing charges have been nominal and have not been of major significance.  Some £40 million was raised in the past 12 months in local authority charges.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must accept that the basic decision in the preparation of the estimates is the decision of the council.  They have to be accepted by the council.  The charges will be prepared in the context of the estimates and if the council do not accept them they can reject the estimates.  I am maintaining the status quo in relation to the present situation in county councils and the urban area authorities are being given powers they did not have up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that when the council come to consider the estimates the amount of grant they obtain from the Department will play a major role in deciding the amount of money to be collected locally by way of charges or otherwise?  In other words, the Minister's decision in regard to the grant which his Department make available to a local authority is the crucial point.  To use the Minister's own words, it is facetious of him to seek to convey the impression that the elected members will play any great part in determing the balance to be made up.  His decision regarding the amount of grant which his Department make available will determine how everything else falls into place.</P>
      <P>The whole idea of giving local authorities power to introduce charges for services was acceptable generally when it was first mooted on the basis that this would be a source of additional funds to local authorities and that it would not be used to replace existing sources.  That is where this Bill falls down and it is why Fianna Fáil are taking a strong stand against it.  It is not the kind of measure we would have introduced had we stayed in office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Anyone who studies this Bill in an effort to understand its effect will have to understand the significance of section 9 where there is no obligation on the Minister in future to provide any set amount to any local authority.  It has been said that it has been the practice of local <Col N="2569" /> authorities to introduce fairly reasonable charges but that will not apply in future. If the Minister in the future decides to reduce the amount of direct grant, there is no obligation on him to give local authorities an amount in lieu of any item. If he gives a local authority £1 million this year he can decide next year to give only £500,000 and let them make up the balance by way of extra charges for services. The Bill will allow this to happen in the future.</P>
    <P>If the Minister gets his way members of local authorities will not even have the power to decide the amount of charges. They will be turned into useless rubber stamps and many people will decline to serve on local authorities if their powers are diminished in this way.  It will be a useless exercise to attend local authority meetings and go through the motions of bringing forward local problems if major decisions in relation to the operations of the authority rest solely in the hands of the Minister and the manager and where the other people are only brought along for the charade.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Brady asked a question but he did not get an answer. The Minister said provision will be made in the estimates for these charges.  If the council disagree with the manager can he bring in the charges irrespective of what the council decide?  Secondly, do the council stand in danger of being dissolved because of their failure to strike a rate? That area has not been clarified and I should like the Minister to reply to my question.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with legislation. It is not the existing situation. We are talking about new charges.  Will the council be in danger of being dissolved if they do not strike the rate which includes new charges which the Minister is empowering the manager to introduce?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>If the council reject any provisional charges brought forward by the manager, the obvious thing for them <Col N="2570" /> to do is to knock out that part of the expenditure.  I assume a manager will not introduce charges just for the sake of imposing charges.  Obviously they would be for the purpose of maintaining employment or the provision of services. If the council reject whatever sum has been put into the estimates to be raised through charges, they can strike out the services that would have been provided by way of the charges.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  I am sure the Minister will agree that you would want to be a qualified accountant to play an effective part at any local authority estimates meeting.  You would want to go into the inner sanctum of any local authority and to spend hours looking through the books if you were to play an effective part in the costing of any estimate.  That is acceptable: a local authority member must take a lot for granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister says charges have to be made if there is a shortfall, unless the councillors have a direct role to play at that level their authority will be usurped. That is the great danger in this Bill. Deputy Molloy made that central point. There is no question here of any personal <Col N="2571" /> attack on any Member of the House on this issue.  We are concerned about the framing of the legislation.  We have participation by nearly 60 per cent bureaucrats in the running of the country &mdash; a comparable figure in the US is 22 per cent &mdash; and if we are aiming at streamlining local authorities, this Bill, at one fell swoop, will disinfranchise local authority members.  This is a grave danger.</P>
    <P>The Minister was wrong in his opening comments because he appeared to engage in a party political speech, harping back to the abolition of domestic rates in 1977.  For heaven's sake, if the Minister has any doubt about that inequitable system of local rates as it applied in any city or town, why not just reintroduce domestic rates rather than point back to a system which he thought to be wrong at the time?  Every Member of the House wants to safeguard the position of local authorities and the Minister has absolutely nothing to lose by accepting the amendment, which will not dilute the efficiency of this Bill.  Therefore, why not accept the amendment.  Every councillor in the country is looking to the Minister, so why can he not give them that protection?  I appreciate the excellent backup and advice the Minister is getting from the Department but there is another side to the democratic coin, the 40 per cent of the people who are not involved in the bureaucratic process.  The Minister in this section is eroding that further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I join in the requests to the Minister to accept the amendment. So far he has made our case for it.  He spoke about strengthening and revitalising local authority finances.  As Deputy Molloy said, the Minister and the Department will set the guidelines for the charges.  There is not a doubt about that &mdash; it will be done under section 9.  If the Minister makes a block grant it will set the guidelines for the various charges that will be made by local authorities, and local authority members would not have any option but to agree to extremely heavy charges.  I am asking the Minister to ensure that the charges will be a reserved and not an executive function. <Col N="2572" /> In the Cork case it would appear that the manager will just make the charges.  The manager in Mayo has said that he has the right to make the charges if we do not agree to the various items in the various programmes of which there is no estimate. It is just a shortfall.  He has allocated £X to each of the various programmes. Ballina UDC were just presented with a sum of £96,000.  We had no say in how or where that money would be spent.  There was a shortfall of £96,000 and that would come from charges.  We reduced the estimate somewhat and will be meeting shortly, with the Minister's consent.</P>
      <P>It is the block grant that will determine the charges.  It should be made clear to everyone that what is being enacted today will not give extra powers to local authority members to put on charges so that they can get extra services for their own areas.  This provision is to make up revenue which should have been coming to councils under the 1978 Act.  Members of local authorities cannot give in on this. The only way the rights of local authority members can be safeguarded is acceptance by the Minister of what he calls this technical amendment.  The amendment has the backing of the vast majority of Deputies who have spoken.</P>
      <P>I do not want to be political but the members of the Minister's party, particularly in Kildare during the last election, issued a circular saying that there would not be any charges for local services.  That brings us back to the abolition of domestic rates in 1977.  Once and for all, will the Government forget about that?  If they feel that the abolition of rates was wrong, as Deputy Brady said let them reintroduce rates and finish with it, but let the Government stop the codding and the nonsense.  They had actually begun to abolish rates.  All of us then accepted that the rating system was inequitable. This Bill is a reintroduction of rates under a new guise, pretending that it will give extra power to local authority members. It will not.</P>

We are <Col N="2573" /> expressing the views of members of local authorities throughout the length and breadth of the country.  The Minister assured us that the <i>status quo</i> will be maintained.  Council members, therefore, ask what is the reason for the Bill? If the <i>status quo</i> is maintained and if the council have the power to run their own authority as they wish, why are we talking about this Bill?  Councillors are suspicious about this Bill.  They believe there is something sinister about it, that something is being taken away from the democratically elected members of the council.  I want clarification on one of the points raised by the Minister of State. Did he not say that if it was found that the powers of local authority members were eroded the Minister would take action?</P>

This point struck me very forcibly when the Minister of State was replying.  We are establishing that there is confusion in this area.  Why should council members misinterpret the Bill?  If the council lose their authority we are guaranteed that the Minister will intervene. To my mind this will create confusion. In my view the Minister is saying that our amendment is correct.  Why not accept our amendment which will enlighten every member of a local authority?</P>

Clearly this ambiguity is undesirable to everybody in this House except the Minister and his Minister of State. Many Fine Gael backbenchers agree with this side of the House about this.  This confusion can be arrested if the Minister accepts Deputy Molloy's amendment.  If he does not do that he can, as Deputy Brady and others said, reintroduce rates. It is as simple as that.</P>

I do not mean to embarrass the Minister of State but this cynical exercise which I have sat through for the past 45 minutes appears to be another example of Government by hit and miss.

On many occasions, as the Minister will agree we held firm on this throughout our constituency. We gave categoric assurances that under no circumstances would powers be taken from local authorities.  It is very fine for the Minister to laugh and take this exercise in a cynical way, but the fact is that local councillors are looking to this measure today and feel their powers are being eroded.  Firm assurances were given that this would not happen.  We even spoke about splintering city councils into smaller units, to establishing on a pilot basis the Rathmines Council, the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and a council on the north side of Dublin, to give councillors more local and effective powers.  That is getting down to the very essence of local democracy.  All that is gone.  That is fair enough, because that is one of the prices one has to pay in a narrowing band of the democratic process. It is becoming more and more difficult to govern as the bands of tolerance became so narrowly divided.  Our legs are constantly being cut from under us by the Goliath of bureaucracy.  It is bureaucracy run riot.  What is happening here today is a further swipe at wiping away the powers of local councillors.  That is how serious the situation is and that is why I am in this House today.  No matter how finely worded or glossed over it can be, it is a grave disservice to local democracy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regretfully and lamentably may I say it is my interpretation that the Minister is holding firm on this one, but what has actually percolated out of his contributions and, indeed his Minister of State's contribution, is that it is to be a watch, wait and see how it works situation.  That is just not good enough.  The Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, says there is no confusion on his side of the House about whether the local powers will be usurped from city councillors.  He is definitely not in touch with members of the Government or, indeed, with members of Fine Gael and Labour in making such a statement. If there is any measure of doubt left, my last appeal to the Minister is to <Col N="2576" /> agree to this amendment.  There will be no loss of face whatsoever.  It will strengthen the legislation if anything.</P>

      <P>I should like to reiterate my earlier statement and to assure Deputy Brady that it would not be my intention to issue directives on the basis of whims.  I would not consider myself to be a whimsical person.  He described what is being done in this Bill as a swipe at the democracy of local authorities.  If he considers I am doing that, he should have stood up and spoken when the sledgehammer was being wielded in 1977.  I thank Deputy Fitzsimons and Deputy Molloy for their concern about Labour Party backbenchers and their contributions, or their activities, or otherwise. Fianna Fáil seem to pay great attention to them when the Labour Party are in Government, but we never hear about them from Fianna Fáil otherwise.</P>

      <P>I should like to clarify what is happening and what the intention is.  The amount of money to be raised by a local authority is governed by the estimate adopted by that authority, and the adoption of the estimate is exclusively the function of the elected body.  By the exercise of this function the elected members can determine the policy which the manager will have to follow in regard to charges, and the limits within which he will have to work.  The implementation of that policy within the limits of the estimate provisions will be an executive function.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the rubber stamping bit.  Nobody believes what the Minister is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the rubber-stamping comments, the Deputy will recognise that for the first time since 1977 local authorities have power to strike whatever rate they wish this year.  Under Fianna Fáil it could be said that the estimates meetings were hardly worth attending because there was no authority or power to strike a rate.  Most councils <Col N="2577" /> adopt a practice whereby estimates committees are established to go through the finances available in preparation for the estimates.  That is the effective method by which the level of charges can be set out.  Then in consultation with the estimates committee it is the manager's function to prepare the estimates along the lines he is directed to prepare them.</P>
      <P>We are working along the traditional lines of the division of functions within the local authority, as has survived very well in the county council area over the past number of years.  I do not think it has given rise to any serious difficulties. I have had no complaints about how it works.  We are talking about a sum in the region of £20 million out of a total budget estimate of roughly £1,000 million for local authorities.  I am rejecting the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there will be any further contributions on this amendment from the Fianna Fáil Party. We have stated our position on it.  The Minister continues to make what I consider to be misleading statements about the effects of this Bill.  To throw in the figure of £20 million at this stage seems to me to be done to give the impression that we are talking about very small money, and that it will always remain small money.  If the Minister considers £20 million to be raised by way of charges in 1983 small money, so be it.</P>
      <P>There is no limitation in any section of the Bill on the amount of money which can be raised in any future year by way of these charges.  What might be £20 million in 1983 could very easily become £200 million in 1986.  That is the danger contained here because of the changes the Minister is proposing in section 9.  As this is only an interpretation or definition section, we do not intend to spend any further time on it.  We will have to come back when our main amendment with regard to reserved functions is being discussed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>On section 1, I want the Minister to clarify whether the charges will be confined solely to services provided to individuals.  Many people would like the Minister to give a fuller definition of services in this context.  I am sure the Minister has received a circular from the Confederation of Irish Industry.  They are concerned that the charges proposed in this Bill may apply under the Water Pollution Act in relation to the discharge of effluent.  They posed some questions which I should like to put to the Minister at this point.  I am sure he has been acquainted with them.</P>
      <P>One is whether power here will be limited to specific services, or whether the discharge of an effluent from an industrial plant for which charges can be levelled under other Acts could be levied for charges under this Act.  There is also the question of uniformity of charges throughout the country.  One local authority could decide that their charges would be raised largely under one heading rather than being spread out over a number of the services they were providing, and in that way there might be a disadvantage in one local authority area for an industrialist as against locating in another area.  This might make it more competitive for people to manufacture their goods in one local authority area as against another.</P>
      <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry were concerned about the effect these charges might have if there was not some uniformity in the manner in which they were applied throughout the country.  I am only posing the questions, because I feel personally that there has to be an element of discretion in the determination. Our whole thrust is that the elected members should decide this.  In arguing that, we would also argue that they should have full discretion to decide on the level of the charges.  To give the Minister an opportunity to allay the fears of the Confederation of Irish Industry, I would ask him to give a more detailed definition of service in this context than is given in the Bill.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Planning Act is specifically excluded.  The definition is intended to embrace all services and facilities provided by a local authority to a person or in respect of premises, for example, where a person or premises can be identified as enjoying or having available individually or directly to him a particular service, such as waste disposal services or waste disposal facilities, sewage disposal, various licences and permits. The intention is that local authorities will be free to make charges over as wide a range of services as possible.  It is for the authority themselves to decide which of the relevant services will be charged for and which will not.  The Water Pollution Act contains provisions itself, and will not come within the constraints or the provisions of this Bill.  This Bill will not affect that Act because it has its own provisions in relation to licences, and so on.</P>
      <P>To clarify Deputy Bruton's point about services provided on a general or community-wide basis such as the ones mentioned, street lighting or road sweeping, these are not covered within the definition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 3, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2580" />&ldquo;(4)  The making of a charge under the provisions of this section shall be a reserved function exercisable directly by the elected members of the local authority concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have already debated fairly substantially the Fianna Fáil point of view in this regard.  The intention behind this amendment is to do exactly what we have been saying since the debate started this morning, to write into the Bill a section stating that it shall be a function only of the elected members of the local authority. I am sure there is a temptation on your part, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, to ask us not to repeat the arguments we have already made.  However, this is crucial to our opposition to the Bill as presented by the Minister.  As a party we are not opposed, in principle, to the idea of bringing in charges if they are brought in to give the local authorities a further source of revenue.  That is not being done.  The Minister spoke about the shortfall which existed in local authorities and the difficulties they have experienced since 1978 when rates were taken off houses and a limit put on the rate which could be struck each year.  That was done for very good reasons, particularly to protect commercial and industrial properties against exorbitant poundage being struck each year.  The Minister is more or less boasting that he has changed the law in this regard and is allowing local authorities to strike whatever rate they like on commercial and industrial properties. We do not altogether applaud this because the industrial and commercial property owners are providing essential employment, which is of crucial importance at present, and will always be so.  If excessive taxation burdens are to bear on industrial and commercial concerns to such an extent that they can no longer continue to trade successfully, then excessive levels of commercial rates are of no benefit to anybody.  It is questionable whether the Minister's move in this regard is of any great benefit.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister why he uses different forms of words when addressing different audiences in regard to the main provisions of the Bill In a <Col N="2581" /> circular sent to local authorities on 10 May 1983, section 10 states:</P>
    <P>Functions: The charges functions assigned to local authorities under the Bill will, as executive functions, fall to be performed by the manager.</P>
    <P>Yet, on 1 June, the Minister in his Second Stage speech put this in a completely different way.  He said:</P>
    <P>The basic responsibility for deciding on the amount to be raised by charges will fall to be exercised by the council members....</P>
    <P>Those two documents were prepared in the Department of the Environment by or for the Minister, and in the Dáil Chamber the emphasis is on creating the impression that the levying of these new charges will be exercised by elected council members.  He makes no such assertion to the county managers but states that charges functions assigned to local authorities under the Bill will fall to be performed by the manager.  That is the double talk of which I accused the Minister earlier on and it is an obvious intention to cover the real implications of this Bill.  The Bill is disastrous as far as local authorities are concerned, and, if the views of the elected Members of this House are not going to be accepted by the Government, it is a very sad day for democracy and this Parliament.  It will be a tragic day for local authorities and for people elected to them because they will be affected most by the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>During the Second Stage debate Deputy Doyle spoke very strongly and expressed her serious concern at the provisions of the Bill attempting to give power to managers to implement its provisions. It is not good enough for the Minister to state that the <i>status quo</i> will be maintained.  He seemed to think that was a satisfactory reply to the points we were making.  When this Bill is enacted the <i>status quo</i> will not be maintained because the law will have changed.  The power to levy charges will have changed and the obligation on the Exchequer to recoup in respect of house grants will have been changed.  The whole method of financing local authorities will also <Col N="2582" /> have changed and charging of local services will no longer be a source of minor revenue to local authorities.  As the Minister said, a transition will take place on the whole question of financing local authorities, a transition from Exchequer to local revenue sources and it will become a major source of local tax.</P>

This release included a quarterly series retrospective to 1980 for manufacturing <Col N="2588" /> and for transportable goods industries.</P>

    <P>Minor revisions of this order of magnitude are a normal feature when results of a short-term sample inquiry are adjusted to take account of results of full-scale censuses.  They do not in any way invalidate the usefulnes of the initial results in indicating trends.  I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy that the publication and the way in which it is made out may mislead people somewhat and I am assuming the question refers to the information I have given here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is right in his assumption but will he acknowledge that the figures for manufacturing industry generally were not quoted by him in his reply?  There is a downward trend in the third and fourth quarters of 1981 from 6.3 and 7.3 per cent as initially indicated in the provisional figures to 5.6 per cent and 5.8 per cent.  That has been the pattern over the last number of years. The final figures always show a drop in the actual level of industrial production as distinct from the provisional figures and would the Minister try to ensure &mdash; it is a matter of statistical accuracy &mdash; that the original figures will be more precise and accurate?  In the last few years, and particularly now, when the final figures come in they show a downward adjustment of up to 2 per cent.  That is quite significant in many cases.  That is the first <Col N="2589" /> point.  The second point is in view of the fact there is in the final analysis perhaps a two year lacuna showing a downward revision, ultimately of 2 per cent, would be advise his colleagues, particularly the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, against relying on the provisional figures, such as these March figures, when they come out in order to imply there is a big boost in industrial production, the more so since the percentage for January last year, when we almost had a freeze-up, shows the percentage is totally misleading when the final figures come out later?</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>Centralised export marketing of pigmeat has for many years been the function of the Pigs and Bacon Commission which is now controlled by the industry. The commission have had considerable success in developing exports to Japan and sales to that country this year may well reach a record level of up to 15,000 tonnes.</P>
      <P>Because of the difficult market situation in the EEC, increased export refunds have been secured this year as well as a scheme of aid for private storage of pigmeat. These measures are helping to relieve the situation.</P>
      <P>As regards curtailing imports of pigmeat, economic restrictions on imports from other member states are not permissible under EEC rules.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We always give every possible assistance and advice to the industry. I might point out that the Minister for Industry and Energy is going to Japan tomorrow and I will specifically ask him to see if he can further improve the volume of pork exports to Japan.  We have an opening there at the moment because of the foot and mouth disease problem in Denmark as a result of which the Japanese are not taking pork from Denmark. It has given us this opening and I am glad to say that the Irish bacon curers are taking full advantage of this opening and are doing tremendous business with Japan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that in the situation which pertains at present, when we are importing, in pork and bacon, the produce of about 130,000 pigs per year and in addition there is unofficial importation of pigs <Col N="2598" /> which is causing serious problems in the trade, these are areas which need to be examined very closely in regard to production, not marketing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not mention it but I presume he is referring to smuggling.  It has been there as long as the Border has been there and will be there for many years to come.  The particular trade which the Deputy has mentioned is referred to as the pig carousel trade, that is, the pigs go back over again and in doing so get the advantage of MCAs.  Every agency and every Government have tried to eliminate that, but unsuccessfully.  I am afraid that people in the Deputy's part of the country are particularly adept at smuggling &mdash; no offence to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Minister in respect of the difficulties that the Danes find themselves in, is it his intention to explore other possibilities for markets which the Danes held?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our intention to explore every possibility.  Unfortunately, the pig industry in the EEC generally is extremely depressed at the moment, more so in Britain than here, but it is a very severe problem and we are doing everything we can.  The pig industry is by nature cyclical and this is one of the depressions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us from statistics in the Department the number of pigs produced in the country? The Minister must know the number of pigs being slaughtered, because slaughterings are monitored and supervised.  He should be able to calculate the number of pigs being imported illegally.  Has the Minister considered the implications of this for the pig industry?  Everybody who produces a pig is being levied to support <Col N="2599" /> the sale of pigs on the export market. Therefore, smuggling has severe and unfair implications for farmers who are not involved in smuggling.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the overall figures because they are not requested in the original question.  However, I have some statistics.  It is estimated that 588,372 live pigs were imported from Northern Ireland in 1982.  However, it is estimated that real imports amounted to less than half of this number because of the Border carousel trade to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>For the sake of peace and quiet I do not mind replying to the Deputy.  There are loopholes in present legislation involving prosecutions regarding the constitution of feedingstuffs.  We are examining at the moment and have been for some time past ways of improving the regulations.  In particular it is hoped to make new regulations under the European Communities Act, 1972, implementing the EEC farm regulations governing feedingstuffs.  There is a technical difficulty in that the feedingstuffs have to be for sale and it is difficult to prove that.  Samples are taken in the compounders' premises and it is difficult to prove that the feedingstuffs are for sale at that point.  There is a technical difficulty at the moment that we are attempting to overcome.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> and <b>Mr. Leonard</b> asked the Minister for Agriculture the proposals his Department have to curtail the importation of poultrymeat in view of the financial crisis facing many poultry producers in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EEC rules we cannot impose restrictions for economic reasons on trade with other member states.  That is a trend running through a lot of questions in the last few weeks.  We are in the EEC and cannot impose restriction on trade with other members.  However, because of our high avian health status, imports of raw poultrymeat are allowed from only Northern Ireland and Denmark.</P>
      <P>Substantial aid is, of course, available for the modernisation of poultry plants. In 1982 £1.38 million was made available through the IDA and FEOGA for these purposes and applications for double this amount are under consideration at present.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that when we are importing a third of our requirements of poultrymeat the situation is serious?  He said that the two countries he mentioned are the prime source of imports.  Would he agree in relation to at least one of them that the built-in aids to that industry militate against fair competition between imports and the home-produced commodity?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last part of the Deputy's question.  Regarding his initial statement, we do not import a third of our requirements of poultrymeat.  We <Col N="2603" /> import 16 per cent, which amounts to about £8 million worth of poultrymeat.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of those imports 97 per cent come from Northern Ireland.  In relation to the other part of the Deputy's question, yes, there is a considerable advantage to the North of Ireland producer in this field.  However, much of it is due to the fact that this industry was highly developed before our accession to the EEC in 1973.  They have far larger units and, therefore, are far more efficient producers.  There are other benefits also.  Energy, for instance, is considerably cheaper in the North and feeding stuff is also cheap.  They have an advantage and that is a difficulty we must face up to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am most concerned about the situation and I realise there was a tannery in Ballybay, the Deputy's constituency. The remaining tanneries are located in my constituency in County Waterford and they are experiencing <Col N="2608" /> considerable difficulty.  I will look into the point further.  Apparently, the market price in Europe for hides is extremely high and most countries can import them considerably cheaper from South America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated that the question would be more relevant to the Department of Industry and Energy but will he accept that in his reply today he painted a picture of the Department of Agriculture being production-orientated only?  Will the Minister accept that he should be organising with the Department of Industry and Energy a proper processing and marketing arrangement for our hides?  If there is such a price available in Europe it means that European processors are making money.  Why should we not be processing our own raw material rather than exporting it?  It is amazing that the Minister, a representative from Waterford, did not know until the question was tabled that 96 per cent of our hides are being exported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt if any Members from Waterford were aware of that.  The hide trade is not well publicised and we do not have much information about it. The Deputy referred to the marketing and development aspects of the Department and I should like to point out to him that in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Energy I have arranged for a senior official from my Department to be appointed to the board of the IDA to further the marketing end of the industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the processing side?  Surely there is an initiative the Minister can take on that side?  If the European processors are prepared to pay such high prices, surely it makes good economic and national sense at a time of high unemployment to have the processing of our own raw materials carried out here rather than export them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The first requirement for a thriving food industry is an adequate supply of top-quality raw materials.  Since I took office a major policy aim has been to secure substantially increased and more efficient farm production.  In addition to those on-going activities of the Department of Agriculture which are designed to expand and improve agricultural output, the best deal in recent years was secured for Irish farmers in this year's EEC price negotiations.  This should help <Col N="2613" /> to restore farmers' confidence and encourage them to increase productivity and efficiency, which must be the basis for any food industry.  Unfortunately, we did not have the weather to accompany all that.</P>
      <P>In March I established an inter-Departmental committee to monitor food imports, to identify those which could be produced at home and to assess why they are being imported.  In the light of the detailed information which the committee will produce I will consider what further steps can be taken towards the provision of processing facilities to displace such imports.  I have also reappointed the horticultural development group for a three-year period to identify potential areas of development in the horticultural industry and to make recommendations to me on the measures needed to achieve such development as well as on specific programmes and projects.</P>
      <P>Careful planning and preparation are, of course, essential for the development of new food processing projects.  In this connection continuing advice and assistance are available to promoters from my Department and from the IDA, and substantial grants may moreover be obtained both from the IDA and from FEOGA for new projects.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Leonard says, over the years it could be argued that some potentially good agricultural land was planted by the Department of Forestry.  There is a great deal of liaison, particularly at regional level and in the various counties between the Forestry and the Irish Land Commission.  In recent times this relationship has been strengthened. I am not aware of good agricultural land that has been planted recently.  This is for obvious reasons.

      <P>Would the Minister agree that unless a thorough examination is made by the Department and the forestry officials we could very well reach the situation again in particular areas if there is not a demand for agricultural land that it could be offered to the Forestry Service and planted?  There is no system at the moment by which land is examined and monitored in regard to whether it is suitable for agricultural land.  It is possible in time to come, if land <Col N="2616" /> prices fall, that this land could be taken over for forestry.</P>

      <P>I propose to take <Col N="2617" /> Questions Nos. 31 and 32 together.  I am at present engaged in a comprehensive review of all aspects of land policy including the problem of commonage division.</P>
      <P>As Deputies are no doubt aware, existing legislation provides that where one or more but not all of the owners of a commonage wish to have it divided it is open to them to apply to the Land Commission for compulsory division.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that at the present time a great deal of pressure is being put on by farming organisations, the Land Commission and farmers to have marginal land or commonage divided because the extra acreage means a great deal to small farmers? Is the Minister aware that one individual can hold up the whole operation? When does he propose to take active steps to ensure that this situation cannot continue?  When a majority of local farmers are in favour of having land divided will he try to introduce the necessary legislation to make it easier for the division?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the Deputy's concern and I share it.  It is a more complex problem than it appears at first sight.  There is a compulsory division section in our legislation which, to my knowledge, has not been applied for through the Land Commission.  There might have been various reasons for this over the years.  As the Deputy says, because there is legislation to deal with one or two objectors, I have asked the Land Commission officers to earmark for me commonages that have been held up because of this.  The particular legal machinery we have will be fully tried out. If we fail there, new legislation can be introduced to deal with the one or two objectors in the national and local interests.</P>

The various powers at our disposal will be utilised.  It is quite likely that the legislation we have is good enough.  I want to have it tried out and after that we will take further steps if they are found necessary.</P>

At my request the Industrial Development Authority have had discussions with the <Col N="2622" /> key shareholders and have made suggestion to them aimed at maintaining the existing employment in the company. However, the shareholders have not reacted positively to these suggestions with the result that the future of the company remains in doubt.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that if this threatened closure takes place it will simply mean the transfer of jobs from Westport to England?  Further, is he aware that the parent company will then have the full benefit of Irish markets for the sale of thread as this is the only factory in the country that manufactures this type of material?  Furthermore will he accept that this is another case of the multinationals putting in the boot in the case of small Irish companies where they have taken a shareholding?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Due principally to depressed market conditions and the high manufacturing costs of the Westport plant the company have incurred substantial trading loses.  The UK group, who have only a 50 per cent shareholding in the company, have considerable overcapacity in their own operations in the UK.  Proposals were made by the IDA to the UK shareholders and discussions have taken place with local shareholders. Regrettably, to date these have not proved successful because of commercial realities in this market segment, which, I think the Deputy will appreciate, are particularly difficult.</P>

This factory received grants up to £1,500,000 about two years ago but it now appears they are likely to close.  Will the Minister not accept that this is a very serious situation for Westport?  Will he ensure that something positive is done to have Westport regarded as an area where it is necessary to have employment provided as quickly as possible?</P>

As I am sure the Deputy is aware, the IDA are, within their limitations, vigorously promoting County Mayo as a location for industry.  There is a 21,800 sq. foot advance factory in Westport and two cluster units of 3,300 sq. ft. also, each of which is being promoted for suitable projects. In addition, there are 36 acres of industrial land.  Every measure is being taken to take account of the serious employment problems already existing in Westport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The dispute at the Dublin Gas Company results from the proposed conversion to natural gas.  The unions had sought compensation for the conversion and the matter was referred to the Labour Court, which heard the case on 18 May.  The Labour Court recommended a phased increase of 8 per cent &mdash; 5 per cent on acceptance and 3 per cent from 1 July 1984 &mdash; and a lump sum of £1,800 in four phases up to June 1985.  This recommendation was rejected by the company who have now threatened to withdraw from <Col N="2624" /> the conversion programme to natural gas.</P>
      <P>I understand that dismissal notices for up to 400 staff may be imminent and that industrial action by the unions is possible should dismissal notices issue.  I have had no request from either side to intervene in this dispute but I am keeping in close touch with developments which could have serious consequences for gas users and which threatens the proposed conversion to natural gas in Dublin.

I must remind the Deputy of the debate we had on the Estimate last Thursday when I said it was my policy, as Minister for Labour, in the matter of industrial disputes to have no direct intervention in them.  It has been my judgment since I first took office that direct intervention is totally counter-productive in terms of fostering a generally healthy industrial relations climate in the long term.

As a matter of urgency, would he intervene to prevent the notices being issued and, if possible, allow the dispute settling machinery of his Department to prevent this dispute worsening?

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to make a statement on the meeting of the European Council which I attended in Stuttgart on 17-19 June, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I arranged to have laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas the Conclusions of the Presidency and the Declarations issued or signed at the meeting, including the text of the Solemn Declaration on European Union as circulated following the meeting. I intend to have the Presidency text of the Solemn Declaration placed in the Library as soon as we receive it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the doubts I expressed in the past about the value of many of these European Council meetings. I have to say that this meeting proved to be of considerable significance for the future of the European Community. What was at issue there was whether the member states could agree to changes in the budget which are a pre-condition for the enlargement and development of <Col N="2687" /> the Community or whether other considerations including in particular the purely national concerns of individual member states, would cause tensions sufficient to tear the Community apart.  The length and tone of the discussions reflected these basic difficulties &mdash; at times in ways that were strikingly robust.  There was indeed for a time a real danger that counterbalancing pre-conditions on different sides would result in a situation of deadlock, that there would be a failure to take decisions and that, in the end, the Community would be precipitated into what would have been a dangerous, and potentially explosive crisis.</P>
    <P>In the event, by contrast, the outcome was strikingly positive.  The impulse towards the maintenance and development of the Community and its policies was strengthened, and forward-looking orientations were given for negotiations to be conducted within a specified time-table on the question of increasing own resources, taking account of possible savings, in policies, including the Common Agricultural Policy, and of enlargement and of the problems of individual member states, so that decisions may be taken on all those issues at the next European Council meeting in Athens in December.</P>
    <P>The Minister and I, with gratifying support from colleagues, were successful in preventing damage to Irish interests in the Common Agricultural Policy.  In fact, a comparison between the proposals circulating recently on that subject and the conclusions of the Stuttgart Council will show a really remarkable degree of understanding and support for the basic principles of that policy &mdash; with at the same time a rational emphasis on the need for prudent expenditure controls. In other areas, also, to which I shall refer, involving both the economic and political domains, the conclusions reached were satisfactory.  Finally, all ten member states were able to sign the Solemn Declaration on European Union, an event which confirms the commitment of these European countries to closer integration and eventual union, and we also agreed on a number of foreign policy declarations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2688" /> I should like to pay a warm tribute to the exceptionally skilful handling of the meeting by the German Presidency, in the persons of Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Foreign Minister and Vice-Chancellor Hans Dietrich Genscher.  In particular on the key issue of Community financing, their sensitivity and determination, their sense of balance and of the overriding Community interest, made a crucial contribution to the satisfactory outcome of the meeting.  I am happy to tell the House that Chancellor Kohl has accepted an invitation from me to pay an official visit to Ireland at a time to be arranged probably in the autumn.</P>
    <P>As arranged at the previous meeting of the European Council in Brussels, I had a friendly and constructive meeting in Stuttgart with the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher.  We discussed matters of mutual concern, including arrangements for future contacts between the two Governments.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs had a meeting in parallel with the British Foreign Secretary, Sir Geoffrey Howe.  We now look forward to further meetings at different levels, including a formal bilateral meeting at Head of Government level, probably before the end of this year.  This process will involve a complete normalisation of Anglo-Irish relations before the end of the present year.</P>
    <P>The most difficult and intensive discussions over the three days of the Stuttgart meeting concerned the development of Community policies, the issues relating to enlargement, the British wish to receive financial relief for what they regard as the excessive share of Community own resources collected in the UK and the need, as perceived by some, for greater budgetary discipline.</P>
    <P>Over the last three or four years, the Community has been approaching the end of its financial capacity, on the basis of current arrangements, as its expenditure has inexorably closed on the maximum permissible amount of revenue or own resources, as they are called.</P>
    <P>The Community's own resources are drawn from three sources: the receipts from customs duties payable under the Common External Tarrif, the proceeds <Col N="2689" /> of levies imposed on imports under the Common Agricultural Policy and the proceeds of a rate of value-added tax which may not, under existing provisions, exceed 1 per cent.  With the liberalisation of trade and expansion of Community agricultural production, the first two sources are not particularly buoyant.  The base on which VAT is assessed has been expanding somewhat faster, but still at a rate insufficient to keep pace with the expenditure demands as Community policies have developed.  As a consequence, it has been necessary, from one year to another, to strike higher rates of VAT.</P>
    <P>The VAT rate originally settled for the 1983 budget was 0.79 per cent.  However, since the beginning of the year, expenditure under the CAP has been running up more than 30 per cent above expenditure in the corresponding period of last year. This calls for a supplementary budget which may have to provide additional funds also because of an apparent underestimation of the amount payable arising from the arrangement the British secured last October in regard to the 1983 budget. These developments will bring the rate of VAT very close to the 1 per cent ceiling this year, and they leave no doubt that the limit on own resources would be reached in 1984-1985 in the absence of measures to deal with the situation.  The Community could thereafter be unable to finance even existing policies.</P>
    <P>It has been a common view of successive Irish Governments over the last four years that the limit on own resources should be raised.  Last February the Commission published a Green Paper and in response to the guidelines from the March meeting of the European Council finally put forward last month proposals for new own resources.</P>
    <P>There are two central elements in the Commission's proposals, both based on the VAT mechanism.  In the first place, they propose replacement of the existing 1 per cent ceiling, not by a new ceiling but, rather, by a system of increases every five to seven years, by steps of 0.4 per cent or roughly £4.5 billion.  Such increases would have to be approved by the Council, acting unanimously, and by <Col N="2690" /> the European Parliament through a majority of its members and three-fifths of the votes cast.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Commission proposed that, as long as CAP guarantee expenditure exceeded 33 per cent of the budget, the share of VAT that member states would normally pay to the budget would be adjusted for the excess proportion.  At present, for example, this would mean that for 25 per cent of the overall budget, member states' VAT contributions would be assessed differently from the normal method which could continue to apply to the rest of the budget.  The adjustment of VAT shares would be by reference to three indicators, two of them measures of relative prosperity and overall benefit from the operation of the Community, the third being the member states' share in the value of the Community's final agricultural production.</P>
    <P>It appears that the operation of this system might confer a small net advantage, in purely budgetary terms, on Ireland, but there would also be disadvantages. Irish reactions to the proposals had been made clear by the Minister for Foreign Affairs at three meetings with his colleagues in the Council this month and last, and to representatives of the Presidency and of the Commission who have visited Dublin.</P>
    <P>Other member states also made known their views.  In some cases there was predictable emphasis on the need for savings in spending on the Common Agricultural Policy and, indeed, this view appeared to be fairly widely held.  The overriding British concern was, of course, to obtain agreement on a rebate of their contribution to the Community budget.  They saw both satisfaction on this and achievement of substantial savings on agricultural spending as preconditions for agreement, even in principle, on increasing own resources.  Both they and some other member states had other ideas about adjustments to the Community's financial system which would have gone far towards &ldquo;juste retour&rdquo; and the consequent subversion of the financial and common policy basis of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Presidency drew up a report in which it sought to strike a balance <Col N="2691" /> between the varying viewpoints of the member states.  When this was circulated, in advance of the special meeting of the Council held on 13 June, our assessment of it was most adverse.  Our views were put forward trenchantly by the Minister. Nevertheless, the basis presented to us for our discussions in Stuttgart was this Presidency paper essentially unchanged, accompanied by statements of member states' reservations.</P>
    <P>There was in this draft a totally disproportionate emphasis on savings and limitations on expenditure: as one of my Community colleagues sardonically observed, the word &ldquo;dynamic&rdquo; appeared in this draft only in relation to cuts.  There was even the suggestion that the achievement of agreement on the future financing of the Community should be conditional on savings on the CAP, and the terms of reference for consideration of measures to adjust the CAP were, from an Irish standpoint, unbalanced.</P>
    <P>In my intervention on the first day I made these points and said that the starting point of the discussion must be the consistent and strongly-expressed view of the Commission that new own resources are urgently required.  I recalled my reservation in March about this use of the term &ldquo;budgetary imbalances&rdquo; which as Chancellor Kohl had himself recently emphasised, can mislead people.</P>
    <P>On the suggested examination of expenditure under the Common Agricultural Policy, I stressed, <i>inter alia:</i></P>
    <P>&mdash;the need to take proper account of farm income requirements, long-term food security and the Community's balance of payments,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the acceptability of any proposals that would be directed towards freezing existing production levels in member states where these are well below the Community average and where there is far greater dependence on the farm products involved, as is the case with milk, for example, in the Irish case,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the need for stronger action against distortions in the market caused by <Col N="2692" /> MCAs, national aids and other internal barriers,</P>
    <P>&mdash;the need to tackle the problem of excessive intensification of agricultural production, involving the so-called factory farms.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly, some other interventions were in the opposite sense.  However, the theme running through most of the contributions was, strikingly, the centrality and importance of the CAP and full acceptance that it should not be made the scapegoat for all the difficulties within the Community.</P>
    <P>The debate on new own resources, the British rebate and savings brought us through three further drafts before we reached agreement on the Declaration issued last Sunday.  This Declaration represents a balanced outcome which, I am confident, opens the way towards new own resources and, in its own words, the provision of a solid basis for the further dynamic development of the Community.</P>
    <P>The exigencies of obtaining agreement have led to the use of oblique language in delicate equilibrium.  All the member states have agreed that decisions will be taken on all the issues, including future financing, at the end of a major negotiation involving Ministers for Foreign Affairs, Finance and Agriculture, which is to be completed this year.  Consideration of the own resources aspect will be on the basis of, <i>inter alia,</i> the development of Community policies and enlargement. No savings that are feasible or conceivable could offset the requirements arising in these areas.  The emerging facts and logic of the situation must lead to a decision to increase own resources without delay; but I must emphasise to this House that that decision still remains to be taken.  We think that the logic of events must compel it &mdash; but until it actually happens we should not assume, with certainty, that it will.</P>
    <P>In regard to compensation to our British partners, the European Council agreed, pursuant to our decision of last March, that an amount of 750 million ECU &mdash; about IR£540 million &mdash; would <Col N="2693" /> be incorporated in the draft Community budget for 1984, to be tabled by the Commission. The draft budget has, of course, to be considered by the budgetary authorities, the Council and the European Parliament.  The financing by the member states of any rebate would be a matter for further consideration but I registered the belief that, in view of Ireland's lower level of national output per head than in the UK, Community, solidarity should be reflected, as before, by arrangements to, in effect, abate Ireland's contribution to the rebate.</P>
    <P>The declaration states that there is to be an examination of the CAP, to result in concrete steps compatible with market conditions being taken to ensure effective control of agricultural expenditure by making full use of available possibilities. The declaration contains a list of areas or questions to be examined.  I am glad to say that we have succeeded in having a number of important changes made to this list, both by way of inclusion of items omitted from the original draft or elimination of items in that text or subsequently suggested by other delegations which could have been damaging to us. We succeeded in having inserted references to Community preference &mdash; relevant in regard to New Zealand butter and other concessionary imports; to the type, as well as the size of farms; to &ldquo;the particular situations of the various categories of farmers&rdquo;, by reference to which we can pursue our points about low farm productivity consequent on historic factors in Ireland; to internal barriers to trade e.g. health regulations, genuine or otherwise; and to problems of regions at a disadvantage for economic, as well as natural features.  A helpful inclusion, at the instance of a like-minded member state, was &ldquo;external agricultural policy&rdquo;, where there is scope for the Community to be more active, both in promotion and in defensive action in traditional markets.</P>
    <P>It was also accepted on my proposal that national aids and their effects could be considered under the item &ldquo;aids and premium arrangements&rdquo;.  Following earlier negotiations in which we had been active, the list already referred to MCAs. The whole section on the CAP is, of <Col N="2694" /> course, introduced by an express commitment that the basic principles of the policy will be observed in keeping with the objectives set forth in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>The Council spent some time on other aspects of Community affairs, on which there are Presidency Conclusions.  On the subject of economic recovery, the European Council considered that the prospects for sustained and non-inflationary economic recovery should be reinforced by developing and defining more precisely the action being taken throughout the Community.  The Commission were requested to review the nature and extent of recovery and national measures taken to consolidate and accelerate it; to make full use of Community financial instruments to support the recovery; and on this basis to indicate what new factors the member states and the Community can bring forward to underpin the recovery, as and when necessary.</P>
    <P>In view of the inconclusive outcome of the Williamsburg Summit and the still hesitant and vulnerable nature of the recovery in Europe and internationally, I was reasonably content with these guidelines for action.  A number of my ministerial colleagues and I had made considerable efforts, in contacts with our counterparts, to secure adoption of a more positive Community attitude at Williamsburg &mdash; for which a particularly good position recommended by the Commission was, unfortunately, not adopted as the Community position for that Summit.</P>
    <P>There are now more than 4,500,000 young people in the Community without jobs.  The meeting welcomed with some satisfaction the recent decisions of the Social Affairs Council on the reform of the European Social Fund which proposed a 40 per cent increase in the fund next year and which will allow a high degree of priority to be given in allocating this greatly increased sum to the fight against youth unemployment.  I was glad to join in this expression of satisfaction on an outcome which had represented a notably successful negotiation by the Minister for Labour.  That Council had decided that 75 per cent of the fund's <Col N="2695" /> resources should be allocated to actions to relieve unemployment among young people aged up to 25.  These decisions have been expressed in a way that will suit the particular composition of the age group in question in Ireland.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Minister obtained a decision that 40 per cent of the fund's resources should be reserved for the six super-priority regions, including Ireland and Northern Ireland, despite the fact that some member states were opposed to any regional allocation, although 50 per cent of resources had previously been reserved for a wider group of less developed regions &mdash; involving all those eligible for aid from the Regional Fund.</P>
    <P>Our applications will now have less competition, with a 40 per cent share of a growing figure guaranteed to regions which, over the last three years, together received an average of 38 per cent.  The youth and regional earmarkings combined should ensure that we in Ireland, with the youngest and fastest growing population in the Community, will be able to increase further our efforts directed at providing employment, training and work experience for our young people.</P>
    <P>The European Council also welcomed the resolutions on vocational training in the eighties and vocational training measures in relation to the introduction of new information technologies, recently adopted by the Council.  We also asked the relevant Community bodies actively to pursue their consideration of recent communications from the Commission on the promotion of youth employment and the reduction and readjustment of working time.</P>
    <P>I raised in Stuttgart, as I had said I would do, the use of new forms of protectionism to influence the location of mobile international investment.  I referred to the distortions caused by procurement policies in some states and to the increasing use of technical and health regulations as forms of protectionism.  I underlined the need we saw for the continuation and extension of the work already undertaken at the Internal Market Council meetings, held during the <Col N="2696" /> German Presidency, in order to strengthen the integration of the Community market.  The final paragraph of the Presidency's Conclusions on the Internal Market has, on our proposal, been phrased in such a way that our concerns can be taken up in further work on promoting a Community-wide market.</P>
    <P>The Conclusions also contain a section on the Sixth UNCTAD Conference due to open soon in Belgrade and to the economic position and development of the Third World countries.  The positive tone of the section reflects particularly the efforts of the Netherlands and Irish delegations.</P>
    <P>Finally, on the Community side, the European Council reached conclusions on the need to strengthen Community policies in the areas of steel, transport and the environment.  In the discussion of European Political Co-operation topics, we reviewed some of the main problem areas in the world.  The first of these was Poland, a country on which the attention of the world is now focused because of the current visit of His Holiness the Pope.  We expressed our conviction that only a national reconciliation, which takes full account of the aspirations of the Polish people can lead Poland out of its present crisis.</P>
    <P>Secondly, we promised that our Governments would examine in a positive spirit the important initiative recently taken by the Spanish Prime Minister to unblock the present stalemate in the negotiations at the meeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in Madrid.  We appealed to the Governments of other participating States to do likewise, in the interest of securing the adoption of substantial and balanced conclusions to the conference which would register progress in the human rights area and open the way to a Conference on Disarmament in Europe.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, on the Middle East, we expressed our conviction that the return of sovereignty and peace to Lebanon requires the complete and prompt withdrawal of all foreign forces from that country, with the exception of those, such as international peacekeeping forces, <Col N="2697" /> whose presence may be requested by the Lebanese Government.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the deep interest and concern of Irish Public opinion at the tragic conflicts which beset Central America, where Irish missionaries and civilian volunteers are working in conditions of great hardship and constant danger. Ireland was particularly active in ensuring that the Heads of State and Government would put on record their views on the situation in that troubled area of the world.</P>
    <P>Deputies will note from the conclusions of the Council that the Heads of State and Government expressed full support for the current regional initiative of the Contadora Group of countries, and readiness to continue contributing to further development of that area, in order to promote progress towards stability.  I am sure that the House will agree that the European Council made two points of particular importance and value on the situation in Central America:</P>
    <P>first, the Ten clearly pointed to the causal link between socio-economic conditions and political tensions in the region; and they called for strict observance of human rights;</P>
    <P>second, the Ten, who are an important force in world affairs, have stated unequivocally that the problems of Central America must be solved by political and not military means, from within the region itself and with full respect for the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers.</P>
    <P>We hope that these two conclusions will be heeded by all concerned in the tragic situation in Central America.</P>
    <P>As the House will be aware, the members of the European Council at Stuttgart signed the Solemn Declaration on European Union.  The text of this document has been laid before the House.  I should like to pay special tribute to the initiative and vision which inspired the original co-sponsors of the Declaration of European Union, the Foreign Ministers of the Federal Republic of Germany and of Italy, Hans Dietrich Genscher and Emilio <Col N="2698" /> Colombo.  They and we have reason to be satisfied that as the Community faces into a very difficult debate which has crucial implications for its future, the Heads of State and Government meeting within the European Council, by adopting and signing the Solemn Declaration have reaffirmed their commitment to the basic ideals which inspired the founders of the Community.</P>
    <P>I was naturally happy that it fell to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and myself to sign the Solemn Declaration on behalf of Ireland.  In our view, it brought to a positive conclusion the negotiations which have been conducted under successive Governments.  The Irish approach in these negotiations has consistently, under different Governments, reflected the following national concerns. Ireland, when we joined the Community, accepted and committed herself to the goals of European Union, for two basic reasons:</P>
    <P>first, because of a belief that progressive and systematic movement towards European Union was good for the European Community and Europe as a whole and, therefore good for Ireland;</P>
    <P>secondly, because of a conviction that the future development of the Community and of collectively funded Community policies centrally administered, could be a crucial factor in the economic and social transformation of this country.</P>
    <P>In line with this approach, during the negotiations on the Solemn Declaration, Ireland consistently emphasised the importance of the link between developments in the economic and political areas if effective progress is to be made towards European Union.  We have argued that closer political integration must be based on greater economic convergence and that the evolution of common policies in the political areas will depend on the deliberate development and promotion of a growing community of interests in the economic area.</P>
    <P>In our view, support on the part of public opinion here and in Europe for <Col N="2699" /> movement towards European Union will be more readily forthcoming if the Community is seen to be willing to address in a practical way the problems, such as unemployment, inflation and industrial decline, which bear directly on people's lives.  It must be seen to devise and fund effective Community-wide policies to deal with these issues.  It is for this reason that sucessive Irish Governments have adopted a generally positive attitude towards the Genscher/Columbo proposals from the outset and, in particular, to those elements in the Solemn Declaration which are aimed at drawing together the economic and political achievements of the Community and of the Ten so as to facilitate greater institutional coherence and responsiveness on the part of the Community.</P>
    <P>The Government therefore hope that the adoption of the Solemn Declaration itself, the approach which it contains, and the framework which it provides will help to inform the major debate which has now begun on the future financing of the Community and the future of Community-wide policies.  It is essential that the Community be given the means, both financial and institutional, to ensure that the provisions of the Solemn Declaration can be transformed into realities and so that the public support which is crucial for progress towards European Union may be ensured.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to a number of specific features of the Solemn Declaration of a special concern for Ireland. The section dealing with the European Communities contains a number of useful affirmations from an Irish point of view. The emphasis given to the need for an overall economic strategy in the Community to combat unemployment and inflation and to promote convergence is very welcome.  So is the importance given to the defining of Community instruments and mechanisms which will permit action geared to the situation and specific needs of the least prosperous member states.</P>
    <P>The Declaration also stresses the importance of continuing the development of the CAP and maintaining the <Col N="2700" /> principles of unity of the market, Community preference and financial solidarity. This is especially welcome at this time because of the doubts which have arisen about the attitude of some member states to the CAP.  The Solemn Declaration acknowledges that the problems of the less favoured agricultural regions merit special attention.</P>
    <P>The text stresses that the development of the regional and social policies of the Community implies the transfer of resources to less prosperous regions.  This emphasis is also timely having regard to the current debate in the Community.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should refer to the provisions of the Declaration in regard to foreign policy.  The text sets out practical ways and means by which the process of European political co-operation may be strengthened and the co-ordination of the foreign policies of the member states made more coherent.  In effect the Solemn Declaration incorporates and draws together a series of practical improvements which have been made in this connection over recent years.</P>
    <P>It is important to be clear about the provisions of the Declaration in regard to consultation and co-ordination between member states on issues and questions relating to the political and economic aspects of security provisions which have had the formal endorsement of successive Governments through the period of negotiations.  The co-operation and consultation entailed fall explicitly within the framework of foreign policy co-operation. They relate essentially to the diplomatic activities of the Ten in regard to security-related issues arising in fora where the Ten are present as such &mdash; for example, in the CSCE in Madrid or the Disarmament Commission of the United Nations.  The &ldquo;economic aspects of security&rdquo; mentioned in the text relate to issues such as the security supply of raw materials and questions relating to East-West trade.  Issues relating to defence or military operations are outside the scope of the Solemn Declaration and, indeed, as Deputies will be aware, in the course of the negotiations a draft provision which might have permitted discussions involving <Col N="2701" /> meetings of Defence Ministers was deleted.</P>
    <P>All in all, it is to be hoped that the effect of the provisions of the Solemn Declaration in relation to Foreign Policy Co-operation will be to enable the Ten to speak and act more effectively, coherently and autonomously &mdash; as I think they did at this Council &mdash; both in our relations with third countries and in regard to the many difficult problems, political, economic and developmental, which we must face together in an interdependent world.</P>
    <P>I have taken more than the normal time to describe the outcome of the Stuttgart Council, but from what I have said I think that Deputies will understand the reason.  The Council extended over three days, working long into the night on each of the first two days.  It covered a range of matters of unusual importance and complexity.  In the conclusions we reached there is, I think, a reasonable balance between the competing demands of member states and the need of the Community for both financial and political impetus.  In short, this most difficult Council, instead of being a damaging failure as it might well have been, was a success with which all the participants can be reasonably happy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The outlook for the European Council in Stuttgart was never very hopeful and while, in the event, the Council did avoid a stalemate situation, that is about all that can be said for it. The basic economic and social problems of the Community remain untouched. Yet another European Council has allowed itself to be dominated by the subject of the British budgetary rebate. It seems there was no discussion worth mentioning of how economic recovery in Europe might be stimulated and co-ordinated or how the scourge of unemployment could be tackled.  Are we to take it that the present generation of European leaders do not see the solving of the unemployment problem as their primary duty?  We in Fianna Fáil believe that it should be and we intend to keep it to the forefront of political debate.  At every European Council that I attended I urged <Col N="2702" /> a co-ordinated European approach, a Community policy, to combat unemployment.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach made much, as he often does, before he went out to Stuttgart, of his intention to complain about certain protectionist practices which were discouraging firms from locating in Ireland. Post-Summit press briefings do not give any indication that his views on that subject received much attention.  In fact, until I read the Taoiseach's speech here today I was of the opinion that he had not mentioned them at all and even then the reference in his speech to this issue is vague and confused.  As far as I can see, he relies on the chapter in the Presidency Conclusions dealing with the internal market to indicate that he took some action on this matter but I cannot reconcile the Conclusions as I have them on the internal market with his statement that he had succeeded in doing something about these restrictive practices.</P>
      <P>He refers to the last paragraph and the last paragraph, as I see it, just says: &ldquo;Differences between national standards as well as in the service sector&rdquo; and the other previous paragraph talks about &ldquo;Completion of the internal market must remain a priority aim.  The measures decided at Copenhagen constitute only a first step in this direction.  Work must therefore continue <i>inter alia</i> on the removal of various forms of discrimination&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>As far as I can see, that particular chapter deals only with such things as certification for third country products, frontier formalities, company law directives and so on.  So, if the Taoiseach did mention this particular problem at Stuttgart, then I do not think anybody paid very much attention to what he had to say about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been generally accepted at all European Councils that I have attended that high interest rates are perhaps the greatest single deterrent to investment and therefore to the reduction of unemployment. On the Sunday prior to the European Council in Brussels the Taoiseach on RTE said that if interest rates did not come down again within a couple of weeks of devaluation he would want <Col N="2703" /> to know the reason why.  Interest rates are still high and as far as I can gather from the Taoiseach's statements here yesterday at Question Time they were not even discussed at Stuttgart.  Our exchange rate with sterling has fluctuated by about 15p since March, of which the devaluation element represents little more than one-quarter.  It must be obvious to everyone, therefore, that the 93p rate in early March was a temporary aberration unlikely to last and the Government's action in devaluing was costly and unnecessary.</P>
    <P>It was ironic to see the Taoiseach attempting to masquerade in Stuttgart as the defender of Irish agriculture.  The Government he leads have scrapped the Fianna Fáil four-year plan for agriculture, including the scheme of exchange guarantee loans for restocking.  His Government have also frozen the farm modernisation scheme, abolished a number of subsidies, suspended the farm retirement scheme and reduced or deferred drainage schemes.  The £112 million provided in Fianna Fáil's Public Capital Programme has been reduced to £96 million, a cut in investment in agriculture of nearly one-quarter in real terms.</P>
    <P>Again, looking at the Conclusions of the Summary, I do not think that the Taoiseach and his Minister for Foreign Affairs in Stuttgart have done a great day's work for Irish farmers, because it is only necessary to read the list of questions which are going to be examined under the heading &ldquo;Common Agricultural Policy&rdquo; to realise that they constitute a major onslaught on the Common Agriculture Policy and I regret very much that such a list was adopted as a Conclusion of this particular European Council.</P>
    <P>It was never on in my book that the British Government would receive both a special rebate on Britain's contribution to the Community budget as well as a fundamental change of Community agricultural policy to suit Britain.  The British have chosen to seek a special solution to their problem through a rebate and having received such a rebate their partisan arguments about agricultural spending <Col N="2704" /> should no longer be given any credence whatsoever.  The Common Agricultural Policy is one of the fundamental pillars of the Community and while we all agree that reforms and savings should be pursued in some areas, it is not possible to seriously interfere with the CAP without shaking the foundations of the Community itself.  For Ireland and for a number of our Community partners the Common Agricultural Policy is an essential part of the basis on which we decided to enter the Community.</P>
    <P>The British came away from the European Council with a more than adequate rebate of £450 million.  It was less than they sought.  On the other hand, the British Prime Minister is quoted in the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> of Monday, June 20 as saying, &ldquo;we have no legal entitlement to anything this year&rdquo;, presumably because of over-payments in previous years.  The Taoiseach, by the way, should tell us how much exactly Ireland will be contributing to this rebate.  It is important to understand that our contribution to the Community has been steadily increasing and if this latest agreement on the British rebate in Stuttgart has contributed further to that increase, than it must be deplored.</P>
    <P>It would appear that the British rebate was conceded after threats to disrupt the Council.  In my view, European leaders should not allow themselves to be intimidated in this manner by any of their members and there should be a firm decision that it will not be tolerated any more.  As things at present stand one can only be filled with foreboding at the future development of the European Community.  And here I differ totally and completely with the Taoiseach's bland summing up at the end of his statement and with what it implies.</P>
    <P>At the moment the Community has structures and decision-making mechanisms which make coherent decisions all but impossible.  It may be appropriate to ask whether Europe any longer has the capacity to make progress towards the fulfilment of the ideals envisaged by the founders of the Community.  The declaration of European ideals proposed by Foreign Ministers Genscher and Colombo <Col N="2705" /> is only a charade when contrasted with the practice of the European Council at Stuttgart which formally adopted the declaration.  We must all be somewhat cynically amused at the words the Taoiseach used when he said that he and his Foreign Minister were very happy that it fell to them to sign this declaration on Ireland's behalf.  If he uses words like that about that particular non-event, I shudder to think what sort of bombastic display we will have if the day ever comes when he signs an international document of some significance.</P>
    <P>Ireland has given consistent political support to the enlargement of the Community despite the effect on our own national interest in some respects.  With every enlargement, however, the Community becomes more and more diverse and unwieldy.  It is doubtful if structures appropriate to Europe of the Six or ever of the Nine are realistic when applied to Europe of the Twelve, with so many diverse interests, governments and national identities.  Enlargement ought to be accompanied not only by an increase in financial resources but by improvements in the decision-making procedures.</P>
    <P>The agreement on the need to increase financial resources is totally unsatisfactory. It reads, in the important part:</P>
    <P>On the basis of the calculations reached on development of policies, improving budgetary discipline and the examination of financial system, the extent and timing of the Community's requirements in terms of own resources will be determined.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to decide what that means. The Taoiseach, in a very charming piece of gobbledegook, speaks about &ldquo;the exigencies of obtaining agreement have led to the use of oblique language in delicate equilibrium&rdquo;.  I ask you to pause and consider that.  Is not that just simply a piece of shorthand for saying, &ldquo;We could not agree.  Therefore, we wrote a piece of gobbledegook that meant nothing&rdquo;? But, the key sentence in the Taoiseach's speech comes later, and I quote it:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2706" /> The emerging facts and logic of the situation must lead to a decision to increase own resources without delay, but I must emphasise to this House that decision will remain to be taken.</P>
    <P>Clearly no decision to increase the own resources has been taken and in fact what has happened is the British Government have obtained their rebate, a very handsome rebate of £450 million, to which we will contribute without any commitment to an increase in the Community's own resources.  It is not clear that there was any agreement whatever of any increase in those own resources in December but the British Prime Minister again is quoted as making such an increase conditional on substantial agricultural savings.  Again the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> is quite categoric.  It quotes the British Prime Minister as saying that the agreement to a financial &ldquo;re-launch&rdquo; of the EEC will take &ldquo;a lot of hard pounding&rdquo;.  It goes on to say:</P>
    <P>The Prime Minister has given nothing away on future financing of the community to secure the rebate and flatly rejected proposals for raising new funds by increases in VAT contributions of member states.  &ldquo;They are kaput&rdquo; she said.</P>
    <P>Our vital interests and the vital interests of the Community and its future policy lie in securing an increase in Community funding.  That has not been achieved.  In fact the outcome is completely negative.</P>
    <P>The European Declaration, now known as the Genscher/Colombo proposals, was adopted by the European Council in a watered down form.  We were resolutely opposed to this declaration in its original form which proposed a defence co-operation which seemed to us incompatable with our neutrality and independent foreign policy.  The declaration in its present form seeks, and I quote:</P>
    <P>Co-ordination of the position of member States and the political and certain economic aspects of security.</P>
    <P>These phrases repeat language first used in the London agreement on political operations in October 1981 which was <Col N="2707" /> approved by the previous Coalition Government against opposition from us in Fianna Fáil.  I think it would have been preferable to avoid reaffirming such language but, on the other hand, the political value now attached to the Genscher/Colombo text is such that it would be unprofitable on this occasion to make an issue out of it.  The president of the Commission recently called it a sad text.  <i>Agence - Europe</i> has called it a solemn declaration that conflicts with reality.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion since the Taoiseach's speech which caused me some anxiety arising out of that declaration. He states:</P>
    <P>All in all, it is to be hoped that the effect of the provision of the Solemn Declaration in relation to Foreign Policy Co-operation will be to enable the Ten to speak and act more effectively, coherently and autonomously in our relations with third countries, and in regard to the many difficult problems, political, economic and developmental, which we must face together in an interdependent world.</P>
    <P>I would hope that that would not be used on some future occasion to inhibit our freedom of action at the United Nations and elsewhere in support of disarmament, multilateral disarmament and particularly in nuclear disarmament or, at least, a freeze on further nuclear armament.  What is vitally important, however, is that no one in the Community should be in any doubt about our firm intention to maintain our policy of military neutrality.  Unfortunately the attitude of the Taoiseach, of the Minister for Defence and the Fine Gael Party generally is very ambivalent on this issue.  I notice the Taoiseach never uses the word &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; if he can avoid using it.  He prefers to speak about our being outside military alliances.  Being outside military alliances is a negative and minimal formulation. Even in the pages of waffle he has here about the Genscher/Colombo proposals, if they are of any importance at all to us they are important only so far as they relate to our military neutrality, <Col N="2708" /> but in all the pages of waffle he never once referred to Ireland's position of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Taoiseach in my view is remarkably reticent on vital international issues involving the future of mankind, such as the nuclear arms race.  A few weeks ago in reply to our spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Gerry Collins, he refused to raise Irish concern at the escalation of the arms race with Vice-President Bush who is coming to Europe principally to discuss American views on the siting of missiles in Europe.  Can there be something in the suggestion that he has no wish to discuss it in the trilateral commission on these issues?  We in Fianna Fáil, speaking for the vast majority of the people, wish to seek no further escalation of the nuclear arms race and the dangers of nuclear war.  I think it is time Irish people generally took a hard look at the position of the Fine Gael Party and particularly its members in the European Parliament.  Let me refer now to the resolution of the European Peoples' Party, or the Christian Democrats as they are properly called.  A report from <i>Agence-Europe</i> in 1983, 14 June, states, and I quote:</P>
    <P>The European Peoples' Party has called on the heads of Government who are going to meet in Stuttgart reminding them of the European Parliament resolution on the Genscher/Colombo draft and on (a) the need to go back to the majority decisions as laid down in the Treaties; (b) an extension of the Parliament's powers and (c) security co-operation within the framework of the Atlantic Alliance.</P>
    <P>It is quite clear that the policy of that group to which Fine Gael belongs in Europe is committed to closer EEC security co-operation within the framework of NATO.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Defence, Deputy Cooney, last week made a speech here bearing not only on our neutrality but on our national independence and security.  So far the Taoiseach has made no comment on the Minister's speech so that one can only presume he goes along at this stage with its content.  Let me remind the House of what the Minister said.  First of all, he said that his conviction was that our neutrality was a matter of expediency and not of principle.  He went on to state:</P>
      <P>Our territory is not desired or required as a base by the Western Alliance and we are in the happy position of being ideologically and geographically allied to the Western Bloc and we can confidently rely on it to protect our territory if any State or combination of States hostile to the western world threaten it.</P>
      <P>That in my view is a startling change.  If neutrality is merely a matter of expediency that clearly implies we will go to no great lengths to maintain or defend it. It cannot be reconciled, for instance, with our stance in the Second World War.  On behalf of Fianna Fáil I wish to state clearly and unequivocally that for us the maintenance of Ireland's military neutrality is a matter of both principle and expediency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Does the Minister's statement mean that if the Western Alliance wanted our ports or airports they could have them? Does it in fact constitute an open invitation to the NATO alliance at any time of crisis to demand the use of our ports and airports?  Is there an implication that if NATO were to seek discreetly and quietly the use of certain facilities, for example in the telecommunications field, the Minister would not refuse them?  The <Col N="2710" /> Minister's statement seems to be dangerously close in line of reasoning to the statement made by the British Defence Secretary recently that we enjoy the protection of the NATO umbrella.  May I remind the House of what Mr. Heseltine said?</P>
    <P>In the event of any real threat there is no way they could opt out.  Those countries which do not play a part in NATO should ask themselves why they should take advantage of the umbrella we provide.</P>
    <P>The Government at the time, with some prodding from us in Fianna Fáil, protested at Mr. Heseltine's views as being unwise and unhelpful.  What is Mr. Heseltine to think now?  Before I pass from that subject I would like to refer briefly to Senator O'Mahony's contribution on behalf of the Labour Party to discussions on European security.  Senator O'Mahony disputes that the Estimate speech of the Minister for Defence represents Government policy.  It is difficult to think of a more formal statement of Government policy than an Estimate speech.  If the Labour Party are unhappy with that Estimate speech they have two simple choices: to demand the resignation or repudiation of the Minister for Defence or to resign themselves.</P>
    <P>I come now to Anglo-Irish relations and the Taoiseach's brief meeting with the British Prime Minister.  Following the meeting the Taoiseach claimed that there will probably be a summit in the late autumn, even though there is nothing in the brief joint statement to this effect and no official confirmation from British sources &mdash; the reverse in fact.  The House will recall that some ten days ago in an interview in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> of 12 June 1983 the Taoiseach said that he did not plan to seek a full-scale, formal meeting with the British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, until after the New Ireland Forum had issued its report. Many of us felt that he was creating for himself an alibi at that stage, an alibi he did not really need.  He told the <i>Sunday Tribune,</i> and I quote: &ldquo;This almost certainly means that the meeting would be postponed until 1984&rdquo;.  On the very same <Col N="2711" /> day, however, on RTE radio, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, contradicted the Taoiseach and said that he hoped &ldquo;that Dr. FitzGerald and Mrs Thatcher would meet as soon as possible. A summit would not have to await the completion of the New Ireland Forum report at the end of the year&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The benefits we have reaped over the ten years of our membership of the EEC have been enormous.  Recent economic and social trends as indicated, however, must give cause for anxiety.  From our point of view the situation is, unfortunately, disimproving.  Our financial contributions are going up while our receipts are going down, certainly in real terms. New industries have been established here because of our membership of the Community, but recently Community policies have directly caused heavy job losses in many sectors.  The present position in certain sectors of Irish agriculture and horticulture and in regard to the importation of fruit, vegetables and potatoes in disastrous.  The Regional Fund, which was intended to bring an equal level of development to all the different regions of the Community, has been a total failure.  However, it is on the employment front above all others that <Col N="2712" /> the Community has failed.  Here we have the richest and most economically powerful group of nations in the world with a vast accumulation of skills and knowledge, with experience of sophisticated public administration, unable to provide employment for millions of their adult citizens.  The communique itself speaks of four-and-a-half million young people unemployed and nothing being done with regard to that enormously tragic situation except some paper references, and the Taoiseach has the audacity to come into this House and speak about a satisfactory outcome of a European Council.</P>
    <P>I believe that the means and resources to tackle unemployment are there in our community.  What is lacking is the political will among the leadership of the EEC to tackle and eliminate this social evil of unemployment.  Another European Summit has come and gone.  Its time was spent bargaining about an issue which should properly have been dealt with and settled by a committee of second secretaries from the Departments of Finance of the member states concerned.  The EEC is still a great political concept.  It still has the incalculable capacity to achieve economic and social progress.  Its leaders today, however, are not measuring up to their responsibilities.  They are failing the people of Europe and in so far as this latest council has not achieved anything of significance economically, socially or politically, it must be regarded as a colourful, pompous non-event.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The extraordinarily long, boring, pedestrian and dreary statement from the Taoiseach certainly did not give us the concept that Deputy Haughey has just spoken of &mdash; a Community which has potential for the future. He did not give us any concept of any relevance whatsoever either to this House or to the public abroad.  It is difficult for the Deputies who were listening here &mdash; I doubt if there were very many of them &mdash; to recall anything in the statement which the Taoiseach made.  At least Deputy Haughey spoke of the policies which he and his party advocate in Europe.  In the whole of the Taoiseach's speech there is no statement that I can <Col N="2713" /> see of Government policy on any issue. It is simply a dreary record of what did or did not take place.  The question of relevance is vital.  We are talking about the relevance of this House to the public, and the relevance of the EEC to this House and to the public is also of vital concern.  There is no doubt whatever that the CAP is of great relevance to the farming community.  That was the main reason we joined the EEC &mdash; it is of vital concern that it be kept and so on.  This probably is what the Taoiseach is so happy about, that the CAP concept has been preserved.</P>
      <P>To anyone else what relevance has the EEC?  What does it mean to the public? Did this statement bring out anything to show that it has any relevance or any meaning?  I do not think so, and it is failing miserably in that regard.  The solemn declaration that was signed was apparently of tremendous importance to the Taoiseach in any case.  It makes him quite happy that he and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, were able to sign the solemn declaration, but what will the solemn declaration bring to us? What does the solemn declaration mean? What will the solemn declaration do for the unemployed?  That issue was not touched on at all except for a reference to the fact that 40 per cent of some figure which I would like the Taoiseach to let the House know will be available to the six priority regions, of which Ireland is just one.  What will that mean?  We want to know how much we are to get, if we are to get anything, to assist in finding some solution to the unemployment question.  There is no indication that there is any plan, apart from giving a figure of 40 per cent, for its use or the ending of unemployment in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major issue of the effect on the Community of the new members and our trade in the enlarged Community was not discussed or, if it was, the Taoiseach has not reported back to us.  The Taoiseach has not told us how our trading with the enlarged Community will be affected.  It is difficult to understand what the Summit <Col N="2714" /> was about.  There was no reference to the European Parliament although we will be having an election to that body next year. Could it not have been decided at the Summit to scrap the whole lot and save a few million pounds or, alternatively, give the Parliament some powers and make some use of it?  One would have thought it would have been discussed.</P>
    <P>The major issue in Europe and at home is dismissed in a couple of lines; the issue of war and peace, of nuclear disarmament and the siting of missiles in Europe. Our Government's stand on that has not been explained to the House.  What was the attitude of the Taoiseach when speaking on our behalf in regard to this issue? Do we have a policy at all?  If we have a policy will the Taoiseach indicate what it is?  In that context the issue of neutrality is relevant.  Deputy Haughey spelled out clearly the Fianna Fáil policy, but I notice he restricted it to military neutrality, and I regret that.  Nevertheless, he made a commitment to stand by that military neutrality.  It is important that the House is given an indication if the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have a similar commitment to neutrality.  We should be told how they see our neutral role or if they see a neutral role for us at all.  It is vitally important that we are told that.</P>
    <P>I would expect a report by the Taoiseach from such a Summit would contain such statements.  The Summit lasted three days and I assume most of the issues I mentioned were dealt with.  I presume the Taoiseach outlined the Government's policy on those issues, but he has not informed the House of the Government's position.  That is a grave lack in the statement. It is merely a verbose minute of a meeting that took place and does not give any indication of the Government's policy in Europe or at home.  The greatest lack in the statement is that there is no hint of any policy or possible solution to the problem of unemployment or anything that would make the EEC relevant to our population other than to the farming community.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No.2:</P>
    <P>In page 3, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(4)  The making of a charge under the provisions of this section shall be a reserved function exercisable directly by the elected members of the local authority concerned.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Deputy Molloy).</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have argued our case substantially already on the first amendment and the Chair allowed an extensive wide-ranging discussion on it.  Our second amendment deals specifically with our suggestion that the making of the charges be a reserved function of elected members.  The House, taking into consideration all the views expressed, has clearly indicated its agreement that the making of the charges should be a reserved function of members of local authorities.  To substantiate that I will highlight speeches made by Fine Gael Members.  Labour Party backbenchers were silent on this matter and did not contribute to the debate.  They seem to ignore this important legislation.  Deputy A. Doyle, as reported in Volume 343 at column 303 of the Official Report, said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object strongly to the general principle of the Bill which makes the raising of these local charges an executive function of managers and not a reserved function of elected members. The whole principle of local government appears to be at stake.  The Bill appears to be largely a matter of convenience to ensure the collection of these charges.  It does not accord with <Col N="2716" /> any general principle.  It reserves to the manager exclusively the right to impose such charges as well as the amount to be paid in any one year.</P>
    <P>At column 317 of the Official Report of 1 June Deputy R. Bruton said:</P>
    <P>In the setting of the structure of charges local representatives have an expertise that is second to none in deciding on what is the most appropriate structure.  It is not acceptable that that decision be handed over to the manager once the councillors have decided an overall level.</P>
    <P>The same Deputy at column 383 said:</P>
    <P>I also regretted the fact that democratic local control is being frustrated by making the charges an executive function.</P>
    <P>Deputy Owen, at column 405 said:</P>
    <P>I agree with what Deputy Seán Walsh and other speakers have said, that making these charges an executive function of managers is regrettable from the point of view of local councillors.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny, at column 427 said:</P>
    <P>I have some doubts about the county managers having absolute rights in relation to the amount of charges to be introduced.  This will be seen in some cases as an erosion of powers of local authority members.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly, at column 433, said:</P>
    <P>I would be very reluctant to see county managers having this absolute power in the years to come.  I am totally against such legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating, who made a more qualified type of contribution &mdash; it was very difficult to know where he stood &mdash; at column 440 said:</P>
    <P>I look forward to the day when elected representatives will be able to assume more control and responsibility, perhaps eventually extending into this area.  But this is not the day on which that should happen because the <Col N="2717" /> councillors are not equipped at present to assume such responsibilities.</P>
    <P>On that basis alone Deputy Keating's contribution should be dismissed.  The House can see, however, that Deputy Keating agreed that the responsibility should be given to elected councillors although he felt they had not matured enough at present, a strange allegation for him to make and one which he denied and contradicted in other parts of his contribution.  Those quotations sum up the Fine Gael point of view but we did not hear anything from the Labour Party backbenchers.  The Minister and the Minister of State said that if it was the wish of Members that this power be a reserved function of elected members of county councils in the future they might agree to it.  Why are they ignoring the expressed wishes of Members who have made a contribution to the debate?  My other reasons for moving the amendment have been outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>After a period of time I would like to see the structural charges being a reserved function of county councillors but one must recognise that there is a difficulty in the year of introduction in having a set of charges put through in a short period.  The control councillors have in the first year is, appropriately, over the overall revenue to be raised by them.  What does a reserved function in relation to deciding the structure of rates mean?  I do not believe it means that half-way through the year councillors can decide they do not accept certain elements of the structural charges and that those are knocked out without compensating finance being found somewhere else.  The reservation of authority by county councillors to decide the structure of the water rate or whatever rate it may be will only come into effect at the time the general estimates are being struck.  I am coming round to the view that, maybe, with the present legislation, provided councillors use the system sensibly, when it comes up to estimates time, they will bear in mind that when they strike the overall level for the particular charge <Col N="2718" /> in question, they are effectively accepting the structure of charges the manager is proposing.  It is open to them to point out to the manager that they will not accept the overall target he is proposing to them unless it is amended in the direction they require.  Perhaps the Minister will be able to confirm that with these powers the councillors will almost have an effective reserved function in this area.  If the Minister can confirm that to us I feel Deputy Molloy's amendment is no longer necessary.</P>
      <P>There is another area where I am anxious about the charges, that is protection for the consumer.  Not only is there a requirement of local autonomy but I believe, quite apart from the democratic control, there is a need for protection of the consumer who will have to pay the charges at the end of the day.  I strongly urge the Minister to give consideration &mdash; perhaps not by amending the legislation but in the way in which it is put into practice in the county councils &mdash; to having a system where there is a management unit set up for any area where the charge is being levied.  If there is to be a charge there will be a specific area of responsibility, there will be an annual debate on issues such as the quality of the service being provided, the increased costs in that service and the improvements the council hope to make with part of the money being raised through the charges. We cannot expect that all of the money will go to improvements.  The local authorities cannot do that at the moment because of their difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The consumer needs a guarantee that increases in charges will be considered always in the context of the quality of service being provided, the cost of the service being provided and so on.  If consumers do not have that they can rightly point to the local authorities and tell them that what they have brought in is not a charge for services but a flat levy regardless of the quality of the service or the cost of the service being provided.  That would be flying in the face of all we have argued about when people on both sides of the House advocated the introduction of local charges.  I am very concerned that managers might look on this as a <Col N="2719" /> revenue-raising function solely and not look at the consumer interest at the same time.</P>
    <P>Another virtue of a system where there is an annual debate and a discussion of the specific service involved is that we could move towards what economists regard as the function of a charge, to get maximum efficiency from the service concerned. I am worried that a lot of councils will look on the right to levy charges as a system of putting a flat rate per house for this, that or the other.  That would be contrary to what we want to achieve on the economic side in imposing charges. Any economic justification for a charge is that it will eliminate waste and lead to more efficient use of the resource.  For example, in relation to refuse, such a charge would obviously be related to the amount of refuse that a person requires the council to dispose of and not to the fact that he has one premises.  If he is able to save on refuse he should be encouraged to do so.  I hope, when these charges are being implemented, that the Minister will issue guidelines to local authorities to see that an economically sensible system of charges is brought in and not simply a revenue-raising system.  During Second Stage I cited some examples of what I have in mind there, such as off-peak pricing and so on where the councils will have scope to greatly improve their management through the implementation of these charges and not just simply raise revenue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise a few points.  Is it the Minister's intention to make these charges mandatory?  I must be given a direct answer to that question because the imposition of charges for particular services opens up the entire question about anybody else providing a similar or better service.  I am speaking now of private enterprise entering the field. How does the Minister view participation of that kind?  We could take the question of refuse, certainly in Dublin city, as an example.  Many areas leave a lot to be desired as far as the quality of service provided is concerned.  There are huge areas of the city, which are flatland areas, <Col N="2720" /> which are in a deplorable condition primarily because we do not have a twice-weekly bin collection service.  If some private firm can offer a service of that kind is it the Minister's intention to say that the private firm cannot do that because the State is actually providing the service even though private enterprise can provide such a service at less cost and more efficiently?  If on one road half-a-dozen people want to avail of the private service and others on the road do not want to avail of the local authority service, what happens?</P>
      <P>This is a very important point in relation to the question of a mandatory charge.  I know there is provision in the waiver section but what if people cannot actually afford consistently to avail of the service?  At the moment, we are living in very stringent economic times where people's income can vary even during the year whereas the waiver scheme applies on an annual basis.  How can charges be justified in a case like that?</P>
      <P>I have always regarded the imposition of a water charge as deplorable.  I know it operates in some local authorities throughout the country.  It is akin to a fresh air tax when you start taxing for water.  How does the Minister propose to do this?  Does he propose to do it by a meter charge or does he propose to have a <i>carte blanche</i> levy of so much per household? If the Minister proposes to have a charge per household, what if the water pressure in that household is of very poor quality?  Has a resident or a householder any way under this legislation to claim a refund if the quality of the service does not measure up to a consistent level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we think of local charges we should be clear in our minds about where competition enters the field.  Once the private enterprise element is stifled, people will have financial hardship inflicted on them or they will take means which none of us would like to see happen such as the indiscriminate dumping of refuse.  I see the Minister nodding his head.  This time last year I put a lot of work into the Litter Act and to this day I am horrified at the non-implementation of that Act in Dublin city.  I realise the difficulties of the Minister but if charges <Col N="2721" /> are imposed for the collection of refuse which people cannot pay, unless they can opt out of such a service there will be indiscriminate dumping of refuse irrespective of the 1982 Act.  I have to say that it is not being enforced to its maximum effect.</P>
    <P>On the question of water charges, unless the water is metered, what is to stop a person from siphoning off a water supply from some other address and opting out of the charge?  I do not wish to put ideas into the Minister's mind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think everybody should be concerned about their mental adroitness on a continuing basis.  We know that ESB meters are tampered with and that people siphon off electricity because they cannot afford to pay the charges or for other devious means. Unless there is some form of metering which would be more equitable for people who are economical in their use of resources we will impose hardship on people.  Irrespective of the lukewarm assurances we have been given by city councillors, I think the situation will be that the amount in question will be divided between a certain number of households.  That is outrageous.  The matter should be examined critically and I ask the Minister to consider it.</P>

      <P>In the course of the discussion on this amendment I have been accused by Deputy Molloy and by others of trying to put something over the Members of this House or of having some underhand motivation.  For the record I wish to clear this up and I reject it entirely.  The art of misrepresentation has been clearly demonstrated in the course of Deputy Molloy's contribution.  From the circular letter sent to local authorities in May he quoted a sentence to the effect that the charges function would fall to be performed by the manager.  Unfortunately he saw no point in quoting the following sentence for the benefit of the House.  That read:</P>
      <P>In practice, however, the amount of revenue to be raised by charges will be determined by the estimate adopted by the elected members and it will then fall to the manager to levy charges accordingly.  It is expected that managers will consult appropriately with their councils in relation to charges which are being introduced.</P>
      <P>The position put forward in that document in no way conflicts with the position I set out to this House when introducing the measure.  The basic decision is the estimates decision and it is entirely a matter for the council.  The manager is bound by their decision and has discretion only within the limits of the decision made.  There is nothing new in this and it should not cause confusion.</P>
      <P>I reject out of hand the notion that I am hell-bent on taking powers from the councils.  I yield to none in my commitment to the local government system and my confidence in it.  I have explained how I will examine the workings of the system, both from the organisational and financial point of view, and will try to make progress where no progress has been made for many years of Fianna Fáil government in reforming the system.  In the meantime, I am simply grafting on to what is already there as regards the division of responsibilities.  I have the clear impression that some members of the Opposition do not want to know about this but their attitude does not alter the facts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2723" /> I have been asked to explain why I am talking about reviewing the system if there is nothing wrong with it.  I have no doubt that the approach in the Bill is the appropriate one and that it will work in practice.  I realise that some others do not share this view but I am sufficiently democratic in my outlook to be willing to accept that if their concerns are borne out in practice then I will change the system as I have the power to do.  If the Opposition try to interpret this as meaning there are doubts in my mind, I do not accept that interpretation.  I want to make it clear that I intend in the course of the restructuring of local government to have a look at the whole question of the financing of local authorities.</P>
    <P>From my experience in a rural local authority, there has been no difficulty between the manager and members of the county council so far as relationships are concerned.  By working together the councillors accepted their responsibility that certain charges must and have been levied.  The amount of charges has been <Col N="2724" /> reasonable and I see no reason to fear that any future charges within the ambit of this Bill should move from the reasonable state we have had up to now.</P>
    <P>I must reject out of hand the suggestions by Deputy Brady about the service being provided by private enterprise or otherwise.  He said that more than one service per week is needed in flatland in Dublin.  Ideally we should have as many services per week as are necessary to cope with multi-use dwellings.  If the money were available the corporation would have no difficulty in providing a more frequent service.  Certain points raised by Deputy Brady are more relevant to section 3 and can be more appropriately covered by that section.</P>

    <P>Amendment declared lost.</P>
    <P>Section 2 agreed to.</P>
    <P Just="Center">NEW SECTION.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, before section 3, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>3.&mdash;(1)  A charge made by a local authority by virtue of section 2 of this Act shall be of such amount as the authority considers appropriate and shall be payable by and recoverable from the person for whom the service is provided, or, where the service is provided in respect of premises&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2727" /> (a)  in case the premises are not owned by a local authority and comprise more than one dwelling, the owner of the premises, and</P>
    <P>(b)  in any other case, the occupier of the premises,</P>
    <P>and different such charges may be made by such an authority in respect of persons, premises or services of different classes or descriptions.</P>
    <P>(2)  in this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;dwelling&rdquo; includes a part of any premises let as a separate dwelling, whether or not the person to whom it is let shares with any other person any accommodation, amenity or facility in connection therewith or any other portion of the premises;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;owner&rdquo; means, in relation to a premises, a person, other than a mortgagee not in possession, who, whether in his own right or as trustee or agent for any other person, is entitled to receive the rack rent of the premises or, where the premises are not let at a rack rent, would be so entitled if they were so let.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove doubts raised about liability to pay charges in the case of certain premises which are occupied as more than one dwelling.  Problems arise as to who would be liable to pay a charge in respect of private premises which are let as a number of separate flats or apartments, and also in relation to establishing the identity of individual occupiers of such rented dwellings.  It has been decided that, in the case of services provided to such premises, charges will be payable by and recoverable from the owner of the premises. This means the owners will be liable for charges for services provided to houses converted into separately let flats or bedsitting rooms and to purpose-built apartment blocks.  This approach in relation to privately owned multi-dwelling premises is in line with the established and tested arrangement which operated in relation to rates on these premises. The amendment otherwise involves the <Col N="2728" /> restatement of what was in the original section 3.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Where a dwellinghouse has been converted into four flats and there are four separate tenants in these flats in the one dwellinghouse, the Minister has stated that the owner of the dwellinghouse shall be liable for the charges which are to be introduced by the local authority.  Can the Minister clarify whether it will be the intention of the local authority to apply the charges individually to each of the four flats, or to make one charge in respect of the dwelling? I am sure the Minister will accept that even though he states the owner shall be liable to pay the charge, in practice the landlord will pass on this charge to the tenant.  We already have in Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick and many other places many tenants living in fear of substantial increases in their rents because of the changes which have taken place in legislation recently following the court decision and the delay in the introduction of the Rents Tribunal.  The courts are awarding large rent increases and in many cases elderly people find that their rent has been substantially increased.  It is likely that these people will also now be faced with a separate charge from the local authorities.  If there is a house with four different flats and four different tenants, will the local authority make four separate charges?  The Minister says that the charges will be made to the owner. Will it be one charge for the dwelling or four charges to the owner for the dwelling? Even though the Minister says the owner will be liable, it is clear that he will pass on this charge to his tenants which will cause further problems.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of that.  The imposition in the example given by the Deputy is a matter for the local authority to impose a charge on the dwelling.  In the case of premises which have been relet as a number of flats, the owner will have to pay one charge either at the standard rate or a multiple of the standard charge related to the number of lettings. In the majority of cases, it is reasonable that the charge should be passed on, in whole or in part, to the tenants who benefit from the service but this will depend on the circumstances and will obviously be a matter of settlement between the parties involved.  The local authorities will have the discretion to take account of any hardship which might be involved and to bring the waiver provisions to the notice of the owners so that eligible tenants may benefit from them in the arrangements that would be worked out.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming more and more confusing.  The Minister tells us that <Col N="2730" /> it is a matter for the members of the local authorities.  Would the Minister clarify that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister speaks about the local authority would he explain what he is talking about in law?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Molloy knows what I am talking about when we speak about the local authority.  In this case it is the manager and the elected members as in the preparation of estimates heretofore. Nothing has been changed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>I know there will be a difference for one local authority.  If, on a majority vote, the council members say to the manager there will be no charges in a certain area, does the manager appeal to the Minister for permission to over-ride the decision of a local authority? The Minister should be honest about this.  It is very confusing because everything hinges on section 1.  Is it the local authority who decides?  We are now told it is for the local authority to decide and I presume we are talking about the county manager and the members of the council.  If elected members of a local authority say to a councillor or city manager that they disagree with any further charges being imposed and there is a shortfall, what happens then?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite simple.  If the elected members decide, in the preparation of the estimates, that they do not want to make provision for certain charges then, obviously, there will have to be a corresponding cutback in the provision of services.  That is logical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>The services will be cut but, at the same time, it is the elected members who run a city or county area.  The <i>status quo</i> is being maintained so what is the point in having this Bill before the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>In the past, there was no power vested in urban authorities to raise charges for water services.  That is the purpose of this Bill as has been pointed out on a number of occasions.  The position <Col N="2731" /> which exists at present in the county council areas is the system which will operate in future in urban areas.  That system has worked well in the past and I do not see any reason why that should change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PearseWyse" hpid="Mr. Wyse Mr. Wyse">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>
      <P>In other words, the Minister is saying to the local authorities that if they wish, they can charge for water supplies. That is it in a nutshell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not wish to delay the House.  It is convenient, from the Minister's point of view, to create confusion and confusion arises because he keeps referring to the local authorities but the local authority can mean different things in law.  The definition section of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, states that a local authority means the corporation of a county borough, the council of a county or an elective body.  It gives a separate definition for a manager.  The provisions of this Bill state that if a dispute arises between a local authority and the manager certain things shall happen.  When the Minister is talking about local authorities most people think he is referring to the elected members of a local authority. In fact, it seems he is not, that he is referring to the general corpus of the county council or corporation and the various functions and division of functions within those bodies and that he is speaking globally.  When the Minister was referring to a local authority he was talking about a body which includes the elected members and the management together.  It would be very helpful if when he is referring to the local authority he would say: &ldquo;I am referring to the manager exercising his executive functions&rdquo; and if he is referring to the elected members he would state &ldquo;the elected members&rdquo;. That is what is causing much of the confusion; and possibly in the definition section we should have repeated what was meant in this Bill by the &ldquo;local authority&rdquo;.  In this Bill the &ldquo;local authority&rdquo; does not mean solely the elected members.  It can mean the manager exercising his executive functions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2732" />
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the explanation I gave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the definition given in the 1955 Act is that the local authority is the elected members.  There is a separate definition given for the manager. We do not wish to delay on this except to emphasise the point that it has suited the Minister's cause to create as much confusion as possible so that this can be brought into law without the members of county councils realising what has been imposed on them until it is too late. We thought this debate would have enabled Members of Fine Gael who expressed views similar to ours to comprehend how serious the provisions of this Bill will be in relation to their own members.  However, it seems they are going along with the Minister in his attempt to quosh the elected member and the role he has to play.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has consistently talked about the council's role in adopting the estimate.  He did not respond when I challenged him on the fact that the discretion available to an elected member at the time when he is being asked to adopt an estimate is very largely dependent on the amount of the grant which was made available to the local authority by the Minister.  The amount of the grant is the key to the whole operation of the local authority service.  In a later section of this Bill the obligation on the Minister to provide a grant of a certain size each year is being eliminated and in future it will be an arbitrary figure chosen by the Minister and we argue that he can reduce that very substantially.  When the councillor goes into his estimates meeting he may find there is a huge shortfall.  He is faced with the task of making up the shortfall by increasing charges or introducing further new charges.  Even at that stage he does not have the power to do that himself. It will now be the manager who will make up the shortfall and the councillors are being brought in to put the rubber stamp on it and adopt the estimate.  If they refuse to do that then the Minister will disband the local authority.  There are a number of local authorities at present <Col N="2733" /> who are travelling along that road. There is one in County Louth and one somewhere else.  Councillors today are totally frustrated.  It is very unfair of the Minister to make grand speeches about wanting to give an increased role to elected members when at the same time the Minister is destroying the whole system. The councillors will now be gripped between the decision of the Minister in making his direct grant and the decision of the manager in deciding what charges he will introduce.  The councillor is becoming fodder in the centre.</P>
    <P>We accept this amendment.  It is necessary to define &ldquo;premises&rdquo; in the way the Minister has done.  We have no objection to having this section replace the existing section 3 but we are very dissatisfied with the whole content and gist of the Bill as it stands.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have become more confused as time has gone on.  I would like to know whether the manager can bring in a charge in the course of the year without reference to the councillors' estimate? In other words, the councillors having decided that, say, charges were to the tune of £50,000 for the year, could the manager later on raise it to £100,000 without reference to the councillors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <P>Revenue raising?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Revenue raising likewise. While I appreciate the co-operation of the Opposition in accepting the amendment, I have to refute some of the points made by Deputy Molloy.  I think Deputy Molloy's points would have some validity if the state of financing of local authorities was not in the catastrophic position in which we find it.  I am trying to hold the local authorities together, to give them some authority to raise money to provide much needed services which have been shrinking since 1977.  Deputy Molloy in his last contribution stressed the urgency and necessity for us to deal as quickly as possible with the restructuring of local <Col N="2734" /> authorities.  Everything would be quite simple if there was no difficulty with central funds, but the Fianna Fáil Estimates for 1983 would have left the rate relief grant 11 per cent down on the provision for last year.  I do not know how they can say I am the one who is trying to undermine and take from the support that central Government is giving to local authorities when I gave an extra £37.5 million to try to help the ailing local authorities. Deputy Molloy is stressing the urgency of this by recognising the present financial difficulties.  I am not giving any new powers in county council areas.  The estimates will be struck as they have been in the past.  We are giving the urban areas power to charge where they did not have that power before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister and his Minister of State have continued to talk about Fianna Fáil leaving the local authorities short of a huge amount of money and they have argued that if they had not come into power and increased the allocation by £31 million local authorities would have been 11 per cent short.  It was the Coalition Government who introduced the 1983 budget, not the Fianna Fáil Government.  Let us go back to 1982 when a different situation existed.  The then Coalition introduced a budget which they failed to have passed in this House. In that budget they decided that they would leave the local authorities £12 million short.  They did not fulfil the obligation placed on them under section 9 of the 1978 Act, the Act which abolished rates on houses.  There was an election held in unique circumstances.  The then Government failed to get a majority in the House and Fianna Fáil said that because of the time of year and because of the circumstances prevailing they were fighting the election on the basis of the budget decisions made by the Government except for specified parts of that budget in regard to VAT increases on clothes and so on.  Those matters were well publicised.  They were the provisions that were defeated in the House.  We carried on with that part of the Coalition Government's decision to leave the local authorities short but the Minister has to <Col N="2735" /> accept that it is the parties in Government, Labour and Fine Gael, who made that decision.</P>
      <P>In the preparation of the Estimates for 1983 an unprecedented step was taken by the Fianna Fáil Party in Government to publish the Estimates in November because there was a commitment by both sides of this House that in future it would be proper and correct to make the figures available much earlier in order to bring forward the debate on budgetary matters and to have the budget early in the financial year.  Then unforeseen circumstances, with an election coming along, caused the delay which took place again.</P>
      <P>We have had an unprecedented number of elections in recent years and they coincided with the time of the year when budgetary considerations were being formalised. Now Fianna Fáil lost the election and we were not the party in power at budget time who made the final decisions in regard to the level of taxation and the final allocations to local authorities and State Departments generally.  All these decisions were made by the Minister and his colleagues in Government and it is unfair of the Minister to seek to create the impression now that had Fianna Fáil won the election there would have been changes in the revenue allocations available from the Exchequer in lieu of rates and other subsidies to the local authorities.  In the budget of 1983 actually published by the Minister's Government it states, at page 51, that in regard to these allocations of funds to local authorities the remaining shortfall is to be considered in the context of the budget.  Now we lost that election and we were not in power to make the final decisions.  The Minister and his colleagues were in power and they left local authorities short £20 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the second time the Minister's party has introduced a budget which has left local authorities short, the second time they have failed to fulfil the obligation under the 1978 Act.  It is a bit of smart aleckry now to try to create the impression that had Fianna Fáil won the election the shortfall would have been <Col N="2736" /> much greater.  The Minister does not know and I do not know what the final decision of the Fianna Fáil Party in Government would have been.  The Minister knows and I know when these decisions are made.  In the document published in November it stated these decisions would be made so the matter was not finalised.  We will leave it at that. It does not serve any purpose to harp on it.  The Minister and his party were in power and they made the decision to leave the local authorities short of money.  They did exactly the same thing in 1982.  Do not try now to put it across here that it is some sort of Fianna Fáil failure.  We accept the amendment.</P>
    <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
    <P>Section 3 deleted.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 4.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 4 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understand it under this section the Minister can stop local authorities charging for a service.  I would like him to explain why he feels he needs this power and under what circumstances the power would be exercised.  It seems a further stranglehold on the local authority by the central authority.  If an order is made under this section will the Minister tell us whether each member of a local authority will be informed of the making of such an order so that there will be public awareness of the fact that the Minister is doing this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will just clarify that.  This section gives the Minister power to exclude any particular service from the scope of the Bill.  The exercise of the power would result in a specified service not being amenable to charges or increased charges.  I would stress that the power of the Minister will only relate to charging under the Bill and he will not have power to exclude the service for which local authorities have a separate power to charge under any other enactments. It is not envisaged that the power <Col N="2737" /> would be widely used but would provide a safety valve in the event of local authorities exercising a power in an undesirable way in relation to any particular service. For example, under section 26 of the Landlord and Tenant Ground Rent (No. 2) Act, 1978, a tenant or other person to whom a dwelling has been leased by a housing authority is entitled to acquire the fee simple and the fee simple is affected by a transfer order and the fees to be taken by a housing authority under subsection (8) is £5.  It is not considered desirable that this charge should be increased and this could be secured by my making an order under section 4 excluding it from the scope of the Bill. This would obviously be used rarely but it is a valuable safety valve.  It would be done by public order so it would be by public notice.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 3, after line 45, to insert the following subsections:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  Every local authority and sanitary authority to which this Act applies shall within three months of the passing of this Act adopt a scheme setting out the conditions under which all or portion of a charge shall be waived under this section and section 8 and all applications made to the local authority or sanitary authority for such a waiver which comply with the terms of such a scheme shall be waived accordingly.</P>
      <P>(4)  The adoption of a scheme under subsection (3) of this section shall be a reserved function exercisable directly by the elected members of the local authority or sanitary authority concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Very briefly what we want done under this amendment is to ensure that the waiver scheme to deal with hardship cases will be introduced within a specific <Col N="2738" /> period after the coming into operation of the Bill.  We suggest three months.  At present the manager has discretion to introduce his own scheme to deal with hardship cases.  As far as I can see the Minister is merely exhorting county managers to introduce schemes to relieve hardship.  He has not given any guidelines as to how the schemes should be drawn up and what cases should be considered hardship cases.  Neither has he said anything about uniformity throughout the country.  Here again we believe it is very important that the principle that elected representatives be involved in adopting the terms of this scheme should be adhered to.  The second part of my amendment would serve that purpose. We have been arguing all day about the value of the reserve function and we would appeal to the Minister to allow elected members to have a say in the adoption of any waiver scheme operating in their respective areas.  The administration of this scheme would of course be an executive function.  If the House is sincere &mdash; it is very doubtful after today &mdash; this is the type of function which should rightly be given to elected members because they will be aware of local problems and of the inhabitants in their areas. They will have greater local knowledge and it is vital they should have some input.  It would be most unreasonable of the Minister to refuse to accept this amendment.  I hope his attitude is not one of &ldquo;It is my Bill and I will ram it through no matter what opposition there is or what praiseworthy suggestions are made for the improvement of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In fairness, one of his predecessors, Deputy Tully, never adopted that attitude while bringing forward legislation here and he gained quite a reputation as a fair-minded Minister in the sense that he was always prepared to listen to the arguments here in the House and recognise that it was essential to do so in order to show that the debate here can contribute to improving legislation and that the experience and knowledge of elected Members in the Opposition gathered over the years should be available to the Government in drawing up and improving legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2739" /> In regard to the operation of local authorities with this new facility or power to levy charges which is given to the managers, if you are not giving that function to the elected members it is imperative that the waiver or hardship scheme should be adopted by the members.  The Minister should lay down guidelines to the local authorities that the manager would put together the bones of a scheme and bring it before the members for adoption and that the members would have time to examine the manager's proposals and make their own changes.  Many years ago I was a member of Galway Corporation when the letting scheme for local authority houses was brought before the council.  I felt that in the circumstances in Galway Corporation at that time it was very important that the letting scheme should contain a clause which would allow the housing officer, the person making final decisions as to who was to be allocated the vacant houses that arose from time to time, to take into account the length of time a person was on the housing waiting list as a factor.  That had not been the case up to then.  That change which I proposed to Galway Corporation by way of motion was adopted then and has been operating successfully over the past 12 or 13 years and quite a large number of families have benefited from it through the letting scheme of the local authority for housing.</P>
    <P>If the Minister resists this type of amendment he is flying in the face of elected councillors and ignoring the role they play and the knowledge they have and he is downgrading them completely. Whatever defence he tried to make this afternoon in regard to not giving them power to levy the charges, he cannot possibly argue that he is not prepared to have sufficient confidence in them to allow them to adopt the waiver scheme. I will be very surprised if he adopts that attitude.  I appeal to him to accept this amendment.  No charge whatever is involved in it.</P>

      <P>A very important principle is involved in this amendment.  It will avoid the situation where Councillor <Col N="2740" /> A can say that he is better than Councillor B in his representations to a manager.  It should not be left to the sole discretion of the manager, who in many cases will have numbers of councillors whispering in his ear that Mrs. So-and-So should have a house because she is worse off than Mr. B or whoever else might have got it.  If a scheme is decided on by the local councillors within the guidelines laid down by the Minister it will be quite clear to everybody who is entitled to the waiver.  It is important that the scheme would not only be in operation but would be seen to operate fairly for everybody.</P>

      <P>I see some difficulty in getting a consistent position on this.  As Deputy Molloy points out, there is a need for uniformity throughout the country in the way this scheme operates and also we need some sort of local responsiveness to individual cases of hardship.  I agree with Deputy Molloy's suggestion that the Minister set out guidelines so that at least a certain minimum social welfare category, perhaps people with mortgages of very recent standing or other needy groups, would be treated as exempt from a charge and at the same time there would be some scope for local responsiveness to individual cases of hardship.  I do not altogether agree with the Deputies opposite that it should be hard and fast with no chance of making representations.

Who will have the greatest knowledge in relation to these guidelines other than the members of the local authorities?  The Minister has repeated on a number of occasions <Col N="2741" /> that he is not interfering in any way with the powers of members of local authorities. In his efforts to justify that he should accept this amendment.  The members of the local authority are the best people to know the merits of the application of a waiver of rates.  I ask the Minister to accept this amendment.  There is no point in continuing to argue about it, but I appeal to the Minister's good sense.</P>

      <P>For the reasons I mentioned in opposing amendment No. 1 I am also opposing this amendment.  I appreciate the points made by the Opposition Deputies in relation to the wisdom of councillors and the understanding of local problems, but I am not departing from the present situation.  I carried out a thorough examination, in the course of the preparation of this legislation, of how the system is working at present.  The number of problems was almost nil, if anything.  The elected members have ample opportunity to influence how the managers go about exercising their functions. The amount which the elected members see fit to include in the annual estimate governs the type of policy which the manager will have to pursue.  Moreover, under section 2 of the City and County Management (Amendment) Act, 1955, the elected members can require the manager to inform them in advance of how he proposes to go about the exercise of these functions.  It is desirable that people know in advance whether and to what extent they qualify for waivers.  I am sure there is no disagreement on the purpose of this section and it is very necessary. It is my intention to advise the local authorities and to set down the guidelines so that we can clear up any possibility of uncertainty, and that will be done as a matter of course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2742" /> The one danger to which we must alert ourselves in relation to any sort of set guidelines &mdash; Deputy Bruton referred to this &mdash; is that where there are specific guidelines there will be people who are not within that range of guidelines.  I am referring to the area which we consider to be the poverty trap in the present situation.  This is the case where managerial discretion has been working to effect and my contacts and communications indicate that local members have found the present system satisfactory, as it works and as it is my intention it will continue to operate.</P>
    <P>The section is designed to assist hardship cases and elminate any difficulties. We have to recognise that certain categories of people will not be in a position to pay.  There is no reason to change the situation that exists under existing legislation. If the fears expressed from the Opposition benches prove to be well founded in the course of reviewing the legislation after a reasonable period of operation, then obviously the powers I have under County Management Acts could be availed of.</P>

      <P>Did I understand the Minister to say that local councillors could decide how much to put into the annual estimate and that managers would have to work within that figure?  I am beginning to wonder if the Minister has any concept of how local authorities operate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as local councillors are concerned they operate within the amount of money handed down to them by the Department.  The Minister has told us repeatedly that the Bill gives power to local councillors and that would be true if the Department continued to fund at the same level all existing services.  Local councillors if they decided to do some extra amenity work &mdash; open a park, develop houses or build a road &mdash; could avail of this method to raise <Col N="2743" /> funds.  The whole purpose of the Bill is to cut back what the Minister gives to local authorities and they will have to raise the money they need.  There is no question of giving local authorities more powers.  This is another form of taxation. Local authorities will have to raise some of the revenue for the Department of the Environment but the Department will give out less to local authorities.</P>
      <P>I have listened to most of the debate and I heard that point mentioned by many Opposition Members who have experience of local authorities.  They are aware that the Bill, far from giving any extra powers to local councillors, will mean that they will raise extra money for the Department.  I do not support the Fianna Fáil amendment to this hardship section because I doubt if the Minister recognises the enormity of the hardship that exists.  We are not talking about a few people who will not be able to pay but a huge number for whom any charge will mean an enormous imposition.</P>

      <P>The Minister's response is very disappointing but because of the time limit on the debate I will not press the matter further.  There are other important sections to be dealt with, particularly section 9.  The Minister's reaction displays a complete lack of understanding on his part of the role of elected local members.  The Minister does not seem to understand the real implications of the Bill and the disastrous effect it will have on the way local authorities have traditionally operated up to now.</P>

      <P>Where a charge is not paid by an individual does the Minister expect local authorities to cut off the service?  If a person living on a road decides he does <Col N="2744" /> not want the water supply for which he is to be charged £50, turns off the stopcock and does not take the services, what will happen?  In the case of refuse collection what will a county manager do if a number of people arrange with a private contractor to have their refuse removed for a charge and inform local authorities that they do not want the service?  Is there anything mandatory about the charges? If the service is not being availed of can an individual opt out?</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the limitations on time and I would point out to the House that water charges are covered in section 8.  With regard to Deputy Molloy's query as to what will happen if people decide not to avail of the bin collection service or refuse to pay for it, I should like to point out that a charge will be payable if a relevant service is provided in respect of a premises whether or not the service is availed of.  If the liability was made conditional on the service being availed of, then obviously the system would be totally unworkable. Members will be aware that there is constant pressure for an extension of bin collection services and it is a reasonable assumption &mdash; a necessary one for the Bill &mdash; that people will want to avail of the refuse collection service and will be willing to make a reasonable payment for it if their local authority decide to introduce a charge.  The vast majority of people will see the reasonableness of this and observe the law.  I do not think there is any possibility of a private collector operating in a number of areas when a local authority is in a position to provide what I consider to be a reasonable and efficient service at a moderate cost where the local authority decides to implement such charges.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Members on this side were not clear about that until now.  It is important that it is made clear that the Minister is making it mandatory on householders to pay this charge whether they are accepting or benefiting from the service. That will cause a lot of difficulty and confusion.  In the end who will carry the can about the difficulties?  The elected representatives will be called to houses to explain how any Minister, or local authority, could impose such a ridiculous scheme of charges for a service they are not availing of.  That was not the interpretation the Galway county manager put on this when he explained it to members of the local authority because I read the document he circulated.  He said that if a large number of householders opted out he would have to consider whether he should continue the service.  The Minister is not saying that but that if a person opts out he will still have to pay.  He has said that there is no opting out.  If that is what the Minister is at we will have to oppose the section.</P>

      <P>Local authorities provide a reasonable and efficient refuse collection service.  If 15 or 20 houses do not wish to avail of the service it ought to become apparent to the local authority that charging for such a service would be pointless.  The other option is that if people had the benefit of a trailer like the Deputy, want to go and dump their refuse it is possible that, at a time when we are trying to protect our environment, we are inviting people to go and dump their litter all over the streets or around the countryside.

      <P>Is it not the case that the Bill provides for either possibility, that the council, in drawing up a system of charges, could well go for a system whereby the owner of a premises who decides not to opt for the service does not pay.  It could well be under this Bill that the council would introduce a charge per bag collected rather than for premises from which it is collected.  As I understand it, the Bill does not necessarily make it the case that once the service is provided to the street every house on the street must pay.  The council can decide that issue.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this section. With the limitation on time it has become impractical.  We did not realise that the statements on the EEC Summit would take up so much of the time for the debate.  This has limited our opportunity to contribute to these sections more fully.  We disagree with the principle in this section that the local authority be empowered to reduce their debt to an individual by the amount of an unpaid charge or that a local authority relieve their commitment to pay a lawful debt by reducing the debt by the amount of an unpaid charge.  The householder may be in dispute about whether he owes the charge.  In those circumstances, the local authority should not have the power to withhold the payment of a lawful debt to a householder on the grounds that he had not paid them the charge for some service particularly, as it transpires now, that he might not be availing of the service.  This is ludicrous.  We have not time to go into it in any greater detail.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would like to have clarified whether this would apply to a local authority tenant or whether it would apply to a local authority employee.  If a person is employed by a local authority, lives in a house which is benefiting from some service that local authority is giving and he has not paid the charge for some reason other than hardship, is the Minister now saying that an amount can be deducted from his wages in lieu of the charge he has refused to pay?  Is the Minister suggesting that it is right to be able to set off the money due in this way?  We believe the principle is bad as it is giving power to the local authority in relation to something which is not being conferred on the individual.  There should be equality before the law for the local authority and the individual.  That would not be the case if this section is allowed to stand. The local authority would be in a preferential position which we do not think in those circumstances the local authority <Col N="2748" /> are entitled to.  We are opposing this section on that basis.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molloy has raised a very important issue here in relation to the question of employees of local authorities.  He has asked if deductions would be made from the wages of local authority employees if they are in dispute over some charge?  The Minister must answer that because there is a very serious implication here.  This is a very serious discriminatory issue in this Bill if this can happen.  The section, as it stands, would certainly allow for that because it states:</P>
      <P>...and, at the same time, another sum is due by that authority to that person....</P>
      <P>There will be sums due all the time to employees of local authorities.  The Minister should answer that issue because it is vitally important.</P>

In this particular situation, if the person owed a local authority money in respect of a charge and at the same time the person was due to be paid a grant or refund by the authority it certainly is not envisaged by me, taking into account the fears raised by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy Molloy, that wages would be within the provisions of this Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing this section. I regret that we do not seem to have <Col N="2750" /> sufficient time to debate this issue.  Section 9 was one of the principal sections contained in the 1978 Act which abolished rates.  It placed an obligation on the Minister to provide a sum of money to each local authority equal to the aggregate of the allowance made by the authority under section 3, 4 or 6 of the 1978 Act, in other words the amount which that local authority would have received in rates on dwellinghouses and on agricultural land.  That responsibility is now being removed.  This constitutes a fundamental change which will have a far-reaching effect.  There was an obligation on the Minister and the Exchequer to compensate local authorities for the loss of income from rates on houses.</P>
      <P>In this section that obligation is being removed.  The words that are being inserted provide that in future the Minister shall be obliged only to provide a grant which shall not exceed the amounts which would previously have been yielded from rates on dwellinghouses and on agricultural land.  Therefore, if the Minister had provided a substitute, placing some obligation on the Exchequer to continue to fund local authorities at a reasonable level, the other provisions in this Bill would not have been so draconian and brought about such a fundamental change.  But he is not placing any responsibility on the Exchequer to provide any fixed sum to the local authority in relation to any matter, such as the poundage to be struck on rates or an average, we will say, based on 1982 which would be reasonable and which I had suggested in the course of the Second Stage debate.  There was absolutely no response to that suggestion in the contributions of the Minister or Minister of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am coming slowly to the conclusion that the Minister himself does not seem to understand fully the far-reaching effects of this section and, therefore, of this Bill.  It was never intended by the Fianna Fáil Party to make this fundamental change.  It was a complete surprise to us when this Bill was published to find that this was happening.  We had to rethink our whole position in regard to these charges when we saw this section. <Col N="2751" /> As Deputy Mac Giolla said very rightly some time ago, we saw the introduction of these charges as a new source of additional revenue, to allow local authorities to do things they have been unable to do up to now.  It would provide new money, allow them to expand their services, introduce new services, allow them to operate successfully the Litter Act, the Water Pollution Act and other legislation introduced in recent years in respect of which no adequate sums of money were allocated to local authorities to enable them operate those provisions.  Many local authorities have been incurring deficits in recent years.  It was thought that these charges would enable them to catch up on some of those deficits.  Some deficits in local authorities arise from charges which we believe should not be imposed on them.  We argue that it is wrong to continue to ask local authorities, for example, to fund Office of Public Works drainage, maintenance, courthouses and a whole string of other services in which they have no role to play whatsoever. They were all listed by us on Second Stage.  We had one response from the Minister &mdash; that he would limit the charge for drainage maintenance to a fixed percentage in future years.  I did not catch the actual percentage; was it 5 per cent?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>5 per cent this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>We thank the Minister for that response.  It is small but significant. We would urge him along that road, to lift all of these unnecessary charges from local authorities, allow them the freedom to collect their own money, granting them a reasonable sum from the Exchequer annually so that they can successfully operate the services they are obliged and have power to provide under the terms of the Local Government Acts, rather than having them hidebound in dealing with malicious damages claims and a whole series of other charges improperly levied on them.  For example, in Galway County Council I saw that the charge for malicious damages had increased recently by 4,000-plus per cent, an extraordinary increase.  Although the figure <Col N="2752" /> may not have run into millions, at the same time it constituted an extraordinary increase which was running right across all of these other charges.</P>
      <P>This constitutes a fundamental change in the method of funding local authorities. The Minister will very much regret having taken this decision in bringing this Bill before the House.  Every elected representative throughout the country will very much regret what the Minister is doing here today.  They will not be fully aware of the effects in 1983 because his Estimates have more or less slipped through on the basis that the power is forthcoming; it is not there yet and the managers did not really expose their hands.  If this Bill is passed there will be no statutory obligation on the Minister to provide any set sum of money to a local authority; he can provide whatever sum he likes.  As we know, that figure will continue to be cut back.  I know the way it operates.  The Department of Finance will put pressure on the Minister when the Estimates are being decided.  The Minister will find that his colleagues will not support him and local authorities will suffer.  We inserted a protection for local authorities in the 1978 Act, that there had to be a sum provided in lieu of the rates on domestic dwellings.  It is a tragedy that something similar is not being continued.  One can argue about the difficulties that arose because of that but it must be remembered that, at the same time, the obligation was there to provide a fixed sum.  The removal of that obligation will leave local authorities in a worse position and it is foolish of the Minister to seek to argue otherwise.  In doing that Fianna Fáil protected local authorities and property owners.  But there will be no guarantee now that local authorities will receive any set figure.</P>
      <P>Very shortly we shall be calling for a vote on this.  We have notified the Chair that we shall be opposing this section.</P>

      <P>Had this section appeared earlier in the Bill rather than being the second last section then the attitude of a number of other Deputies might have been very different.  As Deputy Molloy has said, this is the <Col N="2753" /> hard-core, the kernel of the whole Bill, the reason for its very existence.  As he rightly pointed out, in future years, perhaps not this Minister but some other Minister could legitimately say: &ldquo;You have got your block grant; make up the difference yourselves&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>When the idea of imposing local charges was mooted it was felt it could give additional powers to local authority members because, by imposing such charges, they could cater perhaps for some special need in their area, something their constituents had been seeking, perhaps some special amenity that the county or urban area had been seeking. What the provisions of this Bill will do is to allow councillors make up the shortfall that will arise on Departmental grants in future years.  I see the provisions of this section tightening Departmental screws and control on local authorities and their members.  It will make a charade of what the Minister would like to do, to give more power to local authorities.  All that the provisions of this section will do is to make up the shortfall.</P>
      <P>All of us know what will happen in the future.  If there is a shortfall in a local authority they will be told: &ldquo;Make it up as best as you can.  We gave you the authority to do so under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1983.  You can now make up the charges as you will.&rdquo;  I honestly believe that section was deliberately placed at the end of the Bill when perhaps it was hoped we might all be tired and fed up. We see this as the last straw.  The words &ldquo;not exceeding&rdquo; in subsection (1) are the most important words in the entire section. The Minister should have used the words &ldquo;equal to&rdquo;.  The inclusion of the words &ldquo;not exceeding&rdquo; is the reason we are opposing the section: had they not been there we would have welcomed it. I am sorry the Minister did not accept what I consider to be sensible amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to think this is only a temporary style of financing local authorities.  It is a form of block grant but it does not contain any of the more desirable features that should be in <Col N="2754" /> such grants to finance local authorities. There is no element of matching local effort in raising revenue, which is important.</P>
      <P>In addition, it does not provide equity as among counties in the amount of money allocated.  Essentially we are allocating money on the basis of an historical accident, namely, the level of rates and the level of rateable valuations that existed in 1977.  The outcome of basing a block grant on such accidental values is that there will be serious inequity among counties.  The percentage of income which the grant represents in different counties varies considerably: in some counties it is double what it is in others. The variations do not bear any relationship to the means of the counties involved.</P>
      <P>I urge the Minister to regard this purely as a temporary expedient.  We should move quickly to a more proper system of financing local authorities and reforming their operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzsimons</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to be associated with the remarks of Deputy Molloy, Deputy Calleary and Deputy Mac Giolla. In section 9 there has been a real attempt to pull the wool over everyone's eyes. The more local taxation that is collected by way of charges the less will be the amount of block grant to each local authority.  It is a transfer of taxation from central Government to local government and it reduces the onus on central government to provide local authorities with moneys for various services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are bound to be anomalies. Deputy Bruton quite rightly pointed out that some counties will collect considerably more than others.  The Bill is highly unsatisfactory from start to finish.  When rates were abolished it was intended that compensation for loss of income would be made by the Department to the local authorities.  This Bill is anathema to local authority members.  We may lose the division here in this House but local authorities will rue the day this measure is implemented.  The County Managers' Association have looked forward to this day so that their members might rule their local authority areas and overrule <Col N="2755" /> the elected members.  We are coming close to the day when there will be no need for members of local authorities.  It will be a case of just appointing the county manager and to hell with democracy in local government.  We are going down that road as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with some of the things Deputy Molloy said in his most recent contribution, particularly in relation to the severe demands on local authorities in the area of public works, health, courthouses and malicious injuries.  By limiting the demand of the Office of Public Works this year to 5 per cent a considerable relief was granted to local authorities.  I am at a loss to know why Deputy Molloy in his term of office in the then Department of Local Government did not address himself to this problem and to the whole question of local authority financing.</P>
      <P>At all times I have been quite forthright in expressing my feelings in relation to this Bill.  I have stated it is not the panacea for all local authority financial problems.  I can understand Deputy Molloy's comment that pressure will be brought to bear in the future in relation to local authority funding.  That pressure was obviously brought to bear in the situation in which I found myself on taking office last December.  There was a shortfall in local authority financing from central funds that had to be assisted to the tune of £31.5 million.</P>
      <P>Since the abolition of domestic rates the financial state of local authorities has been sliding slowly into chaos.  The real issue which Deputies opposite have tried to obscure for obvious reasons is not the abolition of rates themselves but rather that no effective system was devised to replace them.  The man in the street will accept that the unfortunate decisions of 1977, irrespective of what political support existed for them, were short-sighted. There was no effective system for financing local authorities and they were £43 million in debt at the end of 1982.</P>

      <P>The 1978 Act gave the Minister power to strike the rate for local authorities which limited the contribution of the Exchequer.  This Bill will achieve the same result except that it will enable me to give back to local authorities some freedom and discretion in the matter of rate poundage levels.  Deputy Molloy was concerned that local councillors were not given the power but when they are given power in relation to striking the industrial rate he said that perhaps they should not be allowed to do this.  He will have to make up his mind what powers should be given to whom.  This Bill has to be commended to the House because of the shortfall and the financial situation local authorities find themselves in.  Despite Deputy Molloy's lack of belief that anything will be done to reform local government, at this stage it is of vital necessity that we address ourselves to that problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Conaghan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already outlined the chronic unemployment situation in the north-west.  This is contributed to by virtue of the fact that the area has been underdeveloped.  The natural resources in the area are farming and fishing. Above all, we have our youth there who are able and willing to develop the area if the necessary aids are provided.</P>
      <P>We all know the great potential of tourism in the Border region and particularly in the Donegal area.  It is our contention that the region has not got the necessary aids to develop and give the people a reasonable standard of living.  There are two natural resources in the north-west and it seems strange that there has been no move by any Government to develop them.  They are Lough Swilly and Lough Foyle, two of the greatest natural waterways in Europe.  We could set up a duty-free port in these areas or there could be trans-shipment of the traffic passing to Canada and the United States from Europe.  We all know there is the difficulty of congestion in the waterways and therefore in getting freight to and from the European countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To develop industry in the Border region there is an argument for the setting up of a duty-free industrial zone.  If the necessary effort is put into it, a move could be made on the industrial front to generate work for the unemployed in the Border region.  How could this work? The entire Border region should be tackled as a separate unit and given special treatment to ensure faster development and to give employment to the thousands of unemployed and their families.  The development should be orderly and it should be generated as quickly as possible. A lower VAT rate should apply to industries located in the area.  Workers should be rewarded with lower PAYE rates.  There could be a transfer of capital and advanced technology, and skilled <Col N="2762" /> labour to the weaker regions could be encouraged by suitable fiscal measures. Regionalised fiscal policy is another aspect that should be looked at.  It is possible, through suitable adjustments, to have indirect taxation.  For instance, capital investment could be attracted by the introduction of a graduated relief from income tax payments.  Skilled labour should be encouraged to remain or settle in a weak region by partially exempting the workers concerned from taxation on salaries.</P>
    <P>VAT could be regionalised by introducing different rates to assist products exported by the weaker regions.  This, if adopted, would restore the balance between the richer parts of Europe and the disadvantaged areas, such as the Border region.  Was this not the concept of the regional fund when it was set up?  It is a matter for the Government and their representatives in Brussels to raise this issue at Commission level and see if they could be induced to adopt a regional planning policy in relation to the disadvantaged areas, rather than the regional fund approach which operates at present, While the regional fund has given assistance and aid to the area in relation to infrastructure, progress is too slow and we in the Border region are not in a position to take our place for any upturn in the economy in relation to attracting industries to that region.</P>
    <P>There would be practical difficulties involved but, as there is at present a chain of customs posts from Donegal to Louth on both sides of the Border, I do not think there should be any difficulty in relation to operating any tax changes that would arise in relation to giving tax incentives to the industrialists and the workers who would be attracted there if an industrial zone was set up with low tax rates. There is an argument for putting this case forward in Brussels and for keeping the pressure on to get recognition for it.</P>
    <P>We see from today's newspapers the results of the efforts of the European representatives in Northern Ireland and we have won considerable recognition from Brussels in relation to the £72 million <Col N="2763" /> package for the development of Belfast. That strengthens our argument and I am convinced that if it is pursued vigorously there will be recognition given to what everyone must accept is a disadvantaged area, a region which is not keeping pace with the rest of the country and is far behind those of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I wish to express my concern in relation to the EEC Regional Planning Committee which has been visiting this area during the last few days.  I should like to know why their itinerary was changed from the original plan.  They were to have visited the Derry-Strabane-Donegal areas.  They were also to have visited Inishowen to look at a project there which is under review for some time, the development of the Greencastle fishery port.  That port is badly in need of development and is due for aid from EEC funds.  As fishing is a very attractive business in the Donegal area, I am disappointed that this delegation was not taken to an area where there has been development in relation to aid that was given to the Derry bridge across the Foyle and the development of a national primary route there.  At least they could have familiarised themselves with the limited development that has taken place through aid from Brussels and it could have been impressed upon them how badly development was needed.</P>
    <P>Our main objective must be to develop infrastructure in the region because, if not, we will not be in a position to compete for industry there.  We are far behind many other parts of the country in this respect and also behind European countries. The first priority must be for a massive injection of capital to boost the development of roads, communications, transport and so on, especially in the Donegal area.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider the question of a regional plan for the Border area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Unfortunately, I did not hear the debate yesterday evening but I understand that it covered the whole question of regional development in the Border areas, free trade, the effect of the <Col N="2764" /> Border on economic conditions and activities, how the Regional Fund is spent and the special allocation from the non-quota section of the Regional Fund which, as has been stated recently, has not been fully taken up.  I agree with the Minister that that appears to be so in certain respects but I understand why it has not been taken up in some instances.  It is said in relation to the purchase of goods in Northern Ireland, where they have a price advantage in certain areas, that we cannot do this or that because the European Economic Community says so.  We should remember that, long before we joined the EEC, we had a free trade agreement with Great Britain.  That was a progressive step at the time and it was a change in our attitude and outlook which heralded the approach of an era when we could become industrially competitive, modernise our structure and services and raise our standard of lving.  We should not blame the European Economic Community for preventing us from reverting to restrictive practices which I do not think would serve the needs of consumers on either side of the Border.</P>
      <P>While I welcome the free trade they have, it can only go along with fair trade. At present we have a certain freedom of trade in the Border areas but we do not have fair trade.  The people on the northern side of the Border have many advantages which we do not have.  I do not want to talk about the retail sector and people shopping in northern towns for some goods but we should take note of the fact that Northern Ireland has the best package of regional aids and incentives within the EEC and perhaps in any part of the world.  Their economic difficulties, high unemployment and so on, cannot be blamed on the United Kingdom Government.  They have given them aids and incentives which should ensure a healthy economy.  Of course there are other problems there but, in that respect, the British Government have not failed Northern Ireland.  That creates problems for certain industrialists and manufacturers on the southern side of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is quite obvious if one drives from Dundalk, down through Monaghan, <Col N="2765" /> Cavan, Leitrim and up into Donegal, that we have failed in the whole area of gravel, stones and readymix concrete and concrete blocks.  The Northern industrialists have an immense advantage over our producers in this area and they have a very big share of the market in the South while no producer in the South that I know has succeeded in selling any significant amount of goods in Northern Ireland.  I do not believe that is due to a lack of effort on the part of the industrialists or the work force on the Southern side.  I believe it arises from unfair advantages which the producers in Northern Ireland have and I would request the Minister to do a study on this.  We cannot have free trade unless that trade is fair. The Minister should do a study not just on this industry but perhaps the provender milling industry as well.</P>
    <P>In the agricultural sector we have the penetration of the Southern market by poultry producers from Northern Ireland.  While I absolutely defend their right to sell their produce down here, just as we have the right to sell up there, we certainly cannot continue to tolerate a situation in which we on the Southern side are forced to concede our markets to people who have every advantage.  The difference in the price of commercial vehicles is startling.  There is a huge difference in transport costs arising out of that.  The roads of the Border areas are thick with lorries.  In some instances I think by some means or other they have been subsidised.  Not only do they pay a low rate of tax on those vehicles but they also have, to the best of my knowledge, a cheaper means of financing their transport than is possible in the Twenty-Six Counties.  It is an area at which we should look carefully.  Otherwise aids and incentives being given by us and the development of structures in the Border regions will be wasted.</P>
    <P>It is recognised that all over Europe borders are areas of less-intense economic activity.  The very existence of borders and customs barriers tends to reduce commercial and economic activity and so living standards and incomes in border regions will always be slightly lower.  It is a little bit worse along our Border <Col N="2766" /> because we have other disadvantages as well.  Most of the problems we have in the Border areas do not require any special treatment apart from what I have already said about fair trade, the customs barriers and the difficulty of access to some areas.  Beyond that, the Border areas are no different, in their disadvantages, from the areas away from the Border. We have a combination of a Border problem and natural disadvantages.  I would not accept the idea that we need a special authority to look after this region.  I think we have enough authorities to do all the development that we have plans or money to do.  We can make those authorities more efficient but I do not think we need any new structures either here or in Brussels.  We do not want any more administrative costs.</P>
    <P>On the border between County Leitrim and County Fermanagh there is no access route.  It is noticeable that the British authorities would not concede an official crossing beside Kiltyclogher in County Leitrim.  They may have had problems of security in that area but it is noticeable that in that case the village is in County Leitrim and people from Northern Ireland would be shopping in Kiltyclogher.  There is no economic disadvantage to the British side in keeping that border closed.  While I am sure they have the same security problems in Ballyconnell, our Government &mdash; I think it was a Fianna Fáil Government &mdash; agreed to and co-operated in the setting up of a customs post there.  I thought that was fair enough at the time and I supported the idea of putting a customs post there. In that case we were giving the advantage to the Northern side from a commercial point of view because at that customs post they take across all the gravel, stones, readymix concrete and blocks which create employment in County Fermanagh.  The British were quite willing to provide the security necessary to man a customs post there where they had an economic advantage but they were not willing to do it in Kiltyclogher.  Every effort we have made in this regard has been a failure.  In County Cavan there is the bridge at Aughalane which was blown up some years ago and it should have <Col N="2767" /> been restored and normal communication resumed.  The security situation in Northern Ireland has nothing to suffer from the opening of these routes.  I believe our Government would give whatever assistance was necessary to ensure that those crossings were not used by terrorists or anybody seeking to subvert the system on either side of the Border. Renewed efforts should be made by our Government to open up these because every bridge that has been knocked down is an obstacle to economic development.</P>
    <P>In regard to the special non-quota section of the Regional Fund, it is easy to look back now and identify what has gone wrong.  When that fund was proposed we did not have any consultations whatever. I can understand the frustration that people feel about European funds.  They are told that there is approximately £500 million of an advantage to Ireland annually from being a member of the EEC and that is true.  They were told before we joined the Community that there would be economic advantages but they do not see very clearly how the money is being spent or how we are getting it and so in some areas they believe they are not getting their fair share.  We oversold that idea in the first place because we gave our people to believe that the only reason we were joining the EEC was to get money from our friends and neighbours in Europe.  That was one of the reasons but it was not the only reason.  When the money comes Ministers and Governments tend to announce the allocation of funds without sufficient reference to the fact that so much of this money is provided from the European Regional Fund or the Social Fund and people do not recognise where it is coming from.  The vast improvement in training facilities through AnCO that we have got from the Social Fund is not recognised even by the people working there.  In places where the Regional Fund money is being spent it is not being recognised. Occasionally there are posters along the roads to say that money is being spent in this way and that has helped, but in many instances where money has been devoted <Col N="2768" /> to food processing and to industrial projects company directors and others have not sufficiently recognised the importance of the contribution from Europe and so we have so many people demanding to know where is the money going that is coming from Europe.</P>
    <P>The Border areas are not getting their fair share of agricultural spending because agricultural production is not sufficiently high in those areas to give them the benefit of the Common Agricultural Policy.  The Regional Fund money is being spent at the will of the Government all over the country and again the Border areas are getting less than their share.  As far as the spending of the non-quota section is concerned the situation is not as bad as it appears on paper. In the area of the grants that were made available for tourist development we had to get applications, the people had to get planning permission, they had to get contractors, raise the finance and carry out the development and so the money could not yet have gone to the recipients because they have not yet completed their projects and the money cannot be paid.  I understand there are sufficient projects there to take up all the money that Bord Fáilte have provided.</P>
    <P>The local authority is a harder one to understand.  I cannot understand how the local authorities did not spend it.  This money was thrown out in so many directions and what went to the local authorities was just used to substitute the sort of money our own Government had to give a few years ago to maintain county roads.  I know roads in which I as a member of a local authority was involved in the provision of money for their upkeep. Those roads were black topped but because the financing of local authorities has run down so much the roads have now fallen into disrepair.  Now we are submitting applications to Europe for tourist amenity roads.  In other words, we are just maintaining roads that county councils have failed to maintain over the years.  That is not the right way to spend money of this sort and is not working in the right way within the framework of the development plan for the Border regions.</P>
    <P>Regarding both the Regional Fund and <Col N="2769" /> the non-quota section I hope this £20 million over five years is not the last allocation of money we will get.  It will not strain the capacity of local authorities to spend all the money.  I have no doubt about that.  Local authorities will take their share and so will Bord Fáilte.  There are more than sufficient applications and I know very worthwhile applications which have been refused because the projected cost would be in excess of what the fund could finance.  A lesser level of financing would have given us a greater number of projects and better value.  The grant given for the self-catering section was quite generous and we could perhaps have succeeded in encouraging the development of 25 per cent more accommodations with the same amount of money. This House, the local authorities and the various other interests involved should have had some input.  They should have been asked for their opinions and, had they been asked, the schemes would have been more carefully designed instead of the Government doing all the negotiating and then announcing a package.  I think there is some sort of political objective in this.  For the future we should hear far more about the planning of these various projects.</P>
    <P>The same situation obtained with the western development fund.  None of us who was involved, concerned and interested could get any information about how the fund was being allocated until the Government made an announcement. This should not happen.  I would prefer to see these funds channelled into a smaller number of schemes for the development of some specific region, preferably the west and north-west, where there would be less administrative cost for four or five years and, when the project was completed, moving on to another area.  Throwing the money into the Naas bypass, the Alcan project and hundreds of other schemes is purely the substitution of national money and if the fund were withdrawn in the morning one would not have the Government reducing the budget by the equivalent amount. They would budget for the same amount less the allocation Europe would make. Additionality is there all right but the <Col N="2770" /> reality is different.  This Government should start by being more honest and open in their administration of this particular fund.</P>
    <P>The Border region is a problem.  No solution will be found in the expenditure of this comparatively small sum.  I think we could have gone further with the money to resolve the problem.  For instance, the Ballymore-Ballyconnell canal, which covers three counties &mdash; Leitrim, Cavan and Fermanagh &mdash; has fallen into disuse and disrepair.  If it were repaired we could then plan tourism and land reclamation.  A worthwhile job could be done over a five year period.  I alerted the Minister and the county development team when the scheme was first proposed but because of failure of consultation the money did not go in that direction.  There were no environmental hazards and it could have become a very important amenity area.  There was also the question of an interpretive centre in Ballyshannon.  The local authority there are very concerned because while this had been planned &mdash; it was an ideal project which could have been included rather than the maintenance of county roads &mdash; nothing was done.</P>

      <P>First of all, I want to call the attention of the House to the motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to recognise the need for the development of the Border region and requests that available EEC funds be used more extensively for this purpose.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two parts to the motion, a recognition of the need for the development of the region and a request that available EEC funds be used more extensively. I would suggest that too much time is spent on the non-quota fund, on the £20 million over five years, and not enough time has been spent dealing with the other regional fund in general as well as the Social Fund and so on.  Last night the Minister in response to the proposer of the motion spent nearly all his time dealing with the non-quota section, the £20 million.  I would agree with Deputy McCartin that the Aghalane and Kiltyclogher <Col N="2771" /> approaches should be repaired. I would not agree with him that Ballyconnell, which is the traditional town of that section of County Fermanagh to the north of it, has suffered in any way &mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want also to endorse his remarks as far as the canal is concerned. There have been movements to get it linked up.  There is a marvellous complex, one of great scenic beauty and great amenity value coming down from Ballyshannon, to Enniskillen to the two Lough Ernes and right on to Carrick-on-Shannon. Quite recently I had a discussion with the President of the Chamber of Commerce in Athlone who has ideas of a linkage between Athlone and Enniskillen and in that context the canal referred to should play a linking role and the expenditure of money on it would be desirable.  Deputy Conaghan suggested to me that I should not be parochial and to remember Donegal.  I do not intend to be parochial but I had to make those comments on what Deputy McCartin said, and Deputy Conaghan repeated last night, that the realities of the effect on the Border regions on both sides &mdash; that is to the north and south, if you can call Donegal the south; anyway the six county part and the twenty-six county part &mdash; have never been studied carefully.  We <Col N="2772" /> have the New Ireland Forum in which we may be studying the economic situation, but I have always claimed that any studies made were made on a Republic basis &mdash; that is to say the whole of the Republic &mdash; and on a six-county basis &mdash; the whole of the six counties &mdash; but were not specific in relation to the areas on the Border where the scene can be quite different from the overall economic situation.  If the New Ireland Forum does anything worthwhile it should draw attention to the problems of the specific Border areas, and to Hades with the cynics who say that it cannot be successful.  They are plentiful, they grow everywhere on the basis that a cynic is one who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. Out of the Forum for a new Ireland could come some productive thinking with regard to the Border areas.  It is important that the realities of the situation of the areas adjacent to the Border on both sides should be highlighted and the studies may do that.</P>
      <P>We had the European Parliamentarians on a visit to the area during the last week and that is indicative of what we should be talking about, which is the line that the people who met the European Parliamentarians took in explaining to them the Border regions.  We had submissions on agriculture, environment, industry and tourism.  I said at the outset that perhaps we spent too much time talking about the non-quota section of the European Regional Fund.  The House will note that, apart from aid to marketing for small industries, most of what the Minister for Finance was talking about last night was connected with only one aspect that I have just mentioned, that is, tourism.  The wording of the motion is broad enough to ask us to have a look at the scene right across the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The population of the area is now substantially larger than it was in 1951.  At times the area was almost bled to death by emigration but the population has built up again and in the north-eastern development area, that is to say, Louth, Monaghan and Cavan, almost 50 per cent, 48 per cent at any rate of the population are under 25 years of age.  The Government's attention to the area <Col N="2773" /> should be directed towards those.  It is very important that cognisance be taken of their existence.  Development that will bring employment for them is very important because it is quite easy to see what might happen to those young people who have a better education than their parents had for the most part, and what they will turn to if they are frustrated. One contribution was made by the IDA officer who boasted and claimed as a plus factor that the work ethic was still strong in the area.  You can cultivate a work ethic only if work is there to satisfy that, and if young people are for a long period without employment there is grave danger that that advantage will be corroded and die.  In the Louth-Cavan-Monaghan area at the moment 11,000 are unemployed. Again I call the attention of the Minister for Finance and through him the attention of the Government of that fact. That adds another reason for asking the Government to recognise the need for the development of the Border region. As has been said, we have unemployment elsewhere, but I maintain that there are social hazards and risks in a large unemployed young grouping along the Border, dangers and risks that do not exist to the same extent elsewhere in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCartin mentioned roads. We had a discussion with the European grouping, including an Irish MEP and a Welsh MEP, about the roads in Monaghan.  In the Louth-Monaghan-Cavan area 6,640 km of roads must be catered for.  Again we must appeal to the Government to look coldly at this situation. Deputy Conaghan and Deputy Leonard made the point that we have no railway system in the area.  We must look at this 6,640 km of roads that have to be maintained.  Deputy McCartin referred to the concept of additionality, but we want substantial aid for roads for that area.  Here I include Leitrim and Donegal also.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the water and sanitary services in our part of the Border region.  Great development has taken place there particularly with the regional water schemes.  Again we must say &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; to the EEC for aid from FEOGA for some of those group water <Col N="2774" /> schemes.  However, Drogheda and Dundalk were mentioned as two towns that needed full development in the water and sewerage area because the lack of an adequate water and sewerage system in those large towns is hindering development, and proof of that can be produced.</P>
    <P>For the most part Louth, Monaghan, Cavan, Leitrim and most of Donegal, certainly east Donegal, depend to a great extent on agriculture.  It is a strong area for pig, poultry and egg production and, of course, dairying.  In this area the Government and the EEC agencies should concentrate not merely on the development of the traditional products but on the development of diverse products.  To mention one interesting development, we have a very fine duck unit in Monaghan.  We have also a new mushroom industry there.  I am talking about new, highly concentrated industries that give employment and bring wealth to the area.  Innovation, the striving to get new products developed should be inculcated in everybody connected with agricultural education in the area.  A few years ago it was inconceivable that Bailey's Cream should be such an important export from this country.  In County Cavan more than 30 million gallons of milk are used for the production of Bailey's Cream.  Emmet's Cream has been launched by the Bailieboro Co-op and it is doing very well.  We should introduce flexibility and innovation into our agricultural education because with so many young people coming on, agri-business is the only type of business that will be able to cater for the employment of young people in large numbers.</P>
    <P>The quality of the land can benefit through aid from the EEC and the Central Fund.  I regret that the western drainage scheme which was welcomed by everybody is now at a standstill because funds are not being provided for it.  On the use of fertilisers in the area it is interesting to note that those who are making most money make the best use of fertilisers. Encouragement by way of subsidy and propaganda is important in that regard.  Statistics about incomes in the area make sad reading.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2775" /> We have applied for an expansion of the severely handicapped areas scheme in those counties.  The fact is that the people through hard work and a large input of sweat and money, in so far as they have the capital, have been placed high up in the productivity league and that tends to go against them in assessment for inclusion in the severely disadvantaged areas scheme.</P>
    <P>The productivity figures mainly assessed in the four large co-operatives in Cavan and Monaghan are good and that tends to militate against the inclusion of areas that by any standards are severely disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>The most immoral and obscene act of any Government &mdash; I thought out those words &mdash; was the decision to discontinue the farm modernisation scheme on 9 February. The word used in regard to that scheme is deferment but whatever it was, a 30 per cent gross increase in production resulted from the use of the funds allocated under that scheme.  Small farmers had already committed themselves to expenditure which for them was large and when they discovered they would not be getting anything out of the farm modernisation scheme they were swamped, financially bankrupt, gone. That was as a result of direct Government action.  I am not making a political point about that; I could not care less but there are instances throughout my constituency of people who had been following the advice of their instructors suddenly discovering that the money was being withdrawn from them.</P>
    <P>I hope now that there has been a change with regard to the use of bulls that the subsidisation of the AI scheme will continue.  Otherwise the quality of the cattle in the area will deteriorate.</P>

      <P>If the EEC have money to give we should send out a clarion call that it be made available for the development of agricultural education in the area from Dundalk to the north of Inishowen.  No other investment would give a better return.  Indeed, some small studies have indicated the type of return that would come from agricultural education but I do not have time to go into the details now.  Thanks to the EEC ten new centres are being established by ACOT in my area.  Let us encourage the EEC to think big as far as agricultural education is concerned.</P>
      <P>The farm retirement scheme is a totally inadequate joke.  There is a possibility that we would get better farm structures if we concentrated whatever money comes from any fund into a worthwhile farm retirement scheme.  I have dealt with diversification, the poultry business and cream liquors.  Butter oil did very well in our region but a reply I received from the Minister for Agriculture indicated that the bottom had fallen out of the market in recent years.  I believe we were selling to some countries that have since gone bankrupt.  Why do we not produce regional cheeses?  De Gaulle complained that one could not rule a country that had 178 different brands of cheese but why could we not have a regional cheese, a Louth cheese, a Monaghan cheese, a Cavan cheese and a Donegal cheese and make a good effort at marketing?  Under the funds we are discussing aid is available for marketing. We should have more small industries. Some years ago we were told that small was beautiful but we are inclined to look for big things in industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2777" /> We have a proposal that there should be an overall development agency in the area.  I am thinking in terms of a SFADCo of the Border region.  A total of £23,616,003 of direct Government funds has been given to SFADCo since 1973-74. We should be given that amount of money for development and we are entitled to it.  Why is it that such money is not invested in the Border region?  We need a SFADCo of the Border region; we will get a nice name for it later.  Belfast, I was delighted to hear, got £70 million but that city is not necessarily the area we should be talking about.  We should be considering the areas that run along the Border.</P>
    <P>There has been a thesis for many years that the best lure as far as the Six Counties is concerned is to have economic development here.  Why not have the display shop along the Border through development of that region?  That would be the best service we could do for the country.  The Border should not be there and many of our problems have come from the fact that it is there, an artificially created Border.  Can we not make a special effort in the economic area to breakdown the dire results of having it there?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise I have only five minutes but I would not get very far down the road in that short space of time. In fact, I would not be able to cross the Border.  I listened to the submissions of Deputies Leonard and Conaghan and I sympathise with the sentiments they expressed.  There is no doubt that the Border regions are deprived and have been neglected by successive Governments in the last ten years.  Many of the problems are peculiar to those regions only.  Deputies so far have referred to deprivation in their own areas and I will not be an exception because my home town, Dundalk, the largest town in Ireland, suffers from industrial deprivation.  No town has suffered as grievously as Dundalk has in the last 14 years as a result of the problems of the North of Ireland.  The town has been virtually brought to its knees economically. There has not been any compensatory measure by any Government to <Col N="2778" /> bolster trade in that ravaged area.  The last major investment in Dundalk was in 1969 when an American shoe company named Weyenberg established a firm there.  Investment during the past 14 years has been stagnant in Dundalk.</P>
      <P>When I visit Newry I am filled with envy at the money and facilities available to that area.  Money is available for environmental projects there.  At the moment £1 million is being spent on a sports complex in the town of Newry.  I cannot help feeling that projects on the northern side of the Border have freer access to EEC funds.  Perhaps I am wrong but that feeling is shared by many people in my region.  When we consider there is unexpended money it is tragic that money has not been taken up in an area which is crying out for help.  I accept, only to a degree, the amendment of the Minister for Finance calling for increased involvement by local authorities and State agencies, because I feel that many of the agencies entrusted with spending that money have a question to answer.  I believe only two agencies took up the full allocation. Bord Fáilte did not take up their full allocation.</P>
      <P>In my area we have the hidden gem of Ireland.  We have an area of natural beauty in Cooley Peninsula which we believe is on a par with any scenic spot in the country but it is undiscovered.  It is part of the beautiful Carlingford Lough area.  It is favoured in song and legend as the Cuchulainn and Fionn Mac Cool country.  There is not one guest house in the area which is indicative of its hidden beauty.  I exhort Bord Fáilte to look at the possibilities of that area.  I exhort them to look at the wonderful virgin territory in the scenic sense of Cooley Peninsula. I hope it will be developed in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Again I have to be parochial in asking why did Sligo receive £190,000 from this fund?  When did it become a Border county?  Eventually we will have Carlow looking for money from the Border Regional Fund.  When money is made available from the regional fund it should be spent in the areas where it is supposed to be spent.  While I understand the reticence of the Minister for Finance about <Col N="2779" /> setting up another layer of bureaucracy in creating a new State agency I feel it would be a progressive and very meaningful step.  It would be a hands across the Border gesture if some type of Irish-Ulster agency was set up.  It need not be a very large one.  It only requires a few people from both sides to identify EEC projects and to monitor their progress.  I believe the money was unexpended because of lack of co-ordination.  It was only at the end of the year that it was discovered the money was unexpended.</P>
    <P>There should be a chief executive or a co-ordinator to monitor the progress of the various projects that are identified by the local authorities and the various State agencies in that area.  I suggest the EEC can play a very meaningful role in easing tensions in the divided part of the country. The way to do so is by having a joint submission made by Ireland and Britain. I believe, because of the very special problems in that region, that a very definite case can be presented to the Commission in Brussels.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this motion.  As I come from, and represent, a Border constituency it is inevitable that the problems which exist in that area are very much on my mind. There are considerable areas of County Louth which are very underdeveloped because of the county's proximity to the Border.  When we talk about the development of the Border regions it is inevitable that we think in terms of the infrastructural development and the assistance towards that which we can derive from the regional development programme. People hold the view that the indirect nature of the assistance coming from that fund is inadequate to deal with the existing problems.  There is the problem with member states of the EEC having different regional policies.  There is a lack of <Col N="2780" /> proper co-ordinated effort among member states, particularly relating to the Border regions.</P>
      <P>We must face the reality that the Regional Fund, as at present constituted, is insufficiently concentrated to make a real impact in the Border regions of County Louth.  The watering down principle whereby funds are spread over a large area is self-defeating.  The fund regulations do not recognise the specific problems of a country like Ireland and its Border regions.  There has been a watering can policy in relation to the distribution of the regional fund in Ireland.  The resources of the fund are spread over too large an area.</P>
      <P>Some of the speakers yesterday said they would try to avoid being parochial about this matter.  I do not believe it is possible not to be parochial about the matter.  The various people who spoke on the motion represent Border constituencies. It is inevitable that they will see the problems there very much as they see them on the ground in their own constituencies.</P>
      <P>Mine is a maritime county, the four principal rivers being the Boyne, the Glyde, the Dee and the Fane, all flowing into the Irish Sea.  The problem is that there are no lakes on these rivers, no natural reservoir which could be used for the storage of water, which would also be of advantage for the development of water supply schemes in the county.  That situation being what it is, it is inevitable that we would have to look to neighbouring counties to augment the supplies we have within the confines of the county. At present Louth County Council, in conjunction with Dundalk Urban Council are endeavouring to secure a water order on the Muckno/Lough Ross catchment in south Monaghan.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>While on the subject of water supply, one point I should make has to do with the problem of the organisation of group water schemes in rural Louth.  Not being designated as a disadvantaged area in the past we could not avail of the assistance provided under <Col N="2781" /> FEOGA grant schemes and available in the counties of Monaghan, Cavan, Donegal and the other Border counties. That has worked to the major disadvantage of County Louth.  It is something that has been reflected in our performance with regard to the organisation of group water schemes on the ground.  We appear at the tail end of the list in this respect.  Louth is a county situated midway between Belfast and Dublin.  It is a natural regional centre, one that should attract a greater amount of industry and commerce.  One would imagine that such would gravitate towards us because of our geographic location.  Unfortunately there are inhibiting factors that have militated against this development over the past number of years.</P>
      <P>It might be of benefit to Deputies if I gave a run down of the population figures in Louth for the years 1971 and 1981, which would give an overall picture of what is the position there by way of labour force and so on.  For example, in Dundalk in 1971 we had a population of 21,672; in 1981 we had 25,663.  In Drogheda in 1971 we had 20,202 and, in 1981, 23,247.  In Ardee in 1971, we had 3,076 and, in 1981, 3,199.  It is significant that there was no real population growth in Ardee in that period.  In the remainder of the county in 1971 we had 30,154 and, in 1981, 36,405.  Over that period there was an increase of 13,410, or a 17.8 per cent increase in population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moving on to the industrial front I might refer the population figures to the town of Ardee where we now have 1,000 persons unemployed.  When we cast our minds back to the population figures there for 1981 and look at the present unemployment figure it will be agreed that a very serious unemployment problem obtains in that town.  There is need for urgent action in Ardee.  There is need of measures to stimulate industrial development in the town.  The Government should seriously consider including the town of Ardee in areas designated as disadvantaged so that we might receive the higher rates of grants in order to encourage industrialists to invest there. It is absolutely essential that local authorities acquire land for small industries in <Col N="2782" /> rural parts of the county.  It is particularly important to do so when there may be entrepreneurs who might have the ideas and some money but who simply cannot get a site readily available.  This is an area in which local authorities have a vital role to play.  In that regard the Minister for Finance should seriously consider removing the £1.75 per square metre planning charge imposed recently.  Everybody agrees that it constituted a retrograde step and in time the foolishness of having imposed it will become apparent.</P>
    <P>Over this period automation has played a significant role in reducing employment opportunity which, combined with the growth in population in our county, left us at the end of last year with 20 per cent of the county's work force unemployed.  There have been new industries emerging, such as plastics, electronics and light engineering, but they have not been sufficient to absorb the increasing workforce of the county. Traditionally in Louth people from the Border areas of South Armagh and South Down have looked to us for employment. That has been the position for many years now.  Employment opportunities were simply not provided in the Border regions of South Down and South Armagh.</P>
    <P>Another very important area in regard to economic growth and activity in the county and Border regions is the Cooley Mountain area of Louth which, taken in conjunction with the Mourne region, is one of the most scenic and beautiful in the country.  Recently the east Border region produced a booklet embracing that area entitled &ldquo;From the Mournes to the Boyne&rdquo;.  There simply has not been an adequate follow-up in the promotion of the area to encourage tourists to come and see the beautiful scenery there. Places like Omeath and Carlingford have been very dependent on the tourist trade over the years.  That trade has not been forthcoming in recent times in the volume that would maintain turnover so necessary for people to keep businesses going. The Cooley, north Louth and South Armagh/Mourne region is a natural area for projection as a tourist attraction. There is tremendous opportunity for cross-Border promotion there also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2783" /> Moving on to farming, there are great similarities existing there between the terrain and soil type in north Louth and South Armagh.  It is an area distinguished by its number of small holdings.  The Minister should explore the possibility of giving sufficient grant aid to keep as many family units and farms as possible in these areas.  When one looks at the cost of job creation in some industries it would be well worth exploring the possibilities, or certainly examining the economic prospects, of maintaining as many people as possible on these small holdings.  An extension of the disadvantaged areas scheme to County Louth would go a long way towards making these family farms viable units.</P>
    <P>We have in the area the Greenore and Warrenpoint ports.  Greenore is a natural gateway for exports for the north-eastern region of the country.  A roadway developed from Greenore to Sligo would open up the country and afford many possibilities for the development of the north east and midland regions.  The Border towns of Dundalk, Newry, Crossmaglen and Castleblayney have been inhibited in their development by virtue of their very geographic location.  The parish of Crossmaglen straddles the Border but there are simply no employment opportunities in that town.  People from the area must look to the South for employment.</P>
    <P>While on the Border regions I might refer briefly to the Customs station on the Newry road and the problem there with trucks stopping and starting at the front doors of residents of the Dowdells-hill area, creating an intolerable situation, one brought about by the existence of the Border a mere ten or 11 miles <Col N="2784" /> down the road.  For years there have been Border region committees in existence and they have done valuable work.  I should like us to establish a development authority board to co-ordinate development in the Border regions.</P>

The need for that type of structure has been stressed by both sides, and probably has been done more forcibly from the Minister's side of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which was concluded in Washington on the 2nd December, 1946.</P>
      <P>The International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling is designed to provide for the proper conservation of whale stocks and thus make possible the orderly development of the whaling industry. Adherence by Ireland to this convention is recommended to support conservation measures for whales, many species of which are believed to be seriously threatened. The approval of the Dáil is necessary before Ireland can adhere to the convention, as a charge on public funds is involved.</P>
      <P>The International Whaling Commission, composed of one representative from each contracting Government, are responsible for the administration of the convention.  Their annual budget is financed by contributions from contracting Governments, the scale of which is approved at the commission's annual meeting in July.  Ireland's contribution for the next financial year &mdash; 1 August 1983 to 31 July 1984 &mdash; is not therefore known, but our contribution for the year ending 31 July 1983 would have been approximately IR£8,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The schedule to the convention, which may be amended by the International Whaling Commission, prescribes certain measures governing the conduct of whaling.  Measures at present in force are (1) prescribed open and closed seasons <Col N="2788" /> for the taking of exploitable whale species; (2) set the maximum catches of whales which may be taken in any one season; (3) fix size limits above and below which certain species of whales may not be killed; (4) prohibit the capture and killing of suckling calves, lactating females and females accompanied by calves; (5) provide for the complete protection of specified whale species, and (6) require the compilation of catch reports and other statistical and biological data. The Whale Fisheries Act, 1937, and an Order made under that Act on 23 July 1982 enables Ireland to implement the provisions of the convention.</P>
    <P>As Ireland is not a whaling nation and has demonstrated, by its active participation in other international conservation conventions and activities, its concern for the conservation of wildlife at international level, our role at meetings of the IWC will primarily be a conservation one based on scientific evidence. Recent accessions to the convention by major whaling nations have tended to swing the balance of voting strength of the commission in favour of whaling interests.  Participation by Ireland at future meetings of the commission will help to restore the balance between the conservation and whaling interests.</P>
    <P>I now move that the terms of this convention be approved.</P>

      <P>The fact that we had no great interest in whales around our own coast was a major factor in causing a certain degree of delay in bringing this convention before the House.  Deputy Collins has been in this House longer than I.  Coming from a coastal constituency, I have to say that I have not had many representations from my own constituency, and I am sure in his time in the Dáil, Deputy Collins has found a similar response or lack of it from his constituency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2789" /> In all seriousness I must say that in international affairs it is important that Ireland should not be involved just in international conventions where we have a particular axe to grind.  To some degree we have a role to play as mediators, and we are fulfiling our international obligations in acceding to this convention.  I should also add that international representations at a very high level have been made to us to take this step.  We are doing the right thing in acceding to the convention.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the 1983 Protocol for the futher extension of the Food Aid Convention 1980 which has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Dáil approval of the terms of the 1983 Protocol for the further extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1980, is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution which stipulates that &ldquo;the State shall not be bound by an international agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>An explanatory note has been circulated to Deputies.  It outlines the provisions of the convention and covers the cost of Irish participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Wheat Agreement, 1971, has two parts: (i) The Wheat Trade Convention for the regulation of the commercial wheat market; and (ii) The Food <Col N="2790" /> Aid Convention for the supply of food aid in the form of cereals to the developing world.</P>
    <P>Under the terms of the Treaty of Accession to the European Community, Ireland was obliged to accede to the Food Aid Convention as the original member states and the Community were a party to it.  We therefore acceded to the Food Aid Convention in June 1973, and have acceded to each extension since then.  The Wheat Trade Convention was extended on the same occasions in order to maintain the framework of the International Wheat Agreement.</P>
    <P>In view of the deteriorating world food position, a new Food Aid Convention was negotiated in March 1980.  The new convention was approved by this House on 24 June 1980 and Ireland duly ratified it on 30 June of that year.  The convention came into force on 1 July 1980, was extended initially to 30 June 1981 and again to 30 June 1983 which coincided with the Sixth Extension of the Wheat Trade Convention, 1971.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House seeks approval for the extension of the Food Aid Convention 1980 until 30 June 1986. The Wheat Trade Convention is also being extended to cover the same period. The effect of the two extensions, therefore, will be to extend the life of the International Wheat Agreement pending the possible negotiation of a new agreement. Ireland, together with its Community partners signed the protocols extending both conventions on 10 May 1983.  Instruments of ratification must be deposited by 30 June 1983, hence the urgency of getting the matter through the House at this stage.</P>
    <P>The Food Aid Convention, 1980, which the protocol under discussion today seeks to extend, binds its adherents to providing total annual contributions of 7.592 million tonnes of cereals for developing countries.  The European Community and its member states have undertaken to supply a minimum of 1.65 million tonnes of cereals in the form of wheat, coarse grains or derivative products suitable for human consumption. This contribution is discharged partly by the Community from its own <Col N="2791" /> reserves and partly by the member states nationally in accordance with an agreed scale.  Ireland's national contribution, which is channelled through the World Food Programme, is 4,080 tonnes per annum.  The cost of this is borne by the Vote for the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <P>The Government are pleased to support this further extension of the Food Aid Convention, 1980 &mdash; a convention which, as Deputies will recall, increased the minimum annual contribution of aid from 4.226 million tonnes to 7.592 million tonnes.  Ireland's national commitment under the 1980 Convention represented an increase of approximately 1,000 tonnes per annum on the 1971 Convention. Total accumulated contributions to the Food Aid Convention by Ireland by virtue of our national commitment between the years 1975 and 1982 amount to more than £4.16 million.  In this year's Vote for Agriculture a further £800,000 has been allocated for the purpose of fulfilling our obligations under the convention.</P>
    <P>Deputies will agree that the most immediate problems facing developing countries are hunger and malnutrition. Since 1981 the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations has designated 16 October each year as World Food Day in an effort to develop a sense of national and international solidarity in the struggle against these twin evils.  At this point I wish to pay tribute to the work done by Gorta in organising one-day seminars to mark World Food Day.</P>
    <P>When it comes to alleviating hunger and malnutrition in the developing world we believe that the food aid we donate should be effective.  This means that it should bring real relief to those in distress, that it should provide them with the nutrition they require and that it should contribute to the development of the recipient countries.</P>
    <P>Food aid is, however, only part of the solution.  The root of the problem, as the Brandt Commission has clearly shown in its report <i>North-South: A Programme for Survival</i> and its more recent memorandum <i>Common Crisis,</i> is poverty.  The <Col N="2792" /> cure for poverty is growth.  In the poorest countries the vicious circle of poverty and hunger can only be broken through rural and agricultural development providing food and employment for their peoples and creating the conditions necessary for growth.</P>
    <P>Realisation of these imperatives has resulted in the development of a new, more dynamic approach to the problem of hunger.  Following the lead of the World Food Council, the European Community has launched as part of its Plan of Action to Combat Hunger in the World a process of dialogue with selected developing countries.  The countries chosen for the first experimental phase are Zambia, Kenya, Mali and Rwanda.  The aim of this dialogue is to draw up a strategy for the agricultural development of the countries concerned which would subsequently be integrated with EEC development aid.  Food aid as such would then become an integral part of the strategy with a view to its being phased out as the recipient country became self-sufficient in food.  It would, of course, continue to be required in emergencies to cope with the problems of natural disasters and of refugees.</P>
    <P>This is the thrust of the most recent EEC Commission proposals for policy guidelines on food aid, now under discussion at the Council of Ministers.  We believe that this is the right approach. Food aid will continue to be required in increasing quantities for the foreseeable future, but it should never be seen as more than a stop-gap to alleviate short-term needs while the work of helping those in need to help themselves continues. It is such considerations which have led us to endorse the food strategy approach where donor and beneficiary co-operate to the benefit of all concerned. In this perspective we will continue to give generously to feed the hungry, but we look forward to the time when through increased co-operation the need for food aid will be eliminated in all but the most exceptional cases.</P>
    <P>It is for this reason also that Ireland has consistently supported the International Fund for Agricultural Development, IFAD, whose objectives are <Col N="2793" /> increased food production, reduced rural poverty and improved nutrition in developing countries.  For the same reason since 1980 we have contributed over 3,725 tonnes of fertiliser at a cost of £762,000 to Sudan, Tanzania, Kenya and Sierra Leone under the FAO's International Fertiliser Supply Scheme.  We particularly respect the approach of the World Food Programme which consists of using food supplied by donors as an aid to economic and social development. Food donations are used, for example, as part of workers' wages, as a way of attracting children to school and improving their health and as an incentive to voluntary participation in community development.</P>
    <P>The continued need for the international community to channel food aid to needy populations is unquestionable. The Food Aid Convention is the preeminent international vehicle for the supply of food aid to developing countries. It is in this spirit that I recommend to the House the protocol extending the Food Aid Convention, 1980.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the International Agreement on Jute and Jute Products, 1982, which has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
      <P>Dáil approval of the terms of this agreement is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution which stipulates that &ldquo;the State shall not be bound by an International Agreement involving a charge upon public funds unless the terms of the Agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>An explanatory note has been prepared and circulated to Deputies.  It outlines the provisions of the agreement and covers the cost of Irish participation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Agreement on Jute and Jute Products, 1982, was concluded under the auspices of the United Nations <Col N="2794" /> Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) at the United Nations Conference on Jute and Jute Products held in Geneva in September 1982.  Sixty-two countries, representing six exporting countries and 56 importing countries, including Ireland, participated.  The agreement is open for signature at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1983 by Governments invited to the United Nations Conference on Jute and Jute Products.  The agreement was signed by the Community and member states on 6 June.</P>
    <P>After signing the agreement Governments may ratify, accept or approve it by the deposit of an instrument to this effect with the Secretary General of the United Nations.</P>
    <P>The agreement establishes the International Jute Organisation to administer the provisions of the agreement and to supervise its operations.  Members will be required to make an annual contribution to the administrative budget of the organisation. Because of the variables involved, it is not possible at this stage to assess accurately Ireland's contribution, but based on the experience of payments to other commodity agreements our annual contribution is estimated to be of the order of £2,000.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of the agreement are to improve structural conditions in the jute market, to enhance the competitiveness of jute and jute products, to improve the quality of such products for the benefit of importing and exporting countries and to develop production and exports and imports of jute and jute products so as to meet the requirements of world supply and demand.  These objectives will be met by means of projects of research and development, market promotion and cost reduction.  The financing of projects will take place through a special account which will be financed through international and regional financial institutions and voluntary contributions.  Such projects will be sponsored by the organisation for loan financing only where a member or members have voluntarily assumed full obligations and responsibility for such loans <Col N="2795" /> and no member shall be responsible by reason of its membership in the organisation for any liability arising from borrowing or lending by any other member in connection with projects.</P>
    <P>Ireland's main economic interest in jute relates to its use in the carpet industry. Our imports of jute yarn and jute products in 1982 amounted to 3,700 metric tonnes valued at £3 million, while our exports of carpets containing jute were valued at approximately £20 million.  The agreement is intended to improve the quality and stabilise the supply of an important raw material for this sector of Irish industry where approximately 2,000 people are employed.</P>
    <P>Membership of the International Agreement on Jute and Jute Products, 1982, will afford Ireland the opportunity to demonstrate its willingness to support international measures which help to improve the economic conditions of developing countries.  This reaffirmation of the importance which Ireland attaches to reducing the serious economic imbalance between developed and developing countries is in conformity with UNC-TAD's Integrated Programme for Commodities and is particularly opportune at the present time when Ireland is participating in the Sixth Session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in Belgrade.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the International Coffee Agreement, 1983, which has been laid before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dáil approval of the terms of this agreement is necessary in accordance with Article 29.5.2º of the Constitution which stipulates that &ldquo;the State shall not be bound by an International Agreement involving a charge upon public funds <Col N="2796" /> unless the terms of the agreement shall have been approved by Dáil Éireann&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>An explanatory note has been circulated to Deputies.  It outlines the provisions of the agreement and covers the cost of Irish participation.</P>
    <P>The International Coffee Agreement, 1983, was concluded at the 38th Session of the International Coffee Council held at the Headquarters of the International Coffee Organisation in London in September 1982.  It is open for signature at United Nations Headquarters until 30 June 1983 by parties to the International Coffee Agreement, 1976, and Governments invited to the negotiating sessions of the Council.  The agreement is scheduled to enter into force on 1 October 1983 and instruments of ratification, acceptance or approval, are required to be deposited with the Secretary General of the United Nations by that date.</P>
    <P>The International Coffee Agreement, 1983, which replaces the International Coffee Agreement, 1976, will remain in force for a period of six years and may be renegotiated or extended, with or without amendment for a further period.</P>
    <P>The main objectives of this agreement are to achieve a reasonable balance between world supply and demand for coffee, at prices fair to consumers and remunerative to producers, to avoid excessive fluctuations in world supplies, stocks and prices, which could be harmful to both producers and consumers and to promote and increase the consumption of coffee.</P>
    <P>For the purpose of achieving these objectives an export quota system will apply.  The quota will be shared between exporting members in relation to previous export performance and stocks held and will operate within a price range agreed each year by the council.  Imports from non-members of the agreement are limited to a certain level and members are urged to increase coffee consumption through removal of any obstacles such as tariffs.</P>
    <P>The agreement establishes the International Coffee Organisation to administer its provisions and supervise its operations. The organisation will function through the International Coffee <Col N="2797" /> Council, an executive board, an executive director and staff.</P>
    <P>The administrative expenses of the organisation in their operation of the agreement will be met by annual contributions by members.  At this stage, it is not possible to assess accurately Ireland's share of these costs, because of the variables involved, such as the number of countries likely to adhere to the agreement. However, based on experience of the existing agreement, Ireland's annual contribution is estimated to be of the order of £10,000.  Our imports of coffee amounted to £8 million in 1981 and £9.5 million in 1982.</P>
    <P>Membership of the International Coffee Agreement, 1983, will afford Ireland the opportunity to demonstrate its readiness to support international measures to stabilise primary commodity prices and to reaffirm the importance which we attach to giving effect to UNC-TAD's Integrated Programme for Commodities at a time when commodity issues are central to the discussions taking place in Belgrade at the Sixth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. It is in this spirit that I recommend the International Coffee Agreement, 1983, to the House.</P>

      <P>I want to make one or <Col N="2798" /> two brief comments on the reports.  The first is what has become unfortunately a fairly traditional opening to speeches on this motion.  It is such a long time since we have had a debate on the developments in the European Communities that perhaps those of us who are new Members like myself find it hard to remember when the last one took place.  This is happening in a situation where the Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities has met only rarely and fitfully in the past two years. That committee has not in any real sense operated during that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">

      <P>It met to elect a chairman. Deputy David Molony was elected chairman.  The report of that arrived in the last day or two, which shows how little impact it has made.  Even this debate is useful.  It is an important debate. Unfortunately it has been squeezed into the tail end of a very busy session and at the end of a particularly tiring and heavy day.  I would appeal to all of those who are interested in the work of the European Communities and Ireland's part in them to get the new committee going as quickly as possible and to ensure that the members of that committee have a chance after the recess to get stuck into the enormous backlog of work that has accumulated and also to chart its own course.  I know that had Deputy David Molony remained as chairman it would have had a very vigorous role to play.  I am sure the new chairman, whoever he or she is, will want it to play the important role it played in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The one point to which I want to address myself this evening may at first sight appear a trivial one.  In the overall context of this report on developments and in the context of the very full statement we had this afternoon on the Stuttgart Summit what I am going to say may appear to be almost incidental.  On the question of Stuttgart, in the history of European summits it probably will prove to have been of greater significance and greater importance in the long-term <Col N="2799" /> development of the Communities than most people so far appear to realise.  We are all familiar with the various landmark summits in the history of European integration. One could mention the Summit at Messina in the fifties after the failure of the European defence community and the European political community.  That summit led to much more realistic goals, led to achievable objectives and ultimately can be seen as being as important as the earlier developments in the establishment of the Community.  Again in the sixties after the retirement of De Gaulle the Hague Summit led to the opening up of the Community once again, to the moves which eventually led to our membership. Stuttgart may well be seen as of similar significance.  It showed that at least there is a will and an ability to compromise, that in spite of the pre-summit publicity, the claims, the propaganda, the various pieces of gamesmanship, that at least there is the ability and the willingness to come together so that the future dynamic, however slow it is at present, was not harmed, that there is the possibility of some sort of future development and that all countries did appear willing to make compromises and to submerge national interests in the interest of wider European development.</P>
    <P>In the context of Stuttgart the point I want to talk about may appear to be minor but it is of major importance in the way in which people here see the European Community and will see the Community over the coming year, because for most people who look at Europe over the next year it will be largely concerned with the European elections.  Nobody here can but be disappointed at the impact which the European Parliament has made on the public over the past four years and nobody can but be worried by the public perception of the Parliament and what it stands for and how it operates.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt whatever that the Parliament has failed to get across to the public the nature of its work, its overall role and its long-term role in the process of European integration.  The fear is that there will be a great deal of cynicism and apathy in next year's elections.  There is <Col N="2800" /> the likelihood that joke candidates will emerge and will attract a widespread following because people see the Parliament as not being a serious institution.  It may well be that the elections will be used by various protest groups in a mid-term period of government to get their point of view across to the detriment of the European Parliament and of the whole idea of Europe.  There is the danger that the original purpose of the Parliament will be lost sight of.</P>
    <P>The blame for this in part must lie squarely with the European Parliament itself.  The officials of the Parliament and those charged with publicising it have not shown sufficient imagination over these past four years.  I know it is difficult to get across to a largely uninterested public the nature of what is going on but I do not believe sufficient imagination has been used, especially given the large sums of money which are available for this purpose. The Parliament itself has not been sufficiently mobile.  That may seem a joke given that the Parliament moves from Strasbourg to Luxembourg every other month.  What I mean is that the Parliament has not brought itself close enough to the people in the various areas.  The exercise this week where officials and members of the Parliament are visiting various parts of the West of Ireland to explain to interested people what exactly the Parliament can do and that the Parliament has some understanding of the real problems of real people living in real parts of the community is a very valuable exercise.  It may be slightly late in the day that the Parliament is embarking on this exercise.  Perhaps it has been going on in the past but if so it has not made sufficient impact.  The impetus of the earlier publicity which attached itself to the Parliament has been lost.</P>
    <P>Much of the bad image which the Parliament has at present undoubtedly comes from defects in the Parliament itself, especially some of the needless and ostentatious spending by the Parliament and by some of its Members.  The plushness of style which seems to be associated with everything the Parliament does has done untold harm to the perception of the Parliament by ordinary people.  This <Col N="2801" /> is an image which alienates.  When people see parliamentarians overpaid, travelling and living at the highest level of luxury or appearing to do so, there is no doubt that a sense of alienation and of cynicism very quickly develops.</P>
    <P>The Parliament must be held responsible for some of this.  Perhaps not much of that is the fault of the Irish members of the Parliament.  We have a much more austere parliamentary style; we pay our parliamentarians far less and they have few, if any, privileges.  Unfortunately the Parliament seems to have looked around at the various parliamentary systems of Europe, plucked the privileges from the different systems and put them all together so that the end result is that the European Parliament is more luxurious and has more privileges and perks than probably all the other parliaments of the ten countries combined.  Unfortunately this sort of penchant for holding meetings of the Parliament at luxury resorts, the needless globe-trotting which so many members of the Parliament seem to indulge in, has been a major area of insensitivity.  Indeed the various scandals which have been highlighted attaching to money and other things around the Parliament over the years have all added to this image.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the leading officials in the Parliament, that most of the members of the Parliament, or many of the members, feel equally strongly about this and want to see this particular image changed; but it may be a little bit late in the day as far as the present Parliament is concerned to alter that.  The fault must lie fairly and squarely with the Parliament and some of its members because of the way in which it has operated, seemingly operated in a different stratosphere from the rest of Europe and the other Parliaments of Europe, seemingly insensitive to the reaction its lifestyle and perks have created.</P>
    <P>Apart altogether from the European Parliament, national parliaments and even we ourselves here have failed to make it more relevant.  We have failed in one specific way.  We have not provided any proper linkage between this Parliament and the European Parliament.  I <Col N="2802" /> know members of the various parties are full members of the respective parliamentary parties but that is not really enough. I put forward an idea a year ago which I think might be a move towards establishing more direct links between members of the European Parliament and this Parliament. That was that those members be given the right of audience in the Seanad and allowed to speak in the Seanad on matters relevant to Europe.  They would not have voting rights but they would at least be in some way part of this national Parliament and there would be some link between this House and the Parliament in Strasbourg.  This two-way process of communication would certainly improve matters.  It would ensure that when European matters were debated here or in the Seanad those most involved would be there to take part directly in the debates.</P>
    <P>I also think some of the bad image attaching to the Parliament must be laid at the feet of the media.  It is easy to go in for media bashing and I have no intention of doing so.  In general the political correspondents and reporters try to report in a fair and objective way.  Unfortunately the blame may well lie with members of the Parliament itself but much of the reporting of the Parliament has been severe.  It has been obsessed with the irregularities and the perks, with the high salaries.  Perhaps that makes good copy.  It does make good copy but it ignores the detailed hard relevant work the Parliament involves itself in.  If I were to single out one journalist who has tried to bring the work of the Parliament to a level where it can be comprehended and become real to the people I would name Mr. John Healy, not a journalist with whom I frequently find myself in agreement. However, more than any other journalist he has attempted to relate the European Parliament to the people of the west and the people of the cities and show that the problems the Parliament is tackling are the same problems writ larger which we are trying to tackle in this House, very often doing so with a sophistication and imagination that we do not manage here.  For all of these reasons the Parliament is not now nearly as important and has not the potential it <Col N="2803" /> had in 1979.  It has not used the last four years as well as it might have been used and the price for this may well be paid in apathy and derision.  For that reason I emphasise the point that Parliament may well pay the price and those who believe in European integration may find their case damaged through adverse negative publicity.</P>
    <P>On this issue there is one central point. That is the question of the dual mandate. It is to our discredit that we have not, with one exception, Deputy Collins, even begun to face up to the problem of the dual mandate.  Frankly, the operation of the dual mandate is making a nonsense of both institutions.  It was fair enough in the early days when everyone was finding his feet.  Members were finding their way around.  The elections were a novelty. We had to adapt and the Parliament had to find its own way of operating.  Now, with four years' experience behind us there is no longer any case for the dual mandate and action must be taken because the existence of the mandate seriously damages the credibility of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>If I might refer specifically, and not in any partisan sense because most of the people involved are friends of mine, to the way in which the Labour Party have used the dual mandate, we can see that this type of merry-go-round, of one moving in and one moving out, where the Parliamentary seats are used almost entirely for party convenience, is something which seriously damages the image of the European Parliament.  For example, if I were a Labour voter in Dublin and voted for Deputy Michael O'Leary or Deputy John O'Connell and then some time later found the people representing me were Deputy Cluskey and Deputy Horgan, and later again they were Senator Flor O'Mahony and Mr. Brendan Halligan, I would, I think, have some reason to wonder at the whole purpose or the whole question of what the European Parliament is all about.  I certainly could not regard it as being a particularly serious institution for the most part.  These have all been friends of mine and first rate members of the Parliament <Col N="2804" /> but nevertheless the people who were elected are, barring exceptions, the people who should fulfil the purpose for which they were elected, barring extreme situations, and for that and other reasons the dual mandate should be faced up to.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil, to their credit, did face up to this problem more realistically than have the other parties.  Perhaps the fact they were in Government at the time forced them to take this decision.  My party and the Labour Party at the time had the luxury of being in Opposition.  I hear there may well be a change in their position on this and Fianna Fáil may well, for reasons the party thinks good, revert to the practice of the other two parties. I hope they will not do so and I hope the other parties will face up to the problem of the dual mandate before some decision is forced on them.  If they do not do so they may be forced to take an unpalatable decision.</P>
    <P>One final question is the question of the electoral system.  It is an academic question so far as the next election is concerned.  We will have the system we had before.  It worked reasonably well, but I think the question must be raised as to whether or not the Euro constituencies are too large, whether the diffusion of effort by the individual members over such a large area does not provide the results which might ensue by changing to 15 single seat constituencies using the alternative vote.  I know that is not a runner for the coming election, but if in May or June of next year there is apathy and cynicism, if there is less of credibility and a low turn out, if the elections are used in large part as a protest movement, then we shall have to rethink our whole approach to the question of the European Parliament because any loss of standing, any loss of credit in the Parliament, will not be just a temporary setback.  It will affect all those who believe in the continuing process of European integration, all those who believe that Europe is more than just a business-like arrangement, a series of free trade agreements and common markets, that there is an idea implicit in the whole idea of European integration and that the Parliament at one level is the finest expression of this <Col N="2805" /> particular ideal.  With these words of warning, I conclude.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Manning for his, as usual, refreshing contribution.  I mention him first.  I also take this opportunity of thanking Deputy Collins for his, as usual, solid contribution.  To a great degree I share Deputy Manning's concern that the joint committee was not in operation during the last couple of years.  It has to be reconstituted after each election.  Unfortunately, the result is that this committee have not really been operating properly for the last couple of years.  I assure the Opposition spokesman that with solid, stable Government for the next four or five years the joint committee will be maintained in a fully operational condition over that period.</P>
      <P>Deputy Manning commented on the European Parliament.  It is right and proper that the apparent defects in the system should be pointed out, teased out and, if possible, remedies should be found therefor.  One should not be too hard on the European Parliament.  It is a relatively new institution.  After all, prior to 1979 we had nominated membership and after the last five years we are really only ending the first term of the elected European Parliament.  There are bound to be growing pains.  They have difficulties in many areas because of the set-up within the Community and tensions between the Commission, the Council and the Parliament.  The Parliament is trying to assert itself within the limits of the Treaties and many MEPs hope that these Treaties will be changed ultimately to give them a greater say in European affairs.  I suppose that is how parliaments develop.  Going back to history we can watch the situation between the Lords and Commons in our neighbouring island at one time when the same type of tension existed.  Through that dynamic tension things develop.  We cannot know now how the European Parliament will develop in the years ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the point that it is important that the Parliament be made relevant to the voters in the Community and, in the <Col N="2806" /> context of our country, to the Irish voters. They should understand its relevance and be able to relate to its activities.  In the Dáil we are accustomed to the Fourth Estate keeping its eye on us and reporting on activities here, and as a result the Irish people are kept very well informed of the happenings in this House.  But with the distance between here and Brussels, Luxembourg or Strasbourg, or wherever they happen to be sitting, we have not the same ease of communication, reporting and so on, and consequently not the same interest in the activities of the European Parliament.  I suppose with an improvement in communications in time to come this may also change.  At present I see as a factor that the public are not really very well informed of the happenings in the European Parliament.  This is a pity and I hope this area will be improved on in time to come.</P>
    <P>Deputy Manning mentioned the dual mandate.  Undoubtedly, this has been discussed by all of us a number of times in recent years.  The joint committee have been given a mandate to examine the question of dual membership and to report thereon to the Houses of the Oireachtas, and this will provide an opportunity for a detailed examination and investigation of the situation and for a report to this House, with presumably a discussion in due course on that report. If I recollect correctly, the first point raised by Deputy Collins when this matter was last before the House was in regard to the relevance of a debate and report that are out of date.  I agree very much with the comments made by Deputy Collins in this regard.  There is, of course, a reason and it is on somewhat the same lines as that pertaining to the question of the joint committee.  We were debating the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th reports.  I accept the point that, even though this may comply with the letter of the Act which requires reports to be made before the House and debated, it does not comply with the spirit.  The idea at the time was that we would have a report to this House every six months which would give an opportunity to Deputies on all sides to discuss what had been happening in the previous six <Col N="2807" /> months in the EEC and in that way to make their contributions.</P>
    <P>I am not sure how best we can respond to the difficulty raised by Deputy Collins. Probably the best way would be stable and secure Government over the coming years which would permit us at regular intervals to debate the reports as envisaged in the original European Communities Act, 1972.  At the same time, despite the problem, Deputy Collins, Deputy Manning and, I hope, I myself tried to make the debate relevant and up-to-date and to discuss the developments in the Community right up to the present, to some extent projecting the situation into the future.  However, I think the more satisfactory solution for the future would be to try as far as possible to ensure that we have the debates at the six-monthly intervals when the reports are laid before the House.</P>
    <P>When I introduced this debate in April I argued that the Community needed a qualitative move forward if it was to be fully relevant and responsive to the changing needs of Europe in 1983 and beyond.  I mentioned that major negotiations would be taking place in the Community on the provision of new own resources, on a definitive resolution of the British budgetary problem and on the development of existing and new Community policies.  Earlier today we had the report from the Taoiseach on the European Council in Stuttgart and essentially that Council marks the beginning of these processes.  That Council was, to take words from the communique, &ldquo;to mark the re-launch of the European Community&rdquo;. I hope that the words of the communique will be found to be absolutely true in the months and years ahead.</P>
    <P>We must be very frank about the situation. Deputy Collins in the benches across the Chamber will know from his attendance at the Foreign Affairs Councils in Brussels and Luxembourg the developments at that time.  We are at an institutional and in particular a financial crossroads in the Community.  The word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is very often used in Europe and to some extent it is a word that can be abused, but the Community is in a position <Col N="2808" /> where there may not be adequate funds to meet ongoing policy commitments.</P>
    <P>That is what gave the European council its sense of urgency and acuteness.  If the political leaders had failed to reach agreement on guidelines for the future the position would have been serious in an unprecedented way.  The implications for Ireland, given the benefits that flow to us from the Community budget, would have been particularly worrying.  There is no need for me to stress that point because I am sure all Members are aware how important the Community is to us.  We have made our sacrifices in the context of our jobs lost through free trade, and to some extent this is compensated for by the net benefits we now get from the Community in fiscal terms.  It would be disastrous, having made the sacrifices necessary to join the Community, if we found ourselves in the situation that the Community was not continuing the policies, particularly the Common Agricultural Policy, out of which we gain. Membership of the Community is a matter of balance of advantage &mdash; we lose in one way and gain in another.</P>
    <P>The Stuttgart agreement is but the first step, however significant, on the road to relaunching and redirecting the Community. Over the coming months all Governments, and the Commission, will be engaged in intensive discussions not only on the financing and budgetary questions but on our future objectives as a Community and the policies and mechanisms that are going to achieve these objectives.  Those discussions will be of crucial central importance for the country. Deputies can be assured, as in the past, that the Government will seek to protect fully our national interests and that balance of advantage and disadvantage on which our decision to join the Community was based.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins asked a question about the farm price increases for the current year.  The situation did look decidedly unhealthy but in the meantime we can take satisfaction from the fact that the package agreed by Ministers for Agriculture on 17 May represented an average increase of 8.2 per cent in Irish farm <Col N="2809" /> support prices.  In addition, we had the subsequent devaluation of the Green pound which increased the average rise to 9.5 per cent.  Moreover, other special measures were agreed for the country which it is estimated will result in a direct benefit to the Irish farm sector of £255 million in a full year.  My colleague, Deputy Deasy, has rightly received warm and widespread praise for his skilful handling of those difficult and sensitive negotiations and I should like to take the opportunity of expressing my appreciation for the work he did.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also spoke about the realignment of the Irish punt within the EMS.  We had statements to the House from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on that matter.  Surely it would have been foolish on our part not to have sought to correct the unwarranted and unsought appreciation of the exchange rate of the punt, particularly against sterling. Our objective was to re-establish as far as possible the relationship with sterling that existed last year before the rise took place and thus to remove a barrier to maintaining employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also mentioned the Genscher-Colombo initiative or what has now developed into the Solemn Declaration on European Union.  The question he put was one that had caused some concern to many people.  The Deputy wanted clarification of the language on security in the Genscher-Colombo initiative. I am glad to say that the Solemn Declaration on European Union was signed in Stuttgart last week by the Taoiseach on behalf of Ireland.  It covers the consultation and co-ordination between member states on the political and economic aspects of security.  The co-operation and consultation fall explicitly within the framework of foreign policy co-operation. They relate essentially to the diplomatic activities of the Ten in regard to security related issues arising in fora where the Ten are present as such &mdash; for example, in the CSCE or at the United Nations.  The economic aspects of security mentioned in the text relate to issues such as the security of supply of raw materials and questions relating to East-West trade.  Issues relating to defence or <Col N="2810" /> military operations are outside the scope of the solemn declaration.  Indeed, as Deputy Collins is aware, in the course of the negotiations a provision which might have permitted discussions involving meetings of Defence Ministers was deleted.  I am glad to have the opportunity to put Deputy Collins' mind at rest on this issue, but he was right to raise it.</P>
    <P>The question of Poland was raised by Deputy Collins also.  I am sure Members on all sides share the Government's hope that the visit of His Holiness, the Pope, to Poland will be a step towards national reconciliation, taking full account of the aspirations of the Polish people which the recent meeting of the European Council identified as the only solution to the Polish crisis.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins referred to Turkey.  It is appropriate that in this democratic institution we should express our views on a situation in which similar institutions do not exist in Turkey.  As a result of a <i>coup d&lsquo;état</i> parliamentarians there cannot meet like us.  Political activity is not permitted and up to recently all political parties had been dissolved and could not operate in a normal way.  That matter was discussed in the institutions of the European Community.  I am also aware that at meetings of the Council of Europe this question was raised consistently.  Resolutions were passed there and at the last ministerial meeting of that body which I attended the matter was raised again. The importance of having the issues raised at a Council of Europe meeting is the fact that Turkey is a member of that council.  It was refreshing to have the Foreign Minister of Turkey in attendance at that meeting and giving a full account of the situation there, but more important he gave an account of the steps being taken to restore democracy in his country. He spoke about elections to be held about November, but I gather that there may be some slight delay in that and they may be put back to the spring.</P>
    <P>He also mentioned the other steps which were being taken from the point of view of normalisation of political activity there.  In some ways it shows the relevance of these international institutions that countries will not ignore them or, if <Col N="2811" /> they ignore them for a short period, will not continue to do so.  I have no doubt that the pressure on Turkey from the various international institutions is a major push towards forcing them back on the road to democracy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said he hoped that the military Government's promise of free elections would be kept.  I can state quite freely that it is a hope I share.  In the international institutions, in the Council of Europe and in the EEC, whatever reasoned voice we can raise towards encouraging and cajoling Turkey back on the road to democracy we will certainly raise it there.</P>
    <P>Another issue raised by Deputy Collins was the question of Central America. More and more in recent times we have become concerned about the difficulties in Central America.  I share the concern expressed by Deputy Collins about the difficulties lying in the way of a solution to the problems in Central America. Some years ago, it was only El Salvador which was beginning to be discussed in this country.  In fact, all the states in that area are now becoming household names here.  I am sure if we asked five years ago about the political situation in Guatemala we would hardly get a handful of people here who would be able to tell us where Guatemala was.  Now, virtually every country in that region is under discussion and is reported on.</P>
    <P>We are all concerned about the developments there.  For our part we remain committed to the achievement of three main objectives in regard to the Central American situation.  First, the furtherance of respect for human rights, second, the promotion of essential social and economic forms and third, support for the creation of the necessary political and diplomatic basis for a peaceful settlement to conflict and tension in the area.  These points were fully reflected in the statement on Central America which the European Council issued at the conclusion of their recent meeting at Stuttgart.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier, the coming months will be decisive for the future of the Community. In recent years there has been considerable dissatisfaction, even disillusionment <Col N="2812" /> in some cases, with the impact and effectiveness of the Community. Vital policies on employment and on the development of small and medium-sized industries were either missing or were ineffective.  Since they joined, two of the four new members have, to a greater or lesser degree, tried to renegotiate the terms of their membership. Moreover, Greenland, who joined on the strength of Danish membership is leaving the Community.  We urgently need to provide the means, financial and otherwise, to implement pressing and widely demanded policies. Only in this way can the Community become more relevant and central to public opinion in all the member countries. If this does not happen quickly, the whole Community ideal and achievement will be brought into disrepute.  Time is not on our side, regarding what is at stake over the coming months.  We must not fail, and on the basis of the positive outcome of Stuttgart I have every reason to believe that we will not fail.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a chur in iúl duit agus don Cheann Comhairle as ucht an seans a thabhairt dom an cheist fíorthábhachtach seo a phlé sa Dáil.  Chuir na fógraí maidir le hardú praghsanna artola a ritheadh sna nuachtáin i rith na seachtaine díoma mhór ar an phobal uilig, agus tá mé ag iarraidh ar an Aire cur i gcoinne na harduithe seo agus a insint do na comhlachtaí artola nach bhfuil sé sásta na harduithe a chur i bhfeidhm.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to take the opportunity of thanking the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the question which is exercising the minds of most people for the <Col N="2813" /> last few days.  It is the question which has been raised in the public press concerning proposed price increases and the applications made to the NPC for further increases in petrol prices.  The purpose of raising this matter tonight is because the public are flabbergasted at this recent announcement in the media.  I wish to exhort the Minister, and through him, the Government to put a stay on the rising cost of petrol to the consumer.  It has reached the limit as far as we are concerned and the consumer can no longer bear any further burden.</P>
    <P>The general public have been shocked at the announcement of the application to the NPC for a further increase in the price of petrol.  The stop-go attitude of the Government in relation to the price of petrol is incredible and does not show any pricing policy or any official strategy of the Government in this regard whatsoever. The public are totally confused with the misleading statements emanating from the Government in the recent past concerning petrol costs.</P>
    <P>On one occasion in the recent past we had a major exposé from the Minister for Industry and Energy promising continuous reductions in the price of petrol to the consumer.  We now see that these cannot materialise.  We have the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism telling us that price increases are being sought by the petroleum companies.  As we know, the inevitable result of these applications to the NPC will be an application before the Government and the announcement of the increase.  The timing of it will be, as is always the case with this Government, at a suitable time for their purposes, more than likely when the House has risen and they do not have to suffer the inevitable flak coming from this side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I see I am stirring Deputy Manning.  No doubt, he is feeling the pinch because he is one of the great antagonists towards his Government so far as this price structuring is concerned. There is absolutely no justification for the proposed increases being sought <Col N="2814" /> through the NPC at this time.  I am asking the Minister, pending the receipt of the report from the committee of investigation which he has set up to inquire into oil prices generally, that he should suspend a decision on the application made by the oil companies.  That would be the least that could be expected of him, seeing that we have had such conflicting statements from various Ministers.  It is obvious that there is no cohesion or co-operation between the various Departments of State and that one Minister is not aware of what the other is doing.  The Minister of State might remind the various Ministers involved that they are at variance with their public statements. Until such time as the Minister for Industry and Energy's committee reports they should suspend any move on the application currently before the national Prices Commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The public are quite satisfied that they are being ripped off.  Consumer resistance is evidence of that fact already.  That must be borne in mind by the Minister in considering this new application.  Any further increase will have a detrimental effect on the whole of our economy, on our competitiveness, the tourism and agricultural industries and industrial relations.  Indeed, all household budgets will suffer as a result of this new attack on petrol prices.  As we are all aware this catches everyone; it is a tax that takes no notice of one's ability to pay and no notice of the hardship it might cause industry or the individual. So far as our competitiveness is concerned we contend it is not a suitable time, nor from the point of view of household budgets, to have a further imposition by way of petrol price increase.  Talk of price increases makes nonsense of the Government's recent harping on price competitiveness in industry.  How can industry currently struggling to maintain their market share hope to stay in business if their unit costs of production escalate further?  To allow a petrol price increase at present would condemn thousands of people to the dole queues.  Further it will close hundreds of factory doors, creating misery not just for the workers but also <Col N="2815" /> for employers.  It makes nonsense also of the efforts of the Government at this time in so far as industrial relations and conducting wage negotiations with various bodies are concerned.  How can one expect any trade union worth its salt to impress on its members the need to show restraint in so far as wage structures are concerned when on the other hand the Government themselves accept the inevitability of further price increases in petrol?</P>
    <P>We all know that petrol is a commodity that affects every single person, body and company because inexorably it adds to the transport costs of the production line. As we are also aware, energy costs are fundamental to all manufacturing industry. If this latest price increase takes place it will have a very serious impact on manufacturing industry, not to talk about the individual consumer or hard-pressed motorist who suffers every single time the Government wish to raise some extra revenue.  We pay the highest price in Europe for petrol.  I believe that on average it would work out something of the order of 31 per cent higher than the average European rate.  Government action is urgently required to protect our overtaxed motorist who carries more than his fair share of general taxation. We must bear in mind the comparisons, that one can still buy a gallon of best premium grade petrol in the United Kingdom for £1.84, in the Netherlands for £2.07, even in France it can be bought for £2.27 and cheaper again in Italy.  But we must head the league in this matter. There is something basically wrong with the whole pricing structure that that should be the case.  How difficult it must make life for everybody concerned with regard to productivity, wage levels, unit costs of production, to maintain any level of competitiveness if they are to have this continuing imposition placed on them by way of increased energy costs.</P>
    <P>We are already experiencing the most difficult tourist season ever.  To further penalise what must be regarded as an export industry by way of a petrol price increase at this time is nothing short of sabotaging that tourist industry.  We must <Col N="2816" /> remember that we have now reached the stage of diminishing returns.  It would appear that the Government do not appreciate that fact.  As I understand it, in April and May this year petrol sales dropped nationally by up to 20 per cent. What do we get by way of exchange to try to entice the already hard-pressed motorist to increase his purchases of petrol: we get the new syndrome called the offer situation at the petrol stations. Companies are engaging in promotions in an effort to outdo one another on sales. One might well ask: at what cost?  We have now the 40p tin of coke if one buys £10 worth of the particular flavour of juice.  There is also the cutlery offer if one buys £120 worth over a period.  We have the newest entry into the stakes, the digital watch which I understand is being promoted by a company called Maxol if one purchases £100 worth of their particular fluid.  It is estimated that the retail price of this digital watch is approximately £28.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Not bad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am concerned, that is 28 per cent on the £100 worth of petrol.  When companies can justify an application to the National Prices Commission for a price increase of 7p &mdash; which I presume would work out at approximately 2 per cent to 2½ per cent on the retail price at the pump &mdash; and at the same time can turn around and offer a £28 digital watch to the consumer if he purchases £100 of their brand of petrol, then surely it is about time the motorist reaped the benefit of all these reductions the companies are able to afford?  They can buy one million watches to give out to consumers if they can entice them to purchase their brand of petrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The time for gimmicks at the petrol service stations and pumps are over.  The consumer should receive the full benefit of all that loose money obviously available and being expended in a campaign to do down one's competitor.  Of course there are other kinds of things on sale at the petrol pumps as well which shall be nameless at this time.  It would be interesting if the Minister this evening could <Col N="2817" /> quantify in cash terms the amount of money he knows is being expended on these gimmicky offers at petrol pumps, if he took some cognisance of what is going on at the petrol pumps and service stations in the race for increased sales among companies.  He might bring to their notice that, rather than have a gimmicky sales offer at the pump, they might give the reduction to the consumer in the basic product they sell.  These kinds of offers confuse the consumer totally. Nobody accepts, because of these offers, that the companies are hard up or that they are losing enormous sums of money.</P>
    <P>On the one hand we have a situation of diminishing returns while, on the other an enormous number of retail petrol stations have gone out of business in the recent past.  For example, in 1970, there were 4,772 petrol retail outlets in this country.  In 1983 it is estimated that there are 3,874.  Whether we like to admit it or not that must mean an enormous number of job losses as well, not to mention the situation obtaining in the Border counties.</P>

      <P>According to our clock, not a digital, the Deputy has five minutes remaining.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite sure you have it right anyway.  There is an enormous loss of revenue in the Border counties because of these prices.  It is calculated that about half the amount of money paid for petrol in the Border counties, estimated at £50 million, is being lost to the Exchequer because of Government action in this respect.</P>
      <P>The tourist industry must be singled out for special attention.  How can the Minister, as Minister for Tourism as well, suggest to the people of this House that he will allow promotional operations to carry on right around the world, that he will himself get involved in promotional activities on behalf of our tourist trade and, at the same time, penalise the very industry he is promoting by making it virtually impossible now for the motoring tourist to come here and have a reasonably-costed holiday?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The world trends in crude during the <Col N="2818" /> past two years have been downward. North sea oil and African crude have been reduced by up to 25 per cent.  The price of a barrel of oil in that period has gone from $39.25 to less than $30 but we never seem to get the benefit of these reductions.  Earlier this year the Minister of State, Deputy Collins, had the gall to say that he would be asking the oil distributing companies to put their act together.  I should like to know what he has done about the matter.  He also understood that the increases were causing frustration.  Imagine that statement from the Minister responsible to the consumers of this country &mdash; that oil prices were causing frustration &mdash; when he knows full well it is causing much more than frustration.  It is putting thousands of jobs on the line and it is bringing us to a situation where we are not just the most highly priced country in the world so far as petrol is concerned but we are fast becoming the most expensive country on any score in which to live.</P>
    <P>In the past few days the question of the possible decontrol of petrol prices was raised.  The Minister indicated he was not considering the decontrol of petrol prices here.  I expect him to reiterate that commitment this evening, to put the minds of people in the west of Ireland at ease that a two-tier pricing structure will not apply in this country.  I hope the good socialist Minister will indicate that he is favourably disposed to maintaining the same price for petrol in Binghamstown as in Palmerstown.</P>
    <P>It is about time the Minister and his colleagues lifted the veil of secrecy off oil supplies and oil suppliers, the multinational subsidiaries and the contracting procedures that apply in sending oil to this country.  We would like to know what the world price situation means in Irish terms.  We would like to know about the better arrangements the Minister has in mind with regard to continuing contractual agreements with suppliers throughout the world.  We would like to know about the sources of supply for the next contracting period.  We also wish to know what the Minister intends doing about building up storage capacity in this country so that we could have a floor price on <Col N="2819" /> a long-term basis.  Is the Minister prepared to make financial arrangements for the forward purchasing of dollars so that an even balance can be maintained throughout the whole financial year?  We would like to know if the Government have renegotiated any of their Saudi contracts and what impact they will have. We would like to know when we will get the benefit from the reduction ex Whitegate refinery and when we will get the benefit of the spot market at Rotterdam. We are told daily in the media that there is a reduction in the price of crude and that it should be reflected in the price at the pumps.  The Minister has not given us any of this information.</P>
    <P>I wish to impress on the Minister the need for a clear-cut statement that he rejects out of hand the present application by the oil companies to the NPC. We want an assurance that he will not allow them to have an increase of the nature they are talking about until the results of the full investigation is put before the public.</P>

      <P>I did not anticipate the debate starting earlier than 10.30 p.m.  I wish to assure the Deputy that no discourtesy was intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flynn raised a number of issues, particularly in the final portion of his speech, regarding contracts for the supply of oil, storage and so on but these matters are not appropriate to my Department.  The only function that my Department and I, as Minister, have with regard to oil is to have any application for an increase examined by the National Prices Commission and to make a decision on that.  The other matters raised are appropriate to the Department of Industry and Energy.  I am sure Deputy Flynn <Col N="2820" /> will appreciate that, as will his colleague who was in that Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What about the forward buying of dollars?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I will talk about that later.  As the House may appreciate, in accordance with section 25 of the Prices Act, 1958, all particulars of price increase applications on hands must be treated as confidential and I am precluded from commenting directly on whether oil price increase applications have been lodged with the National Prices Commission. The House will appreciate that the 1958 Act specifically states that any application for a price increase must be kept confidential.  The reason for that is that if one company makes an application and the other companies become aware of that there could be a rush of applications for price increases that might not be justified. However, within those constraints I will endeavour to be as explicit as possible.</P>
      <P>There have been newspaper reports recently of price increase applications by a number of oil companies.  If these applications have been lodged they will, I assume, be examined in the usual way by the National Prices Commission and the commission will make their recommendation to me in due course. Under current arrangements oil companies are required to give two months notice of their proposals to increase prices.  Therefore, at this stage newspaper comments on the extent or timing of oil price increases are largely speculative and I do not propose to comment on them at present.</P>
      <P>It might be helpful if I said a few words of a general nature about some of the international trends which have been emerging in recent times which reflect themselves on the Irish market.  I refer specifically to the fluctuations in the exchange rate, particularly between the dollar and our currency.  As Deputies are aware, the price of oil is quoted in dollar terms and what happens in relation to the exchange rate between the dollar and the punt has a direct bearing on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The US dollar is the currency in which <Col N="2821" /> oil is traded in internationally.  At the beginning of 1983 the IR£-US$ exchange rate was around IR£ = $1.39.  By 1 April, 1983 &mdash; the occasion of the last oil price review here &mdash; the rate had fallen to IR£ = $1.31 and this is the rate at which the oil companies are at present compensated for in their prices.  In recent weeks the punt in dollar terms has declined to a level below $1.22 but has since made some recovery to a level of $1.25.  However, the overall currency movement involved obviously means that no matter what price control system exists it now costs more, for currency reasons, to import oil products into Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is because of the Government's devaluation policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The prices quoted on the Rotterdam spot market are a relevant factor in the price of oil traded in Ireland.  In the early part of the year these prices were relatively low, reflecting the anticipation of a fall in official selling prices of crude oil.  Since the crude oil price reductions in March 1983, however, prices on the Rotterdam market have been steadily increasing.  This clearly has an impact on the product costs of the importing companies.</P>
      <P>Needless to say, of course, we are not alone in Europe in feeling the results of these trends.  Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, for example, are much more dependent on the Rotterdam spot market for their prices than we are, and the recent rise in spot prices has resulted in sharp rises at retail level in these markets.</P>
      <P>In addition, most other European currencies, except sterling and perhaps the Deutschemark, have declined against the dollar in recent weeks, again leading to retail price increases.  Thus since the beginning of this month, Belgian petrol prices have risen by around 3½p per gallon, those in Germany by about 5p per gallon, and those in Italy by about 6p per gallon.  The EEC average increased in the same period by approximately 2½p per gallon.  The Irish price, on the other hand, has remained static.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a great deal of comment <Col N="2822" /> and speculation regarding the price of oil and particularly the price of petrol. Unfortunately, a lot of that comment has been ill-informed.  Many of the quotations were based on an EEC publication which showed that these commentators were not comparing like with like and if they tried to do so they would come out with a distorted view.</P>
    <P>I hold no brief, and never did, for the oil companies whether international or domestic, but I have a responsibility under the existing law to ensure that fairness prevails.  My interest is in the consumer and the protection of the consumer, and to the best of my ability I will ensure that those interests are protected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister going to stop the gimmicky price war at the pumps?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>All I can do under the existing law, and I want to emphasise this, is to set a maximum price.  If people want to sell below that price they are at liberty to do so.  I cannot interfere with that practice.  Because there has been so much ill-informed comment over the last few months, and because there has been an expectation that a reduction in oil and petrol prices was just around the corner, I thought it desirable to ask the National Prices Commission to carry out an indepth study into the price of oil and particularly the price of petrol.  I did not fuel any expectations and I sincerely hope it will be possible to make a reduction in oil prices.  Naturally in my position I fervently hope it will not be necessary to increase oil and petrol prices but the only undertaking I can give the House &mdash; and I am talking within the constraints of the 1958 Act which precludes me from acknowledging whether any application has been made to increase prices &mdash; is this: any application which may be made will be thoroughly examined and will have to be justified 100 per cent before any increase is given.</P>

I asked the National Prices Commission to look not only at the whole pricing mechanism but to see if it was beneficial to continue exercising control over the price of oil and petrol.  All the relevant factors will be examined to ensure equity prevails.  I give this undertaking: it is not my intention to see people penalised because of their geographic location.</P>

      <P>I am saying it would not be my intention to do so.  I said that before and I am saying it again.  I have no plans at this time to decontrol the price of petrol, but as I have an obligation to examine any recommendation which comes to me from the appropriate body, the National Prices Commission, I will give all aspects a full examination.  A major factor in my examination of their <Col N="2824" /> recommendations would be to ensure that people would not be penalised because of their geographic location.</P>
      <P>I am glad this issue was raised and I hope it has cleared the air to some extent. If there is an application under consideration at the moment, or if an application comes under consideration in the near future, the normal approach will be made to it and the normal criteria will apply.  I have asked as a matter of urgency for a full investigation by the National Prices Commission into the present situation so that we can be assured of all the facts which are relevant to the pricing of oil and petrol here.</P>

      <P>A borrower who is experiencing genuine difficulties in meeting the repayments on a local authority housing loan is treated sympathetically by the authority. Every effort is made to come to an arrangement with the borrower which minimises hardship and avoids repossession of the house by the authority.</P>
      <P>Repayment of loans under the Housing Finance Agency scheme is income-related, being normally 18 per cent of a borrower's income in the previous tax year.  The scheme includes a provision that a borrower whose income falls during the year can, by arrangement with the local authority, have his repayments reduced and the shortfall made good later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Repossession of houses the subject of a loan from a local authority or through the Housing Finance Agency is rare and takes place only as a last resort.  In the <Col N="2633" /> circumstances, I do not consider that any further action on my part is necessary.</P>

      <P>I have no information to suggest that the five main building societies are pursuing legal action for recovery of possession on the scale suggested in the Deputy's question.  On the contrary my information is that, in the event of borrowers being faced with hardship in making mortgage repayments, the societies deal sympathetically with individual deserving cases and make whatever arrangements are possible to alleviate any difficulties a borrower may have.  In the circumstances I do not consider that any action in the matter by me is necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In general, the policies and programmes of my Department in relation to the Dublin inner city area take the form of providing financial and other support for the development of the activities and programmes of Dublin Corporation in relation to the area.  An exception to this is the Dublin Inner City Group, which is under the aegis of my Department and which provides directly financial assistance for various projects of an educational, social, economic, recreational or environment nature.  Since the beginning of 1982, a total of £266,064 has been allocated by way of grant for various projects in the north inner city area and £173,630 has been paid in respect of these allocations.  The capital allocation of £62,500,000 which has been made available to Dublin Corporation to finance their overall local authority housing construction programme in 1983 contains an adequate amount to finance the corporation's housing programme in the north inner city area.  Since 1974, 527 new dwellings have been provided in the area, a total of 333 are in course of erection and a further 324 will commence this year.  In addition, a further 281 houses are in planning and 116 sites are being acquired.</P>
      <P>The Catholic Housing Aid Society is currently constructing 21 flats for the accommodation of the elderly at Berkeley Street.  This development is estimated to cost £602,500 and a loan of £570,000 will be provided by Dublin Corporation. On 16 February 1983, I sanctioned the borrowing by the corporation of £250,000 from the Local Loans Fund for the purpose of providing loan assistance for the development in the current year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Environment improvement schemes provide temporary employment opportunities mainly for young people.  A total of £5.674 million is available to Dublin Corporation for these schemes this year. This will enable the corporation to retain in employment during the year 110 workers who have been employed on <Col N="2636" /> environment works since 1979, and also to provide temporary employment for some 700 young people.  The scheme is funded by the Youth Employment Agency and my Department, and many of the participants come from the inner city area.</P>
    <P>Traffic congestion adds to the difficulties of the inner city areas and to alleviate this, support for the provision of an inner tangent ring road is being provided.  The section of the road north of the River Liffey will be routed through Summerhill, Parnell Street and North King Street.  A compulsory purchase order for the acquisition of properties in the Parnell Street area was confirmed in 1980. Road grants totalling £550,000 (including £300,000 in the current year) have been allocated for this section of the road and the finance has been used mainly for property acquisition.  Outline plans of the Parnell Street section are awaited from the corporation but it is understood that CPOs will be necessary for property acquisition in the two other sections involved, Summerhill and North King Street.</P>
    <P>Dublin Corporation is also pursuing a programme for the provision of multi-storey car parks in the city centre in conjunction with private developers.  One such development, at the ILAC centre, has been in operation for some time. Construction work on a similar project, for a 500 space multi-storey car park at Waterford Street, commenced in March 1983, and is expected to be completed by the autumn of 1984.  These developments are important both to the physical redevelopment of the inner city and to traffic management.  The provision of sufficient spaces for short-term parking is vital to the business and social life of the city centre.  Measures designed to secure the availability of such parking space include the provision of extra meter parking spaces, proposed increase in parking meter fees so as to achieve better availability of meter spaces and traffic management measures to assist the operation of the bus service.</P>
    <P>The action to be taken concerning the future development of the Port and Docks Board site alongside the Custom <Col N="2637" /> House and the other matters covered by the Urban Development Areas Bill and the Dublin Inner City Development Authority Bill, 1982, is under review.</P>

      <P>The policies of primary concern to me relate to promotion of industrial development with a view to employment creation.</P>
      <P>In 1979 the Industrial Development Authority launched a specific inner city development programme under which a total of £6.1 million has been expended to date on site acquisition and factory construction.  Since the programme's launch, 45,000 sq. ft. of industrial space has been let to promoters and 155,000 sq. ft. is still available at East Wall and Prussia Street.  The Authority is vigorously promoting these facilities and the full range of incentives including capital and training grants and rent subsidies are available to suitable industrial projects locating there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Negotiations have taken place between <Col N="2638" /> the IDA and Dublin Corporation concerning the acquisition and development of a site in the Seán McDermott Street area.  However, no agreement has, as yet, been reached on the terms of purchase or the most appropriate site.</P>
    <P>Since 1979 the IDA has approved grant assistance for companies in the inner city, both north and south, which are expected to provide additional employment for approximately 4,400 people.  It is not possible to provide, at short notice, details of the amounts paid to those companies located in the north inner city and I will communicate with the Deputy when the details are available.</P>
    <P>With effect from 1 January 1983 the Dublin inner city area has been given designated status.  This empowers the IDA to give up to 60 per cent grants for projects locating in the area &mdash; the normal maximum grant is 45 per cent.  This measure will last for five years and will cost in the region of an extra £4.5 million.</P>

      <i>AnCO</i>
    </P>
    <P>AnCO are heavily involved in provision of training in the north inner city area and operate a policy of allocating as many as possible of their training places in the area to trainees from the inner city.</P>
    <P>The AnCO Centre City Training Centre at Jervis Street expects to train 689 persons in 1983 at a cost of £0.96 million.  Currently it has a total of 228 training places (144 adult places and 84 apprentice places) &mdash; 40 per cent of which are held by trainees from the inner city.</P>
    <P>The centre also operates special workshops in the inner city.  In the north inner city, 500 local people are expected to be catered for in 1983 on workshop courses at the cost of £0.84 million.  The special workshops currently involve some 168 training places in the north inner city and it is AnCO's experience that almost all the trainees are from the area.</P>
    <P>In addition, AnCO are running two community youth training projects in the <Col N="2643" /> north inner city catering for 15 trainees. One is the training of youth leaders for the Dublin Parks Tennis League.  The other is the renovation of St. Francis Xavier Boys' Club in Sherrard Street.  Two further projects have been approved for the area and are expected to start shortly. One involves painting and decorating the Irish Federation of Women's Clubs' premises in Phibsboro and the other the renovation of St. Saviour's Youth Club in Dominick Street.  Between them, some 20 young persons will be trained in these projects.  The 1983 budget for these four community youth training projects is £0.2 million.  There are, however, at least six more project proposals for the area which are being considered at present.  AnCO also channel inner city trainees to suitable programmes run from their other Dublin centres or by the External Training Division. There are no data available, however, on the numbers of trainees on other programmes who come from the inner city area.</P>

At present, the Manpower Service is concentrating on helping unemployed persons, that is, those on the Live Register and first time job seekers, to find employment, training and work experience. Three placement officers deal specifically with the north inner city area and, in addition to their contacts with employers and job seekers, they have regular contact with the various State and voluntary agencies operating there and provide them with every possible assistance.</P>
    <P>

There are 30 young people from the north inner city at present participating in the programme.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Employment Incentive Scheme administered by the Department of Labour.</i>
    </P>

      <P>My Department are not currently pursuing any actions or policies of the kind mentioned by the Deputy.  Two transport projects will, however, have some impact on the inner city, for example, the electrification of the Howth-Bray railway line which will come into full operation in 1984 and the CIE bus replacement programme which was <Col N="2647" /> introduced in 1981.  Both lead to improvements in rail and road access to and from the city centre.  The total cost of the electrification amounts to £115 million approximately and this year £36 million has been allocated for that project. So far nearly £70 million has been allocated to the renewal of CIE's bus fleet including £16 million this year for road passenger projects.</P>

      <P>However, the following specific undertakings are under way, designed to improve the delivery of health care in the area and to meet ascertained needs for particular services.</P>
      <P>1.  The Eastern Health Board has made a further £100,000 available in the current year towards the cost of extending the day nursery for pre-school children at Mountjoy Square to cater for an extra 25 children.  The board has also increased its allocation to the Family Resource Centre at North William Street to £100,000 in 1983 to enable it to continue to provide support services for families in need in the local community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.  A project team representative of my Department and the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, has been considering the development of that hospital with particular emphasis on the development of out-patient and casualty facilities.  A planning brief for these facilities has now been completed and will be forwarded to me shortly for approval.  The cost of the initial development is estimated at £2.5 million and would probably require a further <Col N="2656" /> two years of planning before construction could commence.</P>

      <P>Applications for assistance in the circumstances referred to may be dealt with under the provision in the supplementary welfare allowances scheme enabling a health board to make a single payment to meet an exceptional need. Payments of this nature may be made in a wide variety of circumstances, each case is assessed on its merits and no maximum or minimum payments are prescribed. <Col N="2660" /> Cases of this type are dealt with sympathetically in all health board areas.</P>
      <P>No formal arrangements exist between health boards and voluntary organisations whereby deposits paid by those organisations are recouped by the health boards although this practice occurs from time to time in some cases.  If the practice proves satisfactory in solving a difficulty in particular instances there would be no objection to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance of £28.00 a week being the maximum rate in his case £40.25 less weekly means of £12.25 derived from the income from his farm calculated on a notional basis related to his PLV.  He appealed against the amount of means assessed in his case and an appeals officer confirmed the amount assessed on the notional basis up to 9 December 1982 and assessed him with means of £30.00 a week from 10 December 1982 calculated on a factual basis.  This entitled him to unemployment assistance of £27.95 from that date, a reduction of 5p a week.</P>
      <P>Factual assessment in the case of farmers is carried out on an income/ expenditure basis for unemployment assistance purposes, taking into account all farm income and also all expenditure incurred in running the farm.  On the income side, all income derived from the farm is taken into account including the sale of stock, crops and other farm products such as milk.</P>
      <P>Account is also taken of farm produce consumed by the family and of other means such as grants, capital or any off-farm income.  On the expenditure side all expenses incurred in earning the income are taken into account, such as the cost of feeding stuffs, seeds, fertilisers, veterinary expenses, hire of machinery etc., and also any interest charges actually paid on loans obtained in connection with the running of the farm.  The difference between income and expenditure is taken as the annual farm means for unemployment assistance purposes.</P>
      <P>As the person concerned is now receiving unemployment assistance based on factual assessment of his means, he will benefit from the general rates increases which come into effect at the end of June.</P>
