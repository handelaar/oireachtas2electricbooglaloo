      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation &mdash; EUTELSAT &mdash; is an inter-Governmental organisation which was established in order to provide the full range of telecommunications services, telephone, telex, data, satellite business systems etc., <i>via</i> satellite on a regional basis in Europe.</P>
      <P>EUTELSAT originated in the early seventies, when, in order to promote European Space Technology, the European Space Agency, of which Ireland is a member, undertook in collaboration with the Telecommunication Administrations of the Conference of European and Postal Administrations a study of the technical and economic aspects of a possible European regional satellite system. Following this study and discussions between representatives of the European PTTs and of the ESA, 18 of the PTTs of the CEPT joined together in 1977 in an organisation called Interim EUTELSAT in order to provide a legal entity for European satellite systems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interim EUTELSAT, which has its headquarters in Paris, has as its objective the operation of commercial satellite telecommunications services in Europe. It was established in order to provide the full range of telecommunications services: telephone, telex, data, television <Col N="208" /> using the European Communications Satellite.</P>
    <P>It was decided in 1981 that Ireland should become a member of Interim EUTELSAT following a decision by that organisation that it would provide in addition to telephone services a western European satellite business system which would enable a business with offices or factories in different locations in Europe to provide satellite links between its various premises.</P>
    <P>In November 1981 the Government authorised the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to accede to the agreement on the Constitution of a Provisional European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, Interim EUTELSAT and the supplementary agreement relating to the Space Segment of the Satellite Telecommunications Systems for the Fixed Service.</P>
    <P>The agreement and supplementary agreement relating to Interim EUTELSAT, were signed in Paris in December 1981, by the Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  Ireland took a financial investment share of 0.22 per cent in Interim EUTELSAT at an estimated cost of IR£140,000 up to and including 1985.</P>
    <P>Interim EUTELSAT, as the name suggests, is a provisional organisation and it was intended since its establishment in 1977 that it should be replaced by a definitive international inter-governmental organisation and thus enjoy the same status as the global telecommunications satellite organisation INTELSAT.</P>
    <P>To this end an inter-governmental conference was convened and met in Paris from 3 to 14 May 1982.  It was attended by representatives of 26 European States. Ireland was represented at this conference by delegates from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Posts and Telegraphs. Following at times difficult discussions and negotiations, a convention establishing EUTELSAT as a definitive organisation for European satellite telecommunications and an operating agreement relating to EUTELSAT were agreed at this conference.  The Final Act of the conference was signed on behalf of <Col N="209" /> Ireland by the Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>Both the convention and the operating agreement were opened for signature on 15 July 1982.  Under the terms of these agreements it is open to this country to become a member of EUTELSAT on the same terms and conditions as applied to our membership of the interim organisation if we do so within an 18-month period dating from the opening for signature of the convention and operating agreement, 15 July 1982, up to 15 January 1984, the final date for ratification of the convention.</P>
    <P>Accordingly, the Government gave their authority on 26 May 1983 for the signature of the convention on behalf of Ireland.  The convention was signed on behalf of Ireland by our Ambassador to France in Paris on 3 June 1983, Ireland taking a 0.22 per cent financial share in EUTELSAT.  At the time that the Government gave their authority for signature of the EUTELSAT convention, they also gave their authority for the moving in Dáil Éireann of this motion for a resolution approving the terms of the convention and operating agreement and, following Dáil approval, the signature on behalf of Ireland of the operating agreement.</P>
    <P>It should be pointed out that while the convention has already been signed on behalf of Ireland, it will not enter into force for this country until the operating agreement has been signed.  It should, perhaps, also be noted that while the convention is signed on behalf of the Government, it is usual in international agreements of this nature &mdash; as, for example, was the case with the INTELSAT agreement &mdash; that the operating agreement is signed by the designated telecommunications entity of the Government, in this case the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who then become the signatory.</P>
    <P>Turning now to the agreements themselves, it could be said that the convention sets out the aims and scope of activity of the organisation, together with the rights and obligations of the parties &mdash;<Col N="210" /> the governments who sign the convention &mdash; while the operating agreement in essence states how the provisions of the convention are to be executed.</P>
    <P>The convention contains 26 Articles and two Annexes, the first of which defines the terms used in the agreement, the second establishes EUTELSAT as the definitive organisation for satellite communications in Europe, and the third sets out in detail the objectives of the organisation, its scope of activity.  Article IV provides that EUTELSAT shall have legal personality and in order to provide for this in Irish law it is necessary to make an order under section 40 (1) of the Diplomatic Relations and Immunities Act, 1967.  This matter will be dealt with in a separate memorandum to the Government at a later date.</P>
    <P>The financial principles of EUTELSAT are set out in Article V of the convention and the manner in which they are to be applied is set out in Articles 4 to 13 of the operating agreement.</P>
    <P>Article V (d) of the convention states that &ldquo;Each Signatory shall contribute to the capital requirements of EUTELSAT and shall receive capital repayment and compensation for use of capital in accordance with the Operating Agreement&rdquo;. The amount of the initial capital ceiling of EUTELSAT is set at 400 million European Currency Units (ECUs) in Article 5 of the operating agreement.  In accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the operating agreement, the maximum extent of this country's liability for capital contributions to EUTELSAT would amount to 0.22 per cent of 400 million ECU equal to .88 million ECU, which at a current rate of exchange &mdash; IR£.69=1 ECU &mdash; would be equivalent to £607,000 approximately.  To date, our contributions to EUTELSAT, including retrospective payments due on our accession to Interim EUTELSAT in 1981, amount to an estimated £99,000.  It is estimated that contributions for 1984-85 will come to £40,000, bringing our total contributions for 1981-85 to approximately IR£140,000, as originally estimated when we joined Interim EUTELSAT in 1981.  Our capital contributions <Col N="211" /> from 1986-87 onwards will increase somewhat as payment for the European Communications Satellites will fall due at that time.  The figure of 400 million ECU as the initial capital ceiling was chosen to cover the cost of a first and possible second generation of ECS satellites.</P>
    <P>It is expected that when the EUTELSAT satellite system becomes fully operational in 1984-85, and revenue begins to flow into the organisation, we will begin to receive interest on capital and capital repayment in line with that which we receive from the International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (INTELSAT).  We receive interest on capital at a rate of 14 per cent per annum from INTELSAT.  The full cost of our membership will in due course be met by charges to our subscribers of the system.</P>
    <P>Articles XIV, and 17 of the convention and operating agreement, respectively, which deal with Procurement Policy are also of interest.  Article XIV of the convention establishes that the Procurement Policy of EUTELSAT shall be such as to encourage the widest possible competition. The principle of open international tender shall apply.  It further states that:</P>
    <P>Contracts shall be awarded in the best interest of EUTELSAT, to bidders offering the best combination of quality, price, delivery time and other important criteria of relevance to EUTELSAT, it being understood that, if there are bids offering a comparable combination of the above mentioned criteria, contracts shall be awarded with due consideration to the general and industrial interests of the Parties. (Article XIV (c)).</P>
    <P>This provision was included in the convention to safeguard the position of the European space industry, and in particular that of the European Space Agency (ESA) of which Ireland is a member. Ireland has benefited considerably from our membership of ESA, many firms here having won contracts for components for the agency's activities in manufacture of satellites and launch vehicles. The organisation structure of EUTELSAT, <Col N="212" /> the composition and functions of its various organs are dealt with in Articles VI-XII of the Convention.  The remaining articles in the convention and operating agreement deal with the Rights and Obligations of Members; Amendments; Withdrawal and Suspension Settlement of Disputes; Co-ordination with other users of the space segment; relationships with other international organisation; procedures for use of the satellite system etc.</P>
    <P>Ireland participated fully in the drafting and agreement of the terms of both the EUTELSAT Convention and Operating Agreement and as has been stated earlier is among the 20 European States to have signed the Convention to date. As has also been pointed out, we must now sign the operation agreement before the convention can enter into force for this country.</P>
    <P>EUTELSAT has already one satellite in orbit and fully operational.  This satellite was successfully launched aboard the ESA launch vehicle Ariane on 16 June last.  The main mission satellite which will provide the full range of telecommunications services, as well as European satellite business systems, is due to be launched in May 1984 and will be fully operational by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>However, before EUTELSAT can be established as the definitive organisation, its convention must be ratified by two thirds of the states holding between them two thirds of the financial investment in EUTELSAT.  This ratification procedure must be complete, under the terms of the convention by 15 January 1984.</P>
    <P>It is essential therefore that we are in a position to sign the operating agreement at the earliest possible date and proceed with arrangements to have the convention ratified in time, not only to allow for entry into force of these agreements for this country, but also to facilitate the entry into force of the convention for EUTELSAT, so that it may enjoy inter-Governmental status and become the definitive organisation for satellite communications in Europe.</P>
    <P>In order therefore to affirm our commitment to EUTELSAT I now move that <Col N="213" /> Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the convention establishing, and the operating agreement relating to the European Telecommunications satellite Organisation, EUTELSAT.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I welcome in general the establishment of the European Telecommunications Satellite Organisation, EUTELSAT.  We regard this as an historic step in European communications.  I feel confident that with the establishment of EUTELSAT it will add to the development of relations between ourselves and our European neighbours and bring about better understanding in the economic, social and cultural fields.</P>
      <P>Our support at this stage is subject to clear assurances to be given by the Minister that the organisation EUTELSAT or its satellite facilities will not be used by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation for military or other purposes which would infringe our clearly stated position regarding neutrality.  I want to make this point clear because the satellite organisation will have an important role in communications in the European area and it is absolutely essential that we retain our clearly enunciated policy regarding neutrality.</P>
      <P>On page 6 of the convention it states clearly that the item I referred to should not be considered.  I am making the point at this stage in case the Government, who have certain ambivalence in relation to neutrality should be warned that we will oppose this convention if an assurance is not given that the possibility of using the EUTELSAT organisation for any military purpose by NATO will not be accepted by the Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the convention, the need for EUTELSAT is quite obvious particularly in relation to a situation where communications are so important. The telephone has become such an integral part of our daily life that it is sometimes surprising to recall that this marvel of communications was invented only 100 years ago.  There was no telephonic communication with America by cable until 1956.  Radio telephone links on which trans-Atlantic communications <Col N="214" /> had depended during the previous 30 years were subject to fading and total black-out.  In recent years tremendous progress has been made in relation to direct communication with America and throughout the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>The continuous growth of telecommunications is no longer conceivable without an increasing use of space techniques.  The International Telecommunications Union estimate that the volume of long distance telephone calls will grow by anything between 15 per cent and 27 per cent per year for the foreseeable future.  Moreover, while the industrial aspect of telecommunications make them an important sector of economic activity they also play an important role in other essential functions such as production, marketing and administration.  The mastery of space communications, therefore, has major industrial, economic and even political significance.</P>
    <P>Satellite communications can be divided into three areas of activity: (1), point to point communications; (2), mobile services, such as maritime and aeronautical communications and (3) direct broadcasting into the home.  That was dealt with by the Minister in the last few days at a press conference.  I appeal to Minister Mitchell to bring any proposals in relation to satellite broadcasting before the Dáil first.  It is an insult to the House if the Minister regards a press conference as being adequate to outline his plan.  The Minister embarked on something new today in the <i>Irish Independent</i> by writing an article under the heading &ldquo;The Brave New World of Satellite Television&rdquo;.  Journalists should be warned about this new movement by Ministers to get into the field of journalism. Instead of relying on reputable journalists to write articles Ministers have now decided to write their own articles. A Minister with specific proposals should outline them to the House first.  Before the Chair rules me out of order, I should like to point out that the matter I have mentioned is relevant to this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1980 the European Space Agency has provided satellites for point-to-point communication links capable of carrying a large part of intra-European telephone, telegraph and telex traffic and the relaying of Eurovision programmes to broadcasting organisations, like RTE, throughout Europe.  Traffic forecasts made by European posts and telegraphs organisations show that the operational satellite system needs to be able to carry about 20,000 simultaneous telephone transmissions in 1990 as against a figure of 5,000 in 1980.  That will be tremendous increase and it makes obvious the need for additional satellite communication services.</P>
      <P>The management of this European regional system has been entrusted to EUTELSAT, created by European posts and telegraphs organisations.</P>
      <P>EUTELSAT will be complementary to INTELSAT which is a single global communications satellite system with 230 earth stations and 108 member nations. On 16 June this year the European rocket, Ariane, put the first EUTELSAT into orbit in a geostationary position ten degrees east.  This is capable of providing 12,000 telephone circuits and two television channels.  It is interesting to note that the Uplink frequency band is 14-14.5 giga-hertz and that research was carried out at University College, Cork, to overcome the adverse propagation conditions at these frequencies.  I should like to compliment the professors and research staff of UCC on their work in relation to this. Their success highlights the advantage of having the expertise here to avail of new technologies.  Three more of these satellites will be placed in orbit between now and 1990 to provide telephone and television circuits as well as specialised telecommunications services such as voice data and telex transmission between oil production platforms and shore stations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What I have said so far about what is with us will pale into insignificance when direct broadcast satellites come along. <Col N="216" /> Then the viewers will be reached directly in their homes without a complicated network of land-based transmitters and microwave links.  The satellite television transmitters will have a large coverage area known as footprints, which will spill over to neighbouring countries.  Each footprint will have five separate channels and this will give the originator of the signal a potential audience of several hundred million people.  Already in the USA almost one dozen companies have applied for permission to start transmitting there although the first satellite of this kind is nowhere near being launched. In England the BBC hope to start transmitting on two channels in 1986.  Channell 1 will be the best of BBC 1 and BBC 2 television programmes and the second channel will be pay television.  Both channels will be free of advertising.  RTE should endeavour to be in a position to provide at least an additional channel carrying advertising around this time.</P>
    <P>Major confrontations could arise between neighbouring countries faced with unwanted but technically unavoidable spill-overs.  This could be the case where relations become strained, even temporarily, between members.  Each will accuse the other of undertaking propaganda exercises and so on.  It is appropriate that when we are discussing an international convention we should discuss broadcasting generally.  Though EUTELSAT is not directly involved with the satellite television stations which are expected to come on stream in the next few years this matter is relevant to the area of communications in the years ahead.  Our national station, RTE, should be gearing itself for the future exciting possibilities and potentials.  In 1977 in Geneva organisations responsible for telecommunications in all European countries anticipated the development of satellite broadcasting.  The major countries thought is would be a positive idea to allocate to countries like us orbital positions far removed from their own. That will leave us in a good position to provide services throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Technology advances very quickly and today aerials are available that can receive direct satellite broadcast signals <Col N="217" /> from different orbital positions.  Unlike the receiving dish which has been in use until recently these aerials have a type of curved focal bar instead of a focal point and they can easily pick up satellites far removed from each other without moving. They are cheaper and easier to mount than the dish receiver aerial ensuring that they will be mass produced when direct satellite broadcasting becomes a reality.  This new technical development has reopened doors which were closed firmly by the larger European countries in Geneva in 1977.  To take full advantage of direct satellite broadcasting Ireland, through its national broadcasting organisation, RTE, must be in a position to start broadcasting at the same time as BBC.  Early penetration in Britain is essential as a first step into Europe. Income would greatly exceed RTE's present total income for a penetration of 10 per cent.  Every percentage point above this would be a licence to print money.  This can be achieved easily with the right type of programmes and marketing of such.</P>

In that regard there is a connection between television broadcasting and EUTELSAT because the two channels would be availed of by RTE to, for instance, bring the Eurovision song contest to Ireland. The Olympic Games will be broadcast directly to Ireland and RTE will be using EUTELSAT's satellites to avail of that.</P>

      <P>The organisation will be based in paris.  I appreciate that we have only a percentage of the total involvement in this organisation but we should have some say in the job potential being created, particularly in production of material for the satellites, ground stations and so forth.  The IDA should involve themselves in studying this organisation and the convention to ensure that our industry would be geared to providing some facilities to avail of the great achievements, possibilities and potential of this organisation.  It is unfortunate that it is based in Paris; naturally we would like some part of it associated with our capital city.</P>
      <P>The creation of jobs at this stage is essential.  We have already geared ourselves to receiving European satellites at our earth station at Elfordstown, Midleton, County Cork, and this will come into operation in the second half of 1984.  I understand that the capital cost of the project is estimated to be in the region of £7 million.  We have geared ourselves to receive signals from direct satellite communication facilities and, in a sense, we are ahead as we will have those facilities available in the middle of 1984.  Costs in relation to this technology are enormous but the net results and advantages for our country are evident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Communications and contact with the EUTELSAT organisation has been going on for a number of years and successive Governments have enthusiastically endorsed the development of this communications system.  At this stage we are in a position to avail of the technical side of this development and we should be in a position to avail of the potential for job creation here.  Our representatives at this convention should brief the IDA on the <Col N="219" /> potential that can be achieved in that matter.</P>
    <P>Many areas here cannot receive some of our present stations and the Minister and Minister of State should investigate the possibility of setting up small deflectar units to solve the problem.  I believe that the Minister is considering the rebroadcasting of RTE 1 and RTE 2 to community groups in isolated parts of the country, with a contribution from RTE to assist the local community.  I take this opportunity of asking the Minister to investigate the poor signals received in different parts of the country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Nealon) Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Nealon)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my speech to ET developments and will not mention telephones. Ireland's participation in the sphere of satellite communications covers a broad spectrum and dates back to the early sixties and the founding of the International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (INTELSAT) which is an intergovernmental organisation.  Ireland was one of the 19 founding States instrumental in drawing up the INTELSAT agreements and in initiating the operation of the world's only global satellite telecommunications system.  Today INTELSAT boasts a membership of 109 states and 134 states (members and nonmembers) now use the satellite system which provides two thirds of the world's trans-oceanic satellite telecommunications and virtually all overseas television transmissions.</P>
      <P>INTELSAT operates satellites in the three main ocean regions.  i. e. in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian Ocean Regions.  The latest series of INTELSAT satellites each has a capacity of 12,000 circuits and can handle that number of telephone calls simultaneously, as well as providing two TV channels.  Generally, communication satellites were located in the equatorial orbit and are stationary relative to the earth's surface.  Potentially, they cover half the earth.  In order to communicate through the satellite, an earth station is required at the originating and receiving ends and the earth station originating communication transmits a signal to the satellite which transmits it back to the receiving earth station.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland's use of the satellite system began in 1965 with the bringing into service of two satellite circuits from this country to the United States.  These circuits were routed via an earth station in Goonhilly, Cornwall, in the United Kingdom in which this country had a financial investment share.  Over the years, the number of satellite circuits used by this country has increased gradually and traffic growth has now reached a point <Col N="221" /> which requires us having an earth station of our own to cater for telecommunications facilities on the North Atlantic route.  The INTELSAT Atlantic Ocean Region Satellite serves the United States and Canada, as well as South Africa.</P>
    <P>To cater for this development and future requirements, a site for an Irish earth station, which will access the INTELSAT Atlantic Ocean region satellite, was purchased at Elfordstown, Midleton, County Cork in 1981.  Work is now in progress on the construction of the earth station and is well on target for a completion date at the end of March 1984.  The earth station will be fully operational by mid-1984 at which time all of our satellite circuits serving the Atlantic Ocean route will be transferred from the United Kingdom earth stations, on which they are at present routed, to Elfordstown; this will provide us with direct, totally independent satellite circuits to the United States, Canada and South Africa.</P>
    <P>For technical reasons, it is not possible to access the Indian Ocean Region satellite of the INTELSAT system, which serves Australia, New Zealand and Japan, from an earth station located at the Elfordstown site.  Our traffic on this route has been routed via earth stations in the United Kingdom until recently. However, we have joined with the telecommunications administrations of the Netherlands, Belgium and the Nordic countries in co-ownership of an earth station, located at Burum in the Netherlands, which will give us independent access to INTELSAT Indian Ocean Region satellites.  This investment will result in reduced costs for routing our traffic on this route.</P>
    <P>INTELSAT has been at the forefront in technological development of satellite communications and will once again be first in the field with the introduction of its satellite business systems at the end of this year.  INTELSAT business systems will offer a global system which will enable a business with offices or factories in different locations throughout the world to avail of private satellite links between its various premises.  This should be of enormous benefit and attraction to <Col N="222" /> multinational companies, many of whom are sited here.</P>
    <P>INTELSAT proposes to offer its satellite business systems on an &ldquo;unprotected&rdquo; basis, that is, no back up in the event of satellite failure, in the Atlantic Ocean Region from 1984, and on a fully &ldquo;protected&rdquo; basis in all regions in 1985. At this time we will be able to offer this service to the Irish business community using our own earth station at Elfordstown or small earth station which can be located near a user's premises.</P>
    <P>As can be seen from the above, Ireland has participated fully in INTELSAT since its foundation and has derived tremendous benefit from its membership of that organisation, both in terms of the facilities of which we have been able to avail and of the services we are able to offer to subscribers.  It should be added also that our financial investment in INTELSAT has also proved very fruitful. In addition to the repayment of the initial capital, we received a return of 14 per cent per annum on our investment. Indeed the organisation has proved so efficient in its operations that utilisation charges for the use of the satellite system have been reduced or maintained at present level for the last 12 successive years.</P>
    <P>INTELSAT has been phenomenally successful over the years and Ireland can and should be proud of the role it has played in the foundation of the organisation and in its participation in the activities which have led to the development and growth of the world's most advanced satellite tellecommunications system.  In this we are shareholders.</P>
    <P>Following the lead of INTELSAT, a provisional organisation for the provision and operation of commercial telecommunications satellites in Europe, &ldquo;Interim EUTELSAT&rdquo; was founded in 1977.  Ireland has participated from the beginning in experiments with EUTELSAT's pre-operational satellite &mdash; OTS &mdash; orbital test satellite.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined Interim EUTELSAT in 1981, taking a financial investment share of 0.22 per cent at an estimated cost of £140,000 up to and including 1985, in order to be in a position to avail of satellite facilities and to offer the full range <Col N="223" /> of telecommunications services, telephone, telex, data, satellite business systems and so on, via satellite on an intra-European basis at the same time as our partners in Europe.</P>
    <P>As a member of Interim EUTELSAT Ireland was able to participate fully and to have a significant input into the preparation of the draft convention and operating agreements put before the intergovernmental conference which was held from 3 to 14 May 1982.  During this conference Ireland played an important role in the discussions and negotiations leading to final agreement by representatives of the 26 European states which took part in the conference of the terms of the convention establishing EUTELSAT as the definitive organisation for European satellite telecommunications and the operating agreement.  To date 20 of those states have signed the Convention and 17 have signed the operating agreement.</P>
    <P>The EUTELSAT convention was signed on behalf of Ireland at Paris on 3 June last.  At a meeting of the Council of EUTELSAT which was held in Dublin Castle from 6-10 June 1983 our commitment to EUTELSAT was re-affirmed with the announcement that it is planned to introduce an Irish earth station to operate with the EUTELSAT satellites by 1986.</P>
    <P>Our participation in the European Communications Satellite System will be advantageous to this country, just as the INTELSAT has been.  At present all of our telecommunications traffic to Europe is carried on the terrestrial network, that is to say by submarine cables and microwave links.  With the introduction of an Irish earth station which will access EUTELSAT satellites we will be able to provided telephones, telex, data, TV relay services via satellite to any destination in Europe.  Arrangements have been completed recently with our partners in Europe to route some of our main telecommunications traffic via EUTELSAT from 1986 on.  In addition it is planned to have a EUTELSAT Satellite Multiservices System in service by late 1984, early 1985.  We will be able to offer this service to our customers using special <Col N="224" /> small earth stations which may be located at sites convenient to customers premises.</P>
    <P>The practical advantage of using the EUTELSAT satellite system may summed up as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>1.  The availability of satellite business systems which may help to promote industrial development in Ireland and will certainly be an advantage in competing for mobile investment.</P>
    <P>2.  Satellite links to Europe will provide us with diversity of routing &mdash; that is, back-up facilities &mdash; in the event of system failure of the terrestrial links to Europe.</P>
    <P>3.  Satellite service to Europe will provide us with a measure of independence from our major partners in Europe, which we do not enjoy at present as our terrestrial links to Europe must transit other countries at present.</P>
    <P>4.  Opportunity for &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; contracts for Irish firms through our association with the European Space Agency, which is the contractor for the first generation of EUTELSAT satellites.</P>
    <P>5.  Transfer of technology which will result from our involvement in EUTELSAT.</P>
    <P>In addition to all of these it should be pointed out that as a signatory of the EUTELSAT Convention we are assured of a repayment of capital and compensation for use of capital.  Indications are that compensation for use of capital could well be similar to that presently received on our investment in INTELSAT, at about 14 per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>Our interests in EUTELSAT will be looked after at two levels:</P>
    <P>Governmental &mdash; by our representation on the Assembly of Parties and</P>
    <P>Operational &mdash; by our representation on the Board of Signatories.</P>
    <P>We will also have an opportunity to have <Col N="225" /> an input at both the technical and financial levels by our representation on the technical and financial committees of EUTELSAT.</P>
    <P>In summary, therefore, I should like to reiterate that our participation in the sphere of satellite communications goes back many years and covers many fields. Ireland has benefited considerably from this involvement.  I have cited INTELSAT as an example of the fruitfulness of Ireland's early and full participation in the sphere of telecommunications satellite growth and development.</P>
    <P>There is every reason to expect that Ireland's involvement in EUTELSAT will be equally beneficial in the European context.  It is worth saying again that we have participated fully in the drafting and negotiation of the terms of the EUTELSAT Convention, which was signed on behalf of Ireland in June last, and the operating agreement, which may signed on behalf of Ireland when the House approves the terms of these agreements.</P>
    <P>On a practical level the urgency attached to the timing of our signature of the EUTELSAT operating agreement should be stressed again.  The convention will not enter into force for this country until the operating agreement has been signed, and the convention must be ratified by two thirds of the states who are party to it, and holding two-thirds of financial investment, by 15 January 1984, in order to effect its entry into force and establish EUTELSAT as the intergovernmental organisation for satellite communications in Europe.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Leyden said, there was another ET development during the week when the Government decided to seek proposals for an Irish direct broadcasting satellite service.  These proposals are being sought from national and international groups.  Of course, the matter will be brought before the Dáil at the appropriate time.  The Deputy referred, too, to the 1977 International Convention in Geneva when we were given a particularly advantageous orbital position with five channels.  This will give reception for Irish television for the first time in the whole of the UK, in parts of Holland, Belgium, France, Denmark, <Col N="226" /> Germany, Luxembourg and Norway. This is the first time that this could be done while conforming fully to international laws.  It is a revolutionary development.</P>
    <P>Of course it also extends out in the other direction to the west and south of the country.  As at present there is nobody there to receive it.  Presumably, when it comes on stream by 1987 the operational staff of the oil rigs will be glad of this service for entertainment in their leisure time.  The DBS represents a revolutionary new opening of the airways. It transcends national boundaries in a totally legal sense in conformity with all international organisations.  It offers great possibilities.  Also, because it is totally new, it represents a journey into the unknown.  While our footprints cover this vast area so also do the footprints of other countries, other television stations, which can be received here.</P>
    <P>It is only right that we should compliment the committee set up to examine satellite broadcasting on their excellent report and the speed with which it was produced.  The Government have reacted very quickly in inviting these proposals because time is of the essence.  We may face the stage here, in 1987 or perhaps later, when we shall have a choice of 15 to 20 outside channels coming in here not at present available.  We must take our decisions.  We have the best possible advice available to us now.  We have invited proposals.  Of course we must be careful but we must also have courage in this area.  In passing I may say there is very great interest in the development and in the invitation we have recently offered for proposals.</P>
    <P>To revert back to EUTELSAT &mdash; which is the motion before the House &mdash; there are two main reasons that it is of the utmost importance that the deadline for ratification of the convention, 15 January 1984, is met.  First, from an economic point of view, any delay in the entry into force of the convention will result in a consequential delay in the conclusion of a headquarters agreement. This agreement will grant privileges and immunities leading directly to a reduction in the cost of the Organisation and, <Col N="227" /> hence, in the financial contributions into EUTELSAT.</P>
    <P>Secondly, from the operational point of view, it should be noted that different principles underlie the interim and definitive arrangements for the establishment and operation of the space segment; the latter offering a more flexible approach. It is of particular concern, that, in its interim status, EUTELSAT may have to acquire in 1984 the satellites which will replace the existing ECS system but without the benefit of any provisions in interim agreements establishing the organisation's procurement policy.</P>
    <P>For those reasons I support the motion before the House and would urge the House to approve the terms of the convention establishing, and the Operating Agreement relating to, EUTELSAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister and Deputy Leyden for their participation in this debate.  It is remarkable how the scope of a debate can be so widened.  We are dealing specifically here with the EUTELSAT Convention and Operating Agreement. However, at the request of Deputy Leyden, we have listened to the Minister, Deputy Nealon, give us a very informative review of what we may be able to receive at some stage in the future.  One wonders are we going to become a nation of television watchers?  How many stations do we need in this country?  Certainly there is need for more than we have at present.  In certain areas of the country two stations only are received, that is RTE 1 and RTE 2, whereas those people living along the east coast benefit from a number of other stations.  Therefore, it would appear that in the not too distant future, certainly by the end of this decade, we, the forgotten people living in the western regions will have available to us the same number of stations and benefits as have our eastern cousins at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As has been said earlier, Ireland has been involved in the sphere of satellite telecommunications for many years and has derived considerable benefit through <Col N="228" /> this involvement.  I am confident that our involvement in and commitment to EUTELSAT will be as beneficial to this country as our participation in the International Telecommunications Satellite Organisation (INTELSAT) proved to date.  The advantages of using the EUTELSAT satellite system have already been put before you.  I should like to sum them up again here and to emphasise the importance and, indeed, practical reality that access to the EUTELSAT satellite system represents for this country.</P>
    <P>On a practical level, participation in the satellite system will provide us with satellite links to Europe and thus diversify routing of our traffic in the event of failure of the terrestrial links to Europe. In terms, less clearly &ldquo;definable&rdquo;, but of equal importance, satellite service to Europe will provide us with a measure of independence from our major European partners on whom we are dependent at present for transmitting facilities for our terrestrial links.  It will also enable us to provide service, such as satellite business services, at the same time as our European partners, the importance of which, in relation to the competitive environment in Europe for mobile investment should be emphasised again.</P>
    <P>The implications of our involvement in EUTELSAT for Irish industry I am sure have not been lost on the House.  I shall refer in a moment to the point the Deputy made himself.  There is a real opportunity for &ldquo;spin-off&rdquo; contracts for Irish firms through our association with the European Space Agency which is the contractor for the EUTELSAT satellites.  The benefits of the transfer of technology which will also result from our involvement in EUTELSAT, should not be underestimated.  And, of course, we are guaranteed a repayment of our capital investment in the organisation, and compensation for use of capital.</P>
    <P>With regard to our actual investment in EUTELSAT, some of you may be wondering, why, in view of the benefits likely to result from our participation in the satellite system, Ireland has taken such a small investment share, 0.22 of 1 per cent.  I should explain that at the time <Col N="229" /> of our joining Interim EUTELSAT in 1981, it was envisaged that our use of the satellite system would be limited initially to the provision of satellite business systems to our customers.  It was decided therefore to take a small percentage share, equal to the lowest percentage share of an existing participant in Interim EUTELSAT, 0.22 of 1 per cent.  Under the terms of the convention, it was open to us to join the definitive organisation on the same terms as applied to our membership of the provisional organisation. It was decided therefore that we should retain our percentage investment in EUTELSAT at 0.22 of 1 per cent on signing the convention in June last.  This small investment share will in no way limit our use of the capacity of the system but it will have the effect of keeping our capital contributions at a reasonable level.</P>
    <P>I should like to assure the House that the EUTELSAT satellite system is not being used for any type of military purpose, as the Deputy hoped it would not. There is no reason to believe that it will; in fact it definitely will not.  That is specifically excluded under the terms of Article III paragraph (e) of the convention.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also referred to direct broadcasting satellites.  The EUTELSAT system is not intended to provide direct broadcasting services.  The satellite can be used in the same way as ground telecommunications systems to carry television material live between different locations for subsequent broadcasting by the appropriate television and radio authorities.  Deputy Leyden referred also to the need to have the IDA fully briefed on the industrial possibilities for Ireland. That is a most important point.  Discussions have already taken place with the IDA and will continue in that direction. Our small share in this is 0.22 of 1 per cent, as one of 20 nations sharing its cost. I should say, for the information of the House, that the people sharing the larger part of the cost are the United Kindgom at 16.40 per cent; France with a similar share; Italy, 11.48 per cent, the Federal Republic of Germany, 10.82 per cent and Belgium, 4.92 per cent.  One other place <Col N="230" /> has a contribution similar to ours but quite a number of them are less than 1 per cent.</P>
    <P>Finally, I reiterate that we have participated fully in the negotiations leading to and in the drafting of the EUTELSAT Convention and Operating Agreement now before the House.  We are fully satisfied with the terms of these agreements and have signed the convention on behalf of Ireland.  Therefore, I urge the House to give its approval to the terms of the EUTELSAT Convention and Operating Agreement in order to facilitate the speedy signature of the operating agreement on behalf of Ireland and the ratification of the convention on the due date of 15 January 1984.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>I had almost completed my contribution last Tuesday in this debate and I was dealing with the role of the courts in the implementation of justice in law.  There is no doubt about the concern expressed by the public regarding decisions of the courts in the recent past.  The Judiciary have a very important part to play in ensuring that people see that justice is done and this is a link in the chain of the process of law and order. From time to time we see reports in the media of cases where persons convicted of very serious crimes have got away with suspended sentences and for crimes of a minor nature people have been sent to prison.  Nobody is outside the law but the public are entitled to ask questions when they see that serious criminals are let off lightly and minor crimes, such as shoplifting, get serious sentences.  This is creating doubt in the minds of the public regarding the role of the Judiciary.  While members of the public would not have all the information in such cases and therefore could not judge on them from what they hear in the media, that area should be looked at.  I do not know if the Minister <Col N="231" /> has any role regarding the Judiciary or whether he can interfere in this area, but the Judiciary play a part on behalf of the community and so their role must be seen as in the best interests of the community. Therefore, I question this lack of consistency in the decisions of the Judiciary.</P>
      <P>I want to refer briefly to prisons.  I am glad that the recent industrial dispute at Mountjoy is over and I hope that never again will this kind of action be taken by people involved who are working on behalf of the public.  We saw what happened and the opportune moment was taken by those concerned to take advantage of the situation.  This is not in the interests of the community and I hope to see procedures adopted to deal with disputes of this nature effectively and quickly without the need to resort to measures such as were taken at Mountjoy on that occasion.</P>
      <P>During the course of the debate many matters were put forward as factors contributing to the high crime rate.  One was drugs, and there is no doubt that drugs play a major part in crime.  We have acted too late in dealing with this problem.  The warning signals were there many years ago.  I remember a sergeant in Cork speaking about the increase in drugs some years ago but nobody was prepared to listen and certainly politicians were not prepared to listen.  This is why we have today a situation which we must tackle very constructively and forcibly in order to bring the drug traffic under control. The drug addict is a victim of the system. We hear from time to time that it is always the socially deprived who are affected by the drug problem, but I do not accept this.  I hope the Minister will continue to use all the resources available to him to ensure that drug pushers are eliminated.  We can well do without them.  The harm they have done and are doing to our young people must be stopped and for this purpose any assistance necessary from this side of the House will be given to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Finally, this legislation is intended to be for the benefit of all the community. It is not only the Garda and the courts who have a role to play in ensuring the <Col N="232" /> success of this legislation.  The media have a very important part to play.  We must all work to ensure that we have a better society.  Some people are saying that this is only to create a police state. That is not so.  People must be assured that those who pass legislation here are doing it for their benefit.  Unfortunately, some people will do anything to undermine the statutory bodies.  We must be vigilant about such people.  They have a foothold here.  We must highlight at all times the needs of our community and their social and economic problems and unless we have law and order we have nothing.  While I welcome the legislation, I have reservations about some sections of the Bill and I will refer to them on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wallace in his closing remarks put his finger on one of the most important things that arise in relation to any Criminal Justice Bill, and that is the fact that it is not just to give the police or the State more power in the administration of criminal law and criminal justice, but it must be seen as something that is there for the entire community and to make that community work. There is always this dilemma between the rights of the individual and the interests of the community and it is hard to draw the line between them.  The remarks of Deputy Wallace and others who have spoken on this Bill are important in that context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the outset I must say that I hope that it will take some time yet before this Bill becomes law because it is important that as many people as possible speak on it, particularly on Second Stage.  Many points in this Bill need to be teased out and talked about.  As a lawyer I could very easily give in to the temptation of going into the Bill as a solicitor or barrister might.  I will avoid that entirely because we need to examine here the general purpose and emphasis behind the measure.  I have one other thing to say by way of preface.  This Bill is perhaps the most promised and most talked about Bill to come into this House for quite some time.  In the last few general elections, and certainly since 1981, this Bill <Col N="233" /> has been promised in one form or another.  Without question it has been in the Department of Justice and we do not know why it has not come forth until now.  I want to pay a compliment to the Minister for Justice and the Government for bringing forward the Bill.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that I welcome the Bill in all respects, as will be apparent when I have finished speaking.  I have some reservations about parts of the Bill but I realise it has required political will to get the Bill out of the Department of Justice and onto the floor of the House. It is clear that several of the Minister's predecessors in the Department lacked the political will and courage to come forward with a Bill.</P>
    <P>It is a difficult Bill for any Minister to produce.  Striking a balance between the interests of the community and the rights of individuals is difficult.  It requires courage on the part of the Minister because he can lose out on both sides.  On the one hand he can be attacked by those who advocate civil liberties and, on the other hand, he can be attacked by the Establishment for not going one way or another.  It is our duty and responsibility to examine the Bill in its entirety, to alter it or to propose changes.  That is a major undertaking because when one starts to tamper with a matter like that one is likely to bring about consequences that may not have been foreseen at the start. It is important that as many as possible speak on the Bill.  It requires much public discussion not only in this Chamber but in the media and I am glad to see it is attracting much attention.  It is important to point out that the Garda Síochána, their representative body and the civil liberties groups among others did not at the beginning see in the Bill what they see in it now.  It is only as they have had an opportunity to go through it in detail and to tease out what it means that the emphasis they place on parts of the Bill has differed.</P>
    <P>The people who have spoken in the debate have been in favour of the Bill, with one exception.  Most people have seen good in it and I think that is the case.  I do not think anyone has spoken completely against it.  Every speaker has <Col N="234" /> echoed the concern of all of us to ensure that we do the right thing.  I have not given as much thought to any other legislative measure since I became a Member of the Oireachtas in 1977.  I have to admit that the views I had initially on the Bill have changed at least in respect of the emphasis I place on certain parts of it.  I am satisfied now as to my views on the Bill but I know that there are matters that will have to be teased out further on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I do not find it easy to make this speech.  I have the highest regard for the Minister but I must say I do not welcome all the measures in the Bill.  It is difficult to express my reservations without seeming to differ from one's Minister.  However, I must say that I welcome the offer of the Minister to accept amendments. That is very important.  Traditionally Opposition front benchers and back benchers have had a very minor function in amending legislation but this Minister is giving us an opportunity to think about the legislation and to consider its various parts.  I think he is quite open to the question of making alterations in the Bill and I will certainly take this up.  I have already discussed the matter with the Minister and in my contribution today I will propose certain amendments that I think will improve the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the objective of ensuring that the guilty are convicted should not be achieved at the cost of putting the innocent at risk.  That is an excellent expression of the balance we are striving to find in the Bill.  It is our job to satisfy ourselves that the provisions in the Bill will deliver to the Garda whatever powers it seeks to deliver to them, ensuring that the guilty get a fair trial but also ensuring that the innocent are not put at risk.  At the moment there is a risk of being carried away in dealing with legislation which proposes to deliver more powers to the Establishment because it is popular to do something like this at the moment.  The rising crime rate and the great difficulties faced by many people, particularly those living in urban areas, are matters that are very much in the public mind at the moment.  There is the danger that politicians, particularly <Col N="235" /> after a by-election campaign and after knocking on many doors, will say that something must be done without necessarily analysing what might and should be done to solve the problem. Politicians are people who call for things to be done and there is a slight danger that we will pass the Bill, give powers to the Garda, imagine that that will solve all problems and then wait until problems build up in the future and until the question of reviewing the legal system comes up for examination.  We must divorce ourselves from such luxurious thinking. We have to accept that dealing with a crime wave such as that which we have been experiencing in the past few years is extremely difficult and the problem will not be solved easily.  I do not believe it will be solved by the passage of the Bill although I think it will help to solve the problem.  We must accept that the problem is greater and will require far more effort.</P>
    <P>We must ponder on what in the Bill will help to reduce the crime rate.  I think it will help us to do that and also to deal with the habitual criminals who exploit and abuse the system.  However, I do not think it will deal with the real difficulties we have today.  The most significant development in crime in the past few years has been the number of young people involved in crime and the different types of crime being committed now. Two or three years ago armed robberies were the major type of crime but now they are on the decline.  Nowadays house-breakings and the larceny of cars are the major crimes.  We should examine why we have been successful in coping with armed robberies and why we have not been successful in dealing with the other types of crime.  We must also consider why crimes are based so much on particular urban areas and also why they are based on petty larceny and so on.</P>
    <P>We must be realistic and face the fact that changes must be brought about in our legal system.  In his speech the Minister reminded us that economic and social problems are at the root of some of our problems in the criminal area.  I agree with the Minister in this.  The Minister <Col N="236" /> also said that we cannot wait until the Government have dealt with the economic and social problems before we work out a strategy to combat the crime wave.  I agree with him in that.  We must recognise that particular difficulties arise so far as the Garda are concerned.  We have to consider their lack of resources and also the tragedy in the North of Ireland.  We cannot ignore the sheer pressure that puts on the operations of the Garda in terms of taking up so much resources.  Those resources are deployed in the Border areas away from areas such as Dublin where there is a crime problem. Many public representatives perceive the greatest problem as not enough gardaí on the beat.  They also lack the technical and forensic resources of other police forces. We must also accept that the Garda feel very strongly &mdash; in this I have the greatest sympathy with them &mdash; that the criminal legal system at the moment seems almost to favour an accused person rather than the Garda.  They see that as wrong.  They are frustrated and annoyed, and rightly so, that that should be the case.</P>
    <P>We have to examine and appreciate all those points but having done so we must still stand back from a Bill like this and, when looking at all the powers we are giving the Garda and every proposal in the Bill, we must ask ourselves if this power will help us solve the problem.  We must also ask ourselves is this giving the Garda more power and at the same time ensuring that the innocent person is not put at risk.  Each and every Member of this House must ensure that whatever is in this Bill is fair and that the innocent person is not put at risk.  Even though it may not be politically popular, we have a duty that we must discharge.</P>
    <P>Members will recall that earlier this year there was a vote in the House of Commons on whether the death penalty should be restored.  Every public opinion poll in the United Kingdom over the last few years clearly indicated that the public want the death penalty restored but Members of the British Houses of Parliament recognised the fact that one cannot simply go along with what is popular, <Col N="237" /> politically or otherwise.  One has to consider whether it is right to do something.</P>
    <P>There is one area where there is a particularly heavy responsibility on us to ensure that what is in this Bill is right, and not just that it will satisfy us in our need to do something about the crime rate.  We must realise that we are changing our legal system and, in some respects, we are changing it very drastically. We must ask ourselves whether what we are doing is right for the country, whether it is what we want to do and not just whether it will be right tomorrow so that we can say to the people of Dublin Central, &ldquo;Look what we have done&rdquo;.  I saw Fianna Fáil claiming credit for this, and so did my party.  When we are asked what we are doing about the situation, we tell the people that we are passing the Criminal Justice Bill at present, as if to say that once the Bill is through crime in Dublin city and everywhere else will be a thing of the past.  We must bear in mind that what we are doing here will be part of our legal system until it is changed again.  We know from experience that it takes a long time to change legislation. This Bill has been in the Department of Justice for the last seven or eight years in one form or another and the likelihood is that when this Bill passes the changes it will bring about in our legal system will remain for many years and will bring about consequences that will affect the Garda, the public and, most important, the relationship between the Garda and the public.</P>
    <P>Before going into the areas where I find there are problems, there are a number of points which have not been highlighted in the past few weeks as being of importance.  There are a number of new ideas in the Bill which are important and which I welcome.  I want to welcome one particular proposal which will enable the prosecution and the defence in criminal cases to reach agreement on certain matters. Up to now it has been the custom in the criminal side of our legal system that the prosecution had to prove everything in a very formal way.  We had experience of this during the court-martial in the Curragh this summer.  People had to be flown from the Lebanon to prove that a <Col N="238" /> certain person stood in a certain place at a certain time.  These formal proofs were totally unnecessary.  This has been an archaic part of our system for years and has cost the country massive amounts because doctors and other professional people had to wait in court to discharge a very formal item of proof in a criminal case.  I welcome these provisions because they will make our court system more efficient.</P>
    <P>Other matters in the Bill have been referred to by many speakers.  The proposal to impose consecutive sentences for offences committed by persons while on bail is a good idea; to create a new offence for somebody who fails to surrender is also a good idea.  The proposal to increase very substantially the penalty for taking a vehicle without the consent of the owner is to be welcomed, although I believe the car manufacturers have a greater part to play in combating the problems of car thefts.  In my view it is important that these penalties be increased.  This proposal now comes within the scope of section 3 and other sections.  I recognise that this is something which must be done.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the proposal to oblige a defendant to give the prosecution notice of an alibi he proposes to produce in court.  It has been unfair and unduly helpful to a defendant to put the State in a position where they had to disclose details of their evidence months before a case went to trial and the defendant could hide behind the secrecy of his own position and only disclose an alibi in court when the Garda and the prosecution would have no opportunity to investigate its validity.  I also welcome the proposal to introduce majority jury verdicts and the proposal to alter the order of closing speeches in criminal trials.</P>
    <P>Having welcomed those provisions I hasten to say that I do not believe this 1983 legislation will be remembered for those proposals.  I believe it will be remembered for two main powers proposed to be given to the Garda and the State.  First, the power to detain and second the inferences sections.  I want to devote the rest of my remarks to those <Col N="239" /> sections.</P>
    <P>Section 3 gives a garda power to arrest a person without warrant whom he suspects of having committed an offence which carries a penalty of imprisonment for a term of five years of more.  The section goes on to provide that where a garda detains somebody in those circumstances the member in charge of the Garda station must have reasonable grounds for believing detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that if a garda has reasonable grounds for believing somebody has committed a crime, he will be able to detain that person and presumably the arresting garda will have to inform the member in charge of the station of his reasons.  Therefore, I suspect that the Bill provides that the garda in charge of the station will have to have reasonable grounds for believing that his detention is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence.  There is no provision that this information should come to the member in charge of the station from his own resources.  I presume it would be good enough for the arresting garda to bring somebody in and say &ldquo;I believe this person has been involved in the commission of a crime and wish to interview him&rdquo;.  That is all that would be required.</P>
    <P>The Minister very properly pointed out that in recent years the Garda in many cases have not been able to investigate cases properly because there was no legal basis for them to detain somebody for questioning.  I do not find this section or the purpose of the section, namely, detaining somebody for questioning, reprehensible in itself but in my view the provision, although it is a good one in the sense that it gives the Garda an opportunity to investigate properly, has not been fully thought out by the draftsman and requires many changes before it can work effectively.  Those people who say this is novel and a new development in our legal system are being quite unfair. People generally were inclined to believe that they could not refuse to go to the station if they were asked by a garda to <Col N="240" /> do so in order to answer questions about a certain matter.  They were under the impression that the garda had the force of law behind him.  That has now changed and it has become more difficult for the Garda to investigate crime.  The hardened criminal knows very well what his rights are and has been able to exploit this.  Most ordinary people if asked to accompany a garda to a station would quite willingly do so.  The Garda are frustrated and infuriated by a system which demands that they get on with the job and solve crime but which at the same time impedes them from doing so.</P>
    <P>There are many journalists who regard the period of detention as completely reprehensible.  That is an unreasonable attitude.  It must be recognised that if the Garda are to investigate crime they must at least have the opportunity to have a chat with a suspect.  Our proposals are moderate and reasonable in comparison with those which exist in other European countries.  In England a person may be detained for up to 48 hours or longer in the case of serious crime.  In the North of Ireland the period of detention is 48 hours, while in Scotland it is six hours on the authority of the police but this period can be extended on application to the local sheriff.  In Belgium the period of detention is 24 hours.  This is also the case in Denmark but it is extendable on application to a judge.  In France the police may detain a person for 24 hours and this period is extendable on application to the public prosecutor for a further 24 hours. In Italy the period of detention is 48 hours, in Luxembourg 24 hours and in the Netherlands 48 hours on the authority of the public prosecutor, extendable in certain circumstances.  In Sweden a person may be detained for up to five days following formal arrest and in West Germany the period of detention is 24 hours.  These are examples of the periods for which people can be detained but I would emphasise that the systems obtaining in other countries are different from ours and the circumstances in which people can be detained also differ.  I am not familiar with the precise provisions of the law of each of the countries I have mentioned but it is universally accepted <Col N="241" /> that in order to afford police the opportunity to investigate criminal activity they must have the power to detain suspects so that proper investigations can be carried out.</P>
    <P>We must equally recognise that to deprive any person of his or her liberty even for a few hours is a grave matter and it can only be done in circumstances and in an environment which are completely controlled and where a person's rights are fully, not partly, safeguarded. My major criticism of this Bill is that it is shabby and defective in regard to safeguards and does not ensure the full safeguarding of a person's rights.  There are provisions in the Bill which could lead to proper safeguards coming into existence and provisions which might in certain cases provide proper safeguards but the fact remains that a person's rights are not safeguarded in the Bill as it stands. Although I may find certain parts of the Bill difficult to accept, I will support it if the Fine Gael Party and this side of the House stand behind it.  I will, however, be disappointed if other Members, having fully examined the matter, do not feel that some stronger safeguards should be written into the Bill.</P>
    <P>I say that not just in the interests of the rights of an individual but in the interests of the Garda Síochána themselves.  They are regularly the subjects of allegations of abuse, brutality and assault.  This does not arise only in security-related matters but in every twopenny-ha'penny case in the District Court.  When a solicitor interviews a client, particularly a client who has made a statement admitting a certain offence, there will often be an allegation that the person was pushed or beaten into making the statement.  This happens in at least 50 per cent of cases.  At present there is a case in the Four Courts concerning this matter and there have been many other such cases in recent months. Some of these allegations against the Garda may be well-founded but very many are not.  The public do not understand and cannot have all the facts before them.  This feature of our society has had a very damaging effect on the morale of the Garda and on the spirit of co-operation and the respect that should exist <Col N="242" /> between them and the public.  We must ensure that this cancer which is building up in our society is excised.  If not we will suffer the results for many years to come.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of gardaí will use the powers of this Bill with responsibility and care and a consciousness of the rights of people.  However, within the Garda a few bad apples can give the force a completely unfair name.  It is imperative that this Bill should succeed not only in giving the Garda powers to deal with crime but should also give them the protection they need and the opportunity to increase the respect of the public for them.</P>
    <P>We all recall the allegations of brutality made against the so-called &ldquo;heavy gang&rdquo; in the Garda some years ago.  Deputy Gerry Collins was then spokesman for Justice for his party and he made promises about an independent inquiry.  When he became Minister no such inquiry was held and this was a pity.  Perhaps if I knew all the facts and were given the reasons for not holding an inquiry I might hold a different opinion.  It is difficult for us to consider this type of legislation without being able to assure the public that, although in the past, there have been problems and allegations, they have been dealt with through an independent inquiry.  It is a pity that inquiry did not take place.</P>
    <P>Instead, the then Minister, Deputy Collins, established in 1978 the Ó Briain committee and asked them to examine what might be done to ensure that the interests of the Garda and the public in relation to allegations of ill-treatment or brutality by the Garda could be protected. That committee met and, in very quick time examined the situation, and came up with proposals.  Some of those proposals are in this Bill but many of them, and particularly those which would have the direct effect of ensuring that the Garda were not left open to allegations of abuse, are not included in the Bill.  That is a pity.</P>
    <P>We are not seen as a legislative body which has recognised the problems which have been seen by the public to have existed over the past few years.  We cannot ignore them.  Even though there is a demand to give the police more powers <Col N="243" /> to deal with the crime rate, the public are also concerned that the problems within our system have not been ironed out and dealt with.  I refer specifically to the problem of allegations of ill-treatment.</P>
    <P>I have given credit to Judge Barra Ó Briain and his committee for some of the proposals in this Bill.  It is important that credit should be given where it is due.  It is a pity that in his very excellent speech the Minister did not explain to the House why other proposals in that committee's report were not produced as proposals in the Bill.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote briefly from the addendum by Judge Barra Ó Briain to the report.  Speaking about the power to detain people without warrant he said:</P>
    <P>I would go somewhat further and question whether or not the time has now come to change the law relating to the investigation of crime by providing a form of &ldquo;detention&rdquo; for a strictly limited period.  During such detention the Gardaí would have the right to hold persons reasonably suspected of having committed a crime, but only such persons, for the express purpose of questioning them in relation to the crime.  The Gardaí lack such power at the moment.  Notwithstanding this, they are under extreme and increasing pressure from the whole community which is clamant that the police uncover and prevent crime and bring guilt home to guilty parties.  Is it any wonder that the allegations which we have considered show a picture, again and again, of the Gardaí frustrated by their lack of legal power to question suspected persons in custody, taking the law into their own hands by holding them for custodial interrogation, and in doing so, breaking the law if not indeed the Constitution.  This is so even apart from ill-treatment.  But the allegations we have considered state that in a number of cases the Gardaí in their frustration have used physical violence or threats of violence to secure answers to their questioning.  If, therefore, this element of frustration can be eliminated, or even reduced, in some cases, <Col N="244" /> by a change of the law, it seems to me that this change would afford <i>per se</i> some further safeguard against ill-treatment.</P>

      <P>I am not quoting from the original report but from the addendum by Judge Barra Ó Briain.  I have not got the date of publication.  It is probably 1978.  We have to accept that a period of detention is necessary.  I support that, but my problem is that the safeguards for the individual are not there.</P>
      <P>We should look briefly at the proposals in the Bill.  The Minister made a point which has been highlighted in the media, that one proposal is that provision will be made for the electronic recording of all interviews with people detained.  There is no doubt that is an excellent idea but the fact is&mdash;and we must be absolutely clear on this&mdash;that the Bill does not provide that interviews will be electronically recorded.  The Bill merely provides that in future the Minister may make regulations for the electronic recording of interviews. To suggest that is a safeguard in the Bill would be quite untrue.  I am not saying the Minister said that, but there is a perception that there will be video recordings or audio recordings of interviews. It is an ideal solution, but I want to make it absolutely clear that the Bill does not propose that interviews will be recorded; it simply allows the Minister the opportunity in the future to introduce regulations governing that question.  I look forward to the day when that will happen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a provision in the Bill, described by some people as a safeguard, that people may at their request have a solicitor notified by the Garda and the solicitor will come into the station.  There is no provision in the Bill which ensures that the solicitor will talk to the person at the beginning of the detention period. There is no provision in the Bill that the solicitor may remain during questioning. It is interesting to note that, while the Garda must advise people without delay <Col N="245" /> of their right to have a solicitor, the Garda need call a solicitor only as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>I do not know why the distinction is drawn there.  I do not know why something is not written into the Bill providing that a person may not be questioned until he has had the opportunity to talk to a solicitor.  I am not suggesting that a solicitor should remain during all the questioning. I am not even directing my mind to that subject.  I am saying that in terms of safeguards it is wrong to suggest that is a safeguard.  The provision in the Bill is merely a solicitor can be called.  There is nothing definite written into the Bill about questioning a person in the presence of a solicitor or after he has been advised by a solicitor.</P>
    <P>There is no provision in the Bill that if a garda suspects somebody of having committed a crime the garda should record anywhere his grounds for suspicion. There is no provision in the Bill that a Garda officer has to tell somebody the crime he believes he may have committed. Imagine the case of people who are picked up and brought to the station.  I presume they will be told they have been arrested pursuant to the powers given to the Garda under section 3 of the 1983 Criminal Justice Act.  People do not have to be told the reason they were brought into the station.  They do not have to be told the crime it is believed they may have committed.  They have not got the right to have their solicitor there from the start.  They have not even got the right to insist that the solicitor should be there during any part of the six hours.  The obligation is to call a solicitor as soon as is practicable.</P>
    <P>If a person feels aggrieved afterwards, what rights has he got?  There will be a complaints tribunal and I will deal with that in a moment.  That person will not be able to say: &ldquo;This happened.  I want it investigated by an independent complaints tribunal or a senior member of the Garda force&rdquo;.  No record or log will be available which might indicate why the person was called in.  It is fundamental to this type of system that if people are detained they are told why they are detained.  If we are to have this detention <Col N="246" /> period it is as much as in the interests of the Garda themselves as in the interests of the individual that more than one person should be there at all times during questioning.</P>
    <P>I like the idea proposed by Judge Ó Briain in his report that a custodial guardian should be there.  I recognise the fact that that might be difficult.  I propose that this Bill should be amended to provide that until such time as electronic recording of interviews comes into effect a custodial guardian should be appointed in each place of detention and that custodial guardian should remain with the person at all times while being interviewed during a period of detention.  If that is impossible, something should be written into the Bill to ensure the right to speak to a solicitor and if he so choose, have the solicitor remain with him for the entire six hours, the extended period of 12 hours or any other period.  That would absolutely copperfasten a person's rights, removing the possibility that people could afterwards claim that they were brutalised, threatened with violence, frightened and, as a result, made an untrue statement.  There is no other way of getting rid of that problem.  There will always be people who have absolutely nothing to lose and everything to gain by accusing gardaí of doing things which they have not done.  You will never be able to protect the Garda or the public unless you build in that type of safeguard and it can be done.  The electronic recording of interviews is the ideal solution in the long term, but in the short and medium term if the Government want the new power of detention it is absolutely essential that a person's rights be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>It is essential that judges or lawyers be not put in a position of having to decide on the credibility of evidence given by a member of the public, an accused person, and of a member of the Garda Síochana, as to whether there was a threat of violence. It is not good enough that that should happen under this Bill.  Regretfully in the longer term this provision in the Bill, far from helping to deal with the problem of crime, will build up a distrust between the public&mdash;or certain members <Col N="247" /> of it &mdash; and the Garda.  We need exactly the opposite, to have power of detention but in such a way that the individual's rights will be safeguarded to the extent that the possibility of untrue or unfair allegations being made against the Garda is got rid of once and for all.</P>
    <P>I said I would avoid the temptation of going into the detailed provisions in the Bill, and I intend to adhere to that.  However, I make one point in relation to section 8.  It will be bad enough for anybody, particularly an innocent person, to be detained for six or 12 hours and it is envisaged in the Bill that a person should not be brought in for another six hours. However, that provision appears to be very loosely drafted.  It states:</P>
    <P>Subject to subsection (2), where a person detained pursuant to section 3 is released without having been charged with an offence he shall not be arrested again for the same offence except on the authority of a justice of the District Court...</P>
    <P>It is well to have the facility of the District Court and circumstances will arise under which the Garda will obtain additional information and need to speak to a person again.  However, they should not have the right, having once arrested a person, to arrest him again for any offence, at least for a period of time. Alternatively, if they are to have that right, it should be obligatory that they apply to a District Justice to obtain permission. The provision specifies the same offence, but a person could be arrested for another offence and there is no obligation on the Garda or on anybody else to tell the arrested person either the offence for which he has been arrested or the grounds for suspicion.  I do not believe that it will happen but, in theory, it is quite possible that a person could be brought in a dozen times in the course of a month, on different offences.  That can and should be changed.  The section should be amended to ensure that when the Garda want to bring in a person for a second time they have to go to the local <Col N="248" /> district justice to get authority and permission to do so.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the inference sections and shall confine my remarks to section 16, but these remarks will apply, in one way or another, to the other inference sections, 17 and 18.  First, without any doubt the proposal contained in section 16 is the most dramatic change ever proposed in our criminal legal system since the foundation of the State.  It is only as time has passed since this Bill was published that I have realised the enormity of the ramifications of this section.  It is very noticeable that when this Bill was published very few appreciated that this was the area where sweeping changes were proposed.  In recent times people have cottoned on to this dramatic change. They can read the section for themselves but I shall try to summarise what the section proposes.  In essence, it is to impose an obligation on persons when questioned to disclose to the Garda any information which they may have about any crime.  Such information which they are obliged to give may include information known to a person but not regarded by that person as material to the questions being put to him by the Garda.  Such disclosed information may be used against that person and inferences which may damage a person's defence can be made by judges and juries.</P>
    <P>The Minister may consider that I am being unfair in describing this section in these terms and will point to the various qualifications written into section 16. However, the fact remains that this section is so wide-ranging that we have to consider all areas of possibilities.  An obligation is being imposed on a person to give the Garda any information about any crime if he is ever interviewed by them.  If he does not give that information, and all of it, he is placing himself in some way at risk.  The right to silence &mdash; and this is what we are talking about &mdash; has been the cornerstone of our criminal legal system and it is not because it has been there for centuries that I have a problem as regards this section.  There is no doubt that the regime of the right to silence has weighed the scales of justice ludicrously in favour of an accused person <Col N="249" /> in some cases in the past.  It has enraged the Garda, with very good cause, that the value of the endless hours of work put into a case has been set at naught because of the technicalities of that system which gives the right to an accused person to remain silent.  This regime should be changed and I would highlight the fact that although other commentators say that there is no need for it, the need is there.  Eminent legal practitioners and academics here and in the United Kingdom have advocated a change in this regime of silence for some number of years now.</P>
    <P>I submit that there is need here of a scalpel in skilful hands to cut away the abuses and the bad parts of the present legislation.  This section is a demolition hammer which will devastate our present system and leave in its wake a void of uncertainty and confusion.  That must be avoided.  The Minister has said that this proposal in section 16 has &ldquo;intrinsic merit&rdquo;.  There is intrinsic merit in the idea which the Minister and his Department officials will have had in proposing this section, but frankly the effect of it is that we import into our legal system the worst aspects of other legal systems and marry them to the weakest parts of our own legal system.  Our legal system is an accusatorial one, whereby one party to the case in court has on him the onus of proving the case against the other.  Other countries use the inquisitorial system.  In some countries a citizen is obliged to come in to respond to questioning.  We are proposing to use that part of the system which obliges a person to answer questions without in any way ensuring that the person who asks the question is independent, or is somebody who can stand back from the system and who sits in a quasi-judicial capacity as opposed to a person who investigates and would prosecute after the investigation.</P>
    <P>The Barra Ó Briain Report was full of the difficulties that we are faced with in a system whereby gardaí have to interview people and those people claim afterwards that their so-called voluntary statements were not voluntary, that they were threatened, they were under duress and had to make them.  The Minister recognises <Col N="250" /> that because he acknowledges in the case of a person who is detained at some stage in the future that it is highly desirable that any interview which takes place between gardaí and that person be electronically recorded.  I believe the Minister is right but now we have a proposal which puts a person, who is not in detention, at risk.  Gardaí will be able to interview that person and afterwards, when the gardaí are giving evidence in court, they will be able to refer not only to the questions asked without there being any record of the questions and answers so that they might be the subject of agreement between the prosecution and the defendant, but they can say to the court that they asked this, that and the other question and the defendant did not give any answer or he said this or that.  The inevitable result will be constant disputes in court about what was said or what was not said even before a person was detained by the Garda, where ordinary questioning was in progress in regard to ordinary inquiries.  The system will be brought into bad repute because of this.  Our whole system will be made virtually unworkable by doing this.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that the section is a good one.  The Minister's speech did not spell out the a, b, c or d reasons for this proposal.  Unless his reasons are very good he should take out the section altogether. If the Minister gives us good reasons I want to say this to him.  If people are going to be obliged to answer certain questions, those questions must be asked by a person who is independent of the prosecution and of the defence.  That person must ask questions which will be recorded and invite answers that will be recorded so that the questions and answers will be available to the court in a written form and there will not be any room for dispute between the prosecution and the defence in relation to what questions were asked or were not asked. The Minister could do this in the Bill if he provided that the inference power which will exist in the courts in the future will only apply in serious cases.  There is no justification for it applying in minor cases in the District Court.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that this is the right <Col N="251" /> thing to do but if the Minister has reasons for doing this I suggest that at the preliminary hearing in indictable cases a district justice should ask the questions.  The prosecution should say that they have the following questions to ask the accused and they need answers to them.  In those circumstances the defendant will at least have had the benefit of legal advice if he wants it and he will also have the knowledge that whatever he says will be recorded; questions will have been recorded and afterwards there will not be any dispute about the questions asked and the answers given.</P>

      <P>The Deputy has certainly put the Minister on notice that he is not happy about this section.  It may be taken from what the Deputy has said that he will have a lot more to say about it on Committee Stage.  Perhaps it could be left for Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certainly prepared to do that but I wanted to highlight this. Several pages of the Bill are taken up with this proposal.  I have avoided the temptation of going into detail about it but, in fairness, I should spell out what my alternative proposal would be.  I am satisfied that I have done it.  There is one other point I want to make in relation to the inference section.  This came from a proposal that was to go into a Bill in the UK in 1972 and was subsequently rejected by the UK Parliament.  I want to refer to the report of the Royal Commission on Criminal Procedure, published in the UK in January 1981.  This report dealt in very considerable detail with this whole difficulty presented by the regime we have of the right to silence.  The commission gave two main difficulties which they saw in relation to interfering with this.  I would like to read those into the record of the House.  The commission stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two main difficulties would arise if the right of silence during investigation were to be modified in this way.  The modified caution proposed by the Criminal Law Revision Committee <Col N="252" /> would have been required to be given only when the suspect was charged or told that he might be prosecuted, that is when there is notionally, at least, sufficient admissable evidence available to the police to enable a prosecution to be mounted but it is difficult to see how the fact that silence at the point of charge would lead to damaging consequences for the suspect would not in practice affect the attitude of the police in their conduct of interviews prior to charge and the way that suspects would respond to questioning.  It might put strong (and additional) psychological pressure upon some suspects to answer questions without knowing precisely what was the substance of and evidence for, the accusations against them; and in consequence what they needed to tell the police in order to allay the suspicion against them.  This, in our view, might well increase the risk of innocent people, particularly those under suspicion for the first time, making damaging statements.  The risk may be small, but these things do occasionally occur.  On the other hand, the guilty person who knew the system would be inclined to sit it out.  If his arrest had been on reasonable suspicion only and this were not enough to make a <i>prima facie</i> case he would lose nothing and gain everything by keeping silent, since he would not be prosecuted if no other evidence emerged.  If the police had got sufficient evidence to mount a case without a statement from him, it would still be to the guilty suspect's advantage to keep to himself as long as possible a false defence which was capable of being shown to be such by investigation. It might just be believed by the jury despite the fact that the prosecution and the judge would be able, under the Criminal Law Revision Committee's proposals, to comment.</P>
    <P>The Royal Commission saw that this provision would actually be of advantage to the hardened criminal and would put the innocent person at risk.</P>
    <P>The second reason given is at paragraph 452 of the report and states:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="253" /> The majority of us does not accept that this would not unfairly prejudice the suspect.  Quite apart from the psychological pressures that such a change would place upon some suspects it would, in their view, amount to requiring a person during investigation to answer questions based upon possibly unsubstantiated and unspecific allegations or suspicion, even though he is not required to do that at the trial. Such a change could be regarded as acceptable only if, at a minimum, the suspect were to be provided at all stages of the investigation with full knowledge of his rights, complete information about the evidence available to the police at the time, and an exact understanding of the consequences of silence.  But that could only be done if the critical phase of investigation, that is the phase at which silence could be used adversely to the accused, was to become more structured and formal than it is now; in effect, responsibility for and conduct at this phase of the investigation close to charge, would have to become quasi judicial rather than a police function.</P>
    <P>This question was considered by Judge Ó Briain and he said it might be desirable to make changes in relation to the regime we have about the right to silence at the moment.  He claims:</P>
    <P>Such questions might relate to identity and address, marital status, explanation of stains on clothing, property (including money) found upon the suspect, an account of his dealings with a vehicle believed by the Gardaí to have been used in a crime, his movements for a specified period of time before and after the crime, and some other kindred questions to be set out in a statute and strictly limited.</P>
    <P>The proposal in the Bill is wide ranging, universal in its application and is not confined to serious crime.  There is no provision for recording any of the questions that might be asked or might not be asked or provision to ensure that a person might be advised before being launched into this.  In short, it is a wild and unthought <Col N="254" /> out proposal to change our existing system. Our existing system is not perfect but the proposals in the Bill will be so devastating in the changes they will bring about in our system that they will lead us into a situation of confusion and uncertainty. They will do more damage than anything else.</P>
    <P>I welcome some aspects of the Bill but I wonder whether we are approaching the problem in the right way.  The Garda, given that circumstance and the resources they have, do an incredible job but we do not take the opportunity to see what changes are needed not just in their powers but in their resources.  I have been struck by the fact that armed robberies which were such a problem some years ago are no longer the problem they were. What is the reason for that?  The Garda and the Minister will give as the reason for this the fact that a special task force was set up to deal with that problem. Since they went into operation they have worked successfully.  Although some of the provisions of the Bill are useful and good, I wonder if the powers being given to the Garda will help to deal with the detection of crime.  I am certain that the Garda will be helped to secure more convictions but the provisions will not do much to help them detect crime.  More technical and forensic resources would help the Garda to deal more effectively with the crime problem.</P>
    <P>At a meeting of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism recently I met Garda Commissioner Wrenn and some senior officers and I was struck by their remarks as to the problems that exist in certain parts of Dublin. For example in C District in Dublin 11,000 crimes, or 10 per cent of the country's total, were committed last year.  Of that figure 3,300 crimes went to the charge stage and of that number &mdash; I am not referring to individual criminals &mdash; 1,100 were juvenile committed crimes.  In that central area of Dublin the Garda are aware that about 200 young people are responsible for the vast majority of those crimes but about 40 or 50 of those young people are the main individuals behind the crimes.  This is not new.  It has been recognised for a number of years that this <Col N="255" /> group of 40 or 50 people are responsible and as those young people move on it is obvious there will be successors to take up the cudgel.</P>
    <P>I recall that Deputy Gerard Collins as Minister for Justice put forward the opening of Loughan House in Cavan as a solution to the problem.  That was a complete failure, a fiasco.  It was a bad idea at the start and it was recognised by many people as a hopeless venture.  It cost a fortune but did not achieve anything. Many of the 30 or 40 people I spoke of in C District have graduated to senior places in crime and Garda officers told us that many of the young people roaming around C District today will form the nub of the criminal class here in a few years' time.  What are we doing about that problem? I accept the Minister's sincerity and that he cannot do anything about this in terms of solving all of our economic and social problems but I am not suggesting that we must do that.  Parts of C District are rough and have economic and social problems that will not be resolved for many years, but the area has been identified as a problem by the Garda.  One of the main gangs in the area is led by a 13-year-old and I understand he is some operator.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity for us to do something in that area.  This should not be a Garda matter.  It is a social problem that could be tackled.  Loughan House was established because it was felt that juveniles like those operating in C District should be put away.  It is obvious that those young people lack parental control and the Garda, while they do not want them put behind bars, want them moved from their home environment where they are running wild.  In fact, we do not have any places to help such young people.  We have an obligation to deal with them and we should have places for them.  I do not wish to sound like a dogooder or a wildly socially concerned person but on a practical basis we have a problem in that major area of criminal activity in the country in that 1,100 of the crimes committed there last year were carried out by 40 or 50 young people.</P>
    <P>We know what we can do in that area <Col N="256" /> and we know also that if we do not do something we will face greater problems in the future.  Those who grow up in that type of environment will remain in the criminal industry because they will not have any other way to survive.  It may be that attempts were made to deal with that problem in the past and that people were frustrated in their efforts.  However, no reason has been given to the House and the matter was not referred to by the Minister.  I hope the Minister has an opportunity to refer to it when replying to the debate because this is a problem the Garda know of and complain about.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned a figure of £230 million for crime related services in his Department in 1983.  That is a lot of money and that is why it would make good sense to tackle the problem that has been identified.  As a law student between 1969 and 1971 I had the privilege of working in the Free Legal Advice Centre in Mountjoy Square and I was acquainted with such places as Gardiner Street, but I was saddened when I returned to that area to canvass support recently to discover that the situation has deteriorated. It seems that we have not come to understand the problem much less to do something to deal with it.  The problem was based in the centre of the city but it is creeping out slowly to the suburbs. People living on the edge of that constituency do not answer their door at night because of a fear of being attacked.  This is a major social problem but what I cannot understand is that, although we know what the problem is, we are unwilling to do something about it.  I accept that this is not a matter for the Minister for Justice entirely but it is a problem that must be tackled.  The provisions of the Bill will not help to deal with that problem. We need to put our thinking caps on and recognise that there is a lot more we can do to deal with the rising crime rate than give more powers to the police, the prosecution or the State.  Perhaps if we examined areas where we could increase resources for family-related services in the area about which I have spoken and thought out what we might do, we could achieve a great deal more.</P>
    <P>Even though in parts of my speech I <Col N="257" /> may have expressed the views that might lead people to believe I was in some way doubtful of the integrity of the Garda Force, I want to emphasise that I believe the work they have done in extraordinarily difficult circumstances over the past number of years has been absolutely superb.  We have been blessed by having a Garda Force that has never been armed, who have had to do very dangerous work in recent years.  They are very good.  But we should not think for a moment that merely because we give them more powers in this Bill we are really helping them along their way.  They need a lot more than that, a lot more support than that.  Let this be the first portion of what we are doing but there remains a lot more to be done.</P>
    <P>I know that the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Fennell, who has now joined us is somebody who is interested in that area and will ensure that something is done.  But all of us have a responsibility.  Perhaps before this debate concludes more people will have expressed views leading us to believe that there is a demand not just to give more powers to the police but to give them more help and indeed the community at large, particularly in the constituency in which a by-election has just been held.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>While I welcome an opportunity of contributing to any legislation in this House it was with some reluctance that I agreed to participate in this discussion. My contribution will be brief, reflecting the fact that I do not think much of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having read the debate so far, I find myself in the somewhat embarrassing position of being out of line with the main stream of thinking of my party on this Bill.  I am sorry about that; it is something that cannot be avoided.  I overheard a Fine Gael Party political broadcast the other day in relation to the Dublin Central by-election in which the Minister for Justice stated on national radio that he was putting a Criminal Justice Bill through the Dáil which would render the homes of people living in Dublin inner <Col N="258" /> city safer.  To describe that as being untrue would be too weak.  It is the exact reverse, a distortion of the truth.  If the Minister whom the Head of this Government has placed in charge of the Department of Justice really believes that, then this country is in a more sorry state than I had thought and those people who know me will know that as it is I am pessimistic about the country.</P>
    <P>This Bill represents the most insidious and far-reaching erosion of personal liberties since the foundation of the State. That is the price we are paying; that is the price the Government are paying, and to achieve what?  Nothing, in my opinion.  I do not intend to go into detailed Committee Stage points.  I do not want to pre-empt the input of my Party into the Committee Stage debate. If one looks at the various headings of sections of the Bill &mdash; for instance section 3 is headed &ldquo;Detention after arrest&rdquo;; section 4 &ldquo;Access to solicitor and notification of detention&rdquo;; section 5 &ldquo;Powers of Gárda Síochána in relation to detained person&rdquo;&mdash; one appreciates that all this Bill is dealing with is a situation in which somebody has actually been detained, apprehended or accused of something. What we must deal with is the growing crime wave, with people who are not being detected.  What we should be talking about are measures to prevent people committing crimes in the first place rather than giving the police substantial powers to deal with people once they have been apprehended, once the crime has been committed.</P>
    <P>The Government should be turning their attention to the prevention of the commission of crime, not giving these sinister, huge powers to the Garda Síochána to deal with people who have already committed crimes.  That is a defeatist approach.  The Government approach suggests that one cannot prevent crime, that one cannot stop these things happening, that what we need to do is to give the courts and the Garda Síochána power to deal with people who have committed these crimes, or allegedly committed them.</P>
    <P>The central problem in relation to the <Col N="259" /> administration of criminal justice here is not that people are walking away from Garda stations or from the courts on a technicality.  The problem is that these crimes are being committed at an ever-increasing rate.  Naturally as the crime rate increases so the detection rate drops, is dropping and has been for some time past.</P>
    <P>The second central problem here is that, once a person has been convicted of crime and sentenced to a period of imprisonment there is a severe overcrowding accommodation problem in our prisons.  I had the unhappy experience about six months ago in relation to a constituent of mine of having to make strong representations to the local chief superintendent in Limerick to actually get that person into prison to serve his sentence because the Garda were showing some reluctance to pick up the person in question.  Having made representations to the chief superintendent the local sergeant called on the family in question and informed the young lad that if he had a hair cut, shaved himself, packed his case and presented himself at St. Patrick's Institution, looking as respectable as possible, they might accept him.  That is the second problem we encounter in relation to the administration of criminal justice.</P>
    <P>What is the response of the Government and of the Minister for Justice to both of those problems?  The response to the problem of the ever-increasing crime rate is to give the Garda increased powers to deal with the people who have been apprehended, a typical political, gallery-playing response with no effort being made to deal with the central problem, that being the rising crime rate itself. Rather: play to the gallery, it looks good; we are doing something about crime; we are going to render the homes of the people in Dublin central safe again, we will make the streets safe to walk again by giving the Garda increased powers to deal with people who have committed crimes.  The streets will not be safe to walk while people commit those crimes. What do the provisions of this Bill do about that?  Nothing.  It deals with the <Col N="260" /> situation after the crime has been committed.</P>
    <P>The response to the second problem, that of prison accommodation is especially cynical.  This sort of approach of successive Governments is bringing this House and the general democratic process into disrepute.  The Minister is fully aware that there is a severe accommodation problem in our prisons.  His response is to give the courts power to mete out longer maximum sentences.  Yet there is no place in which to accommodate criminals; that has not been solved. The courts are given power to send people away for longer periods, if they so wish, but the real problem is that there is nowhere to put them.</P>
    <P>If one looks at section 13 which deals with the increase of penalties for certain firearms offences one finds there, in subsection (1), a typical example of this type of political cynicism and gallery-playing. That subsection reads:</P>
    <P>Section 15 of the Firearms Act, 1925, as amended by section 21 (4) of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Act, 1976, (possessing firearm or ammunition with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property) is hereby amended by the substitution, for &ldquo;imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years&rdquo;, of &ldquo;imprisonment for life&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If a person is convicted under that section he or she can be sentenced to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 14 years. The response of the Minister for Justice to this problem is to increase the maximum period for which a person can be imprisoned from 14 years to imprisonment for life.  What is called in the business the average &ldquo;lifer&rdquo; serves a period of between eight and ten years.  The Minister for Justice knows that well.  It constitutes no response, means nothing but is sheer cynicism, mere window-dressing to insert a provision implying that we are now dealing with this problem, because, to date, the maximum term of imprisonment was 14 years.  Now they can be sentenced to life imprisonment.  That is our solution to the problem.  Up to now they could only be sentenced to 14 years. <Col N="261" /> We changed that by bringing in a provision whereby they can be sentenced for a period which averages between eight and ten years.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Molony indicated, and I was delighted to hear him saying so, this Bill will do nothing to solve the basic problems of our crime rate and the administration of criminal justice.  The Bill does nothing to deal with the rising crime rate, the fear in our streets and homes and the problem of people who, having been sentenced for offences involving a great deal of violence, are allowed out again after serving a month or two of their sentences because there is no room for them.  These matters are not dealt with in the Bill, nevertheless civil liberties are seriously eroded.  The Minister for Justice stated that he has the balance right between the rights of the individual and the protection of the community. The balance is not right and, if the Minister for Justice is not aware of this, I am pessimistic about our country's future.  The balance was still weighted in favour of the authorities before this Bill was brought in.  It is now weighted much more in favour of the authorities and all to achieve nothing.  That is the tragedy of this legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies on the opposite side have mentioned section 16.  Whilst I do not want to make points which would be more appropriate on Committee Stage, I want to look very briefly at the implications of that section for the administration of criminal justice.  On one interpretation, the section could mean nothing. It allows the courts to draw such inferences as are proper.  What does that mean?  I doubt if even the Minister knows.  On the other hand, on another interpretation, the section could result in the invidious situation that even momentary forgetfulness of the smallest fact will inevitably lead to conviction.  Almost any word in that section is open to question. For instance subsection (3) (a) states that nothing in this section shall, in any proceedings, &ldquo;prejudice the admissibility in evidence of the silence or other reaction of the accused...&rdquo;.  What does &ldquo;other reaction of the accused&rdquo; mean?  Unemployment has reached 200,000, crime is <Col N="262" /> escalating and yet these words seem to indicate that a person's facial expression can be used in evidence against him.  Section 16 is a large, sinister section which erodes and destroys civil liberties and human rights that have existed from time immemorial and, as I have said, achieves nothing.  The legislation is meaningless in terms of achievement, it cannot and will not achieve anything.</P>
    <P>Despite Deputy Molony's eloquent protestations, he is determined to vote in favour of the Bill even if it remains in its original form.  The possibility is, unfortunately, that the Bill will pass through this House, be signed by the President and become law.  The Bill purports to give vastly increased powers to the Garda Síochána.  The average training period for a Garda is about 22 weeks and is largely concerned with physical training. Surely people who already have substantial power and who are being given increased powers and responsibilities should be subjected to a longer period of training and also a different type of training? I understand that a probation officer must have a university degree in order to carry out his or her duties.  If that is so, surely gardaí with this vast panoply of increased powers should have at least a longer period of probation and a different type of training from that which they now receive?</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony also referred to the provision in the Bill whereby the Minister may provide for the electronic recording of questioning.  He pre-empted what I wanted to say on that and it disturbs me that the Bill says that the Minister may make regulations which provide for this. If the Minister is committed, as he has stated he is, to introducing electronic or other recording of questioning as one of the necessary checks and balances to offset some of the more draconian provisions in the Bill, why does he not do so? There are examples of legislation &mdash; I cannot recall them now &mdash; where the Minister may provide for this or may make regulations for that and the Minister never made the relevant regulations. I should like the Minister for Justice to indicate whether it is true that the Department of Justice and members of <Col N="263" /> the Garda Síochána said that they would not be prepared to work that system and that that is why we have this window dressing section which states that the Minister may do something which he has no intention of doing.  I should like a clear, unambiguous reply to that.</P>
    <P>Since this legislation will cause fundamental damage to our system of criminal jurisprudence and will do nothing even to begin to solve crime, I want to make one or two remarks on how I think the Government should be approaching the solution of that problem.  There is a large area of jurisprudence and criminology which states that all crime arises inevitably from social and economic conditions and factors.  I agree with that but we have a problem on the ground, as it were, which we must deal with and try to control. The Government should be encouraging the idea of community policing and all parties should adopt a uniform approach to this idea.  I am convinced, representing a constituency which is largely urban and which has a vast and escalating crime rate, especially in the area of violent crime, that this is the direction in which we will have to move in the future.  It is long past the time when we should be sitting down to work out an intelligent all-party approach to this and making some concrete proposals in that area.</P>
    <P>The prison accommodation problem is of concern to all of us.  Some time ago I suggested that if the Government could not see their way to becoming involved in increased capital expenditure for additional buildings in which to accommodate prisoners, they might give some thought to converting to prison use some of the disused Army barracks of which there are a large number throughout the country. One would hope that any such move would be only on a temporary basis and that we would not continue indefinitely to need extra prison accommodation.</P>
    <P>It has been said that justice is often tortured where the law is done.  This Bill represents a torturing of the law in a misguided and ill-conceived attempt to do justice.  The Bill is wrong-headed and involves a great price in terms of civil <Col N="264" /> liberties without achieving anything tangible. It is my personal view that it should be opposed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the two previous speakers and having attempted to interpret the various submissions that we have all received from the interested bodies during the past few weeks, it is my intention, as a non-legal person, to deal with the Bill only in its broadest terms.</P>
      <P>I recognise the need for a new Criminal Justice Bill but in introducing such legislation we must not ignore the underlying reasons for the increase in crime in recent years.  I do not agree with the easy response that public opinion is in favour of a crackdown on crime and that consequently these new measures must be welcomed.  Public opinion is very fickle so that while a Government may be applauded at one stage for the introduction of certain measures they can be condemned later for having introduced those same measures.  Therefore, it is silly to take advantage of the increase in the rate of crime in order to give a free hand to the Government to put the Bill through the House.  I do not wish to be taken as saying that there is no need for the Bill but I am making the point that I have reservations about certain sections in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill has been introduced against the background of a steady increase in crime.  I recall speaking at the Speakers Club in Cork more than 12 months ago when the theme of the debate was the triumph of crime.  For the purposes of my contribution I had to rely on the figures that had been released for the previous year, 1981.  These figures showed that there was a 23 per cent increase in crime compared with the 1980 figures and that the biggest increase, 27 per cent, was in respect of larcenies.  As the Bill was introduced here we received the report of the Garda Commissioner concerning the crime figures for 1982.  This showed a further 10 per cent increase in the figures. What was most disturbing was that it showed that 5.7 per cent of the population in Dublin as against 3 per cent in Cork were involved in crime.  Unfortunately, the increase is greater in the urban <Col N="265" /> areas and Cork is no exception in that respect.</P>
    <P>In examining the statistics we find that many of the crimes committed were against the least protected and the least well off, against the aged and the young. In the urban areas car stealing and drug pushing are now major problems but many of these crimes can be attributed to social problems.  A previous speaker said that we were one of the most policed states in the world.  He gave figures to indicate that we have three policemen per 1,000 of the population as against a figure of 1.8 in the US.</P>
    <P>In stemming the increase in crime we must find a solution for some of the social problems that lead to crime.  I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation to the Minister for Justice for granting us permission, after many years, for two further Garda stations in the Gurranabraher and Mayfield areas of Cork.</P>
    <P>There are many factors that are said to lead to crime.  It can be said that crime results either from personal, environmental or economic stress.  I find that a good deal of crime resulting from personal stress is committed because of a breakdown in family units and very much because of a breakdown in parental control. Some of the cases that I have come across resulted from drink problems within the family.  On the question of environmental stress, I am amazed at the cutbacks at local authority level in spending on recreational facilities.  Any such cutback is shortsighted because it has been proved that the availability of these facilities is a major factor in keeping young people on the straight and narrow. The major problem of unemployment is the biggest contributing factor so far as economic stress is concerned.  Lack of employment is the cause of so many young people engaging in crime.  Talking of young people, I think we must all agree that drug abuse is one of the major sources of concern.  This is a problem that has been increasing in recent years.  The figures in respect of the seizure of drugs is a good barometer of the demand for them.  In 1981 there were 1,200 seizures and in 1982 the corresponding figure was 1,900.  The recent seizure of drugs in <Col N="266" /> Dublin and in the south-east prove that there is a huge demand for drugs.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Government are facing up to this very serious drugs problem. The setting up of the Special Task Force and the issuing of their findings are to be welcomed.  In regard to preventing the importation and sale of drugs, we could fall into the trap of spending vast amounts of money in this way while avoiding tackling the underlying factors that contribute to drug abuse.  However, the task force are placing a high reliance on health education in this whole area. They are in favour of health education being added to all school curricula.  The underlying principle when dealing with drugs is that we must eliminate the need for and reduce the number of people using drugs.  There must be no future for the drug pusher.</P>
    <P>I know that I have deviated slightly from the reasons for the increase in crime.  In getting back to the main point we must divide crime into categories: offences against property and offences against the person.  More often than not the person who commits a crime against the person has graduated from less serious crime against property.  Offences against property are usually in the form of vandalism and petty theft such as shoplifting. I came across some very interesting figures recently when talking to some people involved in shop security. The major incidence of shoplifting occurs among young people from 12 to 16 years of age on their way home from school. That statement indicates ever-decreasing parental control.  It must be obvious to parents that goods coming into the home cannot be purchased by the children who bring them in.  After the age of 16 the incidence of shoplifting decreases. Another interesting point was that the incidence of shoplifting increases in females over the age of 36 for some reason or other.  Perhaps somebody will do a thesis on the reasons for these figures at some stage.</P>
    <P>In dealing with offences against the person we are dealing with robbery with violence and personal assaults.  This type of offence is increasing alarmingly in both urban and rural areas and our present <Col N="267" /> system is not successful in preventing this type of crime, though we must give due credit to the Garda: the detection rate is high, the figure given to me is something like 70 per cent detection.</P>
    <P>Why is crime increasing and what can be done?  One of the reasons crime is on the increase is that the State is becoming more divided between the advantaged and disadvantaged.  I have said that before now and I have no hesitation in saying it again.  Real poverty is becoming far more widespread than it was previously. Poverty is not just the lack of money.  It must be defined and it was defined very well in a thesis put forward by Townsend in 1979 when he dealt with poverty in the UK.  He said that poverty was a lack of command of resources, including cash, income, material assets and publicly organised services such as housing and education, so extreme that the individual, family or person involved is excluded from minimum acceptable ordinary living patterns, customs and activities.  That is dealing with poverty in the widest sense.  Poverty in the form of lack of job opportunities, unemployment, and poverty in the form of lack of recreational facilities must be behind the increase in crime.</P>
    <P>Unless persons committing the less serious types of offences are weaned off crime at an early stage they will graduate quickly to more serious crime and will eventually graduate to serious crime against the individual or person.  Crime can be prevented only by tackling the social, environmental and recreational conditions that encourage crime in the first place.  A report from the NESC in 1981 on the problems of urbanisation stated that, if cities do not begin to deal constructively with crime, crime will deal destructively with cities.  We must all agree with that.  Therefore, the basic causes of poverty must be eliminated.  As long as people are deprived of basic job opportunities and basic recreational facilities the temptation to indulge in minor crime and then far more serious crime will be too great to overcome.  To date, unfortunately, the factors underlying poverty have not been successfully tackled, <Col N="268" /> and with the increase in unemployment and the neglect shown by local authorities in the provision of basic facilities it seems that this country is destined to see an ever-increasing rise in the crime rate.</P>
    <P>It also seems that successive Governments have not been prepared to deal in a humane way with the causes of criminality as our present courts system is geared to a more punitive solution, and to me as a lay person it does not seem to have a great awareness of why people revert time and time again to crime.  Also it is accepted that the experience gained at an early stage in crime means that a person becomes more and more involved in it.  The legal and judicial systems as we have seen them in operation in recent times are not helping the situation.  We need a courts system that will deal swiftly with hardened criminals, sentences should be served fully and, as the previous speaker, Deputy O'Dea, said, this is not happening at present, and he put forward his own solutions for that.</P>
    <P>The system of bail is totally unsatisfactory. Figures show that many crimes are committed by individuals on bail.  I welcome the measure in the Bill which relates to this matter and I will deal with it later when dealing with the sections.</P>
    <P>Before dealing with the Bill itself I must say that a number of unusual and inconsistent judicial decisions recently do not inspire public confidence in the administration of justice or in the Judiciary's determination to stamp out crime. We all must demand that a greater discipline be present within the structure of the legal profession.  Greater use must be made by the courts of professional services, such as psychologists and welfare officers.  This is beginning to happen. Unfortunately, there is a belief among the public at present that we operate a two-tier system of justice and, even though high standards are expected in high places, the public are saying to me&mdash;and I as a public representative must listen&mdash;that they are not getting these high standards they are expecting.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the judicial system, which must be looked at in dealing with the overall problem of crime, the archaic <Col N="269" /> ways of Irish justice are now notorious. There is a belief among the public that they are enjoyed by those who are part of the system and detested by those who are denied justice because they cannot afford the costs or have not the resources or knowledge to use the system.  Unfortunately, calls for reform of the system are made from time to time but these calls are quickly swallowed up and have been stonewalled by the legal system itself and &mdash; shame on us &mdash; killed by the indifference of political parties who tend to treat law reform as a technical issue of no great electoral appeal.  Not being an expert in the legal profession and having no legal knowledge, I am not trying to wash my hands of this but I am greatly handicapped in attempting to grasp this problem.  One finds it hard to get advice on how to approach it and one meets also great resentment from the profession.</P>
    <P>However, it is obvious that certain action must be taken.  There must be a section within the Department of Justice to look at legal services in general, especially legal costs, and the manner in which barristers and solicitors operate the system. I should like to know what is the real role of the Law Reform Commission. They seem to have inadequate resources and my impression &mdash; the impression of a layman who happens to be a politician &mdash; is that they are just fiddling around with minor issues.  They are not tackling the real problems of the legal system. They will only tackle controversial issues when they are dumped upon them because of the weight of public opinion.</P>
    <P>In my short time as a public representative &mdash; three years, of which I have spent two years in this House &mdash; I have had many complaints in relation to the administration of justice.  In the last session when I spoke here about the performance of judges I was told there is a tradition that we do not criticise the Judiciary. There is a fear that by being critical we may undermine the whole system.  I can see the dangers inherent in this and I accept that point but it must not prevent us from having a critical look at the matter.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand the traditions of <Col N="270" /> this House with regard to the Judiciary. Members of the judiciary are not doing a job that is different to that done by most other people.  To me they are the distributors of justice, as the bread delivery man is the distributor of bread.  Justice is a public service and it must be administered fairly and consistently.  The public must be informed of what monitoring takes place with regard to the performance of judges and if no monitoring takes place they must be told the reason. Such monitoring is carried out in other countries.  I should like the Minister in his reply to deal with this problem.  It is part of the reason there is disrespect for the law and, as a result, an increase in the crime rate.  I should also like to know what formal training justices are given before they are appointed, in addition to their qualification as barrister or solicitor.</P>
    <P>My own impression is that a big mistake was made when the State was founded when we took on the British judicial system instead of looking at the American and continental systems.  In my brief examination of the different systems I found there was much in other systems that would be attractive to our way of life.  However, I know there are other aspects of continental justice that would be alien to us and this point was mentioned earlier by Deputy Molony.  The system in Britain was a throw-back to the 17th century, but in fairness to that country they have set out to streamline the system.  However, we have taken very little action in this area.  A total review of civil procedures is long overdue.  As was pointed out by my colleagues from Cork, the symptoms of the problems have surfaced. There have been long delays in the High Court and in the Circuit Courts, especially in the Cork region.  Such delays are intolerable and are causing severe hardship to people.</P>
    <P>The position as it affects Cork has been clearly set out already.  Much poverty and hardship has been caused to certain families, especially where the bread-winner has been affected by an accident.  It is tragic and is a reflection on everyone that the way of life of a family can be affected for years because we cannot streamline the administration of justice.  There has <Col N="271" /> been a failure on the part of State agencies to provide an adequate service and I am asking that this be dealt with as soon as possible.  I have had discussions with the Minister for Justice and there has been an indication from him that he is committed to improving the situation as soon as possible.  However, every month that goes by increases the suffering of people throughout the country, and especially in my city, Cork.</P>
    <P>I should like to support fully the statement made by Deputy Lenihan in this House on 16 November when he said that, however welcome the principle of the Criminal Justice Bill, it acts only as an umbrella.  I echo his sentiments that the real work will have to be in the area of administrative performance.  In other words, the work methods of the Garda Síochána must be more effective, the prisons must be able to cater adequately for those convicted and the courts and the judicial system must work in an efficient manner.  This means better training, more sophisticated equipment, greater manpower and a more sophisticated approach by the Garda.</P>
    <P>In the area of the courts we need more court sittings, more judges and more courtrooms.  Cases must be brought to trial more speedily.  The time is long overdue for the reform of our legal and judicial systems.  This can only be achieved by the efforts of all concerned, including the Incorporated Law Society and the body representing the barristers.  Avoidable delays and unnecessary expense must be identified and there must be consultations between lawyers and other users of the system.  I cannot understand why people who may be affected by the system are not consulted and brought into the decision-making process.  I see a role for a body such as the Confederation of Irish Industry who are affected by outmoded legal practices and I cannot understand why they are not brought into the consultation process.</P>
    <P>Law reform should be an ongoing process, but at the moment it is hardly moving. Although complaints abound, there is no momentum for reform from industry, politicians or those utilising the system. <Col N="272" /> There is a responsibility on all concerned, including industry, to indicate clearly their requirements.  There is an onus on politicians to provide the procedures that will enable legislation to be passed quickly.  I know from statements made this week by the President of the Incorporated Law Society that at long last they are committed &mdash; in theory at least, I have yet to see what they will do in practice &mdash; to law reform and to look into the working procedures of their members.  I hope everyone involved will tackle this serious problem.  Otherwise the confidence of the public in our legal structures will evaporate.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at length with the question of examining the underlying reasons for the increase in the crime rate.  It was strange to hear a previous speaker, a member of my party, state that the unemployment problem is one which no Government can successfully tackle, but the problem of law and order is one which should and must be resolved.  Despite the new Criminal Justice Bill and the increases in the Garda force, there will be no resolution of our crime situation until our social problems are dealt with.</P>
    <P>Since the publication of this Bill every Deputy has been lobbied by various opinions. People have expressed their fear and mistrust and are of the opinion that the trust which has been slowly built up between the community and the Garda will be eroded because of this Bill. Deputy O'Dea mentioned community policing, a suggestion put forward by one of the Garda representative bodies earlier this year.  This whole area must be looked at and I hope the Minister will deal with it and give his views sometime.</P>
    <P>There was a debate in Cork last year where it was said that crime was triumphing. I must agree with that.  It is against that background and the background that our laws are not effective and were not designed to deal with the present problem that this Bill was introduced.  However, in drafting new laws we must ensure that we do not impinge on the rights of individuals.  We must deal with the problems facing us by bringing about social justice and not by narrowing people's personal liberties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="273" /> As a lay person I will attempt to deal with this Bill.  I have studied the briefs given to me and have tried to put in written form what I believe to be correct. In dealing with this Bill, in case an impression is given to the contrary, I must express my admiration for our Garda force who are unarmed and have won the admiration of the world because of their commitment to the implementation of law.  Many gardaí have lost their lives because of that commitment.  The Garda have insufficient manpower and technology and have been doing a very good job. There have been exceptions, but there are bad members in every profession and organisation.  Despite all the drawbacks, the Garda have served the country well and have behaved admirably in carrying out their duties.</P>
    <P>The Minister introduced this Bill some weeks ago and all Members must compliment him for his application to the job to which he was appointed.  We have heard a great deal of talk about the need for a new Criminal Justice Bill.  Each of the Minister's predecessors has been either unwilling or did not apply himself to bring a Bill before the House.  I am also pleased to note that the Minister is committed to tackling this problem of crime.  He put forward his views in his speech but he said he was prepared to listen to proposals and amendments from the House.  I hope he is.</P>
    <P>First, I will deal with the sections of the Bill which I welcome.  I have already dealt with sections 9 to 11 which deal with offences committed while the accused is on bail.  I welcome them because they were long overdue.  Sections 12 and 13 deal with the theft of motor cars and offences involving firearms.  These measures are long overdue because the incidence of armed robbery with violence involving stolen cars is on the increase. This pastime which is indulged in by so many young people in our urban areas has to be stopped.  Therefore an increase in penalties may be a deterrent.  I cannot understand how car manufacturers have failed to lessen the incidence of car thefts. It is beyond belief that we can put people on the moon but we cannot solve this problem.  We are told that the micro-chip <Col N="274" /> and new technology have brought new inventions but we are still left with the problem of car thefts.  Even new cars coming on the market have the old fashioned steering lock appliances which are useless.  We must look at the standards of car assembly and either the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism or the Minister for Justice must insist that the new technology at our disposal be applied to this very serious problem.</P>
    <P>Section 19 deals with trial procedures and covers the situation where an accused puts forward an alibi.  Under this Bill he must give notice of his intention to do so. This is a welcome departure from the present practice because the introduction of last minute alibis was undesirable and had to be stopped.</P>
    <P>Section 24 deals with the proposal to adopt majority verdicts in criminal jury trials.  This too is welcome but the safeguard is still there because we require ten out of 12 jury members to convict.  Section 26 deals with the introduction of tape recording and video recording of interviews in Garda stations.  I find that hard to understand.  I acknowledge that there must be safeguards to protect the individual, but in the case of most minor crimes now, the Garda will find it very difficult to get even an admission of guilt because we will have a very formalised situation.</P>
    <P>A point I overlooked but which Deputy Molony made me aware of, is that this proposal will be introduced later; it is not to be introduced in this part of the Bill.  I would like the Minister to clarify that point further and to go into it in more detail in his reply.</P>
    <P>Now I will deal with the sections which caused me some problems.  Before I deal with section 3 I would like to quote Sergeant John O'Brien who wrote in the recent <i>Garda Review:</i></P>
    <P>Compounding all the difficulties faced by the Gardaí was the lack of any powers of detention except those included in the Offences Against the State Act, 1939 for a narrow schedule of offences which, incidentally, did not include murder.  So Gardaí found themselves in the situation where there <Col N="275" /> was very little power of detention and no power to put leading questions to a suspected person and require a response to be given.  All this while being subject to the most microscopic scrutiny in the Courts of Law and all against the background of a steadily increasing crime rate and falling detection rate.  In consequence of this situation criminals were able to go free simply by refusing to answer any questions or offer explanation and slowly but surely this strategy was adopted by all leading criminals.  In short, the criminal had to be caught red-handed before there was a likelihood of conviction. Evidence gathered as a result of interview by the garda was badly hampered and evidence procured in this way was usually contested vigorously and often outrageously at the subsequent trial.</P>
    <P>This statement by Sergeant O'Brien gives the impression that at present gardaí have no powers of detention.  The statement may have been made in all sincerity but it gives the wrong impression.  My information is that in 70 per cent of cases brought to court there is either a signed statement or a verbal admission.  Another statistic is that 15 per cent of criminals are caught red-handed and 20 per cent of professional criminals cannot be convicted due to other factors.  The statement in the <i>Garda Review</i> that the Garda need to be able to detain people in order to question them is not borne out by these facts.</P>
    <P>Criminal cases may be divided into three categories &mdash; minor offences, non-minor offences and offences against the State.  The latter cases are tried in the Special Criminal Court and minor offences are tried in the District Court.  All non-minor offences except murder and treason are tried in the Circuit Criminal Court or, at the option of the Director of Public Prosecutions, in the Central Criminal Court.  In non-minor offences the procedure consists of a preliminary examination in the District Court and if the justice is satisfied that a sufficient case <Col N="276" /> has been made by the DPP he returns the accused to the appropriate Circuit Criminal Court or the Central Criminal Court for trial, except in the extremely rare cases where the accused pleads guilty in the District Court.  In this case the DPP is obliged to prepare and serve on the accused and the District Court a book of evidence.  This contains statements of evidence by the various witnesses and any written or verbal confession by the accused.</P>
    <P>The Garda argue that at present they have no opportunity to question the suspect once he has been arrested, but it appears that 70 per cent of books of evidence contain either written or verbal confessions.  I find it hard to understand the reasons for increased powers of detention.  I would ask the Minister to say how many books of evidence produced by the DPP since the establishment of this office in 1974 contain written or verbal confessions.  Would the Minister be prepared to obtain this information from the office of the DPP through the auspices of the Attorney General's office?  I should also like to know what percentage of books of evidence contain direct evidence of criminals being caught red-handed by the Garda.  Could the Minister give information on the other books of evidence produced and the type of evidence put forward in these cases?  I want to find out whether my information is correct and to reconcile the contradictory statement that the Garda need these powers in order to get written or verbal admissions while 70 per cent of books of evidence already contain written or verbal confessions.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also state how many cases of trial by jury in the Central Criminal Court since the establishment of the office of DPP in 1974 where an alleged confession, either written or verbal, has been challenged on the grounds of oppression or violence have the jury acquitted or disagreed on the verdict. Has the Minister given careful consideration to the effects of the proposed changes on the jury who will be determining a case?  If under present laws there are more acquittals and disagreements, does it not naturally follow that the problems <Col N="277" /> raised by the carrying out of the new proposals will be greater unless we have satisfactory or acceptable corroborative evidence?  I am trying to put the matter in the best way I can.  If some of the terminology used is inaccurate, the questions are still valid.</P>
    <P>This leads to the question of access to a solicitor under a section 3 detention. The presence of a solicitor is necessary and the use of electronic equipment is essential, despite some reservations I have about it.  The presence of such equipment may at times make the whole procedure so formalised that it will be impossible to get the simplest statement on a minor matter.  The primary concern in a criminal trial will be to satisfy the requirements of a jury, having regard to the principle of fairness and fair procedures. The intention of all of us is to enhance the prospect of securing convictions and we must take special care to consider the real requirements of juries. The evidence offered to a jury will be written or verbal confessions or the conclusions reached by different people from the facts established in the case.  If under the present system juries are reluctant to rely on confessions, it follows that their apprehension will increase proportionately because of the increased powers of the Garda.  The procedure will be counter-productive in dealing with serious crime, especially when one remembers that the jury must be satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt of the guilt of the person before them.  We must remove such doubt because failure to do so could precipitate an even greater crisis in the criminal justice system.</P>
    <P>When a citizen is detained the garda in charge has to inform him of his right to consult a solicitor.  I may be going into some detail which would be more appropriate on Committee Stage, but it is important to air this at an early stage. The accused has to be informed of his right to consult a solicitor.  If a prisoner requests the garda to contact Mr. X who is a solicitor, there is an onus on the garda to contact that solicitor as soon as possible. In recent weeks I have spoken to gardaí and lawyers and people who have been involved with the law, and the <Col N="278" /> impression I got was that many arrests are made late in the evening, or outside the business hours of solicitors.  My impression may be mistaken but I think I am correct.</P>
    <P>What does &ldquo;as soon as possible&rdquo; mean in those circumstances?  Does it mean the solicitor is notified after the period of detention has expired?  If so, the safeguard in section 4 becomes meaningless. If the prisoner is informed of his right to consult a solicitor and makes no such request to the garda, he is free at his trial to allege that he was not informed of his right, or that he requested a consultation and the garda refused to comply with his request.  I presume that, in a situation like that, the statement of the accused would be contradicted and the garda would be supported by other members of the Garda.  The jury would have difficulty in coming to a conclusion.  Therefore, it is important that a very critical appraisal should be carried out on the operation of the proposed system.</P>
    <P>As a result of the question marks over the application of the section, we have a responsibility to make sure that it is modified. The solicitor requested may be unavailable, and I suggest that a panel of solicitors should be available on a 24-hour basis.  A solicitor would then have access to the prisoner and he could ensure that the prisoner was not placed at a disadvantage in relation to the Garda.  If this were done the Garda would have a stronger hand in trying to convince the jury that everything that needed to be done was done, and the rights of the individual were protected.  Before the Bill is passed, the Incorporated Law Society should indicate that they will ask their members to be available to serve on such a panel.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molony dealt at length with the whole question of detention.  I am surprised that the Ó Briain Report has been ignored and that no safeguard has been introduced to protect gardaí and the people detained against subsequent allegations of abuse.  Deputy Molony mentioned the question of custodial guardians. That suggestion in the Ó Briain Report has to be looked at by the Minister, and the Minister has to give some <Col N="279" /> reasons why he has ignored that recommendation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the procedures for bringing hardened criminals before the courts, I am worried about the fact that in practice people can be held for 20 hours in a Garda station even though the initial holding period is six hours.  I will not detain the House by going through all the procedures.  The legal profession have made a number of submissions on this Bill and I ask them to address themselves to the problems in those sections.</P>
    <P>Section 16 has been dealt with adequately by Deputy Molony.  I consider it a somewhat frightening measure which must be thought out a bit better than it has been to date.  On my reading, it abolishes a fundamental right which exists at present and changes totally a basic principle in our present law.  Deputy Molony raised certain serious questions which need to be answered.</P>
    <P>To sum up my feelings on the Bill, some of the powers contemplated in it would not have been tolerated some years ago.  Under the Bill people can be brought into Garda stations on suspicion and photographed and finger-printed. This is a very retrograde step, but unfortunately it is a sign of the times.  People opposing this Bill must remember the ugliness which has prevailed in this country in recent years.  We must not allow this ugliness to stampede us into taking steps we may regret later.</P>
    <P>The public are demanding more effectiveness in the apprehending of criminals. The prevention of crime should be the operative words.  Preventing crime by apprehending criminals and their organisations is very important, but it is also important to prevent crime by doing more work with people who commit crimes and with their victims.  We must make sure that the parole and probation systems are such that a person is less likely to commit a crime again.</P>
    <P>It has been said that prisons can be a university of crime where people learn more about crime while serving their sentences rather than how to avoid it.  All members of the public are interested in making sure that their neighbourhoods <Col N="280" /> are crime free.  When we see a criminal being apprehended, we are not so much interested in what he will experience as punishment, as in whether he will get out and steal or injure people again.  The Garda Force must be given help and support, and their educational standards and qualifications must be constantly improved as they have been in other countries.  They must be seen to be part of the community and identified with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe dealt with that aspect in speaking about community policing, but more important is the prevention of the sources of crime &mdash; those factors operating in society which lead to families being disrupted or split up.  What we require is a more professional approach to the prevention of crime, not talking off the tops of our heads.  We must give the subject more thought than just the introduction of punitive measures.  Steps must be taken which are based on fact and we must look at the lessons learned by other countries.  We must turn our attention to families at risk where repeated episodes of crime take place and the Department of Justice must pay heed to the provision of services to all the children of such families if we are not to have crime continuing from generation to generation.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for the constant up-grading of the Garda and prison officers so that they are working on a prevention programme and not fighting society's more basic instincts by punitive measures.  There is a grave need for the Minister to outline in detail his proposals for the introduction of a procedure for handling complaints against the Garda Síochána.  This is in the interests of everybody including the Garda, because at times I get the impression that an effort is being made by a section of our community to undermine our confidence in the Garda.  In fairness to the Garda force, to whom I have paid tribute earlier, these proposals must be spelt out in detail. More important, they have to be spelt out to every Member of this House so that we can come to a conclusion about this Bill.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see, in one of the Garda magazines recently, that the Garda are <Col N="281" /> on record as saying that they welcome the proposals and the procedures put forward for the handling of complaints against the Garda force by the Association of Civil Liberties and that they will accept the proposals put forward, with a few minor changes.  It is most important, therefore, that the Minister spell out in detail his proposals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Harney</NameTxt>
      <P>Like those who have spoken before me, I welcome the opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I shall begin by quoting from a famous speech made by Senator Edward Kennedy in June, 1977, as follows:</P>
      <P>You did not make the world you live in but you have the chance to change it, to leave it better than you found it.</P>
      <P>We, the legislators, have made an appallingly bad job of fighting the crime wave in our cities and towns over the past number of years.  This Bill will in no way contribute to ending the rampant rise in crime in recent years.  Despite serious changes in the demographic structure of our population from 1926 to the present time, we have made no radical changes in our legal, judicial or prison system or in the method of recruiting, training and promoting the Garda Síochána.  Is it not strange that in 1983 we still apply the Larceny Act of 1916, the Forgery Act of 1913, the Offences against the Person Act of 1891 and the Children Act of 1908?  It is an appalling reflection on us that we have failed to do anything to up-date fundamental legislation relevant to this subject of crimes in our society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have, piecemeal, from time to time introduced measures into the Dáil and explained them to the public as measures which will help to fight crime.  No subject has been debated more in recent weeks than law and order, particularly in Dublin city and county, given that 60 per cent of crime takes place in Dublin.  Powerful law and order speeches by politicians are always guaranteed to get a few votes. Behind the rhetoric lies the reality which we must face.  We must introduce measures which, on the one hand, effectively fight crime and, on the other hand, eliminate <Col N="282" /> the very many causes which we politicians have ignored.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed with the Minister's speech.  He said:</P>
    <P>For instance, in what sense can poverty be said to be a cause of crime when in fact the great majority of poor people are never in trouble with the law?</P>
    <P>The fact is that for years statistics have proved that the vast majority of the people in our prisons come from deprived and disadvantaged backgrounds.  They come from families in which unemployment is the norm, many from families where a parent, brother or sister has been involved with the law.  Many live in slums, in ghettoes, and in 1983 is it appropriate that we still have young children begging for a living on the streets of our cities and towns?  We all have failed to deal with the very many pressing social problems which have contributed seriously to the escalation of crime here in recent years.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that many of my colleagues made what I regard as rather emotive speeches, for example Deputy McGahon, who last week said:</P>
    <P>I believe it is the liberal influence permeating Irish society today which is largely responsible for the absence of law and order.</P>
    <P>He went on to say:</P>
    <P>The weaker sex and society in general must be protected and I call for the re-introduction of hanging...</P>
    <P>To make statements in Dáil Éireann in 1983 calling for the reintroduction of hanging is an absolute disgrace.  I am sorry that capital punishment is still on our Statute Book and has not been repealed by this legislation.</P>
    <P>The power which we here give to the Garda and the courts, the manner in which we tackle crime and those who commit crime in our society, the way in which we protect the civil liberties of our citizens, are what distinguishes democracy from totalitarian regimes.  There are many places in the world where if one committed serious crimes one's hand might be chopped off.  Do we want that <Col N="283" /> kind of criminal system here?  We must face the reality that 50 per cent of those surveyed in 1979 in our prisons were illiterate &mdash; and this in a country which prides itself on having what is called free education and whose Constitution guarantees the right of education to every citizen. Is that not an appalling statistic?  We have many social problems which we have ignored for many years.  By sweeping them under the carpet we have pretended they do not exist.  They have now caught up with us and the criminal who raids our towns and cities, and to whom many people are afraid to open their doors, has taken over.  He has taken over because he has been shown no other way. In many cases he has been given no other chance.</P>
    <P>What chance has a child of seven or eight, sent out by his parents to beg on the streets?  What chance has the child living on the seventh or eighth floor of some of our tenement blocks?  What chance has a child in the areas of the inner city in which I canvassed recently? They have parents who do not care.  It is time that we in Dáil Éireann faced reality, shouldered our responsibilities and gave those children some chance to live.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>

      <Col N="284" /> Nineteen hundred and eighty-two is the latest year for which total market figures are available and in that year net earned premium income for motor insurance amounted to approximately £202 million.</P>

      <P>With regard to the 1 per cent compensation fund which has been referred to recently, have arrangements been made to levy the 2 per cent on the 26 companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Have any of the 26 companies indicated that they will not be in a position to meet the levy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no indication of that at all.  The co-operation we have received from the industry has been extremely helpful and is appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>2.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism if his Department, as the supervisory authority, is satisfied that all non-life insurers writing insurance under licence in this country have sufficient reserves to deal with all claims which have arisen and may arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, there are 38 companies authorised to conduct non-life insurance business in Ireland and their financial results vary from year to year.  In view of this it would be unwise to state categorically, at any given moment, that the reserves position of every authorised insurer is satisfactory.</P>
      <P>However, I can state that with the exception of the case of which the Deputy is aware, there is no reason to be worried about the financial position of the authorised insurers.  The examination of their accounts is, of course, an on-going process and any matters which appear to call for special consideration will receive immediate attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that out of approximately 38 general insurance companies throughout the country <Col N="285" /> according to the statistics in the Minister's own blue book, about 25 of those doing business recorded substantial losses last year and half of those losses were in excess of £2 million?  The prognosis is that there will be an even worse situation in 1983.  Does that not indicate that what is regarded generally now as a crisis exists in general insurance in Ireland?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept that a crisis exists in the industry.  If that message were to go out from this House it would have very serious consequences for the industry.  I am most emphatic, in replying to the Deputy, that there is no crisis.  However, I accept that there have been losses in the insurance industry and that trend appears to be continuing.  In recognition of that, applications for price increases from the industry have been considered by the National Prices Commission and in the main, with certain exceptions, have been approved by me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While nobody wishes to create any confusion in the market place concerning the recorded losses of the 25 companies last year, at the same time they are very serious.  Does any non-life insurer in the country operate the float system so far as the cover for outstanding claims is concerned besides the one in relation to which the Minister took action recently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I am aware, and I am subject to correction on this as I have not got my notes, I do not believe the float system is operated by any other company.  I will check on that to be quite sure and if that is not the case I will convey it to the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that during the implementation of the emergency legislation recently there was a lot of talk that there were two other companies who felt that the legislation might have been brought in against them?  In those circumstances would he undertake to carry out an immediate review of all matters concerning the crisis which exists <Col N="286" /> in Irish insurance companies at the moment, such as suicide price cutting of premiums and the excessive competition in the business?  While the Minister may not recognise the fact, it is articulated by the business that a major crisis in general insurance is looming.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy, I do not accept and it would be damaging for it to go from this House that there is a major crisis in the insurance industry.  The industry is going through a difficult time and there have been losses in underwriting but that is in common with the insurance industry in other European countries.  The Irish case is not an isolated one.  As I informed the Deputy in reply to a previous supplementary question, applications for price increases in various types of insurance have been reviewed by the prices commission, recommended to me and with certain limited exceptions I have approved those increases in recognition of the difficulties being experienced by the industry.  With regard to the other matters the Deputy referred to, such as undercutting and other practices, I have made it quite clear to the industry on a number of occasions that a very serious view is taken by my Department of what could be referred to as gimmick schemes which are brought in to try to attract numbers on their books and which are not prudently estimated, and any losses which may be incurred with insurance companies in introducing those schemes will not be compensated for in any price increases they seek.  I am glad to say that that message has been acted on by a number of insurance companies to date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the supervisory authority concerned with Irish insurance business, can the Minister confirm that he or his Department have not written to any insurance company concerning their assets or their technical reserves in the recent past?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my formal reply, the question of the accounts of insurance companies is an on-going process and I am sure that, as a former Minister <Col N="287" /> in the Department, Deputy Flynn appreciates that.  If any matter which needs explanation or clarification comes to the attention of the Department or if any matter causes concern to the Department &mdash; it need not be of a major nature &mdash; that insurance company are immediately communicated with.  I am not aware of any specific cases which Deputy Flynn has in mind but it is normal practice and will continue to be so for my Department, in living up to their responsibilities, to keep in constant contact with insurance companies on a variety of matters relating to their accounts and accountability.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of the discrimination against people under 25 years in relation to motor insurance; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear what the Deputy means by &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; but I assume that what he has in mind is premium costs, rather than availability of cover.</P>
      <P>It has long been the practice of motor insurance companies to apply loadings in the case of premiums charged to young drivers because underwriting experience shows that claims are heavier both as to frequency and amount than in the case of other policy holders.</P>
      <P>The Prices Advisory Committee on Motor Insurance, which reported to me earlier this year, recommended that, while insurers should be free to charge higher or lower premiums in respect of those categories of drivers or vehicles with better or worse than average claims experience, those charges should not exceed the amount shown to be statistically justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee also referred to the work of the Motor Premiums Advisory Committee which has been engaged in an analysis over a number of years of the appropriateness of the loading factors applied by motor insurers including those applied to young drivers.  That committee's <Col N="288" /> preliminary findings have indicated that the loadings applied to young drivers broadly reflected the risk involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that it is becoming very difficult for young people to get motor insurance cover because premiums are too high?  Is the Minister concerned that even people under 30 years of age being asked to pay very high premiums to get insurance cover?  Is the Minister in a position to give hope to such people that the situation will improve?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as it is proved by statistics that certain ages and categories are high risks I am afraid the situation will continue to be as it is.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it is important that insurance companies are prudent in their underwriting.  It is not like another business where cut-price activities which would be beneficial to the consumer would be welcome.  In the insurance business one must be extremely prudent in the interests of the insured. The Prices Advisory Committee in making a recommendation earlier this year in regard to motor insurance recognised that there was statistical evidence to prove that, unfortunately, in that age category not only were there more accidents but the nature of the accidents were more serious with resulting higher awards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of at least one instance where a premium of £2,100 was sought for a young person? Indeed, in that instance the amount sought was greater than the value of the car being insured.  The difficulties young people have in obtaining an acceptable premium contributes to the number who are driving around uninsured on our roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the case referred to by the Deputy.  The Department when dealing with such matters do not allow in excess of 150 per cent, that being justified on the basis of the statistical evidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is felt that the situation <Col N="289" /> in which one company in the motor insurance field had to take on most of the under 25 age group had a considerable impact on the final situation in regard to that company which the Minister dealt with earlier.  Will the Minister consider making it mandatory on the 26 motor insurers that they provide insurance for the under-25s in accordance with their general licence?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is satisfied that the allocation system now operating in relation to the distribution of films to the film business in Ireland is satisfactory and that the big exhibitors do not have an unfair advantage over the small operators; and if he will make arrangements so that all involved in the showing of films in this country get equal treatment in so far as the distribution of films is concerned.</P>

      <P>The question of supply and distribution of cinema films in Ireland has already been the subject of a public inquiry carried out by the Restrictive Practices Commission under section 5 of the Restrictive Practices Act, 1972. The commission's findings and recommendations <Col N="292" /> were that conditions in the trade were not such as to warrant the making of a ministerial order under the 1972 Act.</P>
      <P>In particular the commission found that the major cinema groups and distributors were not party to any agreements designed to create monopolies in Dublin city centre.  Neither did they find that the terms of rental applied to different cinemas by various renters, while varying in different locations and situation, were unfairly discriminatory.  Furthermore, their examination of the accounts of the principal cinema companies did not lend support to a conclusion that terms had been unfairly discriminatory.  In the circumstances I do not feel that any further action is necessary in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that there is virtually a monopoly situation existing amongst exhibitors in the city at present with the take-over of some other concerns in the recent past?  While the statistics might not be exact to the last exhibitor, this would mean that it would represent something like 77 screens in the control of one operation, as against 170 odd in the whole country, thereby entailing virtually a monopoly situation.  Would the Minister agree also that individual owners are finding it extraordinarily difficult to gain access to first rate films?  Would he not think that that requires some ministerial action?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism the measures he proposes to take to support the flagging tourist industry, with particular reference to the hotel industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept the Deputy's view that the tourist industry is a &ldquo;flagging&rdquo; industry.  Results for the first nine months of this year indicate a level of activity on a par with 1982 with increased numbers of visitors coming from the United Kingdom and Federal Republic of Germany in particular.  On 4 May of this year, in reply to a similar Dáil Question from the Deputy, I outlined the actions taken by the Government in 1983 in support of the industry. I will continue to keep the situation under review and to explore ways by which further measures to assist competitiveness might be achieved.</P>
      <P>In this context, a recent submission to Government from the Irish Hotels Federation is currently under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister indicate to the House the total grant-in-aid from Government resources to Bord Fáilte this <Col N="294" /> year and what proportion was allocated to promotional activities as distinct from administrative costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1983 a total of £21,057,000 was made available to Bord Fáilte for administration, promotion and marketing; that constituted an additional £2,931,000 over the 1982 allocation.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in a year in which it was necessary for the Government to restrict many activities, that increased allocation to Bord Fáilte was a clear indication of their commitment to the tourist industry and has had a substantial effect on the industry.</P>
      <P>If I might just give the Deputy some information: In 1982 tourism earned a total of £747 million, an increase of 17 per cent in current terms over 1981.  The total revenue from out-of-State tourism in 1982 amounted to £487 million and from Irish people holidaying at home £260.3 million.  The total number of visitors from out-of-State came to 2.25 million, constituting an increase of 3 per cent over 1981.  Bearing in mind the difficult economic climate, the tourist industry has performed remarkably well and continues to show very considerable resilience.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thankful to the Minister for those figures.  But the major thrust of my question was that there was some disquiet being expressed recently as to the amount of money from the grant-in-aid that is designated to promotional work as against administrative costs.  The Minister may not have that information in his brief.  Perhaps he could send it on to me later.  While tourism has held its own very well in 1983 would the Minister not accept that over half the hotels of the country have lost money during the current season and that any of the measures he outlined earlier this year to relieve the situation have not had the desired effect?  I am anxious to know what new initiatives he is prepared to take to help the hotel industry in its present crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the Deputy, a submission from the Irish <Col N="295" /> Hotels Federation is under consideration at present.  While I accept that the hotel industry has been going through a very difficult time recently I should point out that there was a reduction in the VAT rate on hotel accommodation which was widely welcomed by the industry.  It must be realised also that the hotel industry is extremely important but that it represents only approximately 17 per cent of the total tourist industry.  Therefore, the tourist industry as a whole could not be judged solely on its hotel aspect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important &mdash; while I know the Minister may not be experiencing the happiest of days &mdash; that I place on the record that there was no real reduction in the VAT rate to hotels by the Minister and his Government.  It had been 18 per cent.  They left it at what is was when Fianna Fáil were in power.  On behalf of hotels, I would ask the Minister to implement the employment incentive scheme on the same terms as obtained during Deputy Gene Fitzgerald's term of office rather than the rather restrictive way it was applied this year and which was of no benefit at all to the hotels industry.  In his review of the allocation for next year would the Minister endeavour to bring about new initiatives that would incorporate the old employment incentive scheme system and also consider new arrangements in so far as pricing and VAT are concerned for the whole of the industry?</P>

I also propose to make arrangements for dealing with emergency services in Bantry.  Up to last February, when it closed, there were approximately four births each week and one could not justify the appointment of a consultant which, with back-up services, could cost £100,000 per year.</P>

It should be within the competence and financial resources of the Western Health Board to deploy staff from within their budget to enable that unit to be opened if they wish to do so.  In 1984 there will be a severe limitation in my Department's Vote for the provision of new services in the context of more nurses, consultants and staff for a particular unit. With the staff they have in Galway and the surrounding counties, they should be able to provide a service for the maternity wing in Galway as the number of births in the western region have not increased to the extent that they are demanding additional resources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A total of £373,362 was collected from 8,310 farmers, from 1 January to 31 August 1983.  In the period 1 January 1983 to 30 September 1983 a total of <Col N="300" /> £66,513 was collected from 1,395 other self-employed persons.</P>
    <P>Health contributions are an important element of the funds available to finance our health services and any shortfall in these contributions can have very serious consequences in the present financial climate. As a first step in the process of eliminating arrears I have informed health boards that collection arrangements which fall within their area of responsibility should be implemented as fully and as rapidly as possible and that penalties for failure to pay contributions should be fully invoked.</P>
    <P>I am considering imposing significant charges for in-patient hospital services supplied to persons who are in arrears with contributions.  These measures should serve to reduce considerably the arrears now outstanding in relation to health contributions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it the position that of the 104,000 farmers who are liable to pay health contributions, only 8,000 have paid to date and that of the 106,000 self-employed who are liable to pay this contribution, only 1,300 have paid?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct but I would draw his attention to the fact that the moneys paid from January last in relation both to farmers and to self-employed were in respect of arrears. The sum was very small in terms of the very large amount of moneys which are due both from farmers and from other self-employed people.  As the Deputy knows, the arrears as at 30 September were estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to be in the region of £13 million in respect of both farmers and self-employed.  About £8 million of that would be attributable to farmers.  The payments I have mentioned were in respect of arrears because in relation to farmers the assessments were issued in the last quarter of this year but we had considerable difficulty in that respect, first, in respect of the change from notional to the factual system of assessment and also because of the trade union concerned who blacked the collection of arrears because they regarded it as additional <Col N="301" /> work.  That action was lifted only recently.  Consequently, the net effect in the current financial year is likely to be small.  The underlying point I wish to make is that I intend considering the imposition of significant charges, especially public ward charges, for those who, at the point of entering hospital, are in arrears with their health contributions. That matter will be considered by the Government in the context of preparing for next year's budget.  I consider it appalling that while every other worker must pay on a deduction basis each week, there are many thousands who make no contribution.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Are the arrears to which the Minister has referred outstanding only to January 1982 or do they go back further?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>One must be very careful about arrears just as one must be careful in relation to assessments.  In the case of income tax arrears a figure of £1,400 million has been bandied around. The health contribution arrears are estimated arrears in respect of the self-employed. These are £8 million in respect of farmers and about £5 million in respect of the other self-employed.  I expect that a very substantial proportion of the amount in respect of farmers is correct but that there could be an over-assessment in respect of the self-employed because they tend to be over assessed by the Revenue Commissioners.  However, of the £13 million at least £9 million is well overdue and that is money that I am determined to get.  Unfortunately, legislation in relation to the health boards and to the delivery of health services is not adequate but that could be remedied in the coming year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that it is unsatisfactory to have health boards collect health contributions from farmers.  The self-employed pay direct to the Revenue Commissioners while the contributions are deducted from the PAYE sector.  Is there any plan <Col N="302" /> to change the method of collection as it relates to farmers?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As and from next year it could be the intention that the Revenue Commissioners would collect the health contributions but there still remain arrears of health contributions which were due legally to health boards. It might be difficult for the boards to discharge that onus to the commissioners but certainly in terms of income tax liability where health contributions are cojoined and levied, it would be the intention that in the next tax year the commissioners would ensure that payments are made.  It may well be that the health boards will seek to obtain the large amounts of money due to them by whatever legal means are at their disposal. The only option is to ensure that people who have not paid their contributions and who require hospital services pay for them before the services are provided.</P>

      <P>In the context of the change in the system of assessment, it is the gross income that is taken into account, but would the Minister examine the possibility of having this changed to net income?  That would be the only fair system of assessing farmers' incomes. Would the Minister not agree that in relation to the arrears for 1982, the assessments for both 1982 and 1983 were only forwarded in August last and that consequently it would be very difficult for farmers to pay their contributions for 1982 since exactly what they owed in respect of that year has not been assessed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The main issue arises in relation to assessment in respect of capital allowances but I would point out that farm income is assessed on the basis of profits derived from farming activities after the deduction of expenses, and the allowances for expenses are quite considerable. Allowances in respect of rents, rates, wages paid out, repairs to machinery and equipment, purchase of seeds, fertilisers and so on are allowed; business interest is allowed; stock relief is allowed as is any sum paid by a farmer towards <Col N="303" /> superannuation; but depreciation &mdash; this is the nub of the issue &mdash; including plant and equipment is not allowed.  I cannot support an assessment system which would allow a farmer to deduct expenditure on fences, roadways, holding yards, drains and land reclamation.  I must assess some income, and on that basis no other section of the community, self-employed or otherwise, gets capital allowances of that magnitude allowed against profits.</P>

Is he aware that health boards from time to time since 1970 have suggested methods under which this money might be collected, such as using the rate collectors, and his Department refused to do so? Will he consider this method of collection? He will know, as everybody else here does, that the rate collectors have been most successful in the collection of any moneys.  Also, will he agree with me that the method that he now suggests, whereby he intends to collect from those in debt as they go into hospital, is already the practice and therefore will serve no purpose whatever?</P>

I hope to transfer into my programme expenditure areas as quickly as possible moneys for basic services as outlined in the Deputy's question. I accept that in the Eastern Health Board area there is a critical shortage of mental handicap facilities and that has been discussed with the board on a number of occasions.

That unit is now fully operational, so progress has been made in that area and I assure the Deputy that I will be most anxious to provide further additional resources in 1984.

First, I want to thank the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs for using his good offices to see that sufficient funds were available to continue our active membership of participation in the Council of Europe because two weeks ago there were not enough funds available for our members to participate in the various sub-committees. I was glad to learn from members of my party that there was an active response from the Department that afternoon and our members have been able to attend their meetings since.  I thank the Minister of State for that.  Of course this situation should never have arisen and I hope it will never again arise because it does not do us any good internationally to be seen as a country which cannot be represented at meetings because of a lack of funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since last Tuesday week, we had a very interesting debate, initiated at long last by the Government under much pressure from Fianna Fáil, on the Common Agricultural Policy.  It is now admitted by everybody that this is one of the most important debates we could have in this House at present.  There is a lot of goodwill in this House for the efforts of the <Col N="367" /> Minister for Agriculture and the Government. There is a lot of support for the Minister, but it is conditional support, because we reserve to ourselves the right to criticise strongly the Government for their failure to do what they should do to strengthen our case with regard to this extremely important issue at European level.</P>
    <P>I was very taken aback at the lack of effort being put into the Government case by the Taoiseach personally.  It was with regret that I had to say he did not seem to be involved, except for the token effort he made earlier when he went to Brussels to meet his friend, the President of the Commission, Mr. Gaston Thorn, and to impress on him the great difficulties that would arise if the Commission proposals were implemented here.  I regret that the Taoiseach did not personally help the Minister for Agriculture, who needed all the help he could get, to try to convince other heads of State and Government as to what the implications were for us in the event of the Commission's proposals being accepted.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs is on record in the Seanad as saying on 2 November, column 317 of the Official Report, that although the diplomatic offensive commenced last July, it was only this week, primarily as a result of my questioning and my sharp criticism of the Taoiseach's efforts, that the Taoiseach and the Government have decided that the Taoiseach should play a greater role in making our case.  I want to tell the Taoiseach that it will be on his head if this effort by our Government fails and if our dairy farming community and the economy as a whole are not protected. Our Taoiseach has totally reneged on his responsibilities as leader of this Government, as a man who comes into this House on every occasion and tells us he has many influential friends in Europe. He has not gone to call on his influential friends up to now.</P>
    <P>Last Tuesday week I submitted a number of questions to the Taoiseach but for some strange reason they have not appeared on the Order Paper.  I do not know where the hold-up was, but I <Col N="368" /> wanted to ask him if he was aware of the opposition of the Danish Government to any concessions for Ireland on the super-levy and if he could be prepared to meet the Danish Prime Minister before the Athens meeting, present our case to him and seek his help in protecting our national interest.  That question should have been on last Tuesday's Order Paper and it would have been interesting to hear the Taoiseach's answer.  I had similar questions down asking him if he would meet the French President, the Italian Prime Minister and the Dutch Prime Minister because up to last week there was no indication that the Taoiseach and the Government would help the Minister for Agriculture, who urgently needed help and who said that it was a matter for political decision at the highest level. That is an admission that the Minister is passing the buck in the hope that the Taoiseach can do something about it because he, the Minister, is not able to go any further.</P>
    <P>Now, I understand, the Taoiseach is prepared to do something about it.  Now that the by-election is over the Taoiseach is getting his personal priorities right, not the priorities of the nation.  He put the by-election campaign before his involvement on behalf of our dairying sector and the economy as a whole.  He should have taken our case and strengthened the Minister's approach by visiting his influential friends in Europe.</P>
    <P>The public at large, the community as a whole and the farming community in particular, see where the Taoiseach's priority lies.  Last week representatives of the farming organisations who were in this House could not understand why he was so involved in other matters which were not nearly as important as the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the milk super-levy.  They see now that this Taoiseach could not even read the signs that his party were going to be decimated at the polls yesterday because of their poor performance.  In my view this Taoiseach would have been far better employed going to Europe over the last two or three weeks and meeting the Dutch Prime Minister, the President of France, the Danish Prime Minister and <Col N="369" /> the Italian Prime Minister rather than going to Moore Street dancing jigs, reels and hornpipes with Mrs. Banotti in an effort to win votes.  A photograph was published showing the Taoiseach watching this dancing last weekend.  It would have been far better for the Taoiseach to do a different dance on behalf of the Irish dairy sector.</P>

      <P>I do not think anybody should create problems and I should be grateful if the Deputy who caused the problem in the first instance would wait for a while and then make one of his rare contributions.  We would like to hear from him.  If he can convince me that the Taoiseach and the Government, particularly the Minister for Agriculture, are doing a worthwhile job on behalf of Irish farmers, then the farmers will be more thankful than the voters in Dublin Central.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The summit meeting will take place in Athens within the next ten days and the Taoiseach will be going there in a much weaker position than he was two weeks ago when he was convinced that he was cock of the walk.  We will still help him, even at this late stage, in carrying out his diplomatic offensive, as it was described by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Seanad on 2 November.  We can imagine how weakened the stance of the Taoiseach will be now that most governments have made up their minds regarding their postion in Athens.  We have a Taoiseach <Col N="370" /> who was dancing jigs and hornpipes last weekend and will be dancing further jigs and hornpipes next weekend in trying to close the stable door when it is too late. Our farming community would appreciate any efforts by anybody on their behalf and they have made this clear in public statements and at meetings we had with them.  For his own petty, political, selfish reasons the Taoiseach preferred doing his little hornpipe in Moore Street rather than fulfilling his role as our Prime Minister in Europe.  It is a shame and a disgrace.</P>
    <P>If the Minister for Agriculture fails in his efforts he should not be isolated by the Taoiseach and the Government and made to carry the can.  The entire Government must take responsibility for the poorest of efforts and the lack of dedication and input in taking this case to other governments and ensuring that our case was fully understood.  It is not understood in the Commission or by the Task Force established by the Commission to see if anything could be done to help us.  I was told this over two weeks ago by Commissioner Tugendhat in Strasbourg and when I made this statement in the House nobody opposite took any notice.  I was referring directly to a conversation I had with the Commissioner about the efforts being made by the Government to ensure that our case was understood at Commission level.</P>
    <P>I want the farming community to know that the Taoiseach is doing far too little too late.  I want him to succeed and I hope he gives assistance to his Minister for Agriculture who is extremely worried about the way things are going and said that he feared the outcome of a meeting he had in Athens.  We had a man new to Government, without any ministerial experience or any experience in European negotiations, being sent out to defend us on the greatest single issue to face us in a long time.  I would love to have been listening to the discussions of the Government on Tuesday when it was decided that the Taoiseach should be made to go and show faith in an effort to save his Minister embarrassment.  I warn the Taoiseach that he will get a greater trouncing throughout the country as a <Col N="371" /> whole than he received yesterday if he fails the farming community in relation to the super-levy.</P>
    <P>Other speakers will have more to say on this subject as the debate proceeds.  I am quite sure it will not finish this afternoon and I should like the debate to be kept going as long as the question of the super-levy is active because it provides the only opportunity for us to air our views on the matter.  Last week's debate was forced on the Government by people like Deputy Seán Byrne who had to go so far in his efforts to get a debate on the issue that he was asked to leave the House.  We will not have to ask Deputy Seán Byrne to go that far any more because it is in our interests and in the interests of backbenchers opposite to keep this debate alive as long as the super-levy is an issue.</P>
    <P>When the Heads of Government met in Stuttgart in June they agreed that certain negotiations should be carried out concerning changes in the Common Agricultural Policy.  They said that the basic principles of the CAP should not be interfered with.  They had to have due regard to the appropriate article of the Treaty of Rome.  We have a duty to insist that the basic principles of the CAP are not interfered with and we should be extremely watchful and careful of what is emerging.  The Stuttgart statement said that special problems arise in certain regions such as the Mediterranean regions, mountain regions and other regions which are at a disadvantage because of natural economic features.  It is extremely important for us to make sure that due regard is given to that part of the statement.</P>
    <P>All of us recognise that the Community is in a grave financial position.  This problem will be added to if Spain and Portugal are admitted to the Community.  We must recognise that there is a deep financial problem in Europe, and it is in our own interest to have something done about it. It is accepted that as a nation we are prepared to contribute our part to the relaunching of Europe which is at the crossroads at present.  We are prepared to take our share of the additional burden. <Col N="372" /> I want to make it very clear that we are prepared to take our share only and we are not prepared to take more than our share.</P>
    <P>If through weakness on the part of the Government in presenting our case we find it would appear that we will have to take more than our share, we will let the Government know of our concern.  There are many benefits for a small country like ours with a very open economy in being a member of the Community.  It is vital for us that the Community should thrive and prosper.  We must not forget that people at Stuttgart were concerned not only with the question of the adaptation of the Common Agricultural Policy, but that they and all of us are searching for a method to re-launch the Community, to rediscover the sense of European progress that has tended to become dimmed, and lost at times under the effects of the world recession.</P>
    <P>Agriculture which is so important to us represents almost 15 per cent of our GNP, two or three times that of the vast majority of our colleagues in Europe.  It is far more important to us in our economy.  We must insist that anything which would tend to damage agriculture would hurt us to a far greater degree than it would hurt many of our colleagues in Europe.</P>
    <P>The Government have the responsibility to defend us in the negotiations.  Perhaps I could borrow a phrase from the Minister for Agriculture.  At the ArdFheis he said if confrontation is necessary there will be confrontation.  I was glad to hear that, and I hope I will hear it again. It reflected a change in his attitude and a change from his statement on television in the Dublin Airport interview on his way to Athens, to the public at large and our partners in Europe, that he was nervous and fearful of the outcome.  I understand his inexperience and his weakness. That is why we want the Taoiseach and the Government to help him.</P>
    <P>Many of us believe that the Commission's proposals for the future of the agricultural policy are a deliberate attempt by the Commission, and by our partners if they accept these proposals, to re-negotiate our terms of entry to the <Col N="373" /> Community.  It is an effort on their part to re-negotiate our terms of entry.  In 1972 when we were asked to decide on the question of entry to Europe we accepted membership of the EEC having carefully weighed the benefits and costs on balance.  We accepted the rewards and the penalties.  We accepted industrial competition as a price to balance the agricultural opportunities.  We paid that price.  Now we must insist that, if the fundamental principles of the Common Agricultural Policy are interfered with, this will constitute a re-negotiation of our entry into the EEC.  This is totally unacceptable to us.</P>
    <P>I fail to understand why we should be told we must accept that our dairy industry cannot be further developed.  Why should we be told, in effect, that instead of even staying as we are we must go back to the production levels of 1981?  Everyone knows that was a disastrous year. Why should we be penalised when our milk yield per cow is only 680 gallons? Why should we be asked to stop our dairy development?  Is it not right that we should have the opportunity to increase our gallonage up to 1,000 gallons per cow?  This is a reality which can be achieved.  Our competitors in other countries have achieved higher levels.  It was said that some of them achieved it by the import of relatively cheap cereal substitutes, by intensive methods and the establishment of factory herds.</P>
    <P>In Denmark and the Netherlands these herds are fed on corn gluten and citrus pellets which are the basis of their milk industry.  We must ask an extremely important question.  Where is the principle of convergence which is supposed to underlie the Community if certain members are allowed to advance and, as we attempt the very difficult task of advancing ourselves in an effort to catch up with our competitors, we are told to freeze everything, go backwards and be penalised?</P>
    <P>I want to make it very clear that convergence is a fundamental principle and aim of the Community, and convergence must be achieved.  I recognise, as does everyone in the House and in the country, that the first and most important <Col N="374" /> problem facing the Community is a budgetary one.  We all appreciate that we have reached the limit of our existing own resources.  This was clearly shown to us in the statement made by the Agricultural Commissioner Dalsager in Athens recently about the deferral of certain export refunds due under the Common Agricultural Policy because the funds were exhausted.</P>
    <P>We also recognise that, if we are to get a new ceiling on the own resources, this requires a unanimous Council decision as well as national parliamentary ratification. We accept that new resources are necessary in their own right because of the procedures I have already mentioned. It is a fact that some member states are doing their best to re-negotiate to their own benefit.  That is no secret. Only two weeks or so ago, the British Foreign Minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe, said there would be no agreement until a satisfactory outcome was arrived at on the British budgetary problem.  It is not in the interests of the Community that a number of other member states are adopting similar attitudes and will agree to an increase in own resources only with a certain number of pre-conditions.</P>
    <P>It is extremely unfortunate for us that one of these pre-conditions is related to agricultural expenditure.  I appreciate that the negotiations on increasing the own resources are difficult and delicate. Because of this, we as the main Opposition party in this Parliament have agreed to help the Government in every way possible in the negotiations.  We are prepared to help them, but they must accept that in helping them we are obliged to criticise them when we feel they are not behaving as they should, and not making our case as strongly as they should, and when we are certain they are not using all the cards in their hands, as it were, to improve our situation.</P>
    <P>These negotiations which cover the question of new resources also cover the subsidiary question of the relative size of members' contributions to the Community budget.  We believe the Community cannot make progress unless they have sufficient resources at their disposal to deal with the great problems facing the <Col N="375" /> Community.  If they cannot do that, they will lose credibility.  Unfortunately, at present the credibility of the Community is extremely low, perhaps the lowest &mdash; and I say this with regret &mdash; since the Community got under way.  It is unfortunate that the Community seem to be stumbling from one crisis to another.  As I have said on a number of occasions, the President and different Commissioners are squabbling openly and publicly. These squabbles which are being highlighted by the media are totally eroding the credibility of the Community.</P>
    <P>I support the Government in the section of the negotiations concerning the development of new policies and the strengthening of the Community's structural funds, regional social and agricultural. My party support the Government in this area.  Have we not all been waiting for the last ten years for the Regional Fund to begin to tackle the problem of regional imbalances?  None of us can be proud that growing unemployment, particularly of youth, is not being tackled in any worthwhile way by the Social Fund.  It is now accepted that there has been a lack of political will to create the conditions and resources by which these funds could play a worthwhile role in relaunching the Community.  I hope that the Regional Fund will be used to take positive action to deal speedily with the problems with which it is meant to deal.</P>
    <P>The Government have been very generously dealt with by this party since the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy became a live issue after the Stuttgart meeting.  We have been very helpful to them and we will support them along the way as long as we are convinced that they are doing a worthwhile job.  We will, however, criticise them when their weaknesses are obvious to us.  The Minister for Agriculture is practically on his own, isolated by his Taoiseach and his colleagues in Government, perhaps for reasons about which we on this side of the House know nothing.  It is wrong that that is so.  The country cannot afford to be run in this manner.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="376" /> The Taoiseach's own record of personal involvement is a sad one which we all regret.  I suppose that he does not meet too many farmers in his social life &mdash; I doubt if there are any in the Donnybrook set.  He should consult with his backbenchers and listen to those who come from rural constituencies because the message is loud and clear.  There is total dissatisfaction with the Taoiseach, in particular.  The people are inclined to forgive the Minister for Agriculture, recognising his weakness, but cannot forgive the Taoiseach who isolates a totally inexperienced Minister who now finds himself deep in the heart of extremely important negotiations in Athens and not able for it, according to his own words. He is not able for it when he sends out the signals loud and clear that this matter can be resolved only at political level, implying that he wants to be bailed out by his Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Now that the jigs and reels of the Taoiseach and his candidate, Mrs. Banotti, in Moore Street are over, I hope to see him making a worthwhile effort on behalf of the Irish farming community in Europe, if it is not too late.</P>
    <P>On 10 November the Minister of State ranged fairly widely over a number of matters.  He spoke on the EEC proper and had some interesting things to say about the Middle East, Poland, Afghanistan and Kampuchea, Namibia, Latin America and the problems in Central America.  We will support the Minister generally in this area.  During my time as Foreign Minister I also had a very close personal interest and involvement in the problems, in some more so than others. I was very interested in the situation in Central America and at that time there were three main objectives, as far as our country was concerned.  The first was that we should avail of every opportunity for the furtherance of respect for human rights.  I was satisfied then, and I am still, that Ireland has played a significant role, for example at the United Nations, in focusing international attention on the appalling human rights violations which have taken place in El Salvador and Guatemala. We have yet another objective in that we believe that the essential causes <Col N="377" /> of conflict in Central America are the inequities in the long-standing social and economic arrangements and the justified demands of the people for fundamental reforms.  The Nicaraguan people's uprising against the brutal regime of Samoza in 1979 is a clear example of this.</P>
    <P>We had a third objective, which I believe the present Government shares as strongly as we did, that Ireland support the creation of the necessary political and diplomatic bases for a peaceful settlement to conflict and tension in the area. We have publicly supported the efforts of the Contadora group of countries to achieve a lasting peace in Central America, based on the principles of self-determination and the right of each country in the region to determine its own destiny free from outside interference.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the statement which came after the Heads of State meeting in Stuttgart reflected generally the views which we had while in Government and that the ten countries of the European Economic Community pointed out the casual link between the socio-economic conditions and political tensions in the region and called for strict observance of human rights.  They also stated unequivocally that the problems of Central America must be solved by political and not military means from within the region itself and with full respect for the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers.</P>
    <P>Everybody here is concerned about the present situation in Central America.  I appeal to our Foreign Minister, acting on behalf of his Government, to make sure that this concern is registered carefully on our behalf in an effort to influence those concerned and to get them to understand our viewpoint, in order to bring peace to this very troubled area.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave an outline of the situation in the Middle East and I am sure that every Member shares his concern about the present situation there. We hope that a political solution can be found and that the terrible destruction which is taking place there daily will end. We all want to see that, because there is a great danger that if the conflict in the <Col N="378" /> Middle East becomes more widespread than at present we will find ourselves involved in another great war &mdash; perhaps the last great war.</P>
    <P>Concerning Afghanistan, I am glad that the Foreign Minister and his colleagues in the Ten have not written off the situation there.  There is a tendency when something has existed for a period to take it for granted and accept the situation. I would like every possible pressure brought to bear on that problem part of the world to resolve the difficulties in a peaceful way.  With regard to the other problem areas mentioned by the Minister, I am in accord with what he said and we as a party will support him there.</P>
    <P>Finally, there are a number of matters, perhaps not coming within the confines of this debate, which we would like to get an opportunity of discussing with him, perhaps in the course of a Private Members' motion, or in some other form. These include discussions on the Estimates, on which none of us knows where we stand.  It is doubtful if there will be any worthwhile discussions on these before Christmas.  If the normal pattern is followed, there are hardly two or three more full weeks of Dáil time before the Christmas Recess.  There is need for discussion on quite a number of matters which are important to us and which do not come within the confines of this debate.</P>
    <P>Many members would like to contribute on the nuclear arms issue.  Many people of all parties have very strong views on the matter and would like an opportunity to voice them.  Many members from all parties are concerned about the situation with regard to Windscale and we would like an opportunity to discuss that.  I have an assurance from the Minister that he is satisfied with regard to the dumping of these wastes off our south-west coast and that everything is in order.  I am sure that the Minister has been told that.  If I were a Minister for Foreign Affairs I would not be satisfied with what I am being told because it appears that it takes a very long time for the truth on these issues to emerge.</P>

      <P>I am doing my best not to.  I promise you I will not go any further. I would just like to mention that there are a number of items we would like to discuss with the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  I already thanked the Minister in relation to the Council of Europe, a matter which Deputy Andrews asked me to raise with him a few weeks ago.  I also want to thank him for something else. When we were discussing this matter two weeks ago I said I felt it was very wrong that almost 12 months should have elapsed since this Government came into office without revitalising the Joint Committee on EEC Legislation.  I did not say this to score a political point off anybody because it was two-and-a-half years since the committee last met because of the unstable political situation and Governments in and out like yo-yos for the last 18 months.  I was not blaming the Minister for that.  I want to thank him, because seemingly, he spoke to somebody and we had our first meeting in two-and-a-half years last Tuesday afternoon.  The Minister will be glad to know that I was elected chairman of the committee and that we will be working fairly closely with him.  I am thankful for the opportunity to make the points which I have made.  If I appear to be hard on the Taoiseach it is not because he is a Fine Gael Member of this House and I am a Fianna Fáil Member. I am hard on him because I believe he has been reckless and has been unbelievably unwise with regard to the CAP and the milk super-levy by not doing anything worthwhile on behalf of the farming community until now.  I hope I am wrong and if I am I will be the first to apologise publicly, but it now appears that the Taoiseach is doing far too little and he is doing it far too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Many interesting points have been raised and some constructive things have been said in the speech we have just heard in relation to the developments in the European Community. It is a pity that the Fianna Fáil spokesman and many others find it necessary <Col N="380" /> during this debate to dwell on the whole question of the super-levy and all that it involves.  I would like to say to the Fianna Fáil spokesman and anybody else listening that I find it very sad that all of us who speak on behalf of the farmers at this time and who speak in defence of our dairy industry have to make the point that our farmers, in relation to their average production, are so far behind our counterparts throughout the EEC.</P>
      <P>I would like to remind everybody that when you go to Europe and you raise this point you must always be prepared to hear the answer that we had the development of our dairy industry in our hands for the last 50 years and that ten years ago when we became members of the EEC we negotiated a Common Agricultural Policy.  I do not think the principles of that policy extended to the question of a super-levy, although I believe they did not exclude the possibility of it.  They are fairly well defined, fairly simple principles of financial solidarity between the members of the Community concerning Community preference and a free market. The Fianna Fáil spokesman seems to forget that within the framework of that Common Agricultural Policy our agricultural industry has not made great progress.  He seems to forget that his party were in Government when that Common Agricultural Policy was negotiated. They could not see at the time, like most people who spoke and who have spoken since, that Ireland, so far back, would have to make a special effort if we were to find a permanent place for ourselves in the market place with agricultural produce and compete with our counterparts in other European countries when the Community had fulfilled its obligation of providing the people of Europe with sufficient food at a reasonable price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We forgot that a time would come when European farmers would achieve the level of production that the European consumer wanted or could pay for.  We did not foresee a situation in which there would not be a market at the sort of prices the European farmers were paid for our production and we did not foresee the present crisis in the agricultural <Col N="381" /> budget of the Community.  We did not check out inflation rates.  The Fianna Fáil spokesman did not refer to the fact that we put our farmers at a disadvantage which they could not overcome.  When German farmers could borrow money at 5 per cent Irish farmers had to pay 20 per cent.  When German farmers had to contend with increasing costs at the rate of 5 per cent Irish farmers had to contend with costs increasing at the rate of 20 per cent.  When German farmers were protected by monetary compensation payments, which in effect are a tariff, no protest was raised by the Fianna Fáil Government.  They went in under that system, they failed to see its weaknesses and, having gone in, they berated others for seeking to renegotiate.  They did not renegotiate, as they should have done, some aspects of the Common Agricultural Policy for the protection of our farmers.  After ten years we find ourselves in the situation where we are at 600 gallons and the European farmers are at 1,000 gallons per cow.</P>
    <P>That is not the worst of the situation. The worst thing is their stocking rates against ours.  They are sometimes producing 2,000 gallons per acre while our farmers produce less than 400 gallons per acre.  The difference is not reflected in the difference of yield per cow.  The difference in the opportunities of European farmers to compete in the markets does not seem to be understood by the people who speak on behalf of our farmers.  I would like to remind the Minister that, if our farmers are so far behind, a good deal of the blame can be attributed to the Fianna Fáil spokesman and to the various Ministers for Agriculture in Fianna Fáil Governments over the years who failed to take account of the disadvantages under which our farmers were operating, who failed to see the gap widen between the income of our farmers and who failed to see the difference in the opportunities afforded to our farmers and the opportunities available to European farmers.</P>
    <P>I want to remind the Minister that just before we joined the EEC, when we should have recognised the merit for Ireland which existed in increasing production rapidly, we had a Fianna Fáil <Col N="382" /> Government who actually introduced the very same mechanism in a different form which is now being introduced by the Commission to control the production of milk in the Community.  The Fianna Fáil Government introduced the two-tier price system, which is the very same thing, a financial disincentive to people to expand.</P>
    <P>Recently I heard a Fianna Fáil spokesman make a suggestion &mdash; and I am not saying that Fianna Fáil have said what we should or should not accept in Athens or whenever the negotiations are concluded &mdash; that 37,000 gallons of milk would be a fair starting point for the super-levy. That person forgets that only a few years ago Fianna Fáil imposed a 7,000 gallon starting point.  That sort of thinking created the present situation with the result that we find ourselves having to go to Europe to plead with other member states to allow us achieve their standards. We have to do so because we failed in the management of our economy and to produce a plan for the agricultural industry to put our farmers into a position in which they can compete.</P>
    <P>In recent years the idea has grown up here that the CAP is a set of sacred principles that during our lifetime must not be reviewed.  That is a mistaken approach to the whole question.  That policy was brought into existence 25 years ago when Europe was 60 per cent self-sufficient in food.  At that time 20 million more people were working on the land than today and many people in Community countries were starving.  The idea of Europe being an exporter of food was not dreamt of.  Surely an agricultural policy designed to fulfil the needs of the farmers and consumers of Europe 25 years ago is in need of revision.  Such a policy does not suit the agricultural industry in Europe today and, certainly, it does not suit the requirements of our agricultural industry, if it ever did.</P>
    <P>The British over the years have attacked the CAP policy and they are regarded here as the great enemies of it. Last year when Irish farmers were finding it difficult to break even the British Minister of Agriculture announced that British farmers had an increase in income of <Col N="383" /> 34 per cent.  The truth is that the CAP afforded to the strong and well-established farmers of the Community an opportunity to stay ahead.  It should be recognised that as far as the need of the Community for food is concerned the capacity of Europe to produce food is almost without limit.  We are self-sufficient in milk, cereals and livestock products but we are not near the point of not being able to produce any more.  In my view we can continue to increase production at a rate of 5 or 6 per cent per annum for the foreseeable future but we do not seem to have markets in the world to sell our produce for the price we produce it.  That is a sad situation particularly when one considers the number of people in need of food in the world.  The question is often asked why we store up food and cannot sell it, but the truth is that it cannot be bought at the price we offer it. Taxpayers or farmers of the Community do not appear to be willing to subsidise the sale of our surplus produce to those who need it at a price they can afford.  To talk about the number of people in the world who are hungry is not a solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>The CAP afforded an opportunity to those who were in front to stay there.  A combination of the way the policy was organised and the way we ran our affairs created a situation which will mean that Irish farmers will never be able to catch up or become competitive with the farmers of Britain or Holland.  Britain has moved from a 60 per cent self-sufficiency in the last ten years to a stage where they are almost self-sufficient in everything. At one time Britain was the biggest importer of food products in Europe.  In the last ten years net agricultural output here has hardly changed as a result of the failures I have mentioned.  Fianna Fáil policy in regard to the dairy industry was clearly manifest in the imposition of a two-tier price and was designed to prevent efficient farmers making progress and to keep the most inefficient and smaller farmers in that situation.  It is hard to understand Fianna Fáil Members who participated in that policy decrying the Taoiseach and the Minister for Agriculture, <Col N="384" /> who were always committed to progressive policies in regard to the agricultural industry.  I find it hard to imagine what the Taoiseach can do in addition to what he has done.  Some months ago he went to Belgium and his approach was aggressive.  He threw down the gauntlet and declared this to be an issue of vital national importance.  That is as far as any Head of State can go in Europe, to assert that a country has a vital interest in an issue and be prepared to stand behind that to the end even if it means the disruption of progress in the Community.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went to Athens to consult with the President of the Council and convince him of the importance of Ireland's case.  He did so, so that the President could lead off the special Council meeting in the knowledge that Ireland could not make major concessions on this issue.  Although the Taoiseach achieved something on that visit he was jeered in the House and accused of wasting public money on a wild goose chase.  I do not know what the Opposition expect the Taoiseach to do.  The question is bigger than the imposition of the milk levy or the CAP.  Many issues are scheduled for discussion in Athens.  We will not have any reform of the CAP if there is not also an extension of the budget and we will not have either of those if we do not clear up the question of the British refund.</P>
    <P>The economies of the Community have not returned to growth and, according to recent figures, the growth rate in recent months was negative.  We will not return to growth unless we begin to develop policies on industry and energy.  We must have the means and the will developed in the Community to deal with the rising problem of unemployment and the failure of the competitiveness of industry and the economies in the Community. The United States and Japan, in spite of their technological advances, do not have the level of unemployment we have in the Community.  Until the Commission are in a position to present a plan to deal with this I do not think there is much point in continuing.  So far the Community have succeeded in developing only one common policy but that policy, <Col N="385" /> because of the decision-making process of the Community, has not been reviewed or made more appropriate to the needs of agriculture and consumers. When the Opposition spokesman, Deputy Collins, was contributing I waited to hear what would be his proposals, what he thought the Taoiseach and Minister for Agriculture should achieve, what he thought they ought to be able to bring back from Athens; whether he felt they would need to stand up and say, &ldquo;We cannot give any more&rdquo;, or whether he felt they should not give anything; what he saw as the solutions to the problems obtaining.  But he advanced no constructive proposals whatever.  Indeed he spent half of his time talking about the failure of the Taoiseach to win the battle before it had begun.</P>
    <P>At present whether one talks with local authority representatives who are speaking about roads having fallen into disrepair and who are told that the Government have not the resources to finance their improvement programmes, or whether it be the vocational education committees, voluntary organisations or whoever, all are saying that if the Government have run out of money why cannot something be done for us in Europe by way of grants?  What about the Social Fund or the Regional Fund?  Can solutions not be found to our economic problems through the EEC?  The truth is that there have been many solutions to many problems through our involvement in the Community.  But when one talks about the development of the EEC it must be remembered that it is in an embryonic stage even now.  Unfortunately, the earlier development seems to have slowed down somewhat and we have not witnessed the same progress recently.</P>
    <P>Since we have reached the limit of our resources we have no money with which to develop other policies.  It seems that agreement cannot be reached to raise the extra funds through the national governments by extending the mechanisms for collecting VAT of 1.4 per cent, as has been suggested, or more.  We cannot reach agreement because at the Council of Ministers each Minister represents his national interest.  Rather than a European <Col N="386" /> Council, the Council of Ministers is composed of representatives of individual states expressing their individual views and opinions from day to day in the light of the individual problems in their countries.  I do not think we shall be able to make progress in Europe until there are changes effected in the decision-making process.  While the EEC are run by the Council, while the strongest weapon in the hand of any Minister is the veto, there will not be progress.  Ironically, that veto has not been used except by Britain last year, when it did not work.  That would appear to be the strongest weapon in the hand of any Minister.  Within the Council of Ministers individual Ministers have the ability to stymie progress, prevent things being done.  Nobody seems to have the ability to start things in motion, get things done.</P>
    <P>If we are to find an answer to the problems about which we speak in the EEC we must change the whole decision-making process at European level.  The Council of Ministers is comprised of people who are enmeshed in their own problems, reflecting their localised political interests.  They will be unable to resolve it.  We shall not solve the problems of Europe until we develop the institutions of the Community to take decisions and play a larger role than they have been doing to date.  The European Parliament has considerable budgetary powers which have been reduced because we are at the stage now where 65 per cent to 70 per cent of the money collected by the Community is composed of compulsory spending; it is spent on agriculture. The ability of the Parliament to change the direction of Europe by manipulating the remainder of the funds is very limited. Until there is a larger budget devoted to the development of other policies we shall not make much progress.</P>
    <P>We often forget that there are probably four instruments: first, one for the redistribution of wealth throughout the Community; second the Common Agricultural Policy; third, the social policy and the fourth, regional policy.  Very often forgotten in the course of all this debate is that, of all the money spent in 1982 under the Social Fund, Ireland gained <Col N="387" /> approximately 10 per cent, a considerable proportion for a population of over 3 million people.  Similarly with regard to the Regional Fund Ireland's share is estimated at 6 per cent.  But when one includes cross-Border schemes and the non-quota section Ireland receives something like 10 per cent.  Ireland receives from the guarantee section of the Common Agricultural Policy something like 3½ to 4 per cent only.  That is the great advantage seen by our people to be received by us from the EEC.  It is true to maintain that, if the Regional Fund were as large as the guarantee side of FEOGA, Ireland would receive much more money.  Similarly with regard to the Social Fund, with regard to the amount of money spent on the subsidisation of loans to agriculture throughout the Community, Ireland received 30 per cent in 1982.</P>
    <P>What we should ascertain is what Ireland would gain from an extension of the European budget, through an expanded regional or social policy, something very often forgotten by our negotiators. While we may go to Athens to prevent a lid being placed on the expansion of the Irish dairy industry, we should not forget that we have an obligation also on behalf of our people to ensure that agreements are reached, that there is an extension of the Community budget so that there can be a development of the policies people advocate &mdash; which do not exist at present &mdash; with regard to energy and industry but also entailing an extension of the regional and social policies.</P>
    <P>When we talk about a new Treaty, new European institutions, a more efficient decision-making process at European level, the question that arises always is, what about the small countries?  How can a nation of 3,500,000 people expect to sit around the table with the major powers of Europe, by any standards major powers in the world, and hope to achieve equality around that table?  It is difficult to give our people an absolute assurance in that regard.  One thing is certain, if we want and hope for the development of European policies then there must be devised a new decision-making process. <Col N="388" /> We should remember that the EEC is the subject of a lot of negative criticism from time to time.  I like to point out to our people that whether it be in the Parliament, or in the Council of Ministers, our population of 3,500,000 has five times the representation of a similar number of people in the Federal Republic of Germany.  The Irish vote in the European Parliament on behalf of its 3,500,000 people is equal to that of other representatives on behalf of 15 million Germans. That is a major concession we should recognise.</P>
    <P>If one were to analyse the decisions of the European Parliament or the Council over a period of years one would find that the input by our representatives was considerably larger than that of our counterparts in other countries because of this weighted advantage.  We should be conscious of the fact also that it is not possible in the Council of Ministers, under the present voting system, for the large powers to impose their interests on everybody else.  The smaller countries, Denmark, Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg, have the power, through the straight vote system, to veto the decisions of the larger powers who have much greater economic power and larger numbers of people.  The position of the small countries is fairly well protected.  It is a bit too much to expect, in the development of a Community that plays an increasing role in the everyday life of the people of Europe, that 3½ million should have the right to veto every possible decision that we regard as being against out interests.  It is sufficient that the small countries can out-vote the bigger nations.  It is a very advantageous position for us and, over the years, without the necessity to apply the veto at any time we have generally got the things for which we worked very hard.</P>
    <P>There are many other arguments that can be made in favour of improving the decision-making process at European level.  National parliaments, local authorities and people with nationalistic views, will argue that giving power to European institutions is taking away the national powers and undermining the rights of national parliaments.  It is true that when <Col N="389" /> you give power to any group, person or organisation you reduce, to some extent, the freedoms of somebody else.  For that reason, we must be very careful of whatever powers we agree to give to European institutions in the years ahead.  However, we have come to the end of the road as things are organised at present.  In working out the organisation of this new decision-making process, we must remember that it is important for the European institutions not to take power from Dublin any more than Dublin should take power from local authorities where they can fulfil their obligations at local level.  Brussels must not take power from Dublin which Dublin can discharge efficiently, but Brussels can acquire the sort of powers that national parliaments can never have.  We must ask ourselves what these powers are and we must organise the role of the European institutions so that these are the powers they will acquire and discharge.</P>
    <P>It is not from the voter in Ireland, the local authority in Carrick-on-Shannon, Castlebar or the Irish Parliament that Europe will take power eventually.  I think that Europe will take the power, for instance, from the Japanese to flood our markets with cheap products.  Europe will take the power from the United States of America to dictate terms of trade to us.  It will be a united Europe pursuing converging policies and harmonising, where appropriate, their laws and regulations to make them more effective. It is the power of stronger regions and states that is threatening the power and decisions of Europe at present.  That is why I should like to see Ireland playing a full role within the European Economic Community.  From an economic and political point of view, the price that Europe will pay for remaining divided will be that they will continue to be pawns in the power game between the United States and the Soviet Union.  They will also be pawns in the game of economic power between Japan, the United States and other developing economies.  European industrialists are finding out, to their cost, that the threat is not only coming from countries like Japan and the United States.  In relation to steel, it is <Col N="390" /> increasingly coming from less developed countries where energy and labour costs are lower.  Modernised plants, with investment sometimes from the West, are threatening the position of producers in the European Economic Community and also frightening the Japanese and the steel producers of the United States.</P>
    <P>There is no alternative to a coming together of the European states for the protection of the freedom that we enjoy and for the maintenance and improvement in the standards of living that we have.  It would help also to assert our independence of the great powers who are more concerned about their own positions than they are about our freedom. We control 40 per cent of world trade.  Relatively speaking, we are not a large power bloc and to remain as individual nations pursuing individual economic policies will certainly lead to a situation in which this part of the world will lose the power and significance which it enjoyed in the past.  Ireland will lose the opportunity, through her participation in that Community, of enjoying the standards of living which are at present enjoyed by more developed industrial nations such as Britain, Germany, France and Italy.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too much on the Common Agricultural Policy and the super-levy.  However, if this debate goes on past this evening, we should apply ourselves to the root of the problem and why it came about.  It is not sufficient for our Minister to go to Athens and to demand from the Governments of Europe a solution to our problems without sufficient preparedness and knowledge of the problem to propose solutions to what has gone wrong.  In so far as milk production is concerned, there might not be a need for the imposition of the super-levy if the Governments of Europe could agree on the whole question of monetary compensation.  These payments have the effect of creating what is a tariff barrier between countries like Ireland and countries like the Federal Republic of Germany, Holland and Britain and giving milk producers in those countries something between 6 per cent and 10 per cent of an advantage over Irish <Col N="391" /> farmers.  In addition, we must recognise that in those other countries, milk suppliers, without taking into consideration the monetary compensatory payments which give them a higher price, get from 7 per cent to 10 per cent more than Irish farmers.  This means that they have a combination of factors which gives them an advantage of more than 20 per cent. Many of those countries are not regarded as agricultural and are not subject to tariffs but we import eight million tonnes of manioc, better known as tapioca, into the Community annually, mainly into Germany and Holland and some into England.  It is imported because they have the shipping facilities on the Continent which we do not have and because they have strong milling industries.  Internationally well-known companies have built storage and processing facilities in Thailand to make this into pellet form and easier to handle and transport.  It is then shipped to Rotterdam where it is transported mostly inland by canal and supplied to dairy farms.  If we tried to do the same thing in Ireland, because of our distance from those ports, our poor facilities and infrastructure, it would cost us 25 per cent more.  Yet the Commission have said that if they did not impose a super-levy they could resolve the problem of surplus milk by reducing the price by something like 15 per cent.</P>
    <P>There has not been much debate on that in Ireland.  It means that 15 per cent would succeed in taking a sufficient number of people out of milk production in those countries to bring us back to a situation where we would not have a surplus. The New Zealand situation is often referred to but she exports in the region of 80,000 tons of butter whereas there are almost 1 million tonnes in cold storage in the European Community.  Even if the 80,000 tonnes of New Zealand butter were taken out of that, the amount is relatively small but in such event, the New Zealanders would almost certainly have sold their butter on the world market. They do not keep butter in cold storage.  In that case we would have sold that much less so we would have a similar amount.  Nevertheless, we concede a considerable <Col N="392" /> advantage to the people of New Zealand.</P>
    <P>That is bad economic policy but for one reason or another it should not be seen as the nub of the problem.  If we take into account the other differences, the difference in price arising out of the sort of products we produce from our milk and the way in which we market them, together with the MCAs, the Irish farmer is at a disadvantage of about 20 per cent.  The Commission says that a 15 per cent reduction in price would reduce our surpluses to manageable proportions. MCAs are a complete contradiction of the idea of a free market in agriculture but if these other farmers did not have the advantage to which I referred, we would revert to a situation in which dairy produce would not be in great surplus within the Community.  We are not at the 600-gallon level of production because of our land being inferior or because of our farmers not being prepared to work as hard as their counterparts in Europe.  We are at that level of production because of the disadvantages we have been at in recent years.  With some improvement in the management of our food-processing industry and with an improvement in the rate of inflation which in turn would result in a reduction in the costs the Irish farmers must bear, I am confident that, with the help of the Community, we could come to terms with the present problem without the need to disrupt the whole process of decision-making in Athens.</P>
    <P>Whatever reason the Community can have for maintaining the situation with New Zealand &mdash; whether it be in the context of international security, of solidarity or of an old friendship &mdash; let them levy the charge not against the CAP but against this other policy.  In this way, it would be seen for what it is, a charge incurred not by the farmers of Europe but by European politicians for entirely different reasons.</P>
    <P>We should not adopt the attitude of never being able to reach the 1,000-gallon yield.  We have the capacity to catch up provided we are working in equal conditions but for many reasons it is time to have another look at the policy which has <Col N="393" /> widened the difference in income between the strong farmers in these richer areas and the poorer farmers.  I represent the constituency of ConnachtUlster and I cannot help but notice that while that constituency includes 42 per cent of the farmers of Ireland, we receive about 17 per cent in terms of the guarantee side of the benefits to Irish agriculture. Therefore, farmers of ConnachtUlster cannot regard the CAP as the policy which enables them, the smaller and the weaker, the ones with the poorer infrastructure, to gain a foothold in European markets or to achieve a level of income comparable with that available in industry or in any other part of the Community.</P>
    <P>The spokesman on agriculture for Fianna Fáil mentioned the whole question of economic convergence.  One of the strongest arguments we can make in favour of a derogation for Ireland in so far as any mechanism for the prevention of further expansion of dairy produce is concerned, is this whole idea of economic convergence, an ideal to which lip service has been paid down through the years by the bigger economies of Europe.  They are getting quite an amount of what they want from the Community.  They have at their disposal a market that is relatively close to being a free market.  They are achieving the opportunity to develop their industries in a market of almost 300 million people.  On the other hand it is being said in relation to the proposals concerning the CAP that we should leave the weak where they are and should allow the strong to remain strong although they have become strong as a result of the policies they wish now to discontinue.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of debate in the European Parliament, and I am sure also at Council of Ministers Meetings, about the harmonisation of laws and regulations.  We have gone far enough in that direction, at least until such time as we succeed in making more progress towards economic convergence.  I am sure that the people of Europe would like to see the economy of Ireland grow until our standard of living and our industrial and agricultural outputs are as great as theirs but they must understand that <Col N="394" /> there will have to be certain concessions on their part if we are to achieve that position.  They must realise that economic convergence will not come about merely as a result of the creation of a free market.  If we are to throw open our economy to competition from the more advanced economies, at some stage the areas in which we can achieve progress must be identified.</P>
    <P>It has been said repeatedly in the Community that the workings of the free market will give to the various regions of the Community the opportunity to produce and sell within that market those products that they are good at producing, provided they are marketed properly.  It is obvious that we have the conditions and the personnel and that we have begun to put together the structures that will create a situation in which the Irish dairy industry will be on an equal basis with that of the rest of Europe.  Then, in a free and firm market, we will be able to compete.  If there is an argument for giving the go-ahead to any industry in any region of the Community, that industry must be our dairy industry.  In this way the Community will be taking one positive step in the direction of bringing about real economic convergence.  There are people in Europe who believe that 60 per cent of the budget should not be spent for the benefit of one sector.  Consequently, they talk of changing the CAP. I do not think that proportion goes to the benefit of one section only.</P>

      <P>Deputy M. Brennan has sought and has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of redundancies in a factory in Ballymote.  The Deputy has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not need 20 minutes.  All I want is five or ten minutes to highlight the fact that Shamrock Castors and Wheels Limited in Ballymote, County Sligo, who employ about 60 <Col N="395" /> people, have given notice to 27 people that they will be made redundant.  Ballymote is a small town in my constituency and it serves as a service centre for a large section of County Sligo.  This part of County Sligo is very rural and is some distance from Sligo town.  Many years ago Ballymote had a railway station from which many people left the area to emigrate to different parts of the world. Some of them never came back to that part of Sligo.  Recently the people of Ballymote and its hinterland had the benefit of two small industries established on the outskirts of the town.  Unfortunately, because of the crippling effects of the recession one of those industries has already gone to the wall leaving its work force as a few in the dole queue which to many seems endless.</P>
      <P>Worse was to come.  Only this week workers in Shamrock Castors and Wheels Limited heard the chilling news that 27 of them were asked to be made redundant. This is the last and only industry in Ballymote with the exception of perhaps two or three who employ a handful of people.  Where so many people are working happily in a small industry such as this it is terrible that 27 people are being made redundant and one wonders where they will go.  I cannot see that most of them will ever get jobs in that area again unless the Government can do something to help them.  Employment opportunities in all of my constituency have been either eliminated or threatened at an alarming rate.</P>
      <P>In August 1982 &mdash; I raised this previously in the House and the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was present and he knows all about this &mdash; 400 workers in the Snia synthethics factory in Snia were asked to take an extended holiday of six weeks.  They waited day after day, week after week, month after month until finally in November this year a decision was made that the factory was to be closed.  That industry employed over 400 people from different parts of Sligo and Leitrim and was a catchment area for that area.  Unfortunately, most of these people have not got jobs yet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="396" /> This time last year in my town of Tubbercurry, Basta Limited laid off 120 workers.  That factory was owned by a former Member of this House, Deputy James Gallagher, a man who brought much industry into the west of Ireland and did more for industry there than any other TD could do or ever will do, I am sure, because he worked so hard for industry in the west.  He died a few months ago.  If he were alive today I wonder if the factory in Ballymote that was set up by him and later sold to a German parent company, Shamrock Castors and Wheels, would be in the position it is in today.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the IDA because of the unemployment situation in County Sligo and in particular in my constituency and I received a reply from them which said:</P>
    <P>I refer to your letter of 25 October seeking information on job opportunities at Tubbercurry, Ballymote and Collooney.  We are conscious of the 120 redundancies at Basta Limited, Tubbercurry, and are giving priority to obtaining a project for the 24,000 square foot advance factory there at present.  Approximately 10 promoters have visited Tubbercurry in the past 12 months and there has been a favourable response.</P>
    <P>Over ten promoters have gone to Tubbercurry and have looked at the 20,000 square foot factory but unfortunately have not come up with the right type of employment for it.  With Ballymote, Tubbercurry and Snia, Sligo has suffered greatly since this time last year.  As the Minister has told us, we have some new industries and when we met Mr. White of the IDA we were led to hope that some new industries would come on line in the new industrial estate in Sligo town, but Sligo town is a centre of population for the north-west and many people live there.  In rural areas such as I come from not many jobs are available.  What are the people of south Sligo to do?  We have a 24,000 square foot factory in Collooney and a German company were to come and set up there but unfortunately they did not do so.  The Minister here present is aware of that also.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="397" /> Sligo has been very badly hit.  The <i>Sligo Champion</i> of Friday, 18 November, stated that Sligo's jobless figure had risen by 69 per cent in ten years and the work force has increased by over 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>I understand that one reason Shamrock Castors and Wheels are being closed is that they are unable to pay the crippling ESB bill, which I believe is £10,000 per month.  That is crippling when you have fewer than 60 people employed.  I ask the Minister if anything at all can be done for this part of County Sligo which I am sure has suffered more in the past 12 months than any other part of Ireland.  I am delighted that Deputy McCartin is here in the House because he should know the position as well as I know since he represents the constituency of Sligo-Leitrim.</P>
    <P>I live on the doorstep of Tubbercurry and Ballymote.  I wonder can the Minister do anything to help.  I believe production is stopping in one section of the factory because they are unable to pay their ESB bill.  If this happens castors for hospital beds and trollies and for heavy industrial use will have to be imported.  This is the only factory which makes these heavy duty castors but from now on they will be making castors for furniture only.</P>
    <P>When the Minister takes all these facts into account I am sure he will do everything possible to help them with this crippling electricity bill over £10,000 a month.  No small industry could afford such an electricity bill.  I do not want to delay the House any longer but I want to know if the Minister can do anything to stop 27 people going on the dole queue before Christmas.  Last year 120 people in Tubbercurry and over 400 in Snia joined the dole queue and many of them came from south Sligo.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to assure Deputy Brennan and Deputy McCartin that I appreciate the importance of the Shamrock Castors and Wheels industry in the Ballymote area.  I am familiar with this industry and with the chairman who recently took over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision was taken on a commercial basis because of accumulated and continuing losses in the operation.  The <Col N="398" /> new parent company, Tenta Rollen, are seeking to reorganise the company to become viable and to identify new products to replace those which are not selling very well at present.  This plant is associated with a zinc-plating plant in Sligo which provides some of the raw materials used.  As Deputy Brennan said, one of the problems they are facing is the high cost of electricity.  I am very concerned about the high cost of electricity in Ireland especially for industry.  The cost of domestic electricity is not very high when compared with European standards but the cost of electricity to industrial users in Ireland is either the highest or the second highest in Europe and this is causing problems.</P>
    <P>I have established a commission of inquiry into the electricity industry and asked them to produce a report within six months of the date of their being set up. They have provided me with an interim report in recent days and I hope some action can be taken on foot of these reports to reduce some of the costs of electricity generation.  However, investment in electricity is long-term because one must build up generating capacity over a long period and it is not easy to revert a decision once it is taken.  It will be difficult to bring about instantaneous improvements in electricity prices, in fact it will be impossible.  One of the areas that might be looked at is the way industrial electricity is priced as against domestic electricity and whether the balance is right in view of the number of people in employment who depend on industry.  Of course there is a cost involved in any change for the domestic consumer.  This is not something the ESB would do lightly or that I would recommend lightly, but it is something that should be looked at.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, Shamrock Castors and Wheels were taken over last year by Tenta Rollen, a German company, previously owned by Hufa Rollen, another German company.  The company have received substantial assistance from the IDA.  Is it necessary for me to give a list of all the different forms of assistance this firm have been given?  They have made applications for further assistance <Col N="399" /> which are being examined at present.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred to the overall question of the promotion of the south Sligo area and industry in that part of Ireland.  As he is aware, the IDA have a fair amount of infrastructure in place for industrial development.  There are eight acres of industrial land in the possession of the IDA in Ballymote.  They also have an advanced factory of 10,500 square feet which is being actively promoted.  There are 120 acres of IDA land in Sligo county, six advance factories and two small industry units.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see that the IDA have put in place all the things that are necessary for industrial expansion, but the problem is to get promotors who are prepared to put some of their money at risk alongside the very substantial IDA money.  The Government cannot create jobs on their own; there has to be a partner who is prepared to put money at risk.  That is the way the system works. The level of taxation would be even higher if the Government were to bear 100 per cent of the risk involved.  It is fair to say that there is a good infrastructure in south Sligo ready for promoters but, <Col N="400" /> as I said, the problem is to get people to take the risk in present market circumstances.</P>
    <P>Ninety eight per cent of the products of Shamrock Castors and Wheels is exported to the German parent company and distributed by them in Germany. Apart from the electricity costs, what has caused the problem is the industrial depression in Germany and in the Community generally.  That is something neither this Government nor any other government can do a lot about.  There is some sign of an up-turn in the European economy, particularly in the German economy.  I hope that this will lead to a healthier position for the German parent company and hence give greater assurance of the jobs in Sligo.</P>
    <P>I assure the Deputy and the House that the official agencies concerned will do everything possible to assist this company to devise a recovery package which will maintain the now reduced work force and enable it to increase as soon as the market improves.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.20 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 29 November 1983.</P>

My Department, however, have made inquiries of the corporation who state that effluent does not discharge in this area and that they are not aware of any effluent on the beach.  They suggest that the Deputy may be referring to a particular type of seaweed which was carried in on the tide during the summer and which gave off an offensive smell during humid weather.  The corporation had this seaweed removed from the beach last July.</P>
      <P>I understand that the corporation have recently received representations from a local residents' association regarding the strand, that they are at present investigating the matters raised and that they will be replying to the association shortly.</P>

      <P>The person named in the question has been employed by the Commissioners of Public Works since 1968 as a seasonal worker on the summer maintenance of the Brosna catchment drainage scheme.  Due to restricted finances, he received only ten weeks' work in 1982 and eight weeks' work in the current year.  As the breaks in employment between the 1981 and 1982 seasons and the 1982 and 1983 seasons each exceeded 26 consecutive weeks, continuity of employment for the purposes of the Redundancy Payments Acts, has been broken.  In the circumstances, the person named in the question does not now have the minimum of two years' continuous service to qualify for redundancy payments under those Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person named in the question has, however, the right of appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.  He may <Col N="331" /> do so on Form R.P. 51A which may be obtained from the Department of Labour, the local employment exchange or office or the local office of the National Manpower Service.</P>

      <P>There has been no avoidable delay in taking up the accommodation.  An extensive scheme of works was called for to render the premises, most of which were rented as shell buildings, suitable for the proposed user.

The team is now well advanced in the preparation of a planning brief for the hospital and it is expected <Col N="335" /> that this should be completed by the end of the year.  Because of the constraints on capital resources it is not possible at this stage to say when building work will commence.</P>

    <P>(ii)  Maternity Unit at St. John of God Hospital, Cahercalla&mdash;A new 30 bed maternity unit is being provided in Ennis at the St. John of God Hospital, Cahercalla. Agreement has been reached between the health board and the St. John of God Order whereby the Order will make available to the health board 30 maternity beds, operating theatres and a labour ward suite.  The unit is now ready for use and I have asked the Board to examine the possibility of staffing the unit from their own resources.</P>

      <P>It is a matter for the individual farmer, in association with his adviser, to decide as to what line of production suits him best. Prices for malting barley grown under contract are higher than those for feeding barley, and of course the barley market is supported by the intervention system for feed barley.  There is already a good export trade in barley of malting quality and there are prospects of increased exports.  These factors should encourage an increase in the acreage under this crop.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Deputy has obviously been given a very partial account of the facts relating to the manning of escorts and I propose to give a brief account here to correct the picture.</P>
      <P>First the background.  The provision of prison officers for escort duty is very expensive.  It has been costing in the region of £1.5 million a year in overtime payments alone.  Financial constraints and the need for efficiency suggested that the system ought to be reviewed.  I found that it had been agreed that an escort was to consist of one officer per prisoner plus one extra officer.  This was not, however a rule that was meant to be or indeed that was capable of being rigorously adhered to, for a number of reasons.  One reason is that an escort is sent to all sittings of the Circuit Court when criminal cases are being heard, but frequently, the main reason is not to bring prisoners to the court but to take prisoners from the court to the prison and there can be no certainty as to how many prisoners may be committed or, indeed in some cases, if any at all will be.  Another reason is that sometimes there are literally not enough prison officers available for the duty &mdash; even on the basis of being recalled from their rest day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I considered that it would be more consonant with practice in many cases and more consonant with the reality of the situation, which includes the fact that many prisoners can be trusted not to give any difficulty irrespective of the size of the escort, if the practice was amended to give governors a discretion in all cases as to the number of escorting officers.  My decision was conveyed to governors in a circular dated 11 October 1983, a copy of which will be circulated with the Official Report.  The Prison Officers' Association protested at my decision and the consequence was the recent industrial action in Mountjoy Prison, following which an <Col N="353" /> agreement has been reached between myself and the association on a number of issues, of which the manning level of escorts is only one.  A revised circular on that subject is about to issue.  It spells out something that was implicit in the October circular, namely, that, in exercising his discretion, the governor will have regard to the need for a larger escort when a prisoner known to be violent or prone to escape is concerned.</P>
    <P>I now come to the events of 2 November. The Acting Governor determined the size of escorts for the following day for the Central Criminal Court and the Dublin Circuit Court.  This involved a cutback on the number provisionally determined by a more junior officer.  The Acting Governor fixed the number at two Assistant Chief Officers and nine officers in all.  As it so happened, those escorts proved to be considerably more than adequate for the number of prisoners dealt with on 3 November.  The escort for the Dublin District Court for 3 November was also determined on 2 November, at two officers for three prisoners: this was increased to four prisoners next morning. The ratio of officers to prisoners was not unusual for a District Court escort (where Garda assistance is also available).  Staff protests were made, however, probably (but subject to the findings of the inquiry I propose to have made into certain events during that week) because the decision of the Acting Governor in relation to the level of escorts for the higher courts meant that four officers who had expected to be called in from their rest days to work overtime on those escorts were not, in fact, recalled.</P>
    <P>The Governor of Mountjoy Prison intimated on 28 October that he proposed to take leave until 11 November. He returned briefly to the prison on 6 and 7 November and then resumed leave.</P>
    <P>Following is the circular letter referred to:</P>
    <P>To Each Governor,</P>
    <P>At recent discussions at the Department on the question of overtime working in the prisons and places of detention involving Governors and <Col N="354" /> Department officials, there was general agreement that a significant contributory factor in high overtime levels in the Prison Service was the level of escorts of prisoners to Courts, hospitals etc., Manning levels of one officer per prisoner plus one officer are sometimes unnecessary and wasteful of manpower.  For the future, therefore, discretion should be exercised as to the appropriate manning levels for each escort.  Decisions on the manning levels should depend on the type of prisoner(s) and other relevant considerations.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): Because of the various demands on the Prison capital allocation for 1983, it was not possible in the context of the departmental Estimates to earmark money for the fitting out of the depot.  Exact calculations of projected annual expenditure on large construction projects are, however, of their nature subject to review and it became apparent in the course of the latter part of 1983 that expenditure on some projects this year would be less than anticipated earlier. Accordingly, it has proved possible to proceed with the fitting out of the depot and it is hoped to have substantial progress made in the matter by the end of the year.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): There is no intention of closing any Garda station; on the contrary the proposals now being put forward are designed to provide for more regular opening of stations and at times that are best suited to local requirements.</P>
      <P>These proposals arise from an examination that has been carried out of ways and means by which the Garda service to rural areas can be improved.  They involve the introduction of a new system of policing which has been tried out as a pilot scheme in two Garda districts &mdash; Claremorris, County Mayo and Thomastown, County Kilkenny.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main feature of the new system is that the Garda personnel allocated to a group of small rural stations combine as <Col N="357" /> a team to provide patrolling and other services for the whole area covered by these stations.  It is intended that each such area will be provided with a Garda car.  Each small station in an area will have a garda permanently assigned to it and it will be served as well by other gardaí assigned to the area who will attend as required &mdash; for example, to open the station on days when the local garda has time off, etc.</P>
    <P>The service to the public is being further improved by the provision of new communications facilities.  A radiophone at every small station will enable the public to contact the gardaí at times when the station is closed and as all gardaí on patrol will be in radio contact there should be a much more effective response to calls requesting Garda attention or assistance.</P>
    <P>The Garda authorities are satisfied that the scheme represents a real improvement over the present system of rural policing and it is intended to extend the new scheme into further pilot areas in the near future.</P>

      <P>Arrangements have been made to initiate architectural planning of the proposed extension to the Christian Brothers school, New Ross, at an early date.  These arrangements follow recent agreement with the school authorities regarding the range of accommodation to be provided. The new accommodation is intended to replace all existing prefabricated classrooms. The question of when construction may commence cannot arise for consideration until the planning process has been completed.</P>

      <P>In reply to a question of 15 November 1983 on the staffing of the school in question, I explained that the assignment of teachers to an individual vocational school from within the authorised allocation is the responsibility of the vocational education committee.</P>
      <P>Apart from consideration of the pressure of the duties of my office as Minister for Education, which would not allow me to arrange to meet deputations from all individual schools which might request a meeting with me, I should point out that the assignment of teachers to Waterville vocational school is, accordingly, a matter for determination by County Kerry Vocational Education Committee and that I have no function in the matter.</P>
