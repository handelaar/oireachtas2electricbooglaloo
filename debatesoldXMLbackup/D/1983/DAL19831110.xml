      <P>Yesterday I outlined two suggestions to the Minister, and I am very pleased that he is here this morning and that he can hear for himself these practical suggestions.  In welcoming Minister, many stages of this most important legislation I said yesterday and I say again this morning that, it is to be regretted, you are failing to involve the community in crime prevention.  This is perhaps being done inadvertently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I was trying to command the Minister's attention in the best manner I could through the Chair.  I make these suggestions to the Minister because he has a golden opportunity now to reach out to the community for the support that they are only too willing to give.  My first suggestion yesterday was that the Minister involve a network of community watch groups in Dublin on a pilot basis. I know he has conducted the initial research in this area and that his senior officials have been out in America studying systems there.  The time is now right to do something about that.  I am making my call directly to him here in the House to set up such systems, one on the north side and one on the south side of the city of Dublin to start.  The statistics indicate that there should be a marked reduction in crime if this is produced in the right manner on the system used in America.  The Minister is aware that we are twice as heavily policed as America, and that is an alarming statistic; 1.7 per 1,000 in America as against 3.14 per 1,000 in Ireland, a high statistic, yet we have this huge rise in crime.  Establishing this network and also establishing some type of educational citizens' support bureau is the second point I made where incentives are given directly to the public.  Laudable as it is to produce legislation of this kind and needed as it might be, again it is not bringing in the citizens to give the Minister the support that he needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night highlighted in very real terms the huge problem facing the country on the drugs issue alone when £1.5 million worth of drugs were found in bales at a perimeter fence at Dublin Airport. That is drifting into almost a South American situation such as exists in Quito, Ecuador, La Paz and Bogota where the stage has been reached where people will just snatch and grab and it is not just handbag snatching.  People are <Col N="2006" /> so desperate for a fix that they snatch wrist watches, tear jewellery off women's necks and so on.  This happens in an everyday situation.  Tourists are warned about happenings on the streets of these cities, and I can see it reaching out to the streets of Dublin.  People pay enormous sums of money for drugs.  The Minister can use, through his good offices, the whole network of residents' associations, youth clubs and so on to involve people in assisting him.  I am sorry to be repeating myself here but it is important in his presence to refer again to what I mentioned yesterday.  In America people are invited to tour around the cities in squad cars to see crime at first hand for themselves. That is the sort of practical action that is getting to school children, bringing them to police stations to see how the whole network operates.  Laws alone, excellent as they are, are not sufficient; there must be an educational process involving tremendous support all the time for the Garda.</P>
    <P>I could quote passages from the <i>Garda Review</i> where the guards say that every parent and child in the community must be involved in combatting the horror of drugs and petty crime also.  I realise that this legislation contains far-reaching measures pertaining to detention and so on to tackle the problems of subversion etc. but it is a criminal justice Bill.  A Superintendent of the Garda referred recently to the drug pusher as worse than a murderer.  Such statements are not made without much thought and consideration.  This was Assistant Commissioner David Leahy in the crime branch, referring to this problem.  What practical measures can be taken?  Names and photographs of drug pushers could be published in the daily newspapers to make the public familiar with the problem. My next suggestion might seem a trifle old-fashioned, perhaps going back to the wild west days, but we have a situation that is nearly wild west in Dublin.  We could go back to the system of rewards and incentives to the public to encourage them to disclose information to the Garda.  Rewards could be given to youth groups, to citizens and so forth to <Col N="2007" /> encourage them to come forward.  Much can be done in that area.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the future of our tourist industry is in serious jeopardy.  In fact, in Border regions it has been virtually wiped out not alone by the sterling differential but by the activities of criminals who operate in those areas.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle, who represents a Border constituency, realises this.  It was sad to hear on a BBC 2 programme recently Dublin being referred to as the heroin centre of Europe.  The ramifications of that well researched and accurate programme are serious.  Any people in England watching that programme would be hesitant about coming here on holidays. That is the type of damage crime is causing to this city and country.</P>
    <P>Local authorities in their efforts, such as the &ldquo;I love Dublin&rdquo; campaign, are swimming against the tide in the face of crime of this type.  If the Minister carries out my suggestions he would get practical results.  I am not suggesting that he should rush into establishing a community watch programme throughout the city because we do not wish to see such a programme flounder in any way.  We want success.  In the no-go areas in the city there is a need for stern action.  Many people are willing to help the authorities.  Last night I met a deputation about this problem and they put forward two practical suggestions. The first suggestion was that parents be made responsible for the crimes of their children until they reach a certain age. Many of these problems prevail in a situation where parents have opted out of their responsibilities.  It is possible that they are numbed into a situation where they believe it is not possible to do anything but they should be made accept some responsibility for the crimes of juveniles.  If such a provision is introduced I have no doubt there will be a rapid reduction in the number of juvenile crimes.  If necessary we should introduce a system of on-the-spot fines instead of jamming up our courts with petty crimes. We have an excellent Garda force which includes many ban-ghardaí and they can be used in a system involving citizens.</P>
    <P>The second suggestion made by the <Col N="2008" /> deputation dealt with the question of loitering. It is not an offence at present to loiter unless it is done under suspicious circumstances, and it is difficult to prove that.  We are all aware that there are areas in the city where gangs converge.  I know of instances where gardaí have told residents that they cannot do anything.  I accept that the Minister is making provision to enable gardaí to arrest on suspicion but that should be expanded to cover loitering.</P>
    <P>I feel disheartened that the provisions of the Bill do not reach out to the community more.  It should have included a sector of our society that is being exploited and under seige from criminals, the elderly.  I am pleased the Minister is present to hear details of a case that took place in my constituency recently.  A 93-year-old lady living alone in Rathmines had her arms broken and was savagely attacked for her paltry savings.  How can the Garda protect a person like that?  A list should be compiled of all the elderly people living in each area and in these days of high technology that should not be too difficult.  Those senior citizens could then be visited on a systematic basis.  I accept that the Garda will respond by saying that they do not have enough members but those who have read literature about these problems in the United States are aware that they have dealt with them by involving the community.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister that in his efforts to tackle crime, drug abuse, attacks on the elderly and the huge rise in urban crime, he should try to involve the local community.  There is not any provision in the Bill for such involvement. I raised this issue some months ago and the Minister undertook to have a look at the situation.  I have no doubt that he would get tremendous support for such a proposal in Dublin.  We have all heard of the great plans for reviving deprived areas in Dublin and so on but practical action is not being taken.  We are simply passing legislation and increasing penalties.  Recently a driver got off scot-free for an offence.  I am not pointing the finger at the Minister for that but such action leads to angry reaction in a community. <Col N="2009" /> People feel they are not being protected.  I welcome the greater presence of gardaí on the streets but in spite of that the crime rate is escalating. Recently I drew the Minister's attention to an incident in Milltown where an elderly parish priest was attacked and parish funds taken.  I warned the Minister that residents there had told me they intended forming a vigilante group, something nobody wants to see happening, but such groups were formed out of frustration.  In my view the Garda should approach such groups and help them establish a watch group in their area to act with them.  There are many ways of dealing with crime and vandalism rather than introducing laws and imposing fines. I appeal to the Minister to take cognisance of the points I raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to welcome the provisions of the Bill and I congratulate the Minister on bringing it before us.  Some Members suggested that perhaps this represents an erosion of citizens' rights in some way, but it must be remembered that the Bill is being introduced out of necessity, by public demand. While one must be careful to have due regard for the constitutional rights of citizens and to ensure that those rights are upheld at all times, regard must also be had for the constitutional rights of the victims of crimes.  People may have fears about an erosion of constitutional rights but that has to be balanced against the necessity to bring in legislation to deal with the problems facing us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Probably some people would suggest that the breakdown in law and order has happened in a matter of months or weeks, but that is not so.  It has been a gradual process over a number of years, but it has now got so bad that many citizens are afraid to walk the streets of our cities and towns by night or day.  We have to contend with a dangerous and difficult situation.  As Deputy Brady mentioned, the Bill which has come before us because of the serious situation can only work if it is enforced, if there is the will in the Department of Justice and among the public to accept the need for it and to <Col N="2010" /> ensure it is enforced.  For that we need full co-operation with the Garda.  We do not want a &ldquo;them&rdquo; and &ldquo;us&rdquo; situation in our cities and our towns.  As the previous speaker mentioned, there must be co-operation between the Department of Justice and the community, even if it means setting up community watch groups.  There must be better liaison between the gardaí and the community so that the wrongdoer or the potential wrong-doer knows before he embarks on a crime that there is the real possibility he will be caught and punished.  That is where we come to the deterrent.</P>
    <P>In the past few years it appears that people about to embark on a crime reckon the odds, and the odds they take into account are the odds of being caught or of getting away with the crime.  Very often teenagers start on a course of crime by stealing a car.  They get away with it and they do it again.  With each theft they become more daring, and they then break and enter, carry out a robbery and perhaps they knock someone down or even kill them.  When the gardaí attempt to apprehend them they often ram the Garda car and there is quite a possibility that they will get away with all of this. They know that if they are caught they could perhaps get a jail sentence but because of overcrowding in the prisons there is a good possibility they will get out in a short time and there is also the possibility that they will not get a stiff sentence in the courts.  These young people continue committing crimes, their friends become involved, and suddenly it is a huge operation.  That is where we have to tackle the problem.  We must have realistic deterrents that will make it clear to anybody about to embark on a campaign of lawlessness that there will be a reckoning at the end of the day and that they will have to pay the price.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady mentioned that perhaps parents could be made responsible, and I think we will have to move along those lines.  There is no sense in the gardaí being involved and the laws being applied if the parents do not recognise the seriousness of the crime and their responsibility to society.  With each crime committed more and more taxpayers' money <Col N="2011" /> has to be spent in the long and tedious work of bringing the perpetrators to justice. That problem will have to be considered in the near future.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the stealing of cars because it is a crime that is increasing at an alarming rate.  In some circles it is not regarded as a serious crime.  We must remember the other crimes it can lead to: it can lead to the old-fashioned smash and grab crime, to hit-and-run accidents, and cars can be used to convey drugs. The stolen car can be used for many unlawful purposes and could lead to the loss of life.  For that reason the Garda will have to pay more attention to the crime of stealing cars.  There must be a crackdown.</P>
    <P>Frequently Garda cars are rammed. Some system will have to be devised to prevent this.  There should be methods other than car chases to stop criminals or else special Garda cars will have to be built.  It is a ridiculous situation that a new patrol car that pursues a group of young people who are not driving their own car and who have no responsibility towards themselves or anyone else can be wrecked totally in dealing with one criminal.  It is an aspect that has to be considered carefully.</P>
    <P>The other element in the law and order process is the courts.  There has been criticism in this House on many occasions in relation to sentences that were given or were not given for specific crimes.  The inconsistency of some of the penalties certainly raises some questions.  I do not want to go into detail on the matter, but for some fairly serious crimes the perpetrators seem to have got away with suspended sentences or even the Probation Act.  On the other hand, there may be a seemingly innocuous type of crime and the person concerned gets a stiff penalty. There is a certain inconsistency in the sentences given, and this matter must be considered.  There is no sense in having a Criminal Justice Bill and the courts to mete out the penalties unless such penalties are handed down according to the seriousness of the crime.  I am not a legal person and I will not suggest what should be done, but there are people in this <Col N="2012" /> House who have considerable experience in the Law Courts and they should be able to come forward with suggestions to deal with the problems.</P>
    <P>The prison service is another important element in the system.  It is well known that if a person commits a crime there is good possibility that he will not serve the entire sentence because of overcrowding in our prisons.  He may in fact serve very little of that sentence.  The potential criminal is well aware of this fact.  The potential criminal knows before he sets out on his wrongdoing that, if he or she has to serve a sentence at the end of the day, it will not be too bad anyway because he or she will get out after a few weeks or a couple of months.  We shall have to tackle this situation.  It may mean spending more money and building more prisons but we shall have to tackle it.  We must ensure that those who are sentenced must expect to serve those sentences.</P>
    <P>In regard to the public attitude to the wrongdoer, we all throw up our hands in horror when a crime is committed.  We say it should not have been allowed to happen and so on.  We say it is wholly despicable.  What happens when the criminal comes to justice?  The bleeding hearts start.  The holier than though come along and say there are extenuating circumstances and this allegedly unfortunate criminal should be treated with leniency. Perhaps he did not mean to commit the crime.  Perhaps there was something on his mind as otherwise he would not have committed it and that should be taken into account.  Strings of references are read out in court pleading with the judge to treat the criminal with leniency. Witnesses are called to speak on his behalf.  When he is sentenced a certain section of the public become concerned about whether or not the conditions in the prison in which he will serve his sentence measure up to the luxury to which he was accustomed.  There are those who regularly complain that conditions in the prisons are not good enough really for the allegedly unfortunate wrongdoer.</P>
    <P>We should remember that the victims of these criminals also have rights and, were they asked as to whether or not the criminals who are punished were living in <Col N="2013" /> sufficient luxury, they would have a very firm answer.  If someone does something unlawful, such as breaking and entering, or a hit and run, or any serious crime, then he must expect not to live in the lap of luxury while serving his sentence.  I am not suggesting criminals should be compelled to live in bare cells on bread and water, but they should not expect any kind of luxury should they be unlucky enough to have to serve even a short sentence.</P>
    <P>Another element in the system is that of consecutive sentencing in relation to crimes committed while on bail.  If sentences had to be served consecutively instead of concurrently, as seems to be the practice now, that would act as a deterrent to a criminal.  At the moment criminals take time off from lawlessness, go into court and get bail and, while on bail they proceed with their criminal activities.  I heard of one occasion on which a group were due in court to answer for their crimes and they were picked up by the gardaí actually on their way to do another job before they appeared in court.</P>
    <P>Speaking as a non-legal person, there are some crimes of such a serious nature that it should be almost impossible for the criminal to get bail.  I know legal people will not accept this argument. Where there is danger that the criminal will abscond while on bail we should deal with that situation seriously by ensuring that he does not get bail.  If bail is granted it should be granted only at great personal cost.  If the crimes involved are lucrative enough there will be no difficulty in getting bail bonds of £20,000 or £30,000 or even more.  These should be personal bail bonds.  They should be of such magnitude that the person on bail cannot afford to abscond.  Should he be in the position that he can afford it then no bail should be granted.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of our modern society is the need for better protection.  The Bill does not deal with this aspect.  All the technological aids now available to police forces throughout the world should be available to the Garda.  Remember, these aids are available to the criminal.  It is nothing unusual for criminals to use <Col N="2014" /> two-way radios and other types of modern communication to assist them in their criminal acts.  The Garda have not sufficient technological assistance at their disposal. They should be equipped in such manner as to ensure that a patrol anywhere at any time can be contacted.  In my constituency &mdash; I am sure Deputy Power will have something to say about this &mdash; there are many towns where the population has increased dramatically over the last 20 years.  At the same time the number of gardaí has decreased.  I know the number has increased overall in the country generally, but the potential criminal is very quick to know the weaknesses in the system.</P>
    <P>We will have to do something to increase the number of gardaí in the new urban areas such as those I have mentioned in Kildare, places like Maynooth, Leixlip, Celbridge and the larger towns like Newbridge and Naas &mdash; Naas not so much because there is a large Garda station there.  Such towns which are very convenient to Dublin and the push that has been put on to beat the criminals in the large cities is forcing them into the rural areas or towns on the periphery of Dublin.  They can get back to the city within half an hour having committed their deeds and they have a reasonably good chance of getting away.</P>
    <P>A few weeks ago, in Leixlip, there were a group of four or five ladies returning from bingo.  A car stopped beside them.  Three young men jumped out and grabbed the handbags of three or four of them.  Unfortunately, one woman did not readily release her handbag and she was dragged a couple of hundred yards along the road by the fellow, who managed to get into the car, close the door and drag her after him.  That woman could have been killed.  She was very distressed.  That is only one incident.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the question of public awareness and preparedness to assist the Garda.  Before we were married my wife had an experience in this city. She was stopped at traffic lights at seven o'clock on a summer's evening.  There were several people on the street and there was a queue of cars at the traffic lights.  Her arm was dragged through the <Col N="2015" /> window of the car, causing serious injury and laceration, and her handbag was snatched.  Not one person made any attempt to assist.  In regard to all the stories I have heard in relation to handbag snatching the same situation has arisen: nobody seems to want to get involved.  At one time the lawlessness in the United States and the public attitude to it there used to be condemned.  We have that situation here now.  Nobody wants to get involved or to help.  This is a sad thing.  If we are to beat the criminals the public must get involved.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned towns where the population has grown very dramatically and where the Garda strength has decreased.  I refer again specifically to towns in County Kildare.  Take, for instance, the situation where a citizen has a serious problem.  Somebody breaks in and enters his house.  He rings 999.  With luck he may get through.  Calls made on the periphery of the Dublin area are taken at the Central Exchange and relayed to the local gardaí.  This may take a little bit of time.  Suppose, for instance, the person does not have a telephone and decides to go to the local Garda station. He could find a notice on the door to say that the station closes at 6 p.m.  What is that person expected to do?  The would-be wrongdoer knows the time at which the local Garda station closes.  He know that if he embarks on a crime after 6 p.m. the Garda car will have to come a certain distance and he can calculate the time he has to get away.  This factor has been used very successfully by criminals in many instances.</P>
    <P>It may be expensive to do it, but whether we like it or not we must change that situation.  I would appeal through you, Sir, to the Minister of State to take account of the serious situation which exists in these areas of population on the periphery of the Greater Dublin area and where serious crimes are now taking place and from which the criminals get back to the city, in many cases without being detected, simply because there is no Garda station in the town or because the one that is there is not fully manned <Col N="2016" /> or may not be opened at the time.  That matter needs to be attended to as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>Leixlip has a population of approximately 12,000 but there is no Garda station there.  The gardaí in the station in Lucan have done a good job in trying to combat the problem there but the criminals know that the nearest Garda station is two or three miles away and that they have a reasonable chance of carrying out their misdeeds and having at least a good head start before the gardaí in Lucan are alerted.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the problems besetting the Garda: (1) lack of manpower; (2) the need for greater co-operation from the public; (3) the need for a communications system which is at least equal to that available to the criminals; and (4) they must have public opinion on their side.  Public opinion can be very fickle, as those of us in politics know.  The Garda may enjoy the support of the public today and tomorrow the situation may be somewhat different.  The public must realise that they will get what they deserve.  As they wish things to be, that is the way they will be.  The public must be more realistic and they must support in every possible way the efforts of the Garda to ensure that the laws of the country are enforced and that the rights of law-abiding citizens are protected.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the ever-increasing drug problem.  I must congratulate the Garda Drug Squad on their success in recent times, particularly taking into account the size of the hauls of drugs that are being brought to attention in recent times.  The vast amount of money involved in that racket is very frightening.  I have been informed that the black market drugs business is worth about £25 million.  There have been recent hauls of drugs to the value of £1 million or perhaps more.  The kind of secrecy and influence that a person can control who has access to that kind of finance is incredible.  That is a frightening aspect.  If there is one problem that we need to get to grips with quickly it is the drugs problem.  There has been some success but we need continued effort and greater resources to hold the situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2017" /> Otherwise, in a few years time there will be a problem the like of which could not have been anticipated.</P>
    <P>The whole system of bail should be severely tightened in relation to drug pushers.  I do not see why a person who has handled £1 million or £2 million worth of drugs which have been peddled to an unsuspecting community to destroy the very fabric of our society, particularly in relation to the young people, should have his or her constitutional rights taken into account when a question of bail arises.  The case should be viewed realistically and due attention should be given to what will happen if bail is granted and whether or not he or she will go to the market place to ply their evil trade once more.  Because of the vast amount of money they can control it is obvious that if they get bail they will abscond and set up elsewhere.  With modern communications it is easy to run a world-wide business.  We have to be careful in every instance that when such persons come before the courts the question of bail is carefully considered and that the sentence handed down is mandatory and of a kind that would make such persons sit up and take notice.</P>
    <P>The drug problem is beginning to spread into the new urban areas.  Again I would ask the Minister of State to convey this to the Minister.  Every measure possible must be taken to ensure that drug pushers will not be able to move into bigger populated areas with a high proportion of teenagers.  Such people are moving in, in some cases with considerable success.</P>
    <P>I referred to the need for more gardaí manning stations.  Next in importance is that we should have increased numbers of gardaí on the beat.  Some progress has been made in this respect in different areas, particularly in Dublin, and it has been having a good effect.  In highly populated areas, particularly approaching Christmas, there will be the annual Christmas rush by the criminal world and I suggest that extra gardaí be put on the beat during that period.</P>
    <P>Better education can help, particularly in regard to drugs, but also in the fight against law-breaking in general.  Special <Col N="2018" /> efforts need to be made to impress on young people the dangers and the consequences of embarking on careers of lawlessness.  They should be told clearly what will happen to them if they do that.</P>
    <P>The Bill brings criminal legislation up to date.  It will tighten our laws generally. It may have the effect of eroding certain constitutional rights, but the rights of 99.9 per cent of our people must be taken into account and given priority.  Our people have the right to go about their business without fear of molestation. They have the right to walk the streets by day or night without being mugged, robbed or raped.  I congratulate the Minister for having brought the Bill before us because it will do something to meet the requirements of our times.</P>
    <P>I doubt if the Bill goes far enough in relation to the laws of bail.  Reference was made last night to section 16.  I am not a legal person, but reading the section as it is drafted I can imagine it involving long hours of legal hassle in various courts throughout the country with various able legal eagles contesting the interpretation of the section.  I can foresee various people wandering through its labyrinth for days, weeks and months and at the end of the day good solicitors will have tied themselves in knots, with neither side able to prove the other wrong.</P>
    <P>I suggest that section needs serious consideration here.  Some time ago we had a Bill to amend the Constitution and it was discussed very carefully on radio and television.  I suggest that section 16 deserves the same wide-ranging debate. However, I think the general public will be fairly confused afterwards.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of the passage of this Bill we will have greater respect for law and order and that potential criminals will realise before they set out on the road of crime that at the end of the road there will be a reckoning that they will have to pay the price, and the community will be able to live and sleep easier.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a measure of the consensus about this Bill that I find myself completely in agreement with Deputy Durkan.  I welcome the provisions of the Bill.  During the Committee Stage there <Col N="2019" /> will be some among us to discuss the nitty-gritty of the legislation.</P>
      <P>This subject has taken up the time of various Governments in recent times.  I was involved in two such Governments. The Bill is necessary and timely because throughout the country there has been a demand for action.  In all probability bread and butter issues, economic matters, taxation are very important issues, but most people admit that their priority is the breakdown of law and order.  Our people are being attacked in their homes, it is no longer safe to walk the streets and rape has become commonplace.</P>
      <P>In my constituency this topic is discussed widely, particularly in the satellite towns in North Kildare.  As criminals find the going tough in metropolitan areas, in the inner city, they have begun to take trips outside where the pickings are comparatively easier.  Civilians, business people in Leixlip and Celbridge, have called public meetings, to which the Garda and public representatives have been invited, to see what can be done about it.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the rate of detection has been disappointing and this has brought about a casual attitude among criminals and a feeling of despair among the citizens who have been crying out for the strengthening of the criminal law which would provide greater aids to the Garda and greater penalties for convicted criminals.</P>
      <P>There may be some areas in the country where lawbreaking is not a daily occurrence but I am afraid it is a fact of daily life in others.  People who are not constantly reminded of it are lucky.  In my constituency premises are being broken into every day.  I know one businessman, after break-ins, who put up steel doors but he had a break-in through the roof a fortnight afterwards.  So far there has not been an arrest.  I suggest that more than 50 per cent of crimes go undetected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People have been waiting ages to see justice being done and at the same time we hear talk about constitutional rights. However, we see criminals who have no respect for the old, the feeble, the poor: <Col N="2020" /> everybody is fair game.  So we must pass legislation to curb the criminal scum and in doing so alleviate the unease of our people.  The general attitude of this Bill is to go ahead with it, and good luck to the Minister for having brought it before us.</P>
    <P>When everybody's liberty is at risk because of the criminals, we cannot afford to be too liberal.  The greatest sin we could commit at the moment is if we allow liberals to have their way.  It is not the business of lawyers to agree; it is their business to disagree.  I am confident that if I met a lawyer and said to him that I wanted him to prove to me that black was white he would say &ldquo;certainly&rdquo; and if I met somebody else within a week and said that I made a mistake, that I really meant that white was black, he would say that he would deal with that too.  The ordinary people want to give the go-ahead to this Bill.  They feel that if people break the law it is our duty to catch them, try them and if they are guilty lock them up, see that life is not too pleasant for them and keep them locked up until they serve their sentences.</P>
    <P>There has been a decline in respect for the law in the last 20 years.  I suppose as people get on in life every generation say that about the previous generation.  As a teacher I am sure I will be forgiven if I say that the emergence of this lawlessness coincides with the emergence 20 years ago of great liberals who got a lot of time from the media in putting their case across.  They were very concerned that there should not be any punishment in the schools.  Perhaps the Minister of State might not agree with me, but the cane was outlawed then.</P>
    <P>I remember in 1979 when there was a P and T strike which lasted for a long time and I asked an official in that Department what the cause of the strike was or what would cure it.  He said he did not know what would cure it now but if I wanted to know the cause he said we would want to go back 15 or 20 years ago when the cane was taken out of the teachers' hands in the schools.  It also coincided with the lack of parental discipline and control.  I know there are many people who suggest that we should bring back <Col N="2021" /> the birch but I am not advocating that.  I spoke to a member of the Tynwald in the Isle of Man this year about this and he said that even though the law is still on the books nobody has been birched since 1974 but the fact that it is in the law of the Isle of Man is a deterrent.</P>
    <P>Parents should be responsible for the actions of their children.  If they do not accept their responsibility perhaps it should be inserted into our law.  In my constituency there was a meeting recently at which responsible people felt that parents should be made responsible for the actions of their children up to a certain age.  I believe juveniles would be disciplined if their parents were forced to pay the penalty for their wrong doings. People did not consider this was necessary 20 years ago.</P>
    <P>It is vital that we have a change of attitude.  This has been suggested by many people.  If we wish to return to a situation where we have law abiding people and where we want people to have respect for private property and authority, I believe that politicians, teachers, gardaí, judges and parents who want to be treated with respect should show that they have earned that respect.  We have to show by our actions that we are a responsible people and have earned that respect.  I feel in many cases people in authority get the amount of respect they deserve.  I would include media people, writers, journalists, broadcasters, playwrights and all those who help to mould public opinion in this.  They have a duty also to play a responsible part.</P>
    <P>Some of them are inclined to pander to the lowest possible taste.  I have in mind one particular person who fantasises in an evening paper.  He has gone the full swing of the pendulum in his literary career from the religious to the irresposible. Even half truths and total untruths are trotted out like facts.  The most insulting remarks slip from his pen in a very slovenly fashion.  We are probably so used to this now that we do not realise it. Recently, when a visiting sportsman and his entourage were subjected to this man's writings they felt that this was the type of journalism that went on here.  It <Col N="2022" /> must have given him a very biased opinion of Irish newspapers in general.</P>
    <P>We all have a duty which we should face up to: to act responsibly and to speak out truthfully when the occasion demands, to try to restore law and order and respect for authority.  This should percolate down to clubs who also have a duty to try to curb violence on pitches and during matches as well as rowdyism on the streets afterwards.  If youth clubs and community asociations were all involved I believe vandalism would be curbed in the long run.  We have only to cantrast vandalism with the wonderful upsurge of interest in our tidy towns and the fact that if you involve people, especially young people, in planting trees and flowers they are much less likely to be vandalised afterwards.</P>
    <P>With regard to the legal profession, solicitors, barristers and judges have a part to play and they have to act responsibly. The liberals will continue to criticise this Bill.  I notice that the lawyers have come out as a body and said they are worried about the implications of it. They think it might infringe on the rights of individuals.  The general public are up in arms about the right of innocent people to live in peace.  The legal profession have said that this Bill will not interfere with the hardened criminals but will infringe on the innocent.  We should give the Bill a chance and see it working.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the Law Reform Commission who issued their fifth report in 1982.  I am not sure if they were given particular terms of reference or told the particular subjects to deal with.  The matters which engaged their attention up to now are civil liability for animals, defective premises, report on illigitimacy, the age of majority and the age of marriage. The work they have in progress is family law, evidence and Vagrancy Acts.  These are very laudable things, but is this an indication of the priorities which engage people's attention in law reform?  I believe that the matters we have before us now &mdash; some of this may have appeared in a bit of a hurry, and they are not fleshed out to the extent we would have liked to see done, but this may happen on Committee Stage &mdash; are matters <Col N="2023" /> which any Law Reform Commission should apply themselves to.  Perhaps their terms of reference do not allow them to do this and the matters they are asked to deal with are what they deal with.  But when we have judges in the Supreme Court, professors of law, barristers at law, senior counsel and many eminent people giving their time to a Law Reform Commission, I believe they should divert their attention to matters which are of more everyday importance.  I know these other matters are important too.</P>
    <P>It is good that this Bill increases penalties and allows sentences to run consecutively rather than concurrently and deals with bail and increased sentences. This will act as a deterrent.  I spoke recently to a person who lives in Singapore who was appalled at the drug situation here and how it had mushroomed in recent years.  One would imagine when one speaks about Singapore, which has a huge population and is at the crossroads of the world in relation to trade and traffic, that it would be an ideal haven for drugs and the dissemination of drugs; but the penalties there are very severe and are rigidly enforced.  There is no diplomatic immunity and if there is the slightest trace of drugs they are told to leave the country.  That is proof that where the law is strictly enforced and where penalties are severe it will act as a deterrent. If we want further proof of that it can be seen in the decline in drunken driving. This coincided with the use of the breath-alyser in connection with detection, proof and sentencing of drunken drivers.  I compliment the Minister on recent trends because the decline in drunken driving has resulted in a decline in fatal accidents.</P>
    <P>It is a pity that the system of investigating complaints has not been produced at the same time as this Bill.  Complaints against the Garda will be made and to ensure that there is a balance it would be better if the complaints system had been running in tandem with the Bill.  I am not accusing the Garda of doing anything wrong because I would say that the general perception by the public of the Garda is that they are good, decent people, guardians of the peace.  The public rely <Col N="2024" /> on them.  In this month's <i>Garda Review</i> there is mention of awards made for bravery to individual garda.  Their actions were heroic.  Generally the public are not aware of what is referred to as &ldquo;heavy gangs&rdquo; and they do not associate the Garda with them.  People usually are glad to see gardaí around and they feel safer in their presence.  I know there may be exceptions, there are exceptions among politicians also, on every side of the House.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, amanta ní bhíonn eolas againn an é tusa nó an Ceann Comhairle a chuireann ar bóthar ár leasa sinn.  However, the general public trust and admire the Garda.  Of course it is necessary that those who wish to complain should have some method of doing so.  Possibly the taping of investigations or the questioning of a person in a Garda station should be documented in some way.  They have a very difficult job to do and they work very unsocial hours. They are dealing with people who, in the Minister's own words, would cut your throat and smile.  If the Garda show compassion to criminals it is construed as weakness.  We need more gardaí, especially on the beat, and we also need more sophisticated equipment, radio communication at least, and greater emphasis on forensic and ballistic help to the Garda. They at least need to be better equipped than the criminals.</P>
    <P>It is high time we looked at the reorganisation of our force.  We probably went a bit overboard in the closure of rural Garda stations.  At that time I was a Member of this House and I heard a previous Minister remark that he was deploying his forces where the need was greatest.  However, whole new towns have grown up since then and the structure of the Garda has not kept pace with them.  People as old as I am will remember when the geographical list of the towns in Kildare was Naas, Athy, Kildare and Maynooth.  There was no mention of Newbridge, which is now our biggest town although it is still a sub-station of Kildare town.  There is no Garda station in Leixlip or Celbridge and gardaí are only available there during the day.  The <Col N="2025" /> structures the Garda have and the type of regions into which they have their force divided need to be revamped.</P>
    <P>People in the immediate area of Maynooth find themselves in three or four different Garda districts.  This does not lead to any great liaison between them and perhaps these areas could be made into one district.  There are repeated robberies in that area where the criminals appear to have free rein and that must be tackled by whatever means are available to us.</P>
    <P>Some criticism has been made with regard to the suggestion in the Bill that suspects should be fingerprinted.  Some people look on that as an infringement of the right of the individual but I am happy enough about the situation.  If the fingerprinting of suspects leads to greater detection of crime it should be done.  I am also happy with the provision that when no charge is brought the files and the fingerprints will be destroyed.  That is necessary.  It is also necessary that the silence of a suspect during questioning would no longer be used as a shield and cognisance will be taken of the fact that somebody when questioned did not account for movements or remained silent during questioning.  This affords the Garda greater powers of detection and, if it will convict somebody who deserves to be convicted, it should be used.</P>
    <P>Another matter which concerns me is no-go areas.  There should be no such place in Ireland as a no-go area for the Garda.  It has been accepted that there are places where you dare not go.  I am involved with a certain football team and we had to play matches in Parnell Park. We came up on three different Saturdays to play there and each time our supporters' cars had their windows smashed and things taken from the cars.  It was reported the first time but it still happened the next two occasions.  As the three matches in Parnell Park were drawn we managed to play the fourth match in Newbridge and things worked out better there.  Years ago when the Queen's or King's Writ ran in this country, it was confined to the Pale in the beginning and if you ventured outside that it was a no-go <Col N="2026" /> area because of the different tribes who were planted in the country.  It took years before the Queen's or the King's Writ ran all over the country and it could be said that the country had been properly colonised.  It would be wrong to think, after 50 or 60 years of self-government, that we still have no-go areas where the Writ of this House does not run.</P>
    <P>There is an epidemic of car stealing and I am glad to see that the Minister has taken note of this and introduced new legislation which I hope will curb it.  He also referred particularly to the use of firearms and we should never cease to condemn those who use them.  They are cowardly people and I am confident that if there was a genuine call to arms in the morning these people would not answer it.</P>
    <P>We have also had instances of kidnapping here recently which should concern us.  This is despicable and I should like the penalty to fit the crime and act as a deterrent. Judges should especially listen to this because they are the people designated to impose the penalties.  Judges differ in their attitudes and consequently the general perception of the public is not of co-operation, and we need co-operation. Possibly we blame too much the fact that we were colonised for too long and it was accepted that those who gave information to the authorities were informers.  That attitude should be changed and we should have community involvement in fighting crime.  It is necessary to bring everybody with us if we are to cure this crime epidemic now.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to go into the nitty-gritty of many of the provisions because our party are concerned about these and will tease out those that need teasing out on Committee Stage.  In our party and perhaps on the other side of the House the degree of emphasis necessary in this legislation will be questioned.  The incidence of crime varies from place to place.  The Dublin metropolitan area unfortunately has the highest crime rate of 50 to 60 indictable offences per 1,000 population. A map is given in the Garda report on crime for 1982 containing provision for <Col N="2027" /> areas where the rate will be over 60 per 1,000 population, these areas to be marked in black on the map.  We have no black areas as yet and I hope that we will not have any black spots.  I hope also as a result of this legislation that the amount of crime will decrease.  In the sparsely populated areas on the west coast, and in Cavan and Monaghan for some reason, the crime rate is less than ten per 1,000. It would be good if the whole country were at that level.</P>
    <P>Law and order in Ireland has broken down.  The general public think that the situation is grave and needs early attention. That is why I welcome this Bill.  The Bill needs the help of everyone inside and outside this House.  We in Fianna Fáil will back up Fine Gael and Labour in every reasonable effort they make to stop crime and to lead to its detection.  I consider the provisions in this Bill reasonable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I congratulate the Minister on producing the Criminal Justice Bill before this House.  Such a Bill is long overdue.  Many of the Minister's predecessors gave considerable media mileage on a regular basis both on and off the record advising members of the media, including political correspondents, that they were about to publish such a Bill, but none of them managed either to publish a Bill or bring a Bill before this House.  I regard the present Minister as probably the best Minister for Justice we have had for many years.  He takes his responsibilities very seriously.  The speed with which he has brought this measure before the House after becoming Minister is something for which this House should express gratitude and should regard as an indicator of his commitment to tackling very serious problems affecting the community in the area of crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's speech when introducing this Bill on Second Stage was both concerned and forceful.  It was the speech of a Minister clearly aware of the problems that had to be tackled and aware also of the complexity of the legislation now before this House.  He is aware of the possible impact of that legislation not <Col N="2028" /> merely in the fight to ensure that those who commit offences in the community are brought before the courts, properly tried and convicted, but he has concern about and obvious understanding of the effects this legislation could have in the area of civil liberties and the dramatic effect it will have on criminal law and legal jurisprudence.  His speech was that of a Minister who is open to listening to what takes place in this House and to considering amendments in the course of the legislative process and to accepting such amendments if he believes they are desirable and if Members of this House can clearly show the need for them.</P>
    <P>That is a credit to the Minister.  Far too often Ministers in different governments or different administrations regard criticism of legislation being introduced in this House or proposed amendments not as a constructive contribution to the proposed legislative process but as an attack on ministerial virginity or purity, containing the barbed suggestion that possibly the Minister has not done his job properly.  In the short time he has been in office this Minister has not merely done his job properly but he has done it in a manner which is a credit to him.  Without disrespect to any of his predecessors, the manner in which he has done it affords to him a stature well above that of any of them.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about the increase in the number of offences committed and there is little doubt about that particularly in areas such as Dublin Indeed, my constituency of Dublin South has been the subject of a very high increase in the number of criminal offences, particularly indictable offences of a serious nature.  Also in Cork and Limerick there has been a serious increase in crime which has not been met by a similar increase in the detection rate on the part of the Garda or in the conviction rate.  In some areas where an increase in crime has been recorded statistically, the conviction rate statistically is declining.  Many people fear to walk the streets particularly in certain areas of Dublin.  People's cars have been stolen. People have been the subject of vicious and violent assaults.  Few of us during the <Col N="2029" /> past five years or so who live in Dublin have not had the experience of at least one burglary at home, and I include myself in that category.</P>
    <P>Therefore, we are all aware of the problems posed by the increase in crime. We are all aware of the fears and worries of ordinary people in the street.  We are aware also that the law has failed to keep pace with the problem and has failed to reform itself in a way that ensures that those who should be convicted are properly brought before the courts and convicted. Moreover, it has failed to provide the general public with the protection to which they are entitled.</P>
    <P>Many of the reforms proposed in this legislation are non-controversial, desirable and long overdue and it is an indictment of previous administrations that they were not tackled in earlier legislation. I have no doubt that other reforms proposed by this legislation are right in principle but the manner in which the legislation deals with them, the provisions in the legislation with which we as legislators must be concerned, give rise to a genuine worry on the part of some people and we in this House must take that worry into account.  A minority of the proposals contained in this Bill which are completely understandable in the context of the enormous increase in crime to which I have already referred &mdash; muggings, burglary, the terrible problem of drug abuse and the violent crime that this community has been subjected to in the past decade of a nature that had not been experienced for many decades previously&mdash;nevertheless are the cause of considerable anxiety.  It is very easy for a member of any party to come into the House reeling off crime statistics and expressing a genuine concern, which we all share in all parties, for the fears of ordinary people and simply endorse a legislative measure which is seen, in effect, to make it easier to lock up those who commit crimes.  It must also be our concern to ensure that those who are not guilty of such offences are not locked up or are not detained in Garda stations for lengthy periods without any justification or protection against possible Garda abuse.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2030" /> I shall deal first with those aspects of this legislation which are welcome and will have the support of all Members of the House.  The provisions which provide for consecutive sentences for those who commit offences while on bail are long overdue.  It has always been illogical that somebody charged with an offence when let out on bail can go on a crime jamboree without the possibility of any greater sentence than would originally have been imposed.  No doubt everyone in the community will welcome that section and I look forward to its coming into operation.</P>
    <P>It has also always been illogical that if a person fails to answer a bail bond the person who has gone bail for him or her may be required to pay over the sum of money for which he or she has gone bail &mdash; which is correct &mdash; but the person who skips bail is not charged with any additional criminal offence for failing to keep his or her commitment to the court and attend before it for the purpose of being criminally charged.  This new provision of making it an offence in itself to fail to appear before the court when released on bail is welcome and long overdue.  The Minister is to be praised for making it.</P>
    <P>The increase in penalties for firearms offences is also welcome.  Indeed, one must question why it was not introduced many years ago in the light of the difficulties experienced in this country over approximately 15 years.  The sooner this comes into operation the better.  The increase in penalties in the area of road traffic offences is also welcome.  We have an enormous problem with car thefts and larcenies and with the carnage taking place on our roads and streets because of young people stealing cars, driving them at irrational speeds and mowing people down.  This has happened in my own constituency and in various places throughout the country.  The increased sentences for such offences are also welcome, as is the announcement by the Minister for the Environment that there will be an increase in the sentences imposed for drunken driving.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Bill which recites the need for an accused to give notice of an alibi so that he cannot suddenly produce <Col N="2031" /> a rabbit out of a hat in the middle of a court proceedings, not affording the prosecution an opportunity to investigate and check on it and provide evidence of a counter nature where it exists, is also desirable and to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The legislation also provides for the abolition of the unsworn statement.  This is an anachronistic anomaly contained in our criminal law permitting people to make unsworn statements and dates back to the time when people prosecuted for offences were not allowed into the witness box to give an explanation of their behaviour.  Why that was not abolished many years ago is difficult to understand. In that context, there is one matter which should be brought to the attention of the Minister.  In abolishing the possibility of making an unsworn statement, the Bill does not provide for the possibility of somebody making a statement by way of affirmation.  A person without a religion who goes into the witness box may not wish, before giving evidence, for conscientious reasons, to swear before Almighty God that what he is saying is true.  Nevertheless, he may wish to swear an oath of a type which is not the conventional one sworn by people who have an adherence to a particular church or religion.  It is important that we make sure that the desirable abolition, of the unsworn statement does not also prevent an accused of no religion from affirming in the witness box that what he is going to say is true and then going on to give evidence in the ordinary way.</P>
    <P>The provision for majority verdicts is also welcome.  It has been introduced in other jurisdictions.  It is illogical that one juror, who because possibly of some peculiar analysis of what happened in the case forms the view that he is not in favour of reaching a decision while the 11 other jurors are unanimous in their view on what decision should be reached, can render a trial in these circumstances at present ultimately abortive and cause a new trial.</P>
    <P>However, as the unanimity of juries is something which has always been required up to now under our criminal justice system, we should be jealous in <Col N="2032" /> trying to retain that system where at all possible.  The legislation provides that no decision should be made by way of majority verdict by a jury unless that jury have been sitting for at least two hours in deliberating on what decision they should bring in.  Some may accuse me of nitpicking by suggesting a somewhat longer period than two hours before the majority verdict is obtained.  That would not in any way impede the criminal justice system or prevent bringing to justice those who commit serious offences.  We should have a bias to try to bring in verdicts by way of unanimity unless that proves impossible.  I would double the time allowable from two to four hours.  If that provision were amended, it would not create difficulties.</P>
    <P>There are many aspects of this Bill which are welcome and which will significantly assist the Garda in their fight against crime and assist the courts in ensuring that those who are prosecuted are properly brought to justice.  I have referred to provisions which may be correct in principle but about which, due to the manner in which the Bill is drafted, there is very real and genuine concern and I turn now to these.  In doing so, I wish to deal in a general way with the provisions of the Bill laid down under section 3 and further expanded on in sections 4 and 5, which concern the provisions to enable the Garda to detain people in Garda stations for a period of time.  This introduces a new principle into our criminal justice code &mdash; and if we are to have it and I express worries about this although I understand it in the context of the increase in crime and the problems in bringing persons guilty of offences before the court &mdash; it must be ensured that it is not open to abuse, that while assisting the Garda in the proper investigation of crime it does not infringe on our civil liberties in a way which is unacceptable.</P>
    <P>It is not traditional in this House to examine the sections in great detail now and I am not going to do so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope the Deputy will not do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something to be <Col N="2033" /> left for Committee Stage.  Section 3, however, introduces many new principles which must be referred to.  Paraphrasing section 3, which runs to over a page in the Bill, the Garda, if they have reasonable cause for suspecting a person of having attempted to commit or having committed an offence for which he may receive a five-year sentence, may bring that person to a Garda station, if the garda has reasonable grounds for believing his detention is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence.  That is at the kernel of the philosophy surrounding section 3, and adjacent sections: that a person could be brought to a station if the garda believes it is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister outlined the difficulties experienced by the Garda by existing limitations on their powers and explained the reason for section 3.  The Minister's explanation is persuasive but I would not be complying with my duty as a legislator and a lawyer if I did not express my concern of a general nature about the section in the hope that the Minister will look at it so that on Committee Stage we will have an informed and understanding debate of the serious problems it raises and its possible consequences. The difficulty with the section in a general way is that despite what the Minister says &mdash; he laid emphasis on the need to operate the section for the proper investigation of an offence &mdash; the section could in effect change the whole emphasis within our criminal law in the context of the functions of the Garda by changing the role of the Garda when a crime is committed from one of investigation to interrogation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A version of this section is desirable and, while it is acceptable to hold somebody in a Garda station for a period of time to ensure that an investigation of an offence is not impeded, to ensure that possible evidence is not destroyed or that witnesses are not intimidated &mdash; indeed, that witnesses are not injured, maimed or killed &mdash; and while it may be acceptable pending the charging of somebody with an offence to detain them if there is a genuine belief that if they were not so <Col N="2034" /> detained they would leave the jurisdiction, there are worries that should be sounded and debated here.  Those worries relate to the effects of the section in other areas.  I make that statement in the context that neither I nor any other Member, or any member of the general public, has any sympathy for the hardened criminal brought to a Garda station and detained there pending being served with criminal proceedings and brought before a court.  I do not have any sympathy for the hardened criminal.  I accept the need to provide for the genuine situation where the Garda need to bring such a person to a station to ensure their investigation is not impeded and that the person to be charged is available to be brought before the court.</P>
    <P>However, the problem with the section is the general nature of the power conferred on the Garda.  While no doubt they can bring hardened criminals to the station under the section there is not anything to prevent them bringing many innocent people to stations and holding them for the periods of time stipulated in the legislation for the purpose of an investigation. The problem is that this concept of the Garda holding people for the purpose of an investigation is not defined in the legislation.  It is not spelled out what limitations the Garda have of a general nature.  The Bill makes specific provisions for conferring powers on the Garda to do specific things, but it does not say in the context of holding a person in a station what type of questioning they can be subjected to.  If interrogation is permitted are there limitations to be imposed on the nature of the interrogation that takes place?</P>
    <P>In other jurisdictions, in particular in the UK, aspects of whose legislation have been discussed &mdash; there has been an ongoing debate there about this type of legislation, a debate of a nature we have not yet had here &mdash; where it is proposed that the police should be able to hold people for a period of detention, albeit a much longer period than under our legislation, it has been accepted by the Home Office that there should be something called a code of questioning.  It is my understanding that in the context of <Col N="2035" /> debating similar legislation in the Westminster Parliament there have been three different varieties of codes of questioning produced, each code being amended in the light of discussions that take place.  Those codes laid down the parameters of the type of questioning the police can engage in when a person is detained in a police station.</P>
    <P>It is important to realise that under this section people can be held for up to 20 hours.  The initial holding period is six hours, but if the holding period strays into the time between midnight and 8 a.m. the Garda may cease questioning and the person can continue to be held in the station.  There is then power to hold the person for a further six hours. In theory at least &mdash; I have no doubt that in practice it will be the case &mdash; people can be held for up to 20 hours.  It is important in the context of the behaviour of the Garda during that period, not simply in the interest of those brought to Garda stations but in the interest of the Garda not being open to false charges of abusing their authority in future court proceedings thereby jeopardising the success of such proceedings, that there should be a specific code of questioning as to the manner in which the Garda should conduct themselves during a period when a person is detained in a station.</P>
    <P>It appears that when somebody is detained under the legislation before us no specific Garda is responsible for that person.  Is it not specified under the legislation that a person can be called in evidence as an independent person, or as a garda not directly involved in investigating the offence, if false allegations of violence are made against the Garda? Nobody can be called to establish that the Garda behaved properly.  I am looking to the English legislation, not that I believe we should cog it.  In fact, the Minister should be praised in that many aspects of similar legislation before the Westminster Parliament have not been included in our legislation.  Our legislation has many innovative and different ways of dealing with problems.  The English legislation provides for a person <Col N="2036" /> known as the custodian, a policeman who is appointed in each station and has a duty to ensure that if somebody is brought to a station the code of questioning as will exist in England is properly followed and to ensure that at all stages the person is advised of his rights and entitlements.  This legislation confers specific rights and entitlements on persons brought to Garda stations.</P>
    <P>The Ó Briain Report, which looked at our criminal justice legislation recommended that if the Garda have extended to them powers to detain people, such as is provided in the legislation, powers that the report recognised as being desirable, the person arrested and brought to the station should have assigned to him on arrival in the station a member of the force not connected with the investigation or other police action which led to the arrest.  The Ó Briain Report went on to say that the garda should be referred to as the &ldquo;custodial guardian&rdquo;.  It stated that it should be the duty of the custodial guardian to ensure that the person was treated humanely and in strict accordance with Garda regulations while held in custody.  That recommendation has a great deal of merit.  I believe that some of the worries of people about the power of detention under this section would disappear if this recommendation were followed. In addition, it would provide the Garda with protection against false allegations of Garda abuse.  It is very much in the interest of the Garda Síochána that a recommendation of this nature be included in the legislation by way of amendment.</P>
    <P>Such a custodial garda should be placed under a specific duty to keep a written record of what transpires during the course of any detention under section 3.  Upon his release, without any criminal charges being brought against him or with criminal charges subsequently being brought against him, the person should be entitled to receive a copy of that written record within a reasonable time after the termination of detention.  One could put a timescale on that reasonable time: possibly a period of seven days would be sufficient because if the garda himself was under an obligation to prepare a report <Col N="2037" /> there would not be any great difficulty in making it available for record purposes to the person detained.  Such a record would be a protection against a possible arbitrary use of the power to detain and it would at least provide evidence that would be of great help in resolving any subsequent dispute that might arise as to the correctness of Garda behaviour when someone is detained.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to be misinterpreted in what I say.  I do not believe that the vast majority of the gardaí will abuse their power.  Most members of the Garda Síochána perform their duty very well and many perform acts that are well beyond the call of duty.  Many lay their lives open to serious risk and danger in protecting the community and, without public acknowledgement, many of them bring a great deal of credit on the force. They provide citizens with assistance and protection when called upon to do so. However, it would be dishonest and unrealistic not to acknowledge that within such a large force there is a small number of individuals who may abuse their authority.  I would not like that comment to be taken as an attack on the Garda Síochána.  There is a small number who come within that category and by their behaviour they remove the gloss and diminish the public acclaim that exists for the general members of the force.  All of us in our experience of life have come across a garda whose behaviour has been less than desirable.  Perhaps a garda has been unnecessarily vicious or has treated an individual in a manner that was not warranted in the circumstances. It is essential to ensure that the general public have protection against such behaviour by having this section qualified with the proper protection.  The vast majority of the gardaí exercise their powers in a proper way and it would never occur to them to abuse those powers.  It is essential that they be given protection in the legislation against the small number of men in the force who might abuse their powers and thus bring their colleagues under public suspicion of a nature that is unwarranted.</P>
    <P>It appears the intent of section 3 is that when a person is taken to a Garda station <Col N="2038" /> he must be kept there.  I should like to ensure that there is no ambiguity about that.  There was a case recently that gained a great deal of notoriety and caused a degree of public concern where someone who was prosecuted in our courts alleged that Garda behaviour towards them had not been proper.  Part of the facts of the case was that the person detained had been shifted from station to station during the course of an interrogation. This legislation should ensure quite specifically that when someone is detained he will be detained in a specific station and not moved around.  It appears to me that is the intent of the Bill but I am anxious to ensure that there will not be any ambiguity about the matter.</P>
    <P>It is also important that each Garda station be given a specific duty to keep a record of the number of people detained under this legislation, the subsequent charges brought as a result of such detention and the conviction rate.  That would give a clear statistical indicator as to whether the section is being properly observed and used and would provide Members of this House with the means of monitoring the effectiveness of the section and its use in real terms.  I should like to see such a provision being included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In my view the absence of a code of questioning is a fundamental defect.  In the absence of such a code, when people admit offences and are held pursuant to the section or when they are subsequently charged under the section, it can be alleged by them that statements made by them were not voluntary, that they were subject to duress, that they were frightened by being held in a Garda station. Even if no allegations of misbehaviour are made against the Garda, they may claim that the very fact of being held in the Garda station created a pressure resulting in their making statements that were untrue.  It is a cardinal principle of our criminal justice system that involuntary statements or admissions made by those charged with criminal offences cannot be produced before the court as evidence because they are not regarded as freely and voluntarily made and, therefore, are suspect.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2039" /> I think there is need for this Bill to clarify the exact status of responses, admissions, replies and statements made by people held in detention prior to criminal charges being brought.  This section does not do that and there is a possibility that, rather than assisting the gardaí in the prosecution of offences, because of its very ambiguity the section when it comes to judicial interpretation may prove a greater impediment to a successful prosecution than exists in our criminal justice system at the moment.  That will be the result because whenever somebody is detained he will be in a position to allege that what he said was said under pressure and should, therefore, be inadmissible. I would ask the Minister to seriously consider that aspect.</P>
    <P>The worries in this area will not be cured by the introduction of an independent tribunal to deal with complaints against the gardaí.  That is a separate item.  I hope these criticisms will be accepted in the spirit in which I make them.  They are not offered as destructive criticisms.  They are not seeking in any way to be personally critical of the Minister. I am making a constructive contribution to the legislative process in the context of this Bill which is designed to bring about very fundamental changes in criminal jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>Sections 4 and 5 are companion provisions to section 3.  Dealing with them in a general way, rather than in the concept of a Committee Stage, section 4 effectively provides that the person who is detained is entitled to consult his solicitor and have his detention notified to another person.  It expressly provides in the context of those detained under 17 years of age that detention should be notified to the parents or guardian.  Again that section is ambiguous.  It does not clarify matters which, if not clarified, will result in endless litigation before the Central Criminal Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal and the Supreme Court trying to tease out what is meant by this provision. It does not say how long a person may be detained.  It does not say whether, prior to the Garda conducting an interrogation, some reasonable time must elapse <Col N="2040" /> after the request to see a solicitor to afford the person an opportunity to discuss his position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to deal with the principles and I propose to deal with the specifics.  Indeed if I were to deal with the chronology of this section that would take a good deal more time than I intend to spend on it.  It is important that we tease out the principles in the context of this Bill.  That is the difficulty.  How long will it be before a detainee will be allowed to consult his solicitor?  The Bill does not say.  May the solicitor remain with the detainee during the course of his interrogation? Must the solicitor remain silent or may he comment?  Will he be thrown out if he misbehaves in the eyes of the interrogator?  Can the third party who must be notified come along to the station and ask to remain with the detainee?  If the detainee is 14, 15 or 16 years of age and the parents are notified will the father or the mother be allowed to remain with the detainee?  We all acknowledge that lack of parental control is one of the major causes of crime.  When a teenager is detained for six hours, or up to 20 hours, would it not be desirable that the parents be admitted to the station with the child during that period of detention? I believe it would be desirable that the parent should be required to remain.  The Bill merely says the parent would be notified.  It does not say whether or not he or she may remain in the Garda station. This Bill does not spell out these issues and the result of that could be endless litigation.</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt the Deputy, but the Deputy is really going into the section in a way which would be more appropriate on Committee Stage.

      <P>The final matter I want to mention by way of putting the Minister on notice &mdash; that is a threatening sort of phrase and one I would really prefer not to use &mdash; is a particular problem.  I was picked up at 9 o'clock at night, taken to a Garda station, kept there until 12 o'clock at night, served with a notice telling me I could sleep until 8 o'clock in the morning, kept there for a further period and, at the end of all this, I was released.  I was never charged with anything. I was never brought before the court at any stage accused of any criminal offence.  What rights under this Bill will people have when they seek damages for wrongful arrest?  That is something that needs to be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issues I raise are valid issues.  They are valid from the point of view of the need for reform of the criminal law to assist the gardaí in their work.  I have long advocated the need to modernise our criminal law and bring it up-to-date in the context of the realities of life by seeking to ensure that the gardaí properly investigate offences.  The worries I express are worries that result not from an academic discourse on criminal jurisprudence, not from a desire to create difficulties or, indeed, from a desire, as so often happens in the case of politicians, to seek publicity.  We have in recent years very real difficulties arising as a result of people being subjected to detention.  Two recent examples are worth putting on the <Col N="2042" /> record because they underline the need for amending this Bill.  We had a horrific example reported less than two weeks ago in our papers which related to the prosecution of a garda as the result of a death.</P>

I am not going to comment on it.  I have no intention of doing so.  I think it is quite proper for somebody in this House to make reference to a newspaper report by way of quoting it verbatim, stating the date of the report, the origin of the report and what paper, and making no further reference to it of any nature, and that would be my intention.</P>

      <P>I would respectfully disagree, because the newsaper reported on the case when it was current and before a jury brought in a verdict.

      <P>Very well.  A Cheann Comhairle, I respect your views and I will not refer to the report in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 3 November 1983 of the result of that case.  I would refer to another case which has concluded and in respect of which there was a report in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 14 June 1983, which was the subject of a Dáil question that I tabled to the Minister. The question I tabled as a result of this case last June is still on the Order Paper.  This is a case which relates to a charge against a woman of 21 years of age by the name of Amanda MacShane. It was a case reported in the papers in which it was recited that a young County Dublin woman was accused of being linked to a robbery involving the removal of £98,000 from a post office, and in the prosecution&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not want to interrupt and I will not.  I leave it to the Deputy's judgment, and the Deputy knows at least as well as I do, and perhaps far better, what is <i>sub judice</i> and what is not <i>sub judice.</i> I do not know anything about the case he is dealing with now, but if it is <i>sub judice</i> I would ask the Deputy not to deal with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure you, A Cheann Comhairle, that it is not <i>sub judice.</i> In this particular case a prosecution took place and the proceedings arose in the High Court before Mr. Justice Hamilton and the case was sent to the Central Criminal Court by Mr. Justice Hamilton. In prosecuting this person there was produced what was described by the defence counsel in that case as a highly irregular document purporting to implicate the lady concerned in the robbery found in the interview room of Crumlin Garda Station before she had made any admissions. This document which was submitted to the court in evidence turned out and was admitted in these proceedings to be a document prepared by a particular guard, apparently containing an admission by this person that she had committed <Col N="2044" /> this offence, a document containing an admission that she had never made, a document that this person had never seen which, by accident, was found by this person lying around the Garda station.  As a result, in these proceedings, which were concluded, what was described as a <i>nolle prosequi</i> was entered against this person and the prosecution was terminated.</P>
      <P>In effect, what happened in that instance &mdash; and the court accepted it and indeed it was accepted in evidence &mdash; was that a statement that was not made by this woman was prepared for her signature.</P>
      <P>There is a problem.  The problem is to ensure that when people are detained in Garda stations they are not put under pressure to sign statements they have not made or where statements are made and are signed that the gardaí are not open to false allegations of pressure, and that case gives rise for a real worry.  It must be accepted that in a situation where crime is on the increase and where gardaí are under pressure to produce results &mdash; and rightly under pressure to produce results &mdash; there will be a very, very, very &mdash; I emphasise that &mdash; small minority of guards who might use this power of detention to produce similar statements signed by individuals to be charged with offences, and indeed we know there have been cases &mdash; I am speaking of a general nature &mdash; in our courts in which it has been alleged that people have been physically assaulted by gardaí in Garda stations and it is essential to ensure that there is proper protection afforded against such behaviour.</P>
      <P>In seeking to provide protection the Bill provides for the recording by electronic or other means of interviews that take place when people are detained. This is a new power, and it is welcome that this type of provision is being introduced, but it cannot be introduced until there is a ministerial code bringing it into force and, indeed, the other arrangements required, such as physical arrangements for the provision of the recording material are made pursuant to this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of general concerns about this.  I must say I would much <Col N="2045" /> prefer, at a time when we may bring in this power of detention, hopefully modified in some of the manner I have described, to see it co-ordinated with the introduction of automatic recording. That would indeed provide protection against abuse to a great extent, but I accept that technologically it may not be possible, but I would like to see certain things of a general nature about the provisions relating to tape recordings changed.  I have no doubt that this Minister will introduce this type of system.  I have absolute and complete faith in the Minister's commitment in this area and in everything he said both in this House and on the record of this House and outside, but I would like to ensure that any person who may be his successor at some future date will also provide and ensure that there is provided this type of protection.  It seems to me that the section as phrased at the moment provides a Minister with discretion to provide a tape recording system but does not confer a duty on any individual Minister to do so and to that extent the section should be changed.</P>
    <P>It should also provide &mdash; possibly the phraseology of the section already provides, this has been mentioned by other Members of the House &mdash; for the possibility of not simply recording but of a video system to cover and record what takes place at interviews.  I accept that that may not be possible in the short term.  I accept that there is a very real cost factor here that may render it impossible and, indeed, a technological problem that may make that impossible within a short period of time, but there should be capacity within the section to video interviews or interrogations, and this already exists in many States in the United States.</P>
    <P>The section provides that if after a recording system has been introduced someone fails to provide for the recording of an interview or something goes wrong with it, that should not render what is said by someone charged with an offence inadmissible in the event of court proceedings taking place.  That is right. If there is an electricity failure or something suddenly goes wrong with the <Col N="2046" /> tape-recorder or the video system it should not render inadmissible things said during the course of an interview, but it must also be assured that systems do not fail from reasons other than accidents. Whereas I believe statements made unrecorded should be admissible, nevertheless there should be an onus placed on the garda who conducted the interview or interrogation during the period of detention to explain why the recording system did not work and in appropriate cases, depending on the manner in which the explanation is given and the jury's or judge's view of it, in reaching final decisions a court may or may not take an inference as to what occurred on the occasion in question.</P>
    <P>It would also be essential that this legislation should provide for an automatic timing system to be built into the recording system.  It seems that it may do this, but I am anxious to ensure that it does, so that it cannot be suggested by any person who admits an offence while in detention that he or she was dealt with in a way that was not proper and that was not recorded on the tape-recorder as the recording system was switched off.  If there is an automatic time recording device, that allegation would be got over.</P>
    <P>The general power to detain creates certain other difficulties.  In referring to them I repeat that I accept that in many instances this power is desirable &mdash; I am not saying that we should not have it.  I preface my remarks by saying that it is desirable, in the case of somebody who is believed to have committed an offence, who might destroy evidence, intimidate witnesses, possibly kill or maim or inflict serious injury on individuals who might be required to give evidence or assist the police in their inquiries, or when a person might simply abscond, to have that power in such circumstances.  It is desirable in so far as it would enable members of the Garda quite properly to fingerprint in order to see if there is a criminal record. It is desirable in such circumstances to photograph and to carry out any inquiries the Garda might wish to carry out while a person is being detained.  The Garda <Col N="2047" /> already have the power to demand that a person gives his name and address.</P>
    <P>All of these powers are desirable, but a particular concern arises about this section. It appears that when somebody is detained the Garda will be conferred expressly with the specific power to search the person so detained.  Implicitly in this legislation, a power is conferred on gardaí who have brought somebody properly to a Garda station not merely to search but to strip a person down to the underwear.  In two specific instances the section confers the power on the Garda to strip the person entirely, particularly in relation to possible possession of firearms or when a person is seized and detained in relation to a drug offence.</P>
    <P>I fully accept that when the gardaí bring somebody to a Garda station and they genuinely believe that that person may have a firearm in his possession, or another implement such as a knife with which the person could cause mayhem or physical injury to a garda or himself, the gardaí must have the power to search, but only when there is reasonable and proper suspicion that a firearm or other implement exists.</P>
    <P>What I am concerned about is that it appears, as the legislation exists, that there are no limitations in the stipulation as to the type of garda who can conduct such a search.  It is open to a young male garda to bring a young woman into the Garda station, express a reasonable suspicion that that person is involved in a drug offence and strip her.  There is no provision to say that when a male person is brought to a Garda station he must be searched or stripped in the presence of only male gardaí.</P>
    <P>I believe that if we are to allow this power to strip search there should be a specific provision to provide that a female can be searched only by a ban-gharda with no person of a different sex present in the course of such search; and that a man can be searched only by a male member of the Garda with no person of a different sex present during the course of such a search.  It is clear that under this provision it is open to the Garda to conduct internal physiological examination <Col N="2048" /> if it is believed they should do so.  That creates the problem that it is open to a male member of the Garda to conduct internal examination of any woman brought to a Garda station, and, I emphasise, properly brought there under this section.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that is appropriate or necessary in the fight against crime.  I believe it is not only open to abuse but it is open to false allegations of abuse when search is necessary in the proper investigation of an offence, or when search is necessary when there is a genuine belief that somebody is in possession of a firearm or other implement that might give rise to a real danger to the gardaí or the person concerned.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I should like to see this provision amended specifically.  I hope the true impact and the importance of what I am saying will be appreciated. This matter has given rise to great controversy in other jurisdictions where this power of search has been suggested.  It is a matter of which there has not been any public discussion in this jurisdiction because there is an overwhelming desire in regard to all of us politicians to be seen, properly and constructively, to be engaged in the fight against crime, and there is a worry that if we express any reservations about this legislation, of any nature whatsoever, that we are laying ourselves open to suggestions that we are soft on crime, that we are flabby, liberal, legal academics engaging in academic arguments that will never have any reality.</P>
    <P>These are very real problems, and this legislation should be specifically amended in regard to searches by members of the Garda when somebody is brought to a Garda station and when there are grounds for believing that an internal physiological examination or search is required of a man or a woman that would involve the gardaí in touching or examining parts of the person's anatomy. I do not believe that is a power that should be properly exercised by the gardaí; it should be done only by a member of the medical profession who would be asked to attend at a Garda station to carry out such an examination.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2049" /> I hope the Minister will look at this section not merely in regard to the other matters to which I have referred but particularly in this respect.  I believe that many gardaí would not want this power in the way it is conferred on them.  I do not believe many of them would wish to conduct the type of search that they would be allowed to conduct under this section.  When the consequences and implications of this are realised, I believe this is going somewhere beyond what is necessary in the fight against crime.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>In his speech the Minister states that there is no prohibition on strip searches under existing law.  I never heard of any abuses of this power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I take a view somewhat different from that of the Minister, that there is no specific power at present conferred on the Garda to engage in strip searching or to engage in searching that can involve internal examination of a person brought to a Garda station.  If that power remains in the Bill &mdash; yesterday Deputy Andrews referred to constitutional rights &mdash; it will be open to constitutional challenge on the ground that it violates the constitutional right to bodily integrity.  As a house of the legislature we have a duty to enact legislation, in so far as we can adjudge in accordance with the Constitution, in such a manner that an inherent defect in a Bill would be recognised and tackled at Committee Stage in a constructive and sensible way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only other point I wish to make in regard to the general pattern of sections 3, 4 and 5, relates to fingerprinting.  I fully support the provision that enables the Garda to fingerprint, and, providing that a charge is not brought against a person after a reasonable period, the records must be destroyed.  The same is true in regard to photographs.  There is one difficulty in regard to general Garda records. In the section regarding somebody being dealt with under the Probation of Offenders Act by a court there is not a provision for the destroying of fingerprints. A person can be dealt with by the courts under the Probation of Offenders Act in a manner in which the person <Col N="2050" /> commits an offence but due to the circumstances surrounding it, no matter what the nature of the charge is, the court regards it as something considerably less than serious.  The court takes the view that the person should be afforded an opportunity as a member of society of having a last chance.  In real terms the charges are said to be dismissed under the Probation of Offenders Act and the person is not convicted.  In those circumstances the crime the person has effectively been found to have committed does not result in a conviction being recorded against him.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the effect of the Probation of Offenders Act, which goes back to legislation enacted in 1907 and amended in 1940 is being watered down. I feel that where charges are dismissed against an individual, pursuant to the Probation of Offenders Act, the provisions under this legislation which require that photographing and fingerprinting be not retained, or destroyed, should apply. If they do not apply in those circumstances in the same way as they have applied to people who find that charges against them are simply dismissed or not brought, the time within which such records can be kept should be delimited.  If somebody aged 16 or 17 is charged with an offence and never again comes into contact with the law and the charge is dismissed against that person under the Probation of Offenders Act, if inquiries are made as to whether that person has a criminal record 15 or 20 years later I believe it is not in the interests of society or the people concerned that the fingerprints or photographing be retained for that period of time.  It would effectively wipe out the effect of the Probation of Offenders Act, which in a sense says to a person that he has done something wrong, he is being given a last chance, a conviction will not be recorded against him, he can go out into the world, make his way in the world and he will not be prejudiced by this one indiscretion.  The retaining of records after that type of approach from the courts could be very prejudicial and is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>I very much support the view that the gardaí, where people are convicted of <Col N="2051" /> offences, should retain comprehensive records of long duration as to fingerprinting and photographing so that, in the event of other offences arising, the gardaí have an opportunity of identifying who the culprits are and whether they have previously committed offences.  I support the keeping of coherent and comprehensive records, but there should be a time by which such records need no longer be kept.  I am putting this suggestion to the Minister.  If somebody commits a serious offence and serves a sentence for it and then goes back out into society it must be questioned if it is necessary for the next 25, 30 or 40 years to still maintain a record if that person never again comes into contact with the law for breaking the criminal law.  I will not express a view as to whether there is an appropriate period of years after which we might no longer keep such records.  I merely ask the Minister to look at this and to consider this as a particular issue.</P>
    <P>There are many other difficulties with this Bill in the areas I have specifically referred to.  Many others are drafting matters to be dealt with in the context of Committee Stage and are not of a general nature so it would not be in order to go into them in the discussion taking place. I would like to deal briefly with the sections which Deputy David Andrews spent a great deal of time on and spoke on very eloquently yesterday in the House.  I refer specifically to sections 16, 17 and 18.  I feel it is unnecessary for me to again cover the detail which Deputy Andrews did in relation to the problems he saw with these sections.  My view of them is not mirrored by the same type of opposition expressed by Deputy Andrews. However, I am very concerned about them.  Deputy Andrews very properly listed 12 specific problems which he saw with section 16 and I support his views on that.  I do not believe there is any need to go into the specifics of those views in any great detail.</P>
    <P>The concerns he expressed, as a lawyer, were correct.  The difficulty in this House is that people can come in on debates of this nature and say that the lawyers always take this view and they <Col N="2052" /> are not really in touch with what people on the ground think.  I am very much in touch with what my constituents think and I am very much in touch with the fears and worries people have about the increase in crime.  We must not forget that at the end of the day when prosecutions are brought they must be successfully brought through the courts and the people who are guilty of having committed the offences must be found guilty by the courts.  The concerns of a technical nature which may be expressed by lawyers in a Chamber such as this are concerns which are designed to ensure that those who have committed offences are found guilty and to ensure that the people who are brought before our courts who are innocent and who have not committed offences are found to be innocent. That must be the concern of everybody in this House.</P>
    <P>I believe that section 16 is very loose in language.  I do not know what some of the phrases used mean.  There are phrases used which we may all think we know what they mean but which I have no doubt will be the subject of many hours of discussion and litigation in court proceedings and will remain uncertain and will not be understood until litigated through many cases in our courts.  The section seems to recognise that it is a somewhat difficult section because it says in the context of the provisions in it that there is a duty on the gardaí to tell people in ordinary language what it is all about I am not sure what ordinary language means in this context.  We all use different types of language.  It creates a particular problem, which was very well described in a book by Franz Kafka called <i>The Trial.</i> It was the problem of the person who found himself effectively on trial without knowing the offence he was being charged with and who was required to provide a defence for the court to his alleged behaviour without knowing what behaviour was alleged against him.  To some extent this section does this.</P>
    <P>Deputy Andrews referred to this section as a fundamental change in our criminal jurisprudence.  I believe it is.  I would not oppose it because of that, because we need a number of fundamental changes <Col N="2053" /> in our criminal jurisprudence.  This section creates the extraordinary position whereby an inference may be taken against a person by a court.  I do not know what that means.  I do not know what inference means the way it is phrased here.  The court may make an inference against a person &mdash; presumably it can be favourable or unfavourable, as the section does not explain that &mdash; if he produces a defence in court proceedings that he did not properly explain to a member of the Garda Síochána investigating the committing of an offence when that person did not even know what the exact nature of the offence was or what he could be charged with.  It seems to require an individual to provide the Garda with all information they could use in respect of defending the charge against him without knowing the charge.  I seriously suggest to Members of this House &mdash; although I am not pretending to be a literary expert &mdash; that Franz Kafka in <i>The Trial</i> clearly, in very illustrative terms, described the difficulties any individual could find themselves in in those circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal to be said, from the point of view of ordinary commonsense, that an individual who was found standing outside a bank where people have been shot with a bag containing £50,000 in their hand, who has no firearm in front of him and who has left no fingerprints behind him in the bank, should be expected to provide some reasonable explanation as to what the hell he was doing there.  Indeed, it is quite reasonable for a court to assume, having heard evidence of that nature, that that individual was partaking in the offence.  If, when asked by a garda, that individual replies &ldquo;Well, I just had a win on the horses and I am collecting my takings from the bookmaker&rdquo;, it is quite reasonable that inferences unfavourable to him be drawn.  If he produces that not as an explanation to the garda but as a rabbit out of a hat during the course of a trial, this section is not required to ensure that members of the Judiciary or juries will draw appropriate inferences.  This section is very wide and seems to transgress a very important principle in our criminal jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> It suggests that an inference should be drawn against people in circumstances in which the Garda may not be able to prove that in fact they have engaged in an offence and, presumably, the inference is supposed to be unfavourable.  It seems to switch the emphasis &mdash; I am paraphrasing what Deputy Andrews expressed as his concern &mdash; in certain instances of the presumption that somebody is innocent until they are proved guilty to raising an inference that they may be guilty until such time as they can prove they are innocent.  That is a fundamental change in our criminal jurisprudence.</P>
    <P>It could very well be that certain aspects of section 16 in particular circumstances are desirable but there are great difficulties as it is phrased at present in working out the circumstances, in understanding its impact, in understanding what is meant by inference; and, to some extent, the section favours the hardened criminal rather than the person who might be innocently picked up or questioned by a garda, because hardened criminals may think and know of when questioned a very specific and useful legal defence or explanation to give as to why they are in a particular place at a particular time or as to what they were doing at a particular time knowing, having had experience in court previously, that certain types of defences work in court. Somebody who has not been engaged in criminal activities and who finds himself questioned under this section may not realise that something he has been doing or some place he has been would, in real terms, provide an explanation for his predicament and a defence to a criminal charge but, without legal assistance and expertise, may not have either the understanding or the presence of mind to provide the full explanation this section requires to seek from him.  When people are stopped by a garda and questioned or if they are brought to Garda stations, even if they have never committed a criminal offence, they can often act in a distressed, emotional way which does not necessarily result in rational thought.  Whereas in principle I accept that section 3 is right if the amendments I am seeking are enacted, linking this section with section <Col N="2055" /> 3, I believe, creates a very genuine worry due to the possible consequences that could emerge.  In real terms it could place innocent people in jeopardy of conviction. That is something we need to refer to.</P>
    <P>Section 17, dealing with it in a general way, also creates a problem.  I can see the reason for that section.  My problem is, looking at what happens in our courts, there are aspects in it of a general nature that give cause for worry.  If something is found on somebody's clothes leading to something relating to an offence, they must provide a proper explanation as to how it got there.  Generally, there is nothing unexceptional in that.  If I am walking down the street and I have a firearm in my pocket and two minutes earlier there was a bank holdup the Garda are entitled to ask me where I was, what I had been doing and what that firearm was used for.</P>
    <P>If drugs are found in my clothing the rational deduction is that I have been engaged in a criminal offence in dealing with drugs or taking them.  An area I am concerned about, something which occasionally arises and has been seen to happen, not just in this jurisdiction but in other countries on rare occasions, is what does this section provide in the context of the individual who might, for example, have an illegal substance planted on him by somebody who wants to set him up or, again, in a very small minority of cases, planted on him by a member of the Garda Síochána?  How in the name of heaven can somebody provide an explanation as to how they had something on their person if they did not know it was there and had no part in putting it there until a member of the Garda Síochána found it? If that happens and I cannot provide an explanation as to how it got there, an inference can be raised against me which might result in my conviction.  I am saying this in the context of understanding the general principles laid down in this provision and what the Minister intends.  By and large, I have great sympathy with the Garda and support them, but I am anxious that there should be some protection in these areas.  This section, like section <Col N="2056" /> 18 in some instances, seems to require the individual to prove his innocence rather than the Garda to prove guilt.</P>
    <P>Much of what is contained in this Bill is good, desirable and long overdue and the Minister deserves fulsome praise from the House for it.  I support other aspects of the Bill in principle but they should be hedged in by a good deal more protection which will not inhibit the Garda but will simply protect them from untrue allegations and protect the civil liberties which each of us seeks to enjoy in a constitutional democracy.</P>
    <P>I am very concerned about the difficulties which I have explained in relation to section 3 and the possible way section 16 could operate.  It is understandable why the section is there but very worrying as to whether we should enact it.  Deputy Andrews very eloquently yesterday described his worries about that section. In the context of the criminal justice system, we must encourage the Garda in the investigation of crime and in bringing to justice those who commit minor and serious crimes.  The investigative technique and its success in properly bringing before the courts people who have committed offences and having them found guilty and sentenced by our courts is something we must encourage, and also provide the Garda with support.  I am concerned in a general way that the provisions to which I referred and criticised will result in the emphasis moving away from investigative techniques to interrogation techniques.  It is vital that that does not happen.  In this context, I would very much like to see far more comprehensive training provided to members of the Garda Síochána than they get at present in the area of investigative techniques and the &ldquo;catching&rdquo; of those who have committed offences.</P>
    <P>We put our gardaí on the streets with one hand tied behind their backs not because of legislation but because of inadequate training, for which they are not responsible.  The time in which a garda is trained before he is assigned to a Garda station or put on the street is unacceptable in a modern technological society.  In that time gardaí cannot develop the expertise that many of them <Col N="2057" /> wish to develop.  This House has a duty to look at that area in great detail.  Too often gardaí are criticised for their failures and are not sufficiently praised for their successes.  In the course of the last six months there have been notable successes in areas with which we are all familiar and with offences which have occurred that I cannot comment on because many of them are <i>sub judice,</i> and the Garda should be praised for their successes in that regard.  We have a duty to provide them with proper training and we are not providing them with a comprehensive training which is desirable and which many of them wish to have. Many of them learn their trade on the job, and that is unfair to them and to the general public.</P>
    <P>This House held a debate some time ago in the context of a criminal charge to which I do not wish to refer, where judges were criticised for lack of uniformity in sentencing.  The proper working of the criminal process is not merely about bringing people before the courts and having those who commit offences found guilty but ensuring that proper penalties are imposed on those people.  We appoint lawyers as members of the Judiciary, to the District Court where the greatest volume of criminal offences are dealt with and to the higher courts, and they are appointed for no reason other than that they are lawyers who may or may not have expertise in individual areas of law or a general knowledge of law.  Many of the judges appointed have, through no fault of their own, no expertise in many individual areas of law upon which they have to adjudicate, and criminal law can be included in that; and they have no particular expertise or training in the area of sentencing.  Judges, certainly those newly appointed, learn their trade while sitting on the bench, and that does not lend itself to a coherent and uniform approach to the criminal justice system or to uniformity in sentencing.  Whereas I, like every Member of this House, would protect to its ultimate the independence of the Judiciary, a most important bastion in our democratic system, we must accept that simply because somebody is a lawyer he is not automatically <Col N="2058" /> a good judge or capable of sentencing or adjudicating on matters in the area of criminal law or making decisions in other areas.  We should look to reforming our system where we seek to appoint people as members of the Judiciary.  We should provide special training for such appointees prior to their sitting on the bench in the District Court or the higher courts to ensure that they have available to them all the basic information they require not merely in the context of criminal law itself but in the context of sentencing, knowing the options available and preaching the need for uniformity of approach.</P>
    <P>We should not criticise members of the Judiciary for lack of uniformity when in practice a lawyer can be a conveyancing solicitor for 20 years, suddenly receive the ministerial or governmental <i>imprimatur</i> of approval, be placed on a court bench as a district justice appointed almost overnight, and find himself two or three days after he has closed his last conveyancing office adjudicating on a series of criminal offences and sentencing people for them while he might in his practice as a lawyer never have practiced in the area of criminal law, never have set foot in a court for a criminal prosecution or talked with anybody who was charged with a criminal offence and certainly never have represented someone so charged.</P>
    <P>Regarding sentencing, for many offences committed at present the fines that can be imposed have long since become irrelevant and out of date and no longer are regarded as serious penalties or as a deterrent to those charged with criminal offences.  Whereas the Minister has during his brief term in office completed work of a mammoth nature that far excels that done by many of his colleagues and produced legislation that many of his colleagues ruminated over for too long, I hope that when we complete the passage of this Bill through the House the Minister will look at that vast general area of criminal law reform and general updating of penalties.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer to another area in the context of criminal justice which might seem out of step with all the matters discussed so far in this Bill.  We are <Col N="2059" /> dealing with reform of criminal law and introducing new offences, to some extent amending existing offences and changing sentencing.  Many offences in our criminal justice system have long since fallen into disuse or in a modern social environment are unacceptable.  Many of them rarely get any hearing in this House.  I would like to take this opportunity to refer to something which could be included in this Bill.  Although the Bill is in effect about evidence and police powers it is also about other things.  It is about sanctions, as we have seen in the context of increased penalties.  We have within our criminal justice system something that has been long abolished in many countries and which is totally inappropriate in a modern, caring, humane and understanding society.</P>
    <P>In this country to attempt to commit suicide is still a criminal offence that can be the subject of prosecution.  Incidentally, it is also a criminal offence to commit suicide but presumably if you commit it nothing much can be done about it. Attempted suicide as an offence was abolished many years ago in many other common law jurisdictions.  In reply to a Dáil question to the Minister on 19 October I was informed that in the 20 years up to and including 1982 criminal prosecutions for attempted suicide were instituted in 15 cases, five of which resulted in convictions.  In two cases the charge was found proved and an order made without conviction, and three cases were adjourned.  Informations were refused in one case and charges were withdrawn in four cases.  Therefore, in 20 years 15 people have been brought before our courts for attempted suicide and five have been convicted.  As we know from statistics from the Department of Health, far more people than that attempt suicide, and probably the statistics do not reflect accurately this very real social problem. This problem has no function in being dealt with in criminal law.  Someone who attempts to commit suicide is normally very seriously mentally disturbed and requires psychiatric treatment.  It is inappropriate that even one person has been prosecuted before our courts for <Col N="2060" /> attempted suicide in the last 20 years, never mind 15 persons.  If gardaí are informed of the threat or possibility of such a prosecution many of them will look away from it, will not report it and the DPP will not know about it, because those gardai believe it inappropriate that the prosecution should take place in such circumstances.  If the DPP is informed he has an obligation and duty to prosecute. I see no reason for attempted suicide being retained as a possible criminal offence. The very threat of prosecution against a person who has attempted suicide and failed and as a result has received medical intervention or treatment can bring on pressures that might result in a further attempt that could succeed. This is one dark area in our criminal jurisprudence which has long been ignored.  I ask the Minister, in the context of this excellent Bill &mdash; with the vast majority of which I am wholeheartedly in agreement, with the reservations I have mentioned &mdash; to introduce a very simple section abolishing as a criminal offence attempted suicide.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be in a position to advise as to when it is intended that the community service orders legislation will come into force and effectively provide for the making of community service orders.  That legislation has passed through this House but I know that time is required to carry out the administrative changes needed to bring it into operation.  That legislation is most important in the fight against crime and, in particular, in ensuring that young people who are committing many offences have brought to bear upon them the impact of what they are doing to the community and what is required of them to meet and repay in a responsible way the damage being done to the community.  Many of those offences which young people are at present committing, and for which they are receiving brief sentences of detention or are sent to residential institutions, would be more properly and greatly more effectively dealt with by the coming into operation of the community service orders system.</P>
    <P>I repeat a plea which I have made to every Minister for Justice since I became <Col N="2061" /> a Member of this House.  As we know from statistics, the vast majority of crimes are disproportionately engaged in by persons who are 17 years of age and younger. We have never yet properly dealt with the juvenile liaison officer scheme which is still a Cinderella within the Garda force.  It has great potential, but has of yet no statutory basis and should more often be brought into play than it is.  In the context of my worries concerning section 3 of this Bill and of persons under 17 being brought into Garda stations and detained, one can see a very real role for the juvenile liaison officer attached to the Garda station by his presence during the course of a questioning or an interrogation session, or while the youngster is the subject of an interview.</P>
    <P>The juvenile liaison officer and community service orders schemes are very important in dealing with young people who come into conflict with the law, in providing others with a deterrent and is protecting the community.  There is a need for custodial sentences, of that I have no doubt.  Juvenile liaison officers must be given greater powers than at present and their numbers increased.</P>
    <P>When the debate on this Bill is completed and when, it is hoped, the Bill is amended to deal with some of the matters raised, it will result in a good deal more success on the part of the Garda in the detection of crime.  Part and parcel of that is reforming and considerably improving the training which a garda receives.  The detection rate, and indeed, the conviction rate in the context of the increase in crime, are appalling.  This legislation has an important role to play but, by itself, will not solve the problem.  In my own constituency in which there has been a very great increase in crime in recent years there is an imbalance which I simply do not understand but which is, no doubt, partially due to the increase in population but must be in some way due to approach.</P>
    <P>In a constituency of 100,000 people we have four Garda stations concerned with the investigation of crime &mdash; two being Blackrock and Dundrum Garda Stations within whose areas in 1982 the number of indictable offences committed <Col N="2062" /> decreased.  The two other Garda stations, Rathfarnham and Tallaght, serve the Rathfarnham-Firhouse areas in my constituency and Tallaght, which is virtually a town, and last year the rise in crime continued at a considerable rate but the detection and conviction rate continued to fall in proportion.</P>
    <P>More people are committing criminal offences in Rathfarnham and Firhouse than in Dundrum and Stillorgan, but there must be some reason for that. There must be some reason why in very similar residential areas there is a very different statistical view of what is happening with regard to offences committed. Until 1982, the number of offences being committed was increasing in all areas in Dublin South.</P>
    <P>I would hope that when the areas I have mentioned are properly tackled we will see a decrease in the number of offences being committed and a renewed confidence in the ability of the Garda, with community policing and new procedures, to successfully prosecute and bring the guilty before our courts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Only an hour and three quarters, and I welcomed the Deputy's contribution.</P>
      <P>I should commence by repeating what the Minister said at the conclusion of his speech &mdash; that laws on their own will not solve crime.  We in this House are all very much aware of that.  Most people who are aware of my anxiety about the breakdown of law and order will know that I rank very much in the forefront of those who are very happy to see this Bill brought before the House.  It will not prevent many of the crimes being committed, which will be with us for quite some while.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the most important legislation to come before the House in a great many <Col N="2063" /> years.  We listen continuously to statements about the rights of the minority in our society, but rarely do we hear about the rights of the majority.  This Bill will make it easier to obtain convictions and provides for increased punishment.  The main cause of crime in Dublin at the moment is drug addiction.  I listened with interest to an interview in which a doctor who addressed a conference in Kilkenny suggested not that medical practitioners might not prescribe drugs, but that a register of drug addicts might be made.  At the moment drug addicts resort to mugging and robbing to get a fix.  I do not think we will solve the problems that face drug addicts simply by increasing jail sentences or locking up such people.  I am referring to the heroin drug addicts who may have been two or three years on the drug and are held to be beyond cure.  We are all aware that very few of those people can be cured.  The Minister should discuss this matter with the Minister for Health.</P>
    <P>This suggestion was put forward at a recent medical conference in Kilkenny and the doctor concerned suggested that it should be debated by the conference. I am enamoured at the suggestion.  In wars young people tragically are killed and I look upon those who are now uncurably addicted to heroin as victims in a war in which they cannot survive. They inflict injury on the public at large to maintain their habits.  Those hardened addicts for which medical science has no cure should be sent to a special centre and given their fix, if necessary, because if they do not get the fix they will injure people and damage property to get it.</P>
    <P>We have been told that there are 1,500 drug addicts in Dublin and that is frightening. The more drug addicts we have fighting, as one would say in commercial terms, for a smaller market the more homes that will be broken into and people injured or murdered as occurs in parts of America.  We have a real war on our hands in regard to that.  The approach suggested by the doctor in Kilkenny should be examined because I believe it would reduce substantially the amount of crime that takes place.  The doctor who <Col N="2064" /> put forward the suggestion is deserving of praise.  It is the first positive suggestion I have heard in regard to that problem. If a number of doctors decide that because of a person's addiction to heroin a cure is not possible it should be possible for that person to be given heroin, or a substitute, on a medical prescription so that he does not resort to mugging.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the Garda who have been fighting a tremendous up-hill battle because of the inadequacies of our laws to deal with the problems besetting our society.  They are up against what I call the smart lawyers who tell their clients not to say or commit themselves to anything.  I welcome the provisions in the Bill not because, as some people may think, I am extreme or right wing.</P>

I suggest to the civil liberties group who are opposed to all the measures in the Bill that they have a wonderful opportunity to put their views to the test if they put up a candidate in the bye-election in Dublin Central.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>We represent the people in this House.  I am satisfied with the safeguards built into the legislation. There has been a certain amount of misgiving about the inferences that can be drawn from a decision by a person not to say anything and it is right, as the Minister has stated, that a judge should draw the jury's attention to this and advise them if they should take any inference from it.  At the moment that cannot be <Col N="2065" /> done.  I do not have any hang-ups about section 3.  I should like to compliment the Minister, and his predecessors, who devoted a lot of time to the preparation of this legislation.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that I was the first Member to suggest consecutive sentences for crimes committed by people while on bail and I am delighted to see such a provision in the Bill because this has been a great problem for the Garda.  We have all read of people caught while committing a crime returning to the scene after being released on bail to complete the job.  Sentences in such cases were always concurrent.  The provision to deal with this is an excellent one.  In order to deal with the problem of over-crowding in our courts the Minister should consider having motoring offences dealt with at night courts.  I am not referring to the serious motoring offences such as cases where people are murdered by drunk drivers but to tax and insurance cases.  It would not be any harm to inconvenience such people in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tonight I will be going to the removal of the remains of a 34-year-old man who was killed in a hit-and-run accident two nights ago in the Tallaght area and leaves a widow and two boys, aged 11 and 13 years.  That prompts me to ask the Minister to take into account the tremendous public demand there is for him to take a harsher view of drunk drivers who kill people.  I am sure the Minister read of the case recently of a man being given a suspended sentence of two years and disqualified for 15 years.  That man should have been sent to jail.  To my mind it is murder if a person drinks too much and, while driving under the influence, kills somebody.  That person should be made serve a term in jail.  They could be brought to jail on Friday nights and released on Monday mornings.  There is room in prisons at weekends because some offenders who are of good behaviour are allowed home.  We must take a stronger line when dealing with people who behave irresponsibly in this manner. I have had many narrow misses myself. I drive about 400 miles a week and probably a country Deputy drives 1,000 miles per week.  We take our lives in our hands <Col N="2066" /> when we get into our cars.  I was in one accident where in spite of driving up on the pavement to avoid a car the driver still came after me head on and hit my car.  Luckily I had time to see there was no one on the footpath before I drove onto it.  It was a narrow road but a container truck was able to pass on the other side of the road.  The driver of the car that crashed into my car was drunk out of his mind but unfortunately the Garda did not have the breathalyser equipment to breathalyse him.  Subsequently he was charged with careless driving.  That happened two days before Christmas, and my children would have had a very unhappy Christmas without their father. We should deal with motoring offences in a stricter way.  I am glad to see that fines for stealing cars will be increased substantially.  I wonder if this will apply also to cars taken for joy-riding?  I am glad to see the Minister nodding his head in assent.  That is much needed and will be most welcome.</P>
    <P>I have made representations to various Ministers that an effective way of reducing crime among young people would be to hold the parents responsible in law. I suggested that parents of children say up to 17 years should be fined when the children commit acts of vandalism and that ten per cent should be deducted from their wages or, if unemployed, deducted from social welfare benefits.  One of the Minister's predecessors passed me a note from an official in his Department stating this might be unconstitutional, that it is not possible to hold someone responsible for another person's crime.  However, a dog-owner whose dog bites someone on two occasions is liable for the actions of his dog.  I say parents should be able to communicate with their children much easier than with their dog.  I should like the Minister to examine the situation to see if parents of young thugs and hooligans could be made responsible for the actions of their children.  When I have mentioned this at public meetings it has been met with a round of applause. People are in favour of a measure of this kind.  If parents had to pay for the actions of their children who may have burned a <Col N="2067" /> car or vandalised a telephone booth, that would be a considerable deterrent.  The tragedy is that most of the young people come from families who have also been involved in this kind of criminal behaviour and the cycle repeats itself.</P>
    <P>Some 70 per cent of houses in the Crumlin area have been broken into, many of them three or four times.  I have spoken on many occasions to the victims of crime.  I have often said that public representatives should have three qualities, namely, a feeling for people, a sense of humour and the ability to take punishment. I was hurt very deeply when one woman told me she wished my place was broken into so that I would know the feeling of people whose house is vandalised. When I heard that I nearly cried.  I told her that it did not have to happen to me for me to know how a person would feel.  Senseless, mindless, hoodlums do not mind causing misery to people.  If the parents could be held responsible in some way for the actions of their children it would be a considerable help.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider preparing some place for the more hardened young criminals.  Loughan House has been closed and the detention centre at Lusk is under the aegis of the Department of Education.  I think we need a secure detention centre for a hard core of young criminals.  I would not have it too luxurious: if I had any criticism of Loughan House it was that it was far too luxurious and it cost the taxpayers a fortune. However, we were still saving money because the young people were not committing crimes.  Also, while they were there they were not on drugs and drink.  It was like a holiday home for some of them.  I consider there is a need for a detention centre for youngsters between the ages of 15 and 18 years.  I would have it rather like an army camp. I have often mentioned preparing Spike Island for that purpose, where the people detained could live a little rough.  They could get up early in the morning and be kept on a rigorous regime, with no television. That would give them a taste of discipline they never experienced before. <Col N="2068" /> I am talking about the vicious psychopathic young criminal who has not compassion for his victims.</P>
    <P>I think lawyers always see things in black and white.  I heard my colleague, Deputy Andrews, mention the number of times his car has been stolen.  Does his car have to be stolen before he recognises the pain caused to people who are victims of crimes?  I do not think so.  Does he have to be mugged or does his wife have to be mugged and his children beaten before he recognises there is a problem? The job of a lawyer when defending a person is to use everything in the law to get that person off.  I was recently in a debate with the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Finlay.  As a non-lawyer I was a little overawed, but in the debate I said the law should serve justice. His reply was that justice must always serve the law.  I suppose both of us were right.  Lawyers can only operate within the laws provided by the legislators.  It comes back to us.  We are giving them some laws now but some lawyers will not want them.  They will use every loophole that exists.</P>
    <P>With regard to the questioning of witnesses in a Garda station, concern was expressed about the manner in which confessions could be extracted.  The suggestion was put forward that possibly a clerk of the court might be present when a person is being interrogated.  Whether that is a fact I do not know but I do know many gardaí have lost their lives and many gardaí have been badly beaten up. There are some who find it very difficult to go into so-called &ldquo;no-go&rdquo; areas.  No democratic country likes to admit it has such areas but there was one in my own constituency.  In St. Teresa's Gardens, which has been in the news recently, a committee was set up there and I am told some of those involved might be considered a little bit dubious but the committee are now telling people who can live there and who cannot.  Because of the apparent inadequacy of the law the people took the law into their own hands.  As a democracy this represents a failure on our part because people should not be forced into that sort of situation.  I have built up a position of trust in a number of areas and <Col N="2069" /> constituents now call me up because they do not want to be identified for fear of reprisals.  I get on to the drug squad even at 4 o'clock in the morning or 4 o'clock in the afternoon and pass on the information that drugs are being dispensed in the area.  Public representatives should encourage constituents to approach them in situations like that.  My experience is that the drug squad are very quick to respond.  Where drugs are concerned I make no apology for saying I would fully support capital punishment for the drug pusher or a minimum mandatory sentence of at least 50 years.</P>
    <P>Someone wrote to me recently and asked why I was not as outspoken about the para-military groups as I was about the drug pusher.  In reply I said that while I deplored the activities of the para-military groups and hated the crimes they committed, they were people who were acting from misguided motives and committing murder in the name of some cause.  I said that lower down in the scale of human depravity was the drug pusher who was doing it for his own financial benefit and in the process destroying youth, responsible for at least 1,600 lives lost just as if these same youths had been killed on the battlefield.  The unfortunate part is that young people are in turn forced to become drug pushers.  We should throw everything we can at the drug pusher and make that known.  Any Minister for Justice will have the support of the people if he does that.</P>
    <P>I look at this from a personal point of view.  I asked myself what would I do if my 15 year old son were a heroin drug addict and I decided &mdash; this is a shocking thing for a law maker to say &mdash; that I would put a bullet through his head rather than see him ultimately robbing and killing other people.  If I did not take action it would be a failure on my part. In not taking action I would actually be doing him an unkindness.  That is a shocking thing to say about one's own child. The problem for the families of drug addicts must be a terrible one indeed. What is happening is frightening.</P>
    <P>I believe we have had and still have too much law and not enough justice.  I am not in favour of rough justice but this Bill <Col N="2070" /> does restore some kind of balance.  We must keep a balance in favour of the lawmaker and not in favour of the law breaker.  The changes proposed in this Bill have the backing of 99 per cent of the population.  The longer we talk on it the more we delay its passing but it is important that we address ourselves to the issues involved.  May I ask the Minister, will this Bill go before the Special Committee or will it be debated in the House on Committee Stage?</P>

      <P>Good.  Those of us who are not on that committee would like to have an opportunity of teasing out the sections on Committee Stage.  Reference was made by Deputy Shatter to strip-searching and the Minister said it is already part and parcel of the law.  I know that women are always strip-searched by ban-ghardaí.  I also know that women have a choice of doctor, either a woman doctor or a male doctor.  Our function is to ensure that the criminal is brought to book.  I believe that most people not involved in crime who are stripped and searched by the gardaí have no objection to that.  I certainly have not.  I believe most innocent people have no objection. If people resent it then there is something sadly wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad sentences for carrying firearms are being increased.  That should have a deterrent effect.  Some time ago I asked the Minister by way of question to impose a minimum of five years.  Again, there is the problem of the intimidation of witnesses.  Those who try to intimidate witnesses should get a very severe prison sentence.  Within the last few months a woman told me she was terrified to give evidence because she was warned that, if she did, she would &ldquo;get it&rdquo;.  She wanted the Director of Public Prosecutions to bring the case before the Special Criminal Court under the Offences Against the State Act.  I rang the DPP's office and was told that it did not fall within that category.  Where people are found guilty of intimidation the sentence for that offence <Col N="2071" /> should be mandatory.  It is shocking that families can threaten witnesses.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a majority verdict is very welcome for the reason that juries cannot be got at so easily.  It might be possible to have it 9 : 3 or 10 : 2.  We are living in very bad times.</P>
    <P>There is a very mean sort of crime prevalent although it may be slightly out of place in this debate to refer to it.  One finds a large dent in one's car which will cost £30 to £40 to have repaired.  Every day people see cars banging into other cars and driving off.  If citizens could be encouraged to take the number of the car that dents another car and to give the number to the gardaí, it might have a deterrent effect.  I have two matching dents on my car on both rear wings. Somebody seeing them identical might think it was part of the design.  This type of thing is happening with increasing frequency.</P>
    <P>A Bill of this kind takes a long time to prepare, and it will be a long time before another such Bill is prepared.  Therefore, one tries to raise as many issues as possible on the Second Reading.</P>
    <P>An interesting point was raised by Deputy Shatter in relation to unsworn statements.  The Deputy suggested that an atheist can hardly be made to swear. Perhaps the Minister will tell us when he is replying to the debate how that problem will be dealt with.  If a person says he does not believe in God, does he swear on his own integrity?  It is an interesting query.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see a change being introduced in relation to alibis, and I do not see anything unfair in the provision. As the Minister has stated, the book of evidence has to be presented to the defence by the prosecution and there is no reason why that should not be balanced by disallowing alibis introduced for the first time on the day of the hearing of the case, giving the prosecution no time to check.  I welcome that, as do most people on this side of the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to the JLO service which is a very important service. There are many young women of 15 to 17 years of age who are actively engaged <Col N="2072" /> in youth work.  A natural progression for many of these would be to go into juvenile liaison work for the Garda.</P>
    <P>Reference has been made to the question of uniformity of sentencing by courts.  We have no function in that matter, but there is a bad feeling amongst many people that judges give different sentences for the same sort of crime, a lot depending on the mood the judge is in on the occasion.</P>
    <P>The Minister must seriously consider ways of making the job of district justice worthwhile for successful legal people. The Minister has a big problem on his hands in obtaining sufficient numbers of persons who want this onerous job.  It is a very difficult job and a very thankless one.  I do not know how district justices can carry out that work day after day.  It is very soul destroying work.  I have been in court many times listening to the kind of things they have to deal with day after day.  They would need some recompense for that.  The job of district justice should be made a great deal more attractive than it is in order to attract people into the service.</P>
    <P>There is a lot of resentment about the cost of free legal aid, which is invariably in favour of the accused and never of the victim.  Vast sums of money are being spent on this service.  A person is accused in court and the justice asks him if he is employed.  When he says he is not he is asked if he wants legal aid and he says he does and then he names the person that he wants.  Then, because of that, the case is adjourned for two weeks.</P>

      <P>I had not intended to start on this note, but having heard Deputy Briscoe's very moving description of the misery that hundreds of young persons are experiencing from being the victims of drug addiction I should like to support what he has said.  It is tragic that this problem has crept into Irish society. It is a relatively new problem, but it is looming very large as a very serious problem of the future and one which will have to be met head on.  I would support completely Deputy Briscoe's suggestion that heroin pushers should be dealt with in the most severe way, and that is by capital <Col N="2073" /> punishment.  That is an extremist view, but one that is fully justified and one which will be endorsed by the ordinary people, perhaps not by the legal profession but certainly by the average man in the street.  The crime of pushing drugs, particularly heroin, is sufficient to merit such extreme punishment.  By implementing that punishment we will meet this desperate situation head on.  Desperate situations require desperate remedies.</P>
      <P>I am sure my request will not be listened to and will not be implemented. The matter in all probability will be referred to committees of inquiry and files will be compiled.  The tragic situation involved in drug pushing will escalate out of control in the next 10 to 20 years unless drastic measures are introduced now, and the situation will be appalling at the end of the century.  That is why the Minister for Justice should seriously consider this problem now when it is in its infancy. Fifteen persons died in this country last year.  They were murdered &mdash; murdered by persons selling heroin and other forms of drugs.  That is the way in which it should be viewed, that they were murdered. The probability is that the graph will rise.  More people will die next year as a result of this foul traffic in drugs.  The position, particularly in Dublin, is out of control.  As yet it has not manifested itself to any great extent in country towns but we do not want it to appear in country towns.  We want it to be dealt with here. It originated here.  Strong measures must be implemented now.</P>

Has the Minister yet made any decision on the £4.5 million for completion of the airport by 1985, as was suggested at that time, or will he decide on the basis of the potential viability of the airport, which is the current criterion for funding for Clondalkin Paper Mill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Transport if he is aware that the Dublin Port and Docks Board are failing in their statutory obligations to maintain and improve Balbriggan and Skerries harbours; and the action he intends to take to remedy the situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the policy of the Dublin Port and Docks Board that expenditure on the Balbriggan and Skerries harbours should be related to revenue from users.  There has been no commercial traffic at either harbour for the past 20 years &mdash; the only users have been fishing vessels and pleasure boats &mdash; and the Port and Docks Board consider that it is anomalous that they should be responsible for maintaining these harbours in the absence of such traffic.  It is my view that it would be unreasonable to expect the Port and Docks Board to incur major expenditure on works at either of the two harbours in the absence of commercial traffic and particularly since there is no prospect of any return on the investment.</P>
      <P>My Department are pursuing with the various interested parties, including Dublin County Council and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, the possibility of sharing the cost of urgent remedial works required at Balbriggan Harbour and I am hopeful of a satisfactory outcome in this case.  I understand that the question of the provision of improved facilities for fishing vessels at Skerries harbour is at present under consideration in the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The question refers to a statutory obligation of the Dublin Port and Docks Board, so it is not a matter for decision by the board whether they will or will not or whether they like to or do not; it is a statutory obligation on them to maintain and improve these harbours. Balbriggan, if I may speak about it first, is in a disgraceful condition.  We have a fishing fleet there&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to make a speech.  The Minister's reply was quite extensive, though lacking in information. The Minister is attempting to say that improvements will only be related to commercial use.  I suggest to the Minister that the board's statutory obligation is to maintain and to improve these harbours, and they are not doing that.  Balbriggan harbour is in a disgraceful condition without even basic amenities for the fishing fleet &mdash; not even for the existing fleet, not to talk about an extended fleet.  For example, it needs to be dredged, it needs lighting, water and other facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure the Deputy has asked a question.  There is a statutory obligation on the Dublin Port and Docks Board which sets out that in accordance with the provisions of section 47 of the Harbours Act, 1946, the Dublin Port and Docks Board are responsible for maintenance of Balbriggan and Skerries harbours.  Section 186 (1) (d) provides that all money received by the board shall be expendable in regard to Dublin, Skerries and Balbriggan harbours. That is the extent of the statutory obligation.  The Deputy will have to agree that it is unreasonable to expect the board to expend money on harbours which are not commercially used.  Attempts have been made to have Dublin County Council take over responsibility for the two harbours but the council have not given a decision on the matter.  There has been a suggestion that the council might make some grant aid available if the board had some plans.  I understand the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are considering this matter and that a decision will be announced in the near future. I hope that if repairs could be arranged on such a basis Dublin County Council would take over future responsibility for the two harbours.  I should like to add that the policy I am talking about today is precisely the same as my predecessor, <Col N="2078" /> Deputy Reynolds, announced by letter to the Deputy in June 1982.</P>

      <P>If nothing else, the Minister has read his brief, but he is not adding much to the brief.  As the Minister knows, there was controversy in regard to the Custom House site.

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The board have a statutory obligation in regard to the Skerries harbour, to the extension of that harbour, but they are not meeting their obligation to extend the harbour for the fishing fleet.

      <P>Dublin County Council have not been found wanting in making money available for projects in respect of which Dublin Port and Docks Board would be prepared to share.

I would remind the Deputy that the board also have a statutory obligation to balance their books.  It would be very wrong of me or anybody else to impose non-commercial obligations on them. The Deputy in his supplementary question said categorically that the Port and Docks Board has responsibility to make provision for the Skerries fleet.  That is not the case.  I understand that the Skerries fleet are a fishing fleet and the Port and Docks Board have not any responsibility <Col N="2079" /> for fishing whatsoever.

While the Minister cannot instruct the Port and Docks Board, since they are supposedly an independent board, is he aware of the potential of these harbours for fishing purposes?  In the light of the commercial viability of these harbours for fishing purposes can the Minister say if the Port and Docks Board will meet their statutory obligations and carry out even basic maintenance on the harbour which they have refused to do?  They are too interested in extending out and polluting Dublin Bay.  They are not interested in maintaining and improving Skerries Harbour.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if he will establish a proper information system whereby members of the general public can obtain speedy and accurate information on matters relating to the telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for an effective, speedy information system is fully recognised and numbers of measures designed to produce this have been and are being taken.</P>
      <P>Outside Dublin it is possible now to get information promptly from the district sales offices on when most telephone applications will be met.  In the Dublin area, it is expected that it will be possible to get information quickly too when a computerised system of recording the position in regard to applications for service is implemented shortly and when the programming of work for next year is completed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In general, there is no difficulty in provincial districts in getting information in regard to when repairs will be carried out.  In Dublin, the prime requirement is to reduce the time taken to repair faults, but as part of the programme for this, four new repair centres are to be provided. These will enable information to be provided more readily on the fault <Col N="2096" /> position.  The first of these is being introduced at present and the others are expected to be in service in the course of the next year.</P>
    <P>Information on telephone accounts can be obtained speedily from the GPO headquarters except perhaps at peak account times, quarterly, or where lines and associated apparatus have to be tested before inquiries can be replied to.  It is proposed to decentralise much of the telephone billing inquiry work to provincial sales offices and a start is being made having account inquiries dealt with in Cork shortly.  This should have a generally beneficial effect.  Restoration of confidence in the billing system would result in a greatly reduced volume of inquiries and enable information to be supplied more promptly.  I expect that action being taken will have this effect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that people living in Dublin, and in particular in South Dublin, seeking information direct from the Department as to when telephones will be supplied or repairs carried out find it almost impossible to get any information whatsoever? Equally, it often happens that people seeking such information get contradictory reports from different people in his Department.  Can the Minister say when in the Dublin area, and in particular in South Dublin, people applying for information will be able to apply direct to the Department and get speedy information, without the necessity of going through Members of this House. Could the Minister also clarify what the position will be with relation to seeking such information after Bord Telecom assume their responsibilities on 1 January next?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the four new repair centres were in operation, it might lighten the amount of work coming on me with regard to queries.  For the information of the Deputy, the four new centres are: Belcamp which deals with Dublin North East and was brought into operation on 10 October; Phibsborough to deal with Dublin North West; Terenure for Dublin South West; Stillorgan, <Col N="2097" /> Priory Park for Dublin South East.  In these cases tenders for the equipment for these centres were received from the contractors at the end of October.  In the not too distant future services will be available in these areas and the queries will not have to go through the channel referred to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider, in the short-term, allocating further staff to the query section of his Department?  The staff there are doing trojan work and are practically martyrs. I have had experience of taking some of the telephone calls in that section and, naturally, the public who have problems with their telephones are quite disappointed and dissatisfied.  The staff are doing great work in difficult circumstances. In the short-term, before these new improvements take place, would the Minister consider putting extra staff at the disposal of the public?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Most telephone faults in the Dublin area are cleared within 2 working days after the fault is reported. There is delay in restoring service normally only when the fault is in the underground cable serving the telephone. These represent about 30 per cent of all faults.  The time taken to clear these faults depends on the nature of the fault, the condition of the cables affected and the availability of skilled staff.  Action taken this year has resulted in the time taken to restore service being greatly reduced, but the position is, I regret, still not as satisfactory as it should be, or as I would like it to be.  It should improve further gradually according as measures in hands, such as preventive maintenance, pressurisation of cables and improved organisation of the work, bear fruit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the reason a telephone bill in the sum of £1,195.56 was forwarded to a person (details supplied) in Dublin 14 in respect of an account dated 5 May 1982 which related to an alleged usage of 15,786 units when the average number of telephone units used by this person over the preceeding 10 years was between 600 and 1,000 units; the reason the bill was addressed to a business (details supplied) when no such business operates from this address; the reason the telephone user was advised by his Department on 29 March 1983 that there are no good grounds for reducing the charge; and if a special investigation will be undertaken into this matter and an accurate bill forwarded to the person concerned.</P>

The bill which was issued by computer, was addressed to the subscriber by name, followed by an abbreviation of &ldquo;Trading as Irish Supermarket Services&rdquo;.  The subscriber was advised that there were no good grounds for reducing the charges because the meter and associated equipment were found to be in good order when checked.</P>

Would the Minister consider expediting his Department's investigation into this matter on the basis that this question was first tabled by me in May of this year?  I also wrote to the Minister's Department in that month and 23 May was told by letter that inquiries were being made into that matter.

      <P>asked the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs the effect the present strike by 183 field staff employed by a company (details supplied) is having on the installation of automatic exchanges throughout the country; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall effect is, regrettably, to delay planned improvements in the telephone service such as conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working, replacement of obsolescent equipment, relief of congestion and provision of new exchanges to cater for new subscribers and more traffic.  At present, the installation and commissioning of over 100 automatic exchanges are affected.  Pending a settlement of the strike, it is not possible to assess how long it will take to clear the backlog and what the impact may be on exchange projects not yet due to start in normal course. When the strike is settled, the contractor will be pressed to recover as much as possible of the ground lost, but it will obviously not be possible to recover the ground fully in the short term.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if following the breakdown of talks between himself and the representatives of the Prison Officers' Association, he will make a statement indicating the further steps he now proposes to take to break the impasse which has now arisen, so that the grave threat which now exists to prison security can be avoided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I have put to the Prison Officers' Association a set of proposals which I believe to be eminently reasonable <Col N="2107" /> and which, in fact, they have not rejected.  They have, as yet, declined to discuss them except subject to preconditions.</P>
      <P>Because the present position cannot be evaluated or even understood without some reference to what has occurred over the last week, I should like to put on the record of the House certain facts.  The high level of overtime in the prisons has been such that my Department had to issue a circular to prison governors on 11 October calling for a certain measure of flexibility in the level of prisoner-escorts. I mention the date to show that this is not something that suddenly arose last week. On Thursday, 3 November, the POA had certain discussions about the circular in my Department.  Because they received no concession in the course of their discussions, the POA stated that industrial action would take place from midnight. They sought a meeting with me that same evening under that threat.  They arrived at Leinster House and asked for a decision within ten minutes on whether I would meet them.  Even if I were free to do so, which in fact I was not, I would consider it to be inappropriate and against the public interest to agree to meet an association in this fashion and the fact that the association should apparently think it normal to act in this way tells its own story.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I declined to meet them that evening. However, later that evening I offered to meet them the following week.  On the following day, the offer was made specifically for the following Tuesday and on the basis that I was willing in the meantime to suspend the operation of the circular. Nevertheless, the POA twice refused to postpone or call off their industrial action until that meeting would have been held.  On the second occasion the refusal was conveyed to my Department by the General Secretary of the POA who subsequently claimed that no such offer had to his knowledge been made. In the event, prison officers in Mountjoy, at a time when I had offered them a meeting and a suspension of the circular, took industrial action and persisted in it <Col N="2108" /> until some were asked to leave the prison and others followed them out.</P>
    <P>The officers who took that action have not in the meantime been allowed to return.  The reason is this.  Prison security is closely bound up with the security of the State itself and it is essential that the state of near anarchy that has been prevailing should end.  The Garda Síochána have had to be called into Mountjoy to maintain order and basic services.  The public have no assurance that, if the prison officers concerned were now to go back to Mountjoy, we may not have further industrial action in a week's time necessitating another Garda intervention. We cannot have a situation in which the Gardaí are required to be on virtual standby in order to be called into a prison because of some dispute with the POA. The Gardaí are now in Mountjoy and I am not prepared to agree to any arrangement which would mean that they would come out only to have to face the prospect of going back again in a week's time.</P>
    <P>The position quite simply is this.  I am anxious for a settlement and for a new beginning.  I am not looking for any victory over the POA but only a recognition that what has been going on cannot continue to go on.  I have not set a 24-hour or any other time limit as some people seem to think.  What I have said is a very different thing, namely, that if the POA want a quick arrangement for the return of their members, I see no reason why the settlement cannot be reached in 24 hours.  My point is, simply, that there is no need for a prolongation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend going into the details of what led to this stage in the dispute.  Obviously the views expressed by officers of the POA and independent officers in the prison would vary with the Minister's account.  In any event, the Minister has said he is anxious to have a settlement and that he has put forward proposals.  It is my understanding a draft agreement was prepared and on the basis of this draft agreement the Minister would be prepared to set up certain machinery.  This is spelled out in the draft agreement and the Minister has a number <Col N="2109" /> of specific requirements which were mentioned in the newspapers this morning. One is that all lawful orders and directives will be obeyed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

In the interests of peace and harmony in our prison service, I ask the Minister to allow the staff to return and let the discussions proceed under an independent arbitrator, if necessary, if this would be helpful so that the security of our prisons can be assured.  There is very little at this stage between the Minister and the officers and I ask him to consider taking that step.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I have already covered the points raised by the Deputy in my reply.  The position is that we have to avoid the state of near anarchy in the prison system from continuing, where we had 21 industrial disputes this year and 18 industrial disputes last year under a different administration and where I and my three immediate predecessors have had innumerable disputes in <Col N="2110" /> the prisons with the POA.  We cannot allow that to continue.  I am not prepared to seek a solution to the particular problem outside the context of a solution to the general problem.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to confirm that the draft agreement covers a long-term solution to the problems. It covers an agreement under which the officers would suspend all industrial action while discussions took place on the draft agreement.  On the basis of that agreement the Minister would have a long-term settlement.  I suggest that, in the interest of peace and harmony, the Minister should consider agreeing to meet with the officers and allow them back to work while continuing to achieve agreement on the broadly based draft programme he has put before them.  Will the Minister not agree that there is a difficult situation in our prisons?  They are overcrowded and too many prisoners are being shed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am not prepared to negotiate across the floor of the House with Deputy Woods either in his capacity as Fianna Fáil's spokesman on Justice or in his seemingly newly appointed role as spokesman for the POA.  The situation is that we have, as I have outlined it, three different services in this State and the security of the State in the final analysis depends on the Army, the Garda Síochána and the Prison Officers Association.  We cannot have a situation in our prisons where they lurch from crisis to crisis and where prison officers are prepared to walk out, without any notice whatsoever, and leave dangerous prisoners unattended.  I am seeking now an overall agreement.  That agreement I <Col N="2111" /> have put before the prison officers.  They are not prepared to discuss the agreement with me without pre-conditions and I am not prepared to concede pre-conditions. There will be no negotiation on the particular problem outside of the context of the general problem.</P>
      <P>I would also like to inform the House that copies of the draft terms of the agreement which I have put before the representatives of the POA, both of their officers and yesterday to their executive before they walked out of my Department, have been put in the Library. These copies are available to Deputies to see for themselves the proposals I have put before the Prison Officers' Association. I am available all the time to discuss with the Prison Officers' Association the proposals I have put before them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Government are required under section 5 of the European Communities Act, 1972, to report twice yearly to each House of the Oireachtas on developments in the European Communities. We will today, therefore, be discussing the 21st Report which covers the period July to December, 1982.</P>
      <P>In introducing some six-monthly reports in the House earlier this year I broke with tradition somewhat and endeavoured to bring a number of central issues up to date.  I intend to follow this precedent today.  It has a number of advantages.  It, for instance, allows us to broaden our examination of a particular period into a general discussion on the Community and its institutions.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Members on all sides of the House feel that we should have such discussions at more regular intervals than has been the case in the past.  Secondly, the updating of our debate will help give a sense of continuity to my detailed account of the six-monthly period up to the end of December last and will moreover put developments during this period in a more satisfactory perspective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Essentially, the same central issues have been concerning the Community for over three years now.  They touch on the institutional, the financial and budgetary, and the policy development sides of the <Col N="2126" /> Community.  In short, the very core, the very capacity of the EEC to progress and to avoid potential disaster has been, and is, at stake for at least three years.</P>
    <P>The background to the continuing crisis is by now well known.  It had its immediate, direct origin in the insistence of the British Government that its contribution to the Community budget placed an unfair and disproportionate burden on it.  That insistence, in turn, led to an examination both of the existing range of Community policies and of the development of existing and new policies that would be required if the Community were to acquire a much-needed new depth, quality and credibility.  This process, known as the mandate, did not achieve the agreement envisaged at the London European Council in December 1981 and to some degree the process lost much of its initial dynamism for some time afterwards.</P>
    <P>This simmering crisis took on a new and highly dangerous dimension this year, however, with the realisation that the Community was fast approaching the present legal limit on its own resources. There was now just the frustation of not being able to develop new and urgently needed policy areas or to resolve the British budgetary dispute, but the very real and early possibility of not being able to fund existing policy.  The Commission paper of last May on the future financing of the Community underlined this point very succinctly when it stated that what was at issue was &ldquo;nothing less than the preservation of the normal operation of all the Community's policies&rdquo;.  The recent deferral of certain payments due under the Common Agricultural Policy was a powerful, practical demonstration of the unprecedented crisis facing the Community.</P>
    <P>The putting in place of new own resources requires a unanimous decision by the ten member states and national parliamentary ratification.  Successive Irish Governments have believed strongly that, if the Community was to develop and was going to respond relevantly and effectively to the growing economic and social difficulties, it needed new resources; and it needed them in <Col N="2127" /> their own right, and urgently.  But, as I said, this decision must be unanimous. The reality is that a number of our partners are insisting on certain preconditions being met before they will give their consent to new resources.  One member state will not even go this far and insists that the case for raising the present 1 per cent VAT ceiling has yet to be proved.</P>
    <P>The present negotiations are, therefore, the most difficult and delicate that have faced this country since accession. They are being conducted under an emergency system of Special Councils which was established by the European Council in Stuttgart last June.  A Special Council under this procedure is, as Deputies will be aware, actually taking place in Athens at the moment.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his colleagues at the meeting were greatly assured by the strong, united support which they received for their negotiating stance from the Seanad last week.  I believe in the circumstances of the present meeting in Athens that our interventions today should be in general rather than detailed terms and I would hope that all Deputies could agree with me on this approach-Stuttgart was about far more than adapting the Common Agricultural Policy.  Indeed, it had to be if the Community is going to reach out and respond relevantly and effectively to the real problems of the Europe of 1983 and of the next ten years.  We have to eliminate barriers to trade, to develop our competitiveness, to promote small and medium sized industries, to develop energy and research policies, to bring about a greater convergence between regions, and, of course, and most important, to make a meaningful impact on the scandal of unemployment, especially youth unemployment. At Stuttgart the Taoiseach argued strongly that this tragic problem should have a high priority and at the Special Councils the Minister for Foreign Affairs has stressed how vital it is that our negotiations lead to urgent and effective action to tackle it.</P>
    <P>The important, the essential message from Stuttgart was the agreed decision to relaunch &mdash; the declaration used this <Col N="2128" /> term &mdash; the Community.  The Government have entered enthusiastically into this process, believing that if the Community is not urgently made much more relevant and responsive to the needs of its citizens its crisis of confidence and credibility will become progressively more severe and difficult to resolve.</P>
    <P>In particular the disillusionment of our youth will become even more deep-rooted. Across the complete spectrum of economic, social and industrial activity, therefore, we need urgently to decide the direction in which we wish the Community to move and, even more important, the policies and financial resources we need to achieve this objective.</P>
    <P>While playing our full part in the Stuttgart progress the Government have been insistent from the outset that Irish agriculture, and especially its milk sector, must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to realise the comparative advantages which it has.  To do otherwise would be to alter fundamentally the entire economic balance accepted at the time of Ireland's accession to the Community.  It would be doubly unjust to do so in a context in which the CAP has been the main Community instrument seeking, in accordance with the Treaty, to bridge the gap between Ireland and her more prosperous partners.</P>
    <P>The Irish dairy sector constitutes, uniquely and exceptionally, some 9 per cent of Irish GNP.  It is responsible for the employment of close to one in ten of those at work.  It accounts for 10 per cent of our total exports.  The direct importance of milk output to the Irish economy is five times greater than the average for the Community as a whole, and two and a half times greater than in any other member state.  The major potential of this sector, historically greatly underdeveloped because of its dependence on the cheap food policy of the British market, was one of the primary reasons for our decision to join the Community in 1973.  There can be no question of this or any other Irish Government accepting a proposal which would create an unacceptable situation for us in this area.  Our position must be clear, firm and united on this issue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2129" /> In looking at the period covered by the report before us I do not think I need remind Deputies in any great detail of the economic background to developments in the Community during that time.  Unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, continued and continues to be one of the greatest difficulties faced by all member states of the Community.</P>
    <P>Inflation, while slowing down to some extent, nevertheless remained high.  The marginal improvement was attributable, I am afraid, to depressed commodity prices and lack of demand rather than any more positive factors.</P>
    <P>As I said in my general remarks at the beginning of this statement, the institutions of the Community were under severe strain in attempting to cope with the internal and external problems they faced.  However, some notable and positive developments were recorded.</P>
    <P>Between June and December 1982 progress was made on the proposed accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community.  Ireland is gratified that since the start of 1982 negotiators have reached substantial agreement on a considerable number of chapters, including transport, regional policy, economic and financial questions and approximation of laws.  We hope that this progress will give added impetus to the negotiations on outstanding issues, which include such vital areas as agriculture and fisheries.  The agreement reached by the Agriculture Ministers in regard to the Mediteranean policy of fruit and vegetables&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>What about olive oil &mdash; that is important?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one of the many issues still facing us.  Fruit and vegetables had been a major blocking point in the matter of getting discussions under way. That agreement has removed one major blockage.  However, there are other major issues in regard to agriculture and fisheries that will cause much difficulty before the agreement can be reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland is firmly committed to the enlargement of the Community.  We welcome the application of Spain and Portugal for membership of the Community <Col N="2130" /> and we believe that the political and economic aims of the Community will be enhanced by enlargement.  However, the accession of Spain and Portugal also poses a challenge.  We believe that if the next enlargement is to be successful the Community's own resources must be increased.</P>
    <P>In this context we welcome the decision taken at Stuttgart to link enlargement to renewed arrangements on internal Community financing for we believe that the satisfactory resolution of our internal problems at this critical juncture in the Community's history will give a new impetus to the accession negotiations. We look forward to next year, when Ireland assumes the presidency of the Community, to contributing actively to the accession of Spain and Portugal to a strengthened and vigorous Community.</P>
    <P>Following the presentation in March 1982 of the Greek memorandum on the economic problems faced by Greece the Commission outlined its initial response to the Greek demands in June 1982 and subsequently amplified its proposals in a full report in March 1983.  This report was considered at the European Council at Stuttgart in June 1983 and has formed the basis of the subsequent work on the memorandum. Since June the Commission has presented a number of specific proposals in the fields of agriculture, training, infrastructure and environment.</P>
    <P>Ireland, which is committed to the eradication of undevelopment and to the economic convergence of the Ten, supports these measures and the general lines of the Commission's response to the Greek memorandum.  Deputies will recall the confirmation of this support made by the Taoiseach to the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Papandreou, during his recent visit to Athens.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament adopted, on 6 July 1982, the resolution sponsored by Mr. Spinelli on guidelines for reform of the Treaties and the development of European Union.  This process was brought a step further by the adoption of a resolution on a preliminary draft Treaty during the parliamentary session of September 1983.</P>
    <P>In view of the early stage of the process <Col N="2131" /> towards the Parliament's goal it is not possible at this stage to anticipate the nature or extent of the final draft Treaty. However the initiative is a positive contribution to fresh thinking on the basic tenets of European consciousness.</P>
    <P>Contemporaneously with the Spinelli initiative work was proceeding in the Council on the Genscher Colombo initiative aimed likewise at the revitalisation of the integration process.  This initiative reached fruition with the signature at the Stuttgart European Council of the Solemn Declaration on European Union. The Taoiseach reported to the Dáil on the Declaration in June last and expressed his satisfaction that, at a time when the Community is in the throes of a very difficult debate with crucial implications for the future, the Heads of State and Government have reaffirmed their commitment to the basic ideals which inspired the foundation of the Community.</P>
    <P>The September 1982 part-session of, the Parliament was marked by a formal sitting to celebrate Parliament's 30th anniversary.  In these times of uncertainty and anxiety regarding the future development of our Community it is encouraging to recall that the institutions have in fact proved their durability over a considerable period, often in times of challenge and difficulty.</P>
    <P>The future development of the Community in the widest sense depends on a complex interaction of the various potential factors for change in all the institutions. It is understandable, however, that special interest should be taken in the activities of the Parliament, now approaching its second phase of direct elections.  Those elections will take place June 14-17, 1984.  I need hardly remind the spokesman for the Opposition, whom I understand will be taking an active role in these elections, according to newspaper reports recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister please repeat that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was commenting on <Col N="2132" /> a newspaper report, which indicated that the spokesman for the Opposition would be the director of elections for the Opposition. I was not elevating him to parliamentary status in Strasbourg.</P>
      <P>While fully appreciating Parliament's role it is only natural that a small country like Ireland, represented by only 15 out of 434 European members, should be cautious about any moves that would impinge on the powers of our national institutions of Government.  Development of the institutions of the Community in line with changed circumstances is to be welcomed but must proceed hand in hand with mutual solidarity between member states and with the promotion of economic convergence, which is an objective both in the Preamble to the Treaty of Rome, and in the Treaty of Accession insofar as Ireland is concerned.</P>
      <P>The complementary institution to the Parliament is the Economic and Social Committee.  In most cases before a Commission proposal can be adopted by the Council it is sent for the opinion of the ESC.  The committee is a consultative body composed of 15 per cent representatives from employers, trade unions and other groups directly interested in Community activities such as farmers and consumers.</P>
      <P>The committee was reconstituted according to the normal four-year cycle on 18 September 1982.  Ireland's nine seats were allocated on the authority of the Government to representatives of the employer, trade union, agriculture and social sectors.  The Irish representatives on the committee therefore represent a cross-section of our society and we are fortunate to be able to avail of their contribution to the process of Community legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Turning now to the Community's external relations, the period under review saw continued strains on the world trading system.  The Community and its major trading partners have in general avoided a protectionist response to these strains, and at the GATT Ministerial meeting held towards the end of November 1982 delegates adopted a declaration which reaffirmed commitment to overcome <Col N="2133" /> protectionist pressure and resolved to support and, indeed, improve the GATT trading system.  Avoidance of protectionism and &ldquo;beggar-my-neighbour&rdquo; policies is essential for Ireland, with our small open and, consequently, vulnerable economy.</P>
    <P>This, however, is not to say that no difficulties were experienced during that time.  Deputies will recall that in the dispute with the United States over European steel exports an agreement was reached in October 1982.  More recently, however, the United States took measures which have, in effect, limited its imports of specialty steels from the Community. A satisfactory accommodation, possibly in the form of compensation for other products, is being pursued in this case.</P>
    <P>The United States and other trading partners, such as Australia and New Zealand, have also criticised aspects of the Community's agricultural trade policy. This was an important issue at the GATT Ministerial meeting in November 1982 where the Community resisted pressure for commitment on the limitation of export subsidies.  The differences between the Community and the US have become more acute following the subsidised US sale of one million tonnes of wheat flour and 24,000 tonnes of dairy products to Egypt in January and July 1983.  The Community views these sales as infringing GATT rules and has been using GATT channels to make its dissatisfaction felt and to seek redress.  The Government will seek to ensure that the Community's right to a fair share of the world market in agricultural produce, which was confirmed in the Tokyo Round negotiations, is maintained.</P>
    <P>The growth in the Community's trading imbalance with Japan was also a matter of serious concern in the period under review.  Deputies will appreciate that for certain member states which manufacture goods such as motor cars, television sets etc. which are in direct competition with Japanese goods, this is a very sensitive matter.  The Community has therefore sought to encourage Japan to open its markets to imports of manufactured goods.  I am encouraged by the <Col N="2134" /> steps which the Japanese Government has taken in this respect.  It has shown a growing understanding of the concern with which Japan's trade surplus is viewed by its trading partners.</P>
    <P>During the particular period under review little progress was made in the area of co-operation between the developed countries of the North and the developing countries of the South.  Since then, however, certain positive developments must be noted in the preparatory work for launching the proposed round of Global Negotiations on Economic Co-operation for Development.  The second Brandt Commission report, <i>Common Crisis</i>, the OECD work on world economic interdependence, the Commonwealth Secretariat paper <i>The North South Dialogue; making it work,</i> the statement from the Non-aligned Summit in New Delhi in April, having all helped to keep the dialogue alive and to point the way towards future progress.  The very fact that UNCTAD VI in Belgrade in June 1983 produced a modest body of work is in itself considered a relative success.</P>
    <P>The Council took note of progress already achieved in implementing operations in support of food strategies in the three initial beneficiary countries of Mali, Kenya, and Zambia and in a move welcomed by Ireland, agreed to the extension of Community support in this matter to Rwanda.  For the information of Deputies, this programme aims to address the problem of increasing food deficiencies in developing countries.  It is innovative however in that it goes beyond the provision of food aid and involves also measures to boost agricultural production within developing countries.  This integrated approach is intended to avert the danger that straight-forward food aid may act as a disincentive to production, in developing countries.</P>
    <P>I, and this country generally, strongly support this new approach.  I am very hopeful that it will be successful and, if it is, that it will be extended to many of the countries.  Basically, while food aid fills a temporary gap, the only real solution to the problem of hunger in the Third World is to encourage self-sufficiency in <Col N="2135" /> those countries, to encourage them to develop their own capacity to feed themselves. I see in this particular programme of the EEC the seeds of such an approach which, hopefully, will lead to fruition.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomed the submission of the Commission Memorandum on Development Policy which was discussed at some length at the Council (Development Co-operation) on 8 November 1982, at the Council (Foreign Affairs) on 22-23 November 1982 and on 3-4 December 1982 at the European Council, and which stressed the importance of proposals for Council decisions on priority questions such as the negotiation of the new ACP-EEC Convention.</P>
    <P>Ireland welcomed the continued awareness on the part of the Community of the important contribution made by Food Aid to development, as evidence by the Council decision of 3 December 1982 to increase from 927,663 tonnes to one million tonnes the amount of cereals aid to developing countries by way of Community Action.  The Food Aid Framework Regulation, which made for greater stabilisation of food aid actions, was also agreed at this time.</P>
    <P>Final negotiations on an International Agreement on Jute and Jute Products, 1982, were concluded at an International Conference held in Geneva, 20 September &mdash; 1 October 1982.  While the Instrument of Ratification of the International Agreement on Jute and Jute Products 1982 was deposited by Ireland on 28 June 1983, this agreement did not enter into force as expected on 1 July 1983, because certain countries had not become members by the deadline of 30 June 1983.  It is now very likely that members of the agreement will meet early in January 1984 in Dacca and decide to bring the agreement into force among themselves, even if it does not have the level of membership stipulated in the agreement.</P>
    <P>The Common Fund for Commodities has been open for signature at the UN headquarters since 1 October 1980.  It still remains for the Agreement to enter into force since it must be ratified, accepted or approved by a minimum of 90 States, accounting for at least two thirds of the <Col N="2136" /> Fund's Directly Contributed Capital of $US470 million.  By 30 September 1983 the Agreement had been signed by 110 states and ratified by 64 states accounting for only 41.466 per cent of the fund's capital.  While the conditions for entry into force have not yet been fulfilled, it remains only for those states which have already ratified the Agreement to decide on a new period for the fulfilment of the requirements for entry into force of the Agreement.</P>
    <P>As the report states the Commission proposals for agriculture products and on certain related measures for the 1983-84 marketing year were presented to the Council by the Commission on 23 December last.  Although details of the outcome of these discussions will be contained in the next report, it would I feel be appropriate to say a few words about the outcome.</P>
    <P>Agreement on prices was eventually reached at the Council of Agriculture Ministers on 16-17 May last.  During the course of the seven Council meetings which led to this agreement, certain adjustments to the Commission proposals were made.  Broadly speaking, I believe that the eventual outcome was very good for our agriculture in general and represents a considerable success for the Government.</P>
    <P>Price increases were agreed across virtually the whole range of our produce to give an average increase of 9½ per cents. This included an adjustment of the &ldquo;green rate&rdquo; for the Irish pound by 3.8 per cent initially and a further 1.2 per cent from June.  The increase for our main products was as follows: milk, 7.5 per cent; beef, 10.8 per cent; sheepmeat, 13.7 per cent; cereals, 8.2 per cent; pig-meat, 10.8 per cent and sugar 9.2 per cent.</P>
    <P>In addition the calf premium which was due to expire was continued together with the suckler cow premium.  Together there are worth £47 million and were continued in spite of some opposition during the negotiations.</P>
    <P>As regards milk the price increase was below the average level because of the operation of the production threshold arrangement provided for in the 1982-83 <Col N="2137" /> farm price settlement.  Nevertheless, it represented an extra 6.3p per gallon for the dairying industry.  In relation to this there was increased FEOGA financing both for school milk and the consumer subsidy on butter which in a full year would benefit this country by some £2½ million.</P>
    <P>Overall these price increases will result in approximately £190 million extra for the Irish farm sector in the 1983-84 marketing year.  The balance of payments should benefit to the tune of £180 million. The impact on the consumer price index was estimated at 1 per cent in a full year which is very modest for a deal which is of such a substantial benefit to the economy at large.  I have outlined some of the main features of the agreement in order to illustrate the commitment of the Government to the agricultural sector and our determination to ensure the continued development of the industry.  This is a commitment which is being and will be shown in the current post-Stuttgart negotiations to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The end of 1982 saw intensive efforts to achieve a Common Fisheries Policy fail.  However, in the first weeks of this year a compromise was found which all member states could accept.  Difficulties have been encountered in settling the level of the total allowable catches and individual member states' quotas for this year and efforts are continuing to find a solution.  It has been generally acknowledged that Ireland did reasonably well in terms of the benefits accruing from the establishment of the CFP.  However, a recent decision by the Commission on the abolition of export refunds for mackerel is a retrograde step as far as our fishing industry is concerned.  My colleague, the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy O'Toole is pursuing efforts to have the position reassessed by the Commission.</P>
    <P>The Community's structural funds are important instruments for assisting our future development and the development of the Community as a whole.  While the Stuttgart Mandate includes three funds, the Regional Fund, the Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund (FEOGA) <Col N="2138" /> follow-up work at present is being concentrated on the Regional Fund.  The Commission's proposals for the Regional Fund are complex and we are at present considering all the implications for Ireland and for the Community.  However, it is clear that the major problem with the Regional Fund is that its resources are inadequate for its task, that is, to reduce the gaps between the richest and the poorest regions of the Community. This is one of the points we are making forcefully in the present negotiations.</P>
    <P>In the field of energy, the most significant development was the drop in the price of crude oil in the world market. While it is agreed that such a trend has an adverse effect on the search for alternative sources of energy and fuel switching, nevertheless such a saving was welcomed by this country.  The drop of a few dollars in the price of oil, however, had no effect on worthwhile projects such as the search for indigenous sources of oil and gas, construction of the coal-burning generating stations or the building of the pipeline for the distribution of gas.  If present exploration efforts continue and lead to major results, we might take a different approach to the question of oil but not at present.</P>
    <P>The role of solid fuels received very active attention from us during this period because of a proposal to grant-aid peat in addition to coal and lignite.  In the area of coal we supported the viewpoint of some delegations that the production aid proposals should be counter-balanced by Community assistance for the use, infrastructures and distribution facilities connected with coal.</P>
    <P>A most important development, in the transport sphere, during this period was the adoption of a regulation granting limited financial support in the field of transport infrastructure.  While the amount allocated under the 1982 regulation was limited to 10 million ECU and aided only three projects, its real significance lies in the fact that this was the first occasion on which discussions on the question of establishing a transport infrastructure fund, which began in 1976, culminated in the actual disbursement of aid.  While no <Col N="2139" /> Irish project benefited from this particular regulation, two of our projects are at present being considered for inclusion in a proposal for a programme of infrastructure aid which is currently under discussion. In the long term we are striving to ensure that Ireland will share, to the maximum extent possible, in any general improvement in the Community's transport network brought about as a result of the operations of the Transport Infrastructure Fund although the amounts of money so far provided are quite small.</P>
    <P>The European Parliament in December 1982 rejected a supplementary budget which would have given budgetary effect to a Council decision of 26 October 1982 that certain reimbursements should be made to the United Kingdom and Germany.  The Parliament's main objection was to these types of <i>ad hoc</i> measures being funded through the budget.  Parliament would prefer to see problems of budgetary imbalance as between member states being solved by a balanced development of Community expenditure policies rather than by repayment to individual member states.</P>
    <P>In January 1983 the Commission proposed a further supplementary budget, this time to the 1983 budget, which would go some way towards meeting the preoccupations of the Parliament.  In this supplementary budget 400 million ECU of 1,092 million ECU destined for the UK would be put with the 210 million ECU destined for Germany &mdash; if Deputies have a problem following the figures I would refer them to paragraph 3.3 of the report &mdash; in a budget heading for special measures of Community interest in the energy sector in those two countries.  Further, the conditions for disbursing the funds would be so defined as to give Parliament greater control over the expenditure.  The Commission also proposed a further 35 million ECU for expenditure on energy projects of a general nature, that is, not confined to specific countries.  Finally the proposed supplementary budget would be financed entirely from positive balances on the receipts side of the 1981 and 1982 budgets, that is, it would not require any increase in the receipts side of the 1983 budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2140" /> Following agreement by the Council and the Parliament to the Commission's proposal the President of the Parliament declared the supplementary budget as adopted on 10 February 1983.</P>
    <P>The Twenty-First Report contains a summary review of developments in European Political Co-operation during the period under review.  In general European political co-operation proceeded in a satisfactory manner.</P>
    <P>The Solemn Declaration, signed at Stuttgart in June, which I referred to earlier, aims among other things at improving the effectiveness of European political cooperation &mdash; the process whereby the member states consult and co-ordinate on foreign policy.  I should say that the adoption of the Solemn Declaration does not entail any extension of the scope of foreign policy co-operation. Rather the text sets out practical ways and means in which this process may be strengthened and made more coherent.</P>
    <P>The major upheavals which took place in the Middle East during the period under review have had repercussions which are still being felt today.  The tragic events that have occurred in Lebanon in recent weeks, and are continuing even as we speak, are part of the continuing consequences of Israel's invasion of Lebanon in June 1982.  The Ten have made clear their support for the territorial integrity of Lebanon and have stressed the need for national reconciliation and for early progress towards the complete withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon, except those whose presence is requested by the Lebanese Government. The Ten welcome very much the decision of the rival groupings in Lebanon to engage in reconciliation talks in Geneva and hope that these will lead to national reconciliation.  The Ten are convinced that the abnormal situation there is a further obstacle to the achievement of a just and lasting settlement in the Middle East as a whole.</P>
    <P>On 21-22 March 1983 the Ten emphasised that, above all, the time had come for Israel to show that it stood ready for genuine negotiations on the basis of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, in the first place by refraining from <Col N="2141" /> enlarging existing settlements in the occupied territories or creating new ones. These settlements are contrary to international law and a major and growing obstacle to peace.</P>
    <P>East-West relations have deteriorated steadily in the past few years.  Such events as the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the imposition of martial law in Poland in 1981 and, most recently, the shooting down of the Korean airliner have eroded confidence.  It is clear that a genuine and sincere dialogue is now required to promote a climate of stability and predictability in East-West relations. In this regard there is an overriding and urgent need for the United States and the Soviet Union to halt the deterioration in their political relationship and to replace the current mood of challenge and confrontation by a process of dialogue leading to agreement.  It is to be hoped that, with sufficient political will on both sides, the dangerous tensions that exist today can be dispelled and replaced by a revival of the spirit of <i>détente.</i></P>
    <P>The situation in Poland, and the negative impact of that situation on East-West relations generally, continues to be a cause of major concern.  Martial law was imposed in Poland in December 1981, and the Ten, both jointly and individually, expressed their disapproval of this development.  The Council of the European Communities also demonstrated its disapproval of the pressure exerted by the Soviet Union against efforts for renewal in Poland, by placing a limit on the importation of a wide range of goods from the Soviet Union.  The Heads of State and Government of the Ten, meeting in Stuttgart on 17-19 June, of this year, expressed their conviction that only a national reconciliation which took full account of the aspirations of the Polish people could lead Poland out of its grave crisis.  On 22 July of this year, the Polish Government formally ended the state of martial law and announced an amnesty for the majority of political prisoners then held in detention.  Nevertheless, the Polish Government subsequently incorporated into domestic <Col N="2142" /> legislation repressive measures which maintained the spirit of martial law.</P>
    <P>The Government, in common with the other governments of the Ten, will continue to follow closely developments in Poland, and the nature of the Ten's relations with Poland will be determined by the extent to which the Polish Government may be ready to pursue a policy of reconciliation with the Polish people.</P>
    <P>The Madrid Follow-up Meeting to the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) completed its work on 9 September.  The work of the Conference, which began in 1980, took place against the backdrop of a steady deterioration in East-West relations. Nevertheless, in Ireland's view, shared by the other members of the Ten, the concluding document agreed at the conference is both balanced and substantial. The concluding document contains worthwhile improvements on the provisions contained in the Helsinki Final Act of 1975.  The most notable advances concern the guarantee of the right to form free trade unions and of their right to exercise freely their activities; the further elaboration of provisions to facilitate human contacts; and the decision to convene a conference on confidence &mdash; and Security-Building Measures in Europe (CDE) which will begin work in Stockholm in January 1984.  The concluding document marks the first major agreement to have been reached by the US and the Soviet Union since the unratified Salt II Agreement of 1979.  It is to be hoped that the measure of agreement contained in the concluding document, given sufficient goodwill to exploit it, could mark the beginning of a return to stability and predictability in East-West relations after the reverses which the <i>détente</i> process has suffered in recent years.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the question of relations between the Ten and Third Countries, including the USA.  The increasingly significant role of the Ten on the world stage is reflected in the growing desire of third countries or groups of countries to establish contact with them.  Over the years the Ten have developed contacts with a wide range of countries in a pragmatic <Col N="2143" /> and to a great extent informal way.  The period covered by the Twenty-first Report saw the expansion of contacts between the Ten and the United States with the establishment of regular twice-yearly consultations at the level of the EPC Troika, comprising representatives of the past, present and future Presidencies. These consultations have proceeded smoothly.</P>
    <P>In Asia, the situation in Afghanistan remains a source of grave international concern and seriously affects the stability of the whole region.  The Soviet intervention has caused great suffering to the Afghan people and forced millions to seek refuge in neighbouring countries. Ireland and its partners in the Ten regret that, despite the overwhelming support at each successive United Nations General Assembly for the resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces and reaffirming the right of the Afghan people to determine their own form of government, the occupying forces continue to ignore the terms of the resolution.  This disregard for the UN Resolutions has in no small way contributed to the lack of progress of the UN initiative, diligently pursued by the Secretary-General's special representative, Mr. Cordovez, which contained very positive elements in a genuine attempt to find a settlement to the Afghan problem.</P>
    <P>The Ten are concerned at the continuing situation of stalemate in Kampuchea. Ireland and its partners have consistently supported successive UN resolutions calling for the withdrawal of foreign troops, the right of the Kampuchean people to determine their own future and a commitment by all states to non-interference and non-intervention in the internal affairs of Kampuchea.  The Ten regret deeply that, despite these resolutions being passed by the overwhelming majority of the assembly, all efforts to end the occupation of Kampuchea have foundered on the refusal of Vietnam to comply.</P>
    <P>The Ten will continue to support any initiative which aims at a just and lasting <Col N="2144" /> peaceful solution to the Kampuchean problem and restores peace and stability to South East Asia.</P>
    <P>The Ten are deeply worried by the delay in granting independence to Namibia and the continuation of apartheid in South Africa.  The longer these issues remain unresolved, the more likely it is that change will be brought about by violent rather than peaceful means.  However, it is clear that South Africa is determined to resist all attempts at progress.</P>
    <P>Most recently, the South African Government has entrenched apartheid in a new constitution which was approved by the all white electorate on 2 November of this year and which will come into force next year.  The new constitution provides for limited participation by the coloured and Indian population in separate parliaments but it continues the policy of total exclusion of the black population. Naturally, the new constitution has been denounced by the leaders of black opposition movements in South Africa.  It deserves our denunciation too.  Democracy can be delayed, but it will not be denied.  Our concern and that of our Community partners is that it should be achieved peacefully and soon.</P>
    <P>The South African Government continues to block progress towards Namibian independence by insisting on linking it to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola.  At the same time South African occupation of part of Angola and their support for terrorism there forces the Angolan Government into continued dependence on Cuban assistance.  The linkage of these two issues has been condemned by virtually every country in the world, most recently last month in the UN Security Council which mandated the Secretary-General to continue until the end of the year his efforts to assist progress towards independence for Namibia in accordance with Resolution 435. Ireland supports the Secretary-General's efforts and hopes that he may make some headway in the very difficult task of dealing with an intransigent Government in South Africa.</P>
    <P>On the continent of Latin America it is probably fair to say that it is the situation in relation to human, social and <Col N="2145" /> political rights in Chile which gives most cause for concern at the moment.  The government of that country appear to have little, if any, sensitivity either to the just demands of their own people or to the pressure of international opinion.  On the other hand, it is indeed heartening to see in Argentina the establishment of a new and democratic administration.  I am sure that Deputies will join me in wishing President-elect Alfonsin every good fortune in tackling the very great political and economic tasks before him and in consolidating democratic institutions in that great country.</P>
    <P>I regret to say that, since the end of the period covered by the report, there has been no improvement in the terrible situation in Central America.  Human rights violations continue on a massive scale, as do social and economic injustices, and tension within and between certain countries of the region.</P>
    <P>In El Salvador conflict continues between the government and guerilla forces.  Presidential elections which had been expected to take place in December have been postponed.  Concern continues with regard to the human rights situation in Guatemala, in spite of &mdash; perhaps the cause of &mdash; a change in leadership.  Nicaragua has been subjected to attack from guerilla forces operating from Honduras and Costa Rica.  There has also been increasing concern in the United States at the situation, and the involvement of that country in the region.  The Government continue to believe that the promotion of essential social and economic reforms is the surest, indeed the only, way to achieve long-term peace in Central America.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach joined with the other Heads of State and Government of the Ten Community countries in Stuttgart on 17-19 June 1983 in expressing their conviction that the problems of Central America cannot be solved by military means, but only by a political solution springing from the region itself and respecting the principles of non-interference and inviolability of frontiers.</P>
    <P>Ireland, in common with the other member states of the European Community, sees a particular cause for hope <Col N="2146" /> in the efforts of the Contadora Group of countries to achieve a lasting peace in Central America.  The fact that the countries engaged in these efforts all belong to the region itself is an added reason for hoping that they will persevere and be successful.  I am glad to note therefore that there has recently been progress by the Contadora Group towards reaching agreement with the countries of Central America on the principles that should govern relations between the countries of that region.</P>
    <P>The regional issue which most occupies public attention at the moment is clearly that of the armed intervention in Grenada on 25 October by the United States and other forces.  The Government's attitude to this event has already been made clear, both in this House and outside it.  We consider that the action cannot be reconciled with the Provision of the United Nations Charter which prescribes that states . . .</P>
    <P>shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state.</P>
    <P>Nonetheless, what is important now is to achieve at the earliest possible time the return of democratic government to the island and the withdrawal of foreign forces.  In this connection, I am glad to note from the UN Secretary-General's recent report on conditions in Grenada that it is intended to proceed to elections in which all political parties will be able to participate and that the United States have indicated their intention to withdraw from the island.</P>
    <P>That, then, is a sketch of the major developments in the Community for the last six months of 1982.  I have also made reference to important issues which have arisen since that time.  If Deputies have questions to put on any of the aspects touched on in my statement, or indeed any issues of Community interest, I will be glad to try to respond at the earliest opportunity.</P>
    <P>As a commentary on the events I have outlined, I would suggest that the Community has now reached the crunch and has been forced to face the issues which <Col N="2147" /> will decide its future.  In playing its part in this self-examination.  Ireland, together with other member states who value what the Community stands for and could stand for, has tried to have attention focussed on the positive elements which could emerge from this critical review.  The opportunity exists for the Community to decide whether it wants to develop as a re-invigorated force on the world scene or whether it prefers to become a club whose members pay in so much for a range of limited services rendered.</P>
    <P>Of course it is not easy for any one in a time of recession to commit himself to a vision which may seem to be hopelessly out of touch with current realities.  But the institutions and each member state of the Community have a duty to defend the vision contained in the Treaties.  It could be said cynically that Ireland need only have narrow self-interest at heart to mount any defence of the Treaties.  It is certainly true that we would deny anyone the right to alter radically the terms upon which we entered the Community.  However, I think that we in this country would go further.  We maintain that no one has a right to call a halt to the ideal which motivated the founders of the Community. In pressing our own legitimate interests we see no conflict in pursuing that ideal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for giving the House an opportunity this afternoon of discussing what I consider to be one of the most important aspects of our business in this Parliament.  At the outset, I regret that there are only three people present out of the 167 or 168 Members.  The issue deserves far greater attention than it is getting, but I am not blaming the Minister for that.  I believe that there is an obligation and duty on us in this House to create a greater interest in the Common Market and in its workings than it has received up to now.  I am not blaming the Minister, or his Minister for Foreign Affairs, for that matter.  We should be doing more to help people understand our problems as they relate to Europe.  It is almost three years since <Col N="2148" /> our Joint Committee on EEC Legislation met and I respectfully ask the Minister of State to appeal to the Minister to get the Committee operating.  It is a very important Committee and I am aware that many Members are anxious that it commence work immediately.  Whether we like it or not a lot of our everyday life is tied up with Europe and we had better come to grips with our European problems and be in a better position to defend our situation as we must in Europe.</P>
      <P>The golden rule I learned in this area of parliamentary life is that Europe does not owe us anything.  We should remember that.  In the past too many of us have held a view that Europe owes us something. It does not and we must be present to defend our interests strongly and well. The standing of the European Parliament, the Commission, the meetings of the Heads of State and of the Council of Foreign Ministers does not rate high with ordinary citizens here.  There is a serious obligation on us to do something about that.  It does not help the image of Europe when we see, as we did in recent weeks, the President of the Commission, Mr. Gaston Thorn, in Athens publicly rebuking the Agriculture Commissioner, Mr. Dalsager, for statements he made to the effect that certain payments under the agricultural vote were to be suspended until the end of the year.  It does not help that Commissioner Thorn, within a short time, had to say that these payments were not being suspended until the end of the year as Commissioner Dalsager had said but for a number of days.  It does not help the Commission, or the concept of Europe, to see on television the British Finance Commissioner, Mr. Tugendhat, being accused of cooking the books.  The President of the Commission, Mr. Thorn, said that a new system would be in operation for the determination of moneys to be paid by way of refund to the British. The implication was that he brought out these new proposals without consulting Commissioner Tugendhat.  If that is so, it is wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If I were President of the Commission I would like to think that I could sit down with the other Commissioners and discuss the problems with regard to budgetary <Col N="2149" /> matters which are causing serious problems.  I would like to think that if I had a public statement to make with regard to changes in the determination of refunds to the British I would be making it with the support of the other Commissioners, particularly the Finance Commissioner.</P>
    <P>What has happened in recent weeks does not help the attitude that exists towards Europe.  It is wrong that our national newspapers a short time ago should carry photographs of President Thorn with a caption to the effect that he was angered that the Irish people were not prepared to accept the Commission's proposals on the super-levy.  I do not know if that was his view but it is wrong that such an impression should be given. I am sure the journalist who put that piece together got that impression in the corridors of the offices in Brussels.  That is not Commissioner Thorn's job.  It is not for me to outline what I see as his role but that is not his role.  The matters I have mentioned tend to undermine the confidence of our people in the European Commission.</P>
    <P>It is no secret that the meetings of Heads of State are turning out to be a series of going-nowhere meetings.  Little progress is made at those meetings and although communiqués are issued after them we do not hear of any solutions to the problems that exist in member states. We have not had anything from Stuttgart to help us with regard to our unemployment problem.  We seem to be stumbling from one series of Summit meetings to another and little worthwhile coming from them.  While I was Minister for Foreign Affairs I was perturbed at the inability of the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs to make decisions.  I am glad the Minister of State is nodding his head in agreement with me.  I cannot be blamed for what happened at those meetings and my successor cannot, but what I have stated is an indication of the condition of the Community at present.</P>
    <P>We would be doing the Community a service if we adopted a suggestion I made some time ago, that the Minister come to the House on a monthly basis for a limited period of time to discuss European <Col N="2150" /> Affairs in an effort to widen interest in what is going on in Europe.  Probably the most important thing to come from Europe and hit us fair and square between the two eyes is the super-levy but we have not had a discussion here on that levy.  This represents the greatest crisis to confront us since we joined the Community but our Parliament have not had an opportunity to discuss the implications of the super-levy or the consequences for the nation.  The dairy industry will not be the only sector to be affected.  It is wrong and unwise of the Government not to give Government time, as requested on a number of occasions by our Leader, to discuss this important matter.</P>
    <P>We are not doing anything to help the Community and the Community and the Commissioners are not doing much to help themselves.  Two weeks ago I attended a session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg and heard a debate about Commissioner Dalsager's statement in Athens about the suspension of payments.  I heard Irish MEPs from all sides making valuable contributions to the debate.  They asked questions that merited answers but Commissioner Dalsager refused to answer them.  He read for three or four minutes from a prepared script but the content of it did not have any relevance to the questions raised by all groups in the Parliament.  When he concluded he gathered his papers and walked out.  If that is the way the Commission treat the Parliament it is difficult for us to hope that our people would have a high regard for the Parliament or the Commission.</P>
    <P>A lot of work has to be done to restore faith and confidence in the Parliament and the other institutions of the Community. A lot of ground has to be made up.  I was shocked to see in today's issue of <i>The Irish Times</i> a report from the meeting of Foreign Ministers in Athens yesterday of the British Foreign Minister, Sir Geoffrey Howe, saying there would not be decisions on any matter until Britain got her budget rebate.  I am not anti-British but if that is the attitude of Her Majesty's Government it is the death knell for the Community as we know it. <Col N="2151" /> other matters were agreed.  These kinds of Probably the greatest mistake made was that we adopted the attitude of every man for himself.  Certainly that is the attitude of the British in recent times, with Mrs. Thatcher at the meetings of Heads of State hammering the desk looking for her money back, looking for a fair return. The European Community is in a serious crisis.  If they could see the Community now I am sure the founding fathers would feel sorrow for the way we have come since the earlier days.  Article I of the Treaty of Rome states:</P>
    <P>The Community shall have as its task establishing a Common Market and progressively approximating the economic policies of member states to promote throughout the Community a harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, an increase in stability, an accelerated raising of the standard of living and closer relations between the States belonging to it.</P>
    <P>Somebody should send a copy of that Article to Sir Geoffrey Howe, the British Foreign Minister, and explain to him what is meant by it.  I do not know how he can reconcile that with his attitude as reported in today's <i>Irish Times</i> of a meeting of Foreign Ministers and Finance Ministers in Athens.  I remember in May 1982 the difficult time we had at meetings of Foreign Ministers to get agreement on certain matters.  At the same time, the then Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, was having extreme difficulty in getting agreement on farm prices.  It was known to all of us that there would not be any agreement on farm prices until other matters were agreed.  This kind of blackmail and heavy-handed tactics are not written into the Treaty of Rome. There has to be very plain talking by Heads of State in Athens to clear the lines for the future.  The EEC is going nowhere at the moment.  I agree totally with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Keeffe, that it is in our interests that Europe be strong, healthy and thriving. We have an important role to see this is the case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2152" /> It does not help to see public squabbling at Commission level, to see summit meetings one after the other result in failure.  Certainly it does not help to see the way individual members of the Commission treat the parliamentarians in the European Parliament.  We know that Parliament does not have great powers. I should like a long time to discuss the Spinelli Report with the Minister of State because there would be a lot of common ground between us.  If the European Parliament is to be a parliament in the way it was intended &mdash; not in the way our Parliament is seen &mdash; I should like to see more respect for it by the Commission. On the day after Commissioner Dalsager walked from the Parliament without answering any questions, the pressure was so great from the Parliament &mdash; one of our members was very active in this matter with some others &mdash; that another Commissioner had to stand in for Commissioner Dalsager and answer the questions he refused to answer the evening before.  Things should not happen like that.</P>
    <P>In the short time before 5 o'clock I have some comments to make and will leave other matters for another time.  I did not believe that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Government would do something which I think was very unwise, short-sighted and foolish.  I am referring to the situation where Irish members of the Council of Europe have had to withdraw from active membership of the Council of Europe.  That is a shame.  The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has been a member of the delegation to the Council, as have Deputy Andrews, myself and others.  Because a sum of £10,000 was needed to cover their active participation in membership of the Council of Europe until budget time in January and because that money was not forthcoming by the Government, they have scrapped the whole business.  I hope that at this late stage something will be done about the matter.</P>
    <P>I should hate to think the other 21 States in the Council would look on Ireland as a country who withdraw from the Council for the sake of £10,000.  The valuable work of many of our members in <Col N="2153" /> the various committees in which they are involved has been thwarted because of that £10,000.  Deputy Andrews was to go to Paris last Monday and there was every likelihood he would be elected chairman of a committee that was important for this country but he was told he could not go because the cupboard was bare.  Last week or the week before in reply to a question by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald it was stated that a sum of £85,000 or £88,000 was listed for special staff in the office of the Minister for Labour.  The Minister for Labour is quite right to have all the staff he needs but it is a sad state for this little country that for the sake of £10,000 we have had to cancel our active participation in the Council of Europe.  It is unfair to the Council of which we have been a member since 1949.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Taoiseach, through the Minister of State, to do something immediately to impress on the Heads of State the serious situation here with regard to the super-levy.  The Taoiseach has already met two Heads of State, Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Papandreou, but from what we have learned it is obvious that the visits have not been successful from the point of view of the super-levy.  I urge the Minister to visit Heads of State and explain our situation.  It is obvious he had not succeeded in getting any help from Mrs. Thatcher on the question of the super-levy if the reported statements of Sir Geoffrey Howe are correct and it is obvious the Taoiseach did not get the help he thought he had obtained from the Minister of State in the Greek Foreign Office, Mr. Gregoris Varsis.  If he had got that help there would have been a much better Greek effort by way of a proposal to help us than we got in the past few days.  If I might borrow a phrase from the Taoiseach, there is a great obligation on him to use his acquaintanceship with his influential friends in Europe, something we have been hearing about for a long time.  We would like to see how influential his European friends are when it comes to giving us some help on the super-levy.  The Taoiseach will be in Athens on 3 and 4 December but as of now he has met only two Heads of State.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair for having allowed me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  We endeavoured to have the matter raised during the week but you had a number of other requests.  Deputies Gene Fitzgerald, Harney, Lenihan and Lemass tried to have a Private Notice Question on the Clondalkin Paper Mills today but for your own reasons you saw fit to refuse the request.</P>
      <P>This matter has been raised many times in the House and I feel sad that I have to raise it now, because this week members of the former staff of the mills went on hunger strike.  I should like to make their position clear because some hard words have been spoken about those men which were entirely unfair.  Those men have gone about their campaign in a fair and reasonable way and it is unfair that they should have been classed as irresponsible, unreasonable people, as political maniacs.</P>
      <P>When the mills were closed, a committee acting on behalf of the workers showed genuine interest and deep concern regarding the future of the industry. Much has been said and written about the mills.  Promises were made and many commitments were given.  The Minister for Energy is here this evening, but on the last occasion the matter was raised Deputy Collins, the Minister of State, when replying said Fianna Fáil had given a commitment prior to the 1982 general election but that it had been left to the Coalition Government, who came into office last November, to purchase the paper mills.  Such statements are now immaterial.  The paper mills are in the hands of the Government, in the ownership of the Government, and the only question that remains is whether the Government are prepared, or have the capacity or the will to re-open Clondalkin Paper Mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to the general election last year commitments were given by Fine Gael candidates and in writing by their agents. Similar commitments were given &mdash; I do not know if any written commitments were given &mdash; by the Labour Party: the <Col N="2155" /> Leader of the Labour Party gave a commitment that the paper mills would be reopened.  As I have said, the mills are now in the hands and the ownership of the Government.  What will they do about it?</P>
    <P>We have been told from time to time that the mills can be reopened only if some suitable client comes along, when the mills can be made a viable unit.  Questions have been asked in the Dáil about the money being spent on the importation of paper, and from the figures given it must be clear to everyone that the Clondalkin mills can be a viable industry. In the past it was a powerful industry.  If that could be so in the past, what is to prevent the mills from being a viable unit in the future?  I make a special appeal to the Minister to reopen the mills because it is important for the sake of Clondalkin and very important for the country as a whole.</P>
    <P>I have great admiration for Deputy Taylor as a constituency colleague &mdash; it is a pleasure to work with him &mdash; and I will recall for him and for Deputy Mac Giolla &mdash; unfortunately Deputy Skelly is not here &mdash; a meeting held in June 1982, when Fianna Fáil were in office.  The meeting was held on a Monday in Clondalkin Community Centre.  As a Fianna Fáil Deputy for the constituency I had to listen to very hard words about why the mills had not been re-opened from the time Fianna Fáil had taken office the previous February.  I recall Deputy Taylor making a statement that night that if the Government had made a commitment prior to the election they had a duty to honour it.  I can recall Deputy Skelly, straight from his victory in the Dublin West by-election, waving a beautiful file in front of him and saying: &ldquo;My vote in the Dublin West by-election must be taken as the voice of the people of Dublin West in opposition to the Government for not honouring their commitment&rdquo;. Deputy Skelly went on to say: &ldquo;I am the person to keep the pressure on the Government to have Clondalkin Paper Mills re-opened&rdquo;.  Where is he this evening? Now is the time to keep the pressure <Col N="2156" /> on.  He has a duty, as a Deputy in the majority party in the Government, to ensure that the mills will be re-opened.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that the Clondalkin workers have had to go on hunger strike, or have seen fit to do so.  It is a sad situation.  Following the last general election a Government commitment was given to the Congress of Trade Unions that any commitment by Fianna Fáil would be honoured by the incoming Government, and I now appeal to the Minister to look at the situation in the interests of everybody concerned.  As I have said, if the mills were viable in the past they can be made viable in the future.</P>
    <P>We learn from reports in the newspapers and on the radio today that a meeting was held with the former workers yesterday which ended without a result.  I say to the Minister that it is not too late to re-open these discussions and I make a special appeal to him in the interests of everybody concerned that these premises be re-opened for paper making.  All the skills and experience of the members of the former staff in Clondalkin can be utilised for that end.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy Walsh for allowing me a few moments to contribute. If I can finish my remarks in time I will allow other Deputies from my constituency to speak.  Last week we discussed the need for Deputies to be given an increase in their salaries and in the meantime it has been very difficult to explain the reason for it.  It will be very difficult now to explain to our constituents why prior to elections commitments are given which are not worth the paper they were written on.  The electorate want honesty in their politicians.  They want the truth to be told in time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year the Government and the Minister now in the House gave a commitment to buy the Clondalkin plant but they did not give a commitment to re-open it.  I do not want to get into an argument, but to my knowledge a sum of £1.75 million was paid for the plant and a decision made to leave it there.  What kind of sense does that make?  What kind of Government have we got if they continue <Col N="2157" /> to spend money in this irresponsible way?  I have no doubt, and neither have the workers of Clondalkin or the community in general, that when that commitment was given it was a commitment to re-open the paper mills.  It is not my word alone which should be taken for it. The Minister for the Environment, in a letter to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions last February said:</P>
    <P>I am sure you are pleased that, following my intervention and the intervention of the Labour Party, the discussions in relation to the Clondalkin Ppaer Mills have now been brought to a satisfactory end.</P>
    <P>A satisfactory end is not simply buying the plant; it is to begin production and to have the workers back at work.  It is highly irresponsible of the Government, particularly the Minister for Industry and Energy, to try to pretend that the commitment given was nothing more than to buy a plant.  That is not what the Irish Congress of Trade Unions understood or, indeed, the workers or, obviously, the Minister for the Environment understood.</P>
    <P>I am very sad that three young men with young families have decided to go on hunger strike.  I do not support the idea of hunger strike and I am sorry they are on it.  For their sakes I hope they come off it because they will do irreperable damage to their health.  I can fully understand, from working with those people over the last two years, the dilemma they find themselves in.  They are beginning to wonder if the word of any politician is worth anything anymore. They would have preferred to be told two years ago that the mills would not open rather than to be kept on a string all this time.  It is almost two years since approximately 400 people were put out of their jobs in Clondalkin.  My party defended the need for a paper making industry in Clondalkin, not because we want to support white elephants or lame ducks but because we saw that paper making in Ireland, a small island country, is a very strategic industry which can and should be viable.</P>
    <P>I consider the behaviour of the Minister <Col N="2158" /> and the Government an absolute disgrace. On the one hand they say &ldquo;We bought the plant but we will only open it if it is viable&rdquo;.  On the other hand they tell us that it cannot be viable, that it only has a 20 per cent chance, after spending £8 million, of being viable.  It is either viable or it is not viable.  There is no such thing as &ldquo;It might be viable and we will only buy it if it is viable&rdquo;.  That kind of use of words does not mean anything and is very dishonest.  I would prefer the Minister to tell the workers the truth now rather than to pretend that the Government are serious about these negotiations.</P>
    <P>Several thousand pound of taxpayers' money has been lost to the Exchequer in the form of PRSI contributions from the workers and the amount of unemployment benefit and redundancy payments which these people have received from the Exchequer.  I have not got the figures but I hope to have them for the debate next week.  Vast sums of money have also been spent, with the IDA trotting all over the world trying to find a buyer.  If we are not serious about our commitment to the workers of Clondalkin let the IDA stop spending money trotting around the globe, to Canada one week and England the next, in so-called negotiations with serious people who are interested in the paper-making industry.  That is not the way a Government should operate and it is not the way the people of Clondalkin want to see the Clondalkin Paper Mills issue being handled.</P>
    <P>The commitment was clear.  It was to buy the plant and begin production and 200 people were to have their jobs back. I, together with my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, want the Minister and the Government to honour that commitment and to stand up honestly and say that they did not simply buy a plant in order to keep some people happy.  Did the Government buy it in order to keep the Labour Party happy and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions happy?  If they did I doubt if the Congress will ever be happy with any commitments from this Government again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to my constituency <Col N="2159" /> colleagues for allowing me time to say a few brief words on this, although the first thing I have to do is to point out that condemnation of the Government on this issue should not be confined to this Government.  It has to be pointed out that the previous Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Reynolds, gave a commitment at a meeting at which I was present, which he followed up by a written comitment, to have this mill re-opened by 9 June 1982.  He was then Minister for Industry and Energy and 9 June 1982 came and went.  July, August, September, October and November came and went and he was still Minister for Industry and Energy.  The Fianna Fáil Government were in power all that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Deputy take his medicine when it comes to him?  Fianna Fáil had until November 1982, while they were in Government, to re-open the Clondalkin Paper Mills but they failed to do so.</P>
      <P>Having said that, I want to add my words in support of my constituency colleagues in urging the Minister who now has the power and has control of this issue to ensure that the Clondalkin Paper Mills is re-opened.  I believe that in the national context it is a viable project and that it is inappropriate to look at this issue in the narrow confines of one company. The only thing that has made paper-making in this country non-viable, if that is what it is, is the policy of having our energy costs the highest in Europe. Paper making is quite viable in Germany, Norway, Canada and other countries.  It can be equally viable here if the conditions which apply in other countries are applied here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that a firm of Canadian businessmen are prepared to sink £1 million of their money into this project.  They are not casual speculators.  I understand that those people are paper people and are in the paper business.  They know the paper business.  Surely if they are prepared to put £1 million of their money into this <Col N="2160" /> they know what they are about.  There must be a future in it and they must have a proposal that can prove viable, that can produced profits for them and for the Government, who are a participating partner in it.  It would produce paper for the country that would save us imports and give us an improvement in the foreign exchange situation.  When all the factors are taken into acount, the national issue, the use of energy we have and the workers to do it, it would be a crying shame if this fine industry was let go.  If it goes this time I believe we will never again have paper-making capacity here.  I beseech the Minister and the Government, with all the eloquence of my command, to get that mill opened one way or the other as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my voice to what other Deputies have said and I want to emphasise the point that Deputy Walsh made at the beginning in regard to the people involved.  They are a most highly responsible group of people &mdash; I am sure Deputies of all parties who have met them will agree with that &mdash; and they have a deep interest in their jobs and their capacity to do this job.  This extends from middle management through all grades of workers in the area.  They are only taking this action out of desperation.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to look at the potential viability of this mill, not in the context of whether some other company find it viable but in the context of its viability from his Department's point of view, now that he owns it, on a two-machine basis, which was proposed already.  We should do this in view of the fact that every piece of paper we have in this House is imported paper which could be made in Clondalkin. I suggest that the Minister contact the Minister for Transport and suggest to him that he close down Knock Airport and opens Clondalkin Paper Mills.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as Clondalkin Paper Mills are concerned, I wish to stress that I have been and am most anxious to ensure that the mill would be reopened on a viable basis for papermaking.  This was the reason for taking the unprecedented <Col N="2161" /> step of buying the mills.  If the mills had been left in the hands of the receiver, they probably would not have been available for papermaking.  Hence the justification for the unprecedented step of spending £1.75 million by the Government to purchase the mills.  It is highly unusual that the premises of a firm that had gone out of production or was unable to continue would be purchased by the Government and that step was only taken because the Government were and are anxious to have papermaking restarted in Clondalkin on a viable basis.</P>
      <P>Since the Government acquired the mills, the IDA have been very active in seeking promoters who would set up a viable papermaking business there.  Some 120 firms throughout the world were contacted by the IDA in the period since then.  Three site visits emerged from this series of contacts.  One proposal was considered in detail by the IDA and negotiations are continuing with the promoters of that proposal on a revised basis.  Another approach has been made to me in recent days and the IDA, at my request, are examing that matter as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>The Government are prepared to work to the maximum extent possible to have a viable papermaking business reopened in Clondalkin but they cannot be forced into putting taxpayers' money at risk in a project which does not have a reasonable prospect of viability.  Indeed, the interests of the workers themselves would not be served by the establishment of a project that was unlikely to be viable, because the resultant employment would be short-term and unreliable.</P>
      <P>Deputy Walsh said that it was never too late to reopen negotiations and I agree with him.  In fact, negotiations are continuing on a very active basis &mdash; and I am keeping in touch daily &mdash; with the two promoters whose interests in the matter are active at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Harney suggested that I considered that papermaking in Clondalkin had only a 20 per cent chance of viability. That is not the case.  The independent consultants hired by the IDA considered that a particular project which they were considering had only a 20 per cent chance <Col N="2162" /> of viability and they are pursuing a proposal with those promoters on a revised basis with a view, it is hoped, to securing a project which would have a much better chance of viability.  Indeed the IDA would not be travelling around the world, to Canada in particular, in pursuit of this matter if there was not a very strong anxiety on behalf both of the IDA and the Government to have papermaking restarted in Clondalkin on a viable basis.</P>
    <P>However, I wish to deny statements made by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that there was a commitment by me on behalf of the Government to the reopening of Clondalkin Paper Mills regardless of commercial viability.  The Congress bases this allegation of an unconditional commitment on the following statement in their press release of 26 October last:</P>
    <P>At the conclusion of the meeting with the Minister at about 2 a.m. on the 8th February, 1983, the Congress General Secretary summed up the agreement reached with the Minister and confirmed that the commitment extended not only to the purchase of the mills but also to the commitment entered into by its predecessor by letter of 16th November, 1982.</P>
    <P>The material facts in regard to this allegation are as follows.  I was not at the meeting in question at 2 a.m. on 8 February and hence could not have given the commitment which Congress say I gave. I did attend a meeting with members of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 7 February at about 7.30 p.m.  This was before the Government meeting to decide the matter finally had taken place and, at that meeting, I gave no commitment that the Government decision to be taken would go beyond the purchase of the mills.  I did not meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions after the Government decision to purchase the assets on either the 7 or 8 February.  All meetings, after agreement had been reached, were conducted by officials on 8 February.  I say this having carefully checked the documentary evidence in the Department in regard to this matter.  As I have said, the only meeting I have had with the Congress <Col N="2163" /> of Trade Unions was on the evening of 7 February prior to any agreement being reached.</P>
    <P>I have carefully studied the contemporary official minutes of that meeting. No commitment of the kind suggested by Congress was made by me at that meeting. In fact, I specifically raised the question of the economics of the mill.  A representative of the Congress of Trade Unions is recorded as saying that he did not wish to discuss the economics at that stage.</P>
    <P>Towards the conclusion of the meeting, I am also recorded as having said that hard decisions would have to be taken in the future about Clondalkin if the mill premises were to be acquired. This clearly implied that there was no automatic progress to reopening the mill, regardless of other factors.  In regard to the meeting at 2 a.m., not attended by me but by officials, I have checked with the officials concerned and they have assured me &mdash; and I fully accept their assurance &mdash; that no commitment of the kind claimed by Congress was given by them at that meeting either.  In fact, official minutes show that at a subsequent meeting at 1 p.m. on 8 February, when the precise terms of the press announcement were being drafted, Congress pressed to have included in the press announcement a commitment in relation to the reopening of the mill.  This was resisted by the official side and the press statement was issued without any such commitment being included.  This can be seen from the text of the press statement.</P>
    <P>Congress seek to rely on the fact that the commitments of the previous Government were mentioned in the press release and during the discussions as somehow suggesting that these commitments were all accepted by the present Government.  There is no foundation for this, either in the proceedings of the meetings in question or in the press release issued subsequently and agreed by Congress.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2164" /> The relevant passage from the press release is as follows:</P>
    <P>The Government have considered the commitments given by the previous Government to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in regard to Clondalkin Paper Mills, and the consequent industrial relations aspects of the situation as represented to the Government by Congress.  In view of this, the Government have confirmed the previous Government's decision to purchase the mill for £1.75m with vacant possession.</P>
    <P>This clearly shows that the Government, in deciding to purchase the mill, were going no further than that.  It also shows that the commitment of the previous Government was but one of the factors considered in that decision.  The other factor was the industrial relations situation.</P>
    <P>I am putting these points on record so that no one will be in any doubt where this Government stand in regard to commitments in this matter.  It would be entirely wrong for anyone to take a course of action based on a false perception of what the Government actually committed themselves to.  Those who propagate a false impression of what the Government were actually committed to contribute to a worsening of the situation.</P>
    <P>I wish to stress that I am and will continue to be most anxious to ensure that the mill will be reopened on a viable basis and I am bending all my efforts, in conjunction with the IDA and in consultation with those promoters who have contacted me recently, to ensure that a viable papermaking operation can be reopened in Clondalkin.  These efforts will continue one way or the other, regardless of pressure from any quarter.  We will not be pushed one way or the other by pressure of any kind.  It is our intention to seek to have a viable papermaking operation established in Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 15 November 1983.</P>
