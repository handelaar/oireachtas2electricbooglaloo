    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1983. - Vote 41: Transport (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £10 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Transport, including certain services administered by that Office, for a cost alleviation payment and for payment of certain grants and a grant-in-aid. </P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister for Transport.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has an enormous responsibility and a difficult task facing him.  The transport business is worth about £2,000 million, equal to about 16 per cent of GNP, but because of the lack of attention given to the industry in the past it has become the Cinderella of our economy.  For example, public investment has been only about 1 per cent of GNP, far less than has been the case in the area of telecommunications <Col N="1081" /> and other vital services.  This neglect will have to be reversed during the coming years.</P>
      <P>The most important thing that has held back transport in the past few years is that it has been bedevilled by a complete lack of decision-making.  There have been a number of reports in the past ten years outlining the need for reform in various areas.  One was the road freight report which highlighted the restrictions on road freight and the extent to which that was increasing the cost to industry with regard to transport of goods.  One figure quoted was 25 per cent extra cost in Ireland compared with other countries and part of that at least is due to road freight restrictions.  This report had been acted on in part but all the recommendations have not been implemented.</P>
      <P>There have been many studies of CIE and it is regrettable that none of the major recommendations in this area has been acted on.  The Transport Consultative Commission reported on the need to set up a Dublin Transport Authority but despite numerous gestures by Ministers that this was to be done, three years after publication of the report the necessary measures have not been put before this House.  Perhaps the greatest debacle of all was the much-vaunted £1,000 million road plan in 1980.  That plan is in shreds and few of the proposals have been implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We do not have far to go to see why these numerous reports have been left on shelves gathering dust.  The reason is that responsibility in the area of transport has been scattered throughout different Departments and authorities.  In the case of roads, the responsibility lies with local authorities throughout the country and with the Department of the Environment. I believe the Department of the Environment and the local authorities would freely admit that their prime responsibility is for housing and their secondary responsibility, from my experience in local authorities, is concern for employment and a greater emphasis on the need to have maintenance programmes going ahead rather than the major structual changes needed to improve our transport system.  I cannot <Col N="1082" /> see that continuing to leave such a large area of responsibility in a Department whose primary responsibility does not rest in the transport area, is a good decision. This will have to be examined during the next few years.</P>
    <P>We have responsibility for public transport scattered among a number of semi-State bodies, CIE, Aer Lingus and so on. The Government have been a reluctant paymaster for those bodies in many cases but I do not believe the Government have seriously got to grips with the policy decisions, the public transport options, which must be examined if we are to have proper development of public transport. They have reluctantly approved proposals coming from those bodies but they have not moved in and decided on the policy options.  That failure has been highlighted in a number of reports, particularly reports by the NESC and McKinsey, when they examined our public transport.  They criticised the Department of Transport for being unable or unwilling to go in and make the policy decisions needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Unable under the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a question of law reform.  The question of traffic management is equally scattered.  We have the Garda, the Department of Justice, the local authorities and the Department of Transport taking some responsibility in those areas.  The scattering of responsibility must be responsible for the slowness in coming to grips with the type of changes in traffic management that have been proposed over the years.  The implications of this failure to take decisions are serious.  Things are being delayed and we also have decisions made which cannot be made in unison.  If development in the area of roads and development in the area of rail are scattered between different authorities I cannot but believe that some investment decisions are made that are inconsistent in many ways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe competing investments must be assessed together and in the same way. Any conflict between them should be resolved before large sums of public money are devoted to them.  It is particularly <Col N="1083" /> welcome that we have a Minister and a Minister of State in this Department who have a reputation for couragous decision-making and an appetite for work.  I believe their efforts will be richly rewarded in this Department over the coming years.</P>
    <P>I would like to deal with some specific areas in public transport.  I believe Dublin city has suffered from the failure to bring in the Dublin Transport Authority sooner.  When the Transport Consultative Commission reported in March 1980 they suggested a timetable of legislation within six months and a short-term traffic management strategy to be carried out within three years.  We have not yet seen the legislation and the short-term traffic management strategy has only been started.  This is important because the Transport Consultative Commission pointed out that they believed the Dublin Transport Authority would immediately implement low cost improvements which could improve the traffic flow in Dublin and also that they would introduce a system of evaluating competing claims of road, bus and rail on public money.  The delay in bringing forward those low cost improvements and proposals to evaluate investment cannot but be a case of counting pennies but flaunting the millions. The pennies that would have been devoted to the proposals of the Dublin Transport Authority have not gone ahead but the millions in investment continue to roll on in the various sectors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That was with the draftsman a long while ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt it was, but we have not seen anything in this House yet.  When the Transport Consultative Commission drew up their report they drew attention to the importance of bringing in the Dublin Transport Authority. They cited the scattered responsibility and the way it was delaying effective decision-making in the transport area. They gave one example, which was very striking at the time, the attempt to bring the bus lane into Parliament Street.  They cited the fact that 11 different bodies had <Col N="1084" /> to be consulted.  The process of consultation meant that the time that elapsed between initiation of the proposals and their final implementation was two years. The fact that the decision makers still must refer to those 11 bodies in some way and that they can only work more speedily by a system of coaxing and co-operation is bound to hold back progress in this area.  It is also precluding the establishment of real expertise in the transport area by the Dublin Transport Authority, which ought now to have been set up.</P>
      <P>Another problem which has arisen, because of the failure to bring in the Dublin Transport Authority, is that many of the more novel ideas proposed by the Transport Consultative Commission have had to be left on the shelf.  It is welcome to see that the bus lane proposal has gone ahead.  There is significant improvement in the traffic flow as a result.  Other proposals have not been implemented, such as off-peak delivery, car pooling, better school transport scheduling, more flexiblity in the time of opening of businesses and schools, suggestions in relation to pedestrian and cycle policies, proposals in relation to a more effective parking policy for the city &mdash; a traffic warden system with more than just the function of putting parking fine notices on vehicles but also with some control responsibility so that they would be able, in the event of traffic jams, cars creating an obstruction, to direct people to remove them.  Those sort of proposals have not gone ahead because they needed more than just willingness to put them through.  They needed legislative authority to push them through and, as a result, they have fallen behind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Transport Task Force have not begun to look at the investment options, which were to be one of the first responsibilities of the Dublin Transport Authority. It may be said that no major decisions in the area of transport have been made in the last few years.  I do not believe that answers the criticism entirely because there is no doubt that routine spending goes on or, if it does not, certain services are being chopped off.  If services are chopped off, or some investment decisions go ahead without reference to the <Col N="1085" /> wider economic value of those services, inevitably some of the money will go astray.</P>
    <P>If the money is short and decisions are postponed perhaps sometimes the wrong decisions are postponed, and here I believe that there has been a significant loss by virtue of failure to have an evaluation authority.  A matter that springs to mind that would affect my constituency is the fact that the proposal to have feeder services to the suburban railway lines has not been implemented.  If large sums of money are being spent and have been spent on a rapid suburban rail service it is only logical that the far cheaper feeder services from the centres of population should have been in place to match that investment.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister said in his speech at the opening of this discussion that the CIE subsidy would in future be given on the above-the-line basis &mdash; in other words, CIE would not be in the continuous situation of having a deficit and the Government coming in and picking up the deficit.  That is bad for management procedure in the company and has brought undue criticism on CIE for appearing to make losses and costing the taxpayer more than necessary.  Those criticisms may or may not be justified, but that form of presentation is bound to bring public criticism on CIE.</P>
    <P>However, it will not be enough merely to switch what is essentially a block grant from the bottom of the line to just above the line.  The Government must go further than just accepting the idea that CIE should apply for a block amount of money, receive that at the beginning of the year and allow it to go above the line. The decision as to the level of that grant must be based on some sort of microknowledge of the various services involved.  CIE have itemised the deficit into rail and bus and various major services, but if we are to make rational decisions about how much should be given to CIE as a subsidy we must look at it per route and per service and go into considerably more desegregation than exists at present.  I cannot see that subsidies towards road freight should be dealt with in the same breath as subsidies <Col N="1086" /> towards transport for the elderly.  We should set out clear-cut criteria on which we will give subsidies to CIE and, therefore, know what we are paying for and let CIE live within those guidelines.  The Minister must go beyond the idea of simply shifting the subsidy to above the line. If the Government feel that such microinterference or examination of CIE's runnings&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They cannot do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;is too difficult or should not be brought in, a possible alternative is to ask CIE to work within a criterion such as, for example, in the case of passenger services they would be under a certain budget constraint and they would be asked to maximise the number of passenger miles within that budget constraint.  I understand that such criteria have been given to transport authorities in the UK and have met with some success.  If the detailed examination of CIE's books, which I would favour, does not meet with Government approval, perhaps that option would be investigated instead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It probably would meet with Government approval but would CIE approve?  This is the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is also a greater need for a Government role in other areas of CIE operations.  The NESC have proposed that the five-year rolling corporate plans be brought in for CIE. Under these plans they would set out their objectives which would be monitored. They would set out their investment plans and management would have explicit responsibility for bad investment decisions.  Probably the problem has dogged many areas of semi-State activity where notably bad decisions have been made in the past few years, but it seems at the end of the day that nobody is specifically responsible for the overruns of spending or for what materialises as bad market projections and so on.  We must bring into our semi-State bodies &mdash; particularly in the transport area because of its importance to the economy &mdash; more <Col N="1087" /> responsibility for the investment decisions.</P>
      <P>In passing, I must say I was disappointed that when I went to the Library to review CIE matters the last account I could find was for 1979 and it seems that in 1983 CIE have not yet come up with their 1980 accounts.  It is bad that the accounts of a semi-State body responsible for such enormous sums of money have not been presented to the House at this stage.</P>
      <P>In the context of five-year plans such as I have mentioned, in recent years the only sort of planning seems to have been a mass of all-or-nothing proposals.  The idea of rapid rail was brought forward as an all-or-nothing proposal presented to the Government.  It would be better to have a more detailed investment programme showing the more minor decisions and the justification for them also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rural bus services are another area where a strong need for reform exists.  It has been pointed out on a number of occasions in this House that the school transport system as it operates at present is designed to be probably as expensive as it could be.  In many cases the school buses are used for nothing other than the transport of children to school.  The charges made to the Department of Education are exceptionally high.  A 10 per cent fee is payable to CIE when they subcontract the services and also a 4 per cent profit margin is given to CIE when they supply those services directly.  That sort of system of charging and the fact that the school buses are used for nothing but school transport cannot but add to the cost of this service.  Part of the reason for the unpopular decision that had to be made earlier this year of cutting back the number of children covered by those services must be that limited use of the service.  If the school buses were to be integrated into a rural bus service that had more flexibility, and also if there was more private tendering in the area of school transport and in other areas of private transport, we could not but improve the rural transport options.  To a large extent that is occurring without Government intervention.  Very many <Col N="1088" /> private operators have seen the need for a greater flexibility in rural transport and they have moved in on that.  It is regrettable that our public transport company have not been able to exploit those openings profitably.</P>
    <P>I turn to the McKinsey Report publised some time ago.  It is important that the Government take decisions on such reports.  That report has been remembered for its suggestions to break up CIE and also its suggestion of the possibility of closing down the railways entirely. Perhaps it is regrettable that those startling recommendations are the only matters for which the report is remembered, because I believe it also had more important short-term recommendations to improve the effectiveness of CIE and these have probably been forgotten.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It did not recommend closing the railways down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I know.  All I said was it canvassed the possibility of closing them down.  It said it was equally costly to the State to either close them or keep them open without improving them.  The fact that it brought up that possibility deflected public debate into an area that moved attention away from its other recommendations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is worth recording again some of its short-term recommendations.  One was that CIE should end the railway's sundries business and allied freight activities. Another was that they should end the area structure of CIE which largely followed from the sundries business.  It recommended that comparative road costs for pricing in the freight market should be used, so that CIE on their rail activities would not be pricing themselves out of the market.  It recommended the introduciton of the one-man bus operation and that suggestion was endorsed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee when they suggested that a pilot scheme at least should be introduced in the very near future to put that into operation.  The report also recommended a full scale route and frequency review by CIE as soon as bus speed improvements were <Col N="1089" /> under way.  The proposals for bus speed improvements are under way in the city, but we have not yet seen the route frequency review.  It recommmended that the Dublin Transport Authority should decide bus service levels in Dublin and pricing policy and it also recommended bringing into the rural scene more options such as smaller buses, private operators and so on.  All those recommendations are very reasonable, at least on the surface, and they were well supported by evidence in the McKinsey Report.  They deserve greater attention by the Minister in the very near future.</P>
    <P>In the area of railway sundries, in 1979 when McKinsey reported it noted that the railways were losing £40 million and that a very sizeable proportion of that loss at that time stemmed not from passenger services where there are obvious social arguments for subsidy, but even freight was losing a substantial amount of money.  Freight generally was covering only about three-quarters of its operating cost.  There was a loss of about £6 million in the freight service area and the vast bulk came from the railway sundries business. They recommended that closure of the sundries business would save a substantial sum over the years and would not cause great disruption because most of the commercial users had already diversified the vast bulk of their business.  This recommendation is one that should have seen more lively discussion at this stage. At present CIE seem to be advertising an expansion in sundries business to make small deliveries around the country.  If the losses involved are as great as McKinsey suggests, that decision should be very closely scrutinised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will not be put off by very difficult lobbies which will be operating throughout the public transport area.  All the major decisions, such as establishing road authorities, bringing in a more sensible system of management within semi-State bodies and reforming road freight are bound to come up against resistance from powerful groups.  It is important that the Minister gets a very clear idea of the objectives that have to be achieved because I must emphasise again the enormous importance to the <Col N="1090" /> economy of transport.  With 16 per cent of GNP being devoted to it and with so many of our competitive industries dependent on an efficient transport system, we cannot afford to hold back from important decisions purely because they may bring short-term unpopularity.  I warmly welcome the Minister to what I believe will be a very rewarding task.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies for their thoughtful and constructive contributions to the debate and will reply as far as possible to the many points raised. Some of the issues raised during the debate invlove matters of major importance and would require more time and thought than the circumstances of an Estimates debate would allow.  I refer, for example, to the fundamental questions raised by Deputy Wilson as to the conflict between the needs of State bodies to exercise their specialised skills without interference of a political or meddlesome nature and the equal need, in today's altered financial circumstances, for closer monitoring by the State.  This is a matter that I know exercises the minds of Ministers of Transport in other European countries.  I have discussed the matter with them but none of them has so far reconciled the conflict.  It is a matter that concerns me deeply and I will strenuously pursue my efforts to find a balanced and rational answer.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson similarly raised another fundamental question in relation to CIE.  There has, as the Deputy is aware, been increasing acceptance of the view that public moneys must be utilised productively and that results commensurate with costs ought to be achieved. This view is in conflict with the other view, urged with equal force, that special emphasis must be laid on the social role of the public transport system.  It is, again, one of those areas, where there is a basic conflict of philosophies and I will give it, also, serious thought in order to define or redefine if necessary the optimum role of the road and rail services in Ireland in the financial circumstances which face us in the foreseeable future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Cowen expressed concern at <Col N="1091" /> the high level of CIE fares.  I am extremely conscious that CIE fares are high.  It is, however, another way of saying that transport is a very costly service to provide, which of course it is.  The question of fares is, in any event, part of the whole dilemma affecting CIE.  How can we maintain service, how can we keep the subvention in check?  How can we ensure that fares are pitched at the right level to allow people to use the services and indeed to attract users?</P>
    <P>These are the questions to which I am addressing myself in tackling the short, medium and long term problems of CIE and I am hoping for some progress at a reasonably early date.  Meanwhile, Deputies will not overlook that the National Prices Commission maintains a continuous active role in relation to CIE fares.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson advanced some views on forcing people to use the railways.  It is in the national interest that our railways are used to the maximum extent possible and we must encourage and promote the use of that national asset.  I find, however, some contradiction in the Deputy's position because when he turns to road freight he advocates liberalisation.  He is no doubt aware that restrictions imposed on other forms of transport since the thirties were designed to strongly influence the overall position of the railways in the transport sector and many of them at this stage must be judged as having failed in their objective.  If not, the position of the railways would be otherwise. Furthermore, the restrictions hindered the creation of an effective commercial road freight industry.</P>
    <P>There is no point at this stage in thinking in terms of forcing people on to the railways.  That is not to say that the railway has no merits, as it has a valuable contribution to make within the framework of our overall transport needs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson also asked about the use of the Dublin-Belfast railway line for freight transport.  Northern Ireland Railways do not operate a rail freight service and CIE are, therefore, the sole freight carriers on this line.  The board operate a full range of freight services; the present <Col N="1092" /> freight traffic on the line is at least as good as in other sections of the board's network.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne referred to the Limerick Junction-Waterford line.  CIE have considered a reduction in the level of service on this line on a number of occasions in the past few years.  What has been recently considered is the elimination of passenger service only and in the section between Limerick Junction and Waterford only.  I have asked CIE to hold over their consideration until the overall strategy for 1983 is settled and so as to allow local interests to make their case.  If there must be cuts, I will be anxious to ensure that no part of the country has to bear more than its fair share, and that will be my main concern.</P>
    <P>Deputy Durkan mentioned the question of safety on the railway, particularly in relation to the movement of chemicals such as those being carried to Asahi.  I am very conscious of this matter and I can assure the Deputy that strict operating rules are in existence regarding this traffic.  These rules were drawn up by a committee under the aegis of my Department, a committee which included representatives of CIE, industry, the relevant Government Departments and other interested parties.  In addition an accident procedure has been drawn up so that, in the event of any mishap to this traffic, a plan is ready to move into operation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson and Deputy Brennan, and Deputy Bruton just now referred to the McKinsey recommendations on the future of CIE.  As the House will appreciate, when I became Minister for Transport I set about identifying the problems in the sector with a view to determining my priorities.  In the case of CIE, immediate and short-term issues would not keep and had to be dealt with at the expense of longer term issues.  The McKinsey Report is very much part of my programme of work and I will tackle it as soon as possible.  I expect to be making recommendations to the Government within the next few months and, I hope, a decision will be taken on McKinsey during the year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly referred to the value of <Col N="1093" /> a subway system for Dublin.  Deputies will be aware that CIE have proposals for a rapid transit system, including underground connections for the Dublin area. I would remind Deputies that, when the Transport Consultative Commission reported in 1980 on transport in Dublin, they took a very guarded line in relation to rapid transit and suggested that those proposals required very careful evaluation and ranking in order of worth.  This is the correct approach.  I envisage the Dublin Transport Authority, when established, carrying out the necessary evaluations. When these have been completed, the rapid transit issue can be further considered.</P>
    <P>Deputy Séamus Brennan advocated the installation of a busway on a section of the former Harcourt Street-Bray railway line.  Introduction of a busway on the route of the Harcourt Street line was one of the recommendations in the Rapid Transit Study commissioned by CIE.  It will be a matter for the DTA, when established, to advise on the priorities as between this and other transport investment proposals for the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>In my opening speech I dealt fairly extensively with the prospective role and functions of the Dublin Transport Authority.  I can tell Deputy Wilson and Deputy Brennan that the serious issues they raised about traffic and transport in the Dublin area will fall almost entirely within the areas of responsibility of the Authority.  As I said, I hope the Authority will be established later this year.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to the Bombardier buses.  Under the arrangements between CIE and Bombardier (Ireland) Ltd., CIE provided the premises at Shannon and all the assets of which they retain ownership.  Bombardier are resonsible for the purchase of materials for the manufacture of buses, in consultation with CIE, for the employmentmanagement of staff and the production of buses.</P>
    <P>CIE requirements for new buses are now supplied from the Bombardier factory in Shannon.  CIE's capital allocation for road passenger projects this year is some £16 million which has enabled the board to place an order for 116 buses <Col N="1094" /> with Bombardier.  To date, over 300 new double deck buses and 50 single deck buses have been supplied from the plant.</P>
    <P>As Deputies are aware, the longer-term prospects for the plant are closely linked to the export possibilities for the Bombardier range of buses.  I understand that the company are making all possible efforts to secure export orders and we must hope that they will be successful.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Cowen raised a number of questions about the operation of the Bombardier buses.  I should say that CIE have assured me that the Bombardier buses represent a vast improvement on the fleet of Atlanteans which preceded them and that many of the allegations made against the Bombardier buses are exaggerated.  For example, it has been directly reported to me that some bus crews regard Bombardiers as the best buses they have ever had.  I have also had a reassuring technical report from CIE on the criticisms that have been made.</P>
      <P>Many appear to represent the teething problems normal to new equipment in every field of mechanical activity.  Some of the problems are not problems at all. The Bombardier has been designed to allow for ready interchange of some components. If there is, for example, an engine which is better for financial or mechanical or operational reasons than that originally specified, it is CIE's duty to seek it out and use it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen also raised questions about the road freight services operated by CIE.  The CIE road freight service is a marginal and, incidentally, non-subventible activity.  Contrary to what many people may believe, CIE discharge only a very minor role in the total road freight market, and it is one that costs them money they have no means of finding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This state of affairs is far from being the wish of this or any previous Government. The fact is that, for a full quarter of a century, every possible resource in legislation, policy and enforcement was invoked to secure for CIE a major and dominant role in the freight and road <Col N="1095" /> freight markets.  The sum total of all those efforts was that major users throughout the country turned increasingly to the use of their own vehicles and CIE were left out in the cold.</P>
    <P>This situation is not unique to Ireland. Similar policies have failed throughout Europe and produced the same result &mdash; the growth of own account transport. Even those countries such as Germany which was mentioned by Deputy Wilson have not been remarkably successful in their policy designed to direct freight into the railways.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly raised points about obtrusive advertising by CIE on bridges, and so forth, which detracts from the visual environment.  He conceded that the matter was a minor one, but it raises an important principle.  In these hard times, every penny that CIE can earn will count.  Their estimate for advertising revenue this year is of the order of £1.6 million.  I urge them with, of course, due regard to good taste, to seek to augment these revenues and to find other, even if minor, means of adding to their sources of income.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast asked about progress on a new CIE wages grade pension scheme.  Negotiations between CIE and the relevant staff representatives on a new scheme are continuing.  I have great sympathy with the aspirations of the staff and I hope that progress can be made. When the scheme is agreed, it will be considered by the Government in the light of the prevailing financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson inquired whether the sale of Ostanna Iompair Éireann's Belfast hotel had been completed and whether any policy decisions had been taken in relation to OIE.  The sale of the Russel Court Hotel in Belfast is, of course, primarily a matter for OIE.  I understand from the company that a contract for the sale has been signed and that the sale is to be completed by end June. The sale price is a matter between OIE and the purchaser.  I have been reviewing the operations of OIE generally and I expect to be in a position shortly to bring proposals before Government on the <Col N="1096" /> future operation of the Great Southern Hotels.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast raised the question of those who are moving, as he put it &ldquo;illegitimately&rdquo; into road transport operations.  The legislation in relation to road passenger transport is extremely difficult to enforce.  This is the experience in other countries as well as our own. Obviously the line between club or private hire transport and operations which require a licence is a very narrow one. The fears about these alleged illegal services are exaggerated.  They cater for traffic much of which they themselves have generated and which would for the most part disappear if the services were terminated.</P>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Byrne's point about the activities of foreign hauliers.  I should say that complaints about illegal haulage activities are initially and, indeed, primarily for the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked for an indication of my thinking on the report of the Transport Consultative Commission on Road Freight Haulage.  As I said in my opening speech, I have been considering the TCC Report and I have had discussions with the main interests concerned.  I appreciate that the industry and those who may be planning to invest in the industry need early clarification of the Government's intentions in relation to the recommendations in the report.  In general I am in favour of the removal of quantitative restrictions on road hauliers subject to the application of high standards in the industry.  I will be making proposals to Government in the matter very shortly and I will bring the necessary legislation before the Dáil at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson inquired as to whether the three £10 million equity tranche scheme was being put in place.  As I explained in introducing the recent Air Companies (Amendment) Bill, the Government have decided to make available £30 million by way of equity.  The money is now being made available in two tranches of £15 million, the first of which was handed over to Aerlínte at the <Col N="1097" /> end of March.  The second tranche is due to be paid before 31 March 1984.</P>
    <P>In reply to another point raised by Deputy Wilson, I should say that traditionally, Aer Lingus's cross-channel and continental services manage a break-even or close to break-even result. Cross-channel traffic has been down over each of the past three years, while continental traffic has also been feeling the effects of the recession.  The current year is showing signs of being another difficult one on the traffic front.  Overall, Aer Lingus would hope that, with the help of profits from their ancillary activities, their results for 1983-84 can show a small profit.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson inquired if the provision in the Estimates would be sufficient to cover subsidisation of the Dublin-Derry service for the year.  The position is that the agreement concluded between my Department and the airline providing the service, Avair, was for a two-year period expiring in May, 1983.  In framing the Estimates for 1983, it was considered inappropriate to include financial provision for payments that would run beyond the expiry date of the present agreement. However, I can inform Deputy Wilson that the subsidy for the service will be continued for the remainder of 1983 and the question of the subsidy arrangements that will apply thereafter in respect of the service is a matter currently under examination in my Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson referred to the proposed £99 fare to be offered by People's Express between New York and London and suggested that this could undo the efforts of ECAC to restore a more favourable operating environment on the North Atlantic.  The Deputy is, of course, right in that the experience of the last 10 years on the Atlantic has shown the ease with which price-wars break out and the dire financial results that can follow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present instance, I understand that the UK authorities are still considering the People's Express case.  I also understand that the service, if it is authorised, <Col N="1098" /> will be limited to five services a week.  People's Express would, therefore, be providing a very small part of the total capacity between New York and London and it is to be hoped that their arrival on the scene will not bring about another price war of the kind which had led to the collapse of large airlines and the undermining of confidence in the industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about the impact of a reduction in the price of fuel on Aer Lingus.  Fuel is, of course one of the major elements of airline costs nowadays and any drop in fuel prices is to be welcomed. Each 1 per cent drop in fuel prices is worth of the order of £400,000 to Aer Lingus and the airline hopes to make a saving of some £3.5 million this year arising from lower fuel prices.  Deputies will agree that is a very significant development.</P>
    <P>Another matter raised by Deputy Wilson was the provision for works at Dublin Airport.  The £2.9 million in the Vote relates to works at all three State Airports. The provision was reduced from £3.2 million to £2.9 million because of the difficult budgetary situation.  I am satisfied, however that the amount provided will be sufficient to cover all essential work including the overlay on the main runway at Dublin Airport.  As I mentioned in my opening speech, this will cost £1.2 million.  Work on this project has in fact commenced within the last few days and will be completed in about three months.  While this work will prolong the life of the existing runway for a number of years, Aer Rianta and my Department are actively examining the airport's long-term runway requirements.</P>
    <P>I dealt comprehensively with the position about the Dublin Airport catering concession in replying to a parliamentary question last week.  Deputy Wilson, in his contribution, referred to a comment made by Deputy Haughey about the high quality restaurant service offered by Aer Rianta at Dublin Airport in the past.  In that connection, I should say that the SAS proposals envisage a wide range of services, including the restoration of a first-class restaurant facility.</P>

      <P>I could not agree more.  I hope it will be Irish food.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson suggested that the Federal Express proposal might be revived. The Federal Express concept had very real attractions for Shannon.  Unfortunately, our latest information is that Federal Express are having a major re-think on the whole concept of a transatlantic operation and that the chances of their proceeding with the project are not good, at least in the short term.  Aer Rianta and SFADCo are continuing to keep in close contact with developments.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson asked about the position in relation to Mount Gabriel.  The radar facility at Mount Gabriel was provided in February 1980 to monitor aircraft movements in the upper airspace. The capital cost was borne by Eurocontrol, an international agency concerned with air traffic control services in Europe, and the operational costs are shared by the Department of Transport and by the UK Civil Aviation Authority.</P>
      <P>There are two radar &ldquo;heads&rdquo; involved and Eurocontrol have decided to proceed with the restoration of one of the heads, at a cost of about £250,000.  The question of the restoration of the other head, which was extensively damaged and the general question of financial liability remain to be resolved but there is no question of any payment from the Vote now under consideration by the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of questions were asked by Deputy Wilson about the regulations for travel trade licensing.  I had hoped to be in a position to publish the implementing regulations in February 1983 but was unable to do so because the Irish Travel Agents Association asked me to consider proposals for revision of a number of aspects of the draft regulations.  Even if I had found it possible to meet this target date, I would still have had to allow a six-month lead-in time to ensure ample time for the submission and examination of applications for licences, the negotiation of bonds and the issue of licences in <Col N="1100" /> good time before the scheme became operational.  The date of 1 November 1983 was chosen to coincide with the start of the traditional winter season in the travel trade.</P>
    <P>On and from 1 November it will be illegal to trade as a tour operator or travel agent without a licence under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  In the examination of applications for licences under the new regime, applicants will need a bond and, in addition, will have to satisfy me that they have the necessary financial, business and organisational resources and that they are fit and proper persons to carry on business as a tour operator or travel agent as the case may be.</P>
    <P>In the meantime my Department will continue to insist, as a condition of all charter authorisations, that the carriers involved will repatriate any travellers who may be affected by financial problems experienced by tour operators or travel agents.  In addition the rescue and protection fund established voluntarily by the ITAA will be available in respect of all holidays booked with member companies of that association.  I understand that despite the impact of a recent collapse the association still have at their disposal substantial funds to protect travellers up to the commencement of the new statutory protection measures on 1 November.  The association recently indicated to me that they might be prepared to integrate their rescue resources with the Travellers' Protection Fund which I am establishing under the new Act but no firm proposals have as yet been made to me by the association in the matter.</P>
    <P>As regards Deputy Wilson's reference to the Appropriations-in-aid, I should make it clear that these represent the revenue from licence application fees and will help to offset the administrative costs of running the scheme.  There is no connection between the Appropriations-in-aid provision and the statutory fund which will, of course, be accounted for separately.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to the B &amp; I and Irish Shipping Limited.  Deputy Wilson raised a number of questions about <Col N="1101" /> the B &amp; I and Irish Shipping.  He asked if I will consider the possible extension of the Cork-Pembroke route when I look at the results at the end of the tourist season. I would be very happy if we could have a year-round service again.  However, the route has been very unprofitable for the B &amp; I when operated on a year-round basis.  I will be having the performance of the summer service examined at the end of the season and I will be reserving my position in the meantime. He also asked if I am satisfied that the loss figures on the Cork-Pembroke route were properly computed.  For this I have to rely on the figures furnished to me by the company but I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of the figures provided.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked if I am satisfied that financial control of the ferry services is adequate.  My information here is that the company have a comprehensive range of financial control procedures covering all aspects of the vessel operations. The Deputy may wish to know that a senior executive of the B &amp; I has recently been given special resposibility for all operating aspects of the car ferry services.  On the operation of the Dublin-Holyhead route, I understand that the route is making a positive contribution this year as it did in 1982.  I am not prepared to give detailed figures because of commercial considerations.</P>
    <P>B &amp; I operate a daily service in contrast to Sealink's twice daily service.  There are similar fare structures and regular consultation between both companies on marketing policies adopted by each company from time to time.  I understand that B &amp; I carryings are in line with budget expectations.  I recently visited Holyhead and was impressed by the measure of co-operation which I observed and by the strong indications of local support for the B &amp; I service which is a change from the situation that pertained a year ago.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson also asked about the Jetfoil.  The Jetfoil is at present laid up in Arklow.  The B &amp; I have been pursuing the possibility of a sale or lease of the craft.  There have been a number of promising inquiries world-wide but the vessel has not been disposed of yet. <Col N="1102" /> Deputy Wilson inquired about the level of equity which will be available for B&amp;I and Irish Shipping in 1983.  I can only say that the financial position of B &amp; I and Irish Shipping will shortly be considered by the Government and the Deputy will appreciate that I cannot anticipate the decision of the Government in this regard.</P>
    <P>In reply to another question, I can inform Deputies that the bulk carrier <i>Irish Spruce</i> will be delivered to Irish Shipping Limited in June 1983.  Deputy Wilson also asked about Irish Shipping's share in Oceanbank.</P>
    <P>The position is that Oceanbank Developments Limited are the holding company for Irish Shipping's interests in ferries, insurance and property.  Irish Shipping have a 75 per cent share of the company, the other 25 per cent being held by Allied Irish Investment Bank. Another question was asked about the operation of Belfast Car Ferries.  I understand that Belfast Car Ferries, an Oceanbank subsidiary company, are doing very well.  They commenced operations last year and are operating profitably.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne raised some questions about Rosslare Harbour.  There has been very substantial State investment in Rosslare Harbour in recent years and the benefits of this investment are evident in the frequency of shipping services now using the port.  I realise that the passenger handling facilities, could be improved and I will certainly consider the Deputy's representations in the light of the moneys available and the various demands on them.  I am very much aware of the activities and proposals of the Harbour Development Board.  Indeed the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, met the board last September.  The particular question of establishing a State company or State agency for the development of a particular region is a matter for the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  My understanding is that the board agreed to pursue the proposals with those Ministers.</P>
    <P>I dealt with the matter of the completion of the customs building at Rosslare Harbour in reply to a Dáil question on <Col N="1103" /> 21 April 1983.  As I said then, the completion of the extension of the customs building is primarily a matter for CIE who manage and operate Rosslare Harbour. CIE are unlikely to be able to undertake the work from within their capital budget this year and, due to the severe financial constraints on the Exchequer, no allocation is possible from the Transport Vote this year.</P>
    <P>The question of berthage facilities at Rosslare Harbour, which was referred to in the course of this debate by Deputy Byrne, has been raised periodically by various interested parties and Deputies from the constituency.  CIE have indicated that on average the scheduled usage of the two piers at the harbour is approximately 30 per cent.  Delays, when they occur, are mainly due to ships running behind schedule due to weather conditions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne also raised the question of the supply of beach nourishment material to Rosslare Strand.  In reply to a Dáil question recently I stated that CIE had under consideration proposals to dredge 120,000 cubic metres, 180,000 tonnes, of material at Rosslare Harbour using a trailing suction dredging vessel and that it was intended to dump the dredged material inshore from where it would be moved onto the Rosslare Strand by tidal action.  I understand from CIE that a contract has now been placed for this work to be carried out and that operations will commence shortly.</P>
    <P>I have noted the comments of Deputy Taylor-Quinn on the setting up of a Shannon estuarial authority.  I am prepared to discuss the question of establishing such an authority with representatives of various ports concerned before taking any decision on the matter.  I will have arrangements for these discussions made as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn also raised the question of comparison between the 1983 Estimate figures for salaries and the 1982 provisional outturn figures.  I would point out that as the latter figures are provisional, they require further adjustment before being finalised for the Appropriation Account.  In relation to the difference <Col N="1104" /> in average pay levels between the Marine Services and the Meteorological Services I should explain that the bulk of those employed in the Marine Services are highly paid professional personnel while in the Meteorological Services there is a wide range of grades and the majority of their personnel are in the lower recruitment grades.</P>
    <P>Deputy Morley asked if I am prepared to make money available when required for the completion of the Connaught Regional Airport.  As I indicated recently in response to a Dáil question, the grave Exchequer situation dictates a review of the present position whereby the State is 100 per cent liable for all costs of this project and a decision on the matter will be made shortly.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputy Wilson for the constructive and supportive interest he expressed in the staffing of my Department and particularly the Planning Unit. My Department are, in fact, short of the heads of staff the Deputy numerated but the reasons lie, of course, in the severe economic disciplines at present imposed on Government Departments.  Apart from raising questions of importance on all aspects of the transport sector, Deputies have also made valuable suggestions which I will have carefully considered in my Department.</P>
    <P>Almost all our transport companies are in very severe financial difficulties.  For some that has been the case for some years, but for others, like Irish Shipping, the present position is dramatically worse than what we have come to expect from that company, which was profitable for 15 years in a row before last year.  We hope that recovery from the recession will bring about a dramatic improvement.</P>
    <P>The biggest burden on the Exchequer is CIE, a body that affects most people in the country, almost every parish.  I see it as my duty to set out to create a totally new environment for CIE.  I see it as my duty to establish that environment to improve morale from top to bottom, and in the near future I hope to make specific proposals in that regard.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister who took up my queries, and there <Col N="1105" /> were many of them.  He replied in great detail and I am more than pleased with the answers.  In his unscripted remarks at the end he spoke of the various crises in regard to transport.  Does he not think that he has an unanswerable argument to put to the Government on the need for the planning unit to be strengthened because it was specifically laid down as part of the functions of that unit to monitor the activities in the transport companies that come under the aegis of the Department?  My other question is about Ostlanna Iompair Éireann.  The Minister is probably constrained because it is a private company, but I do not regard his reply as full enough.  However, as the taxpayer has to pick up the bill, I should like to know and the country to know what exactly is the position in regard to the hotels.</P>

Successive Governments have agreed on the need to restrict numbers in the public service because of the financial situation, and that imposes difficulties on us.</P>

      <P>That is a valid criticism. I will strive to ensure that we can strengthen the unit because of the valuable role it can play.  In relation to Ostlanna Iompair Éireann, I hope to have a decision made on it in the very near future.  I will then make a statement on it.  OIE is in a very difficult financial position, as I said in relation to other companies.  This is at a time when the Exchequer itself is in a very difficult financial position and least able to be of assistance.  It has to be looked at in that context.  I will bring before the Government shortly proposals on OIE, and when a decision is made I will make a statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £606,009,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983 for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants in lieu of rates on agricultural land and other grants to local authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-inaid. </P>
      <P>In presenting this Estimate to the Dáil I will speak briefly about the different categories of expenditure involved before dealing with specific subheads.  The gross provision for my Department is nearly £636 million, which is the fourth largest Vote in money terms.</P>
      <P>This gives some idea of the large amount of funds involved especially as it does not include a further £454 million for non-voted capital expenditure in the current year.  The Vote for the Department of the Environment can be subdivided into six broad categories: grants or recoupment of expenditure to local authorities, subsidies to local authorities for loan charges for specific services, direct departmental payments, grants or grants-in-aid to voluntary, semi-State or international bodies, departmental administration and receipts classified as appropriations-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The grants or recoupment to local authorities account for £415 million, 65 per cent of the total amount, and cover grants in lieu of domestic and agricultural rates, road grants, public water supply grants, environmental works, local improvement schemes, malicious injuries and other smaller grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The subsidies to local authorities towards their loan charges amount to over £162 million or 26 per cent of the Vote and comprise subsidies for loan charges for local authority housing, <Col N="1107" /> including private sites and the former low rise mortgage scheme, water supply and sewerage, public library service, rehabilitation of travelling people and for fire services.</P>
    <P>The direct departmental payments total nearly £40 million or 6 per cent and are mainly for grants to private persons for housing, water and sewerage and the mortgage subsidy scheme.  The grants to various bodies cover such organisations as An Foras Forbartha, National Road Safety Association, Medical Bureau of Road Safety, Dublin Inner City Group, Fire Prevention Council, An Bord Pleanála and other smaller bodies.</P>
    <P>The general administrative expenses of the Department are included in subheads A1 to D.  The expenditure involved is £12.4 million or 2 per cent of the Vote. Every effort is being made in my Department to maximise efficiency and to deploy staff resources to the best possible advantage.</P>
    <P>As stated above, the bulk of the funds are given in the form of grants and subsidies to local authorities to assist them to provide services such as water supply, waste collection, roads, fire services, libraries, etc.  The rates relief for domestic premises and agricultural land now being provided by the Exchequer has meant major relief for individual households.</P>
    <P>The provision in the Environment Vote is part only of what will be spent this year on the services of my Department and the local authorities operating under the aegis of my Department. Money for the services also comes from some other Votes, from the Local Loans Fund and of course from local authorities' own resources arising from rates and miscellaneous items of income.</P>
    <P>When all these are reckoned it is estimated that the Department and the local authorities will spend some £1,400 million on current and capital expenditure in 1983.  This figure compares with about £1,250 million in 1982.  The local authorities will have more than £1,300 million to spend this year and they will themselves raise more than £300 million of this amount.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1108" /> It is evident that spending on this scale, capital and current, is of major significance not only in terms of the variety of public services provided and their importance in the life of the community, but also of the direct and indirect impact on economic activity and generation of employment.  It is, of course, essential that the local government system within which the expenditure is undertaken should be working well and efficiently. The question of improving the structure of the system in ways which might make it more effective has been under consideration on and off for several years.  This, as my predecessors can vouch, is a complex subject with wide ramifications.  I intend, however, to examine the issues involved and the options as regards changes which would contribute to making the system stronger, more effective and more democratic.  The future financial health of the system is, of course, central to such consideration, and I will come back to that.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the major expenditure areas of my Department.</P>
    <P>First, I want to talk now about the building industry.  I have heard many figures bandied about recently in relation to public capital support for the industry in 1983 and all sorts of dire predictions for output and employment which grossly distort the true position.  There is no doubt that the building industry has been going through a lean period and it would be strange, indeed, if it remained untouched by the recessionary conditions the country has been enduring.  The result of these conditions has been a massive drop in investment of private capital in the building industry over an extended period.  In the four-year period 1979-1982, private investment in the industry fell by over 50 per cent.  It is unrealistic to expect the State to match in full this reduction in private investment by a corresponding increase in public capital support, given the competing needs of other sectors of the economy and the restriction on the raising of revenue through taxation and on borrowing by the State.</P>
    <P>Public capital investment in the building industry has in fact gone a long way <Col N="1109" /> towards countering the worst effects of the withdrawal of private investment and every effort is being made to maintain this position.</P>
    <P>In the years 1977 to 1979 there was greatly increased public capital expenditure on construction at a time when building activity, buoyed up with private investment, was rising strongly in any event.  The result was a costly and damaging over-heating of the industry and the creation of serious problems, many of which we are still trying to cope with. Inflation in the industry literally took off. Tender prices jumped far ahead of cost increases generally.  Shortages of many building materials gave rise to greatly increased imports.  Shortages of skilled workers became manifest.  Delays in completing projects because of unavailability of building workers in some areas caused further increases in project costs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Now, at Deputy Brady's request, having established that the last bus for Donegal has not departed, I will continue.  Some of the consequences of this period of over-heating are still with us &mdash; to give an example, while building output and the demand for building materials dropped over the past three years, imports of materials have continued at a high level.  This factor is having a damaging effect on our materials manufacturing industry and on employment within that industry.</P>
      <P>Imports of building materials in 1981 &mdash; the last full year for which figures are available &mdash; were valued at about £350 million.  About half of these imported materials could have been produced in the country creating direct employment of up to 10,000 jobs.  Relatively speaking, we have one of the worst trade balances in Europe in this particular sector.  The value of imported building materials doubled between 1977 and 1981; yet our exports in the period increased by less than one-third.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The building industry is a particular case in which an unthinking approach <Col N="1110" /> can, and has, damaged the interests of Irish producers.  The type of case that I have in mind is the not infrequent one in which building or design specifications have been drafted in such a way that they effectively precluded by their terms the use of Irish materials or products that, given a fair chance of competing, would have been quite suitable on grounds of quality and price for the job in hand.</P>
    <P>I want to assure Deputies that this Government will act responsibly towards the building industry.  However, we are bound by constraints which were not of the present Government's making and which seriously limit room for manoeuvre. Much of the remedial action being urged on the Government would, in the long term, compound rather than cure the problems of the economy.  The policy which I will pursue in relation to the building industry may take time to bear fruit but the reality of the present situation is that there is no magic wand available to conjure up in the short-term the kind of additional investment and growth that some spokesmen have called for.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of the need for a system of control both technical and administrative, in the construction of all buildings.  While power to make building regulations is available in the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963, the Act does not cater for developments which have taken place in the industry since the 1963 Act was enacted.  A number of factors, such as energy conservation and efficient use of resources, must be catered for in the building regulations and the power available under the 1963 Act is inadequate for this purpose.  For that reason I propose to introduce a Bill during this present session which will provide a new statutory basis for the making of building regulations and for their administration and implementation.</P>
    <P>Housing is the largest sector within the construction industry.  It accounts for about two-fifths of the output of the industry and about one-third of its employment.  The importance of housing is not solely that it is a major economic activity; it also satisfies a basic social <Col N="1111" /> need.  We are relatively fortunate in having a housing stock of good quality.  The return to the community from the considerable investment required to provide this housing stock is best illustrated by considering the consequences of poor housing conditions, such as widespread health problems, social and economic deprivation and instability.  In the past ten years, well over one-quarter of a million new houses were built or almost 30 per cent of this country's housing stock. Although this is a remarkable achievement, population pressures are such that we must keep up or even increase this pace of activity.  Any shortfall in meeting housing needs in the short-term will have to be made up in the longer term with heavy economic and social costs.  The Joint Programme for Government recognises the need for a continuing high level of housing output and includes an aim to raise output towards 30,000 units per year.  Obviously meeting this target will take some time, but I am determined that the target will be achieved.</P>
    <P>My policy in seeking to ensure that housing completions are sufficient to satisfy needs is based on two approaches. First of all, every encouragement will be given to the majority who can house themselves through their own efforts. There is a wide range of inducements to this group of people ranging from grants and subsidies, tax concessions, the availability of mortgage finance and the operation of arrangements to ensure that new housing is of good standard and located in an acceptable environment.  The second approach is that the State will provide, through local authorities, or assist the provision through voluntary housing organisations, of housing for those who have not the resources to house themselves.</P>
    <P>In spite of the very difficult budgetary situation facing the Government I am maintaining the capital provision for housing in 1983 at a very high level.  The total capital allocation for housing provided in the 1983 Public Capital Programme is £360 million, the highest allocation to any sector of the programme. In 1982, 26,798 houses were completed <Col N="1112" /> which represented a decline of over 2,000 houses on the figure for 1981.  This decline has taken place entirely in the private sector due to the effects of the economic recession.</P>
    <P>In 1982, the capital allocation for local authority housing was £186 million.  This amount funded the completion of 5,686 houses and left a further 7,460 houses in progress at the end of the year.  The average monthly employment on the programme throughout the year was 5,889 while the December figure stood at 6,086.</P>
    <P>An allocation of £208 million is being made available towards the housing programme in 1983.  This figure represents an increase of 11.8 per cent on the 1982 provision.  Having regard to the very competitive tendering which we have experienced, particularly throughout the second half of 1982, and the moderation in the rate of increase in building costs, this allocation should be sufficient to maintain the programme throughout 1983 at about the 1982 level.  It is important to ensure that maximum value is got for the resources provided.  To this end we have undertaken a broad ranging examination of the extent to which there may be scope for restraining the unit costs of local authority houses which have, unfortunately, increased so much in recent years.</P>
    <P>Housing subsidy in subhead E1 of the Vote meets in full the loan charges on borrowings incurred by local authorities in the provision of houses for letting.  The provision for this subsidy in 1983 is over £128 million, an increase of £30 million over last year's provision.</P>
    <P>The present differential rents scheme has been in operation since the beginning of 1982.  I am at present developing proposals for a revision of the scheme for discussion with local authorities and tenant interests.  The basic strategy behind the scheme is that those persons who can afford to do so should pay their fair share of rent and those in less favourable circumstances should have their rent payments tailored to their means.</P>
    <P>Private housing output is influenced strongly by the prevailing economic situation. The result has been that private <Col N="1113" /> housing completions in 1982, compared with 1981, fell by over 2,000 to 21,112. Financial incentives such as grants and subsidies for house purchase and house improvement remain a central feature of Irish housing policy.  Subhead E2 makes provision for £18 million for the payment of new house grants for first-time owner-occupiers and for house improvement grants.</P>
    <P>The mortage subsidy scheme is designed to ease the burdens on first-time owner-occupiers of new houses by making a subsidy of up to £3,000 available to eligible applicants over a period of five years.  The provision in subhead E3 for mortgage subsidy in 1983 is £14.3 million.</P>
    <P>The availability of mortgage finance is a key factor in the level of housing demand.  I am concerned, therefore, to ensure that mortgage finance should be available and at interest rates that people can afford.  Private resources, through the building societies and the mortgage operations of the banks and assurance companies, are supplemented by public agencies &mdash; the Housing Finance Agency and the house purchase loan scheme of local authorities.  In 1982, £439 million was paid out by all the major lending agencies.  Regrettably, the contribution by the banks and assurance companies continues to decline.  Together they provided something in excess of £30 million, or only about 7 per cent compared with nearly 20 per cent in 1978, of the total advanced by the main agencies.</P>
    <P>Building societies remain the major source of mortgage finance.  The societies advanced £292 million in 1982, or two-thirds of the total advances.  The societies can be expected to continue their major contribution to the financing of the private housing programme in 1983 and they are likely to fund about 15,000 loans for both new and existing houses.  The societies' mortgage rate stands generally at 13 per cent since January last, which is the lowest rate that has prevailed for more than four years.  Some of the societies have been able to relax their loan requirements in varying ways in recent months.  During 1982 the societies were permitted to avail of a foreign borrowing facility of £20 million with the benefit of <Col N="1114" /> a State guarantee against possible exchange rate losses.  A token provision is included in subhead E3.6 to cover any expenditure which may be necessary on foot of this guarantee in the current year.</P>
    <P>People on lower incomes for whom the building societies do not normally cater are provided with mortgage finance through schemes operated by local authorities and the Housing Finance Agency.  The capital allocation for the payment of loans by these agencies in 1983 is £127 million.  In 1982, local authorities paid out a total of almost £100 million in house purchase loans.  Loans under the local authority house purchase loan scheme have a fixed interest rate of 12½ per cent per annum.</P>
    <P>The Housing Finance Agency was set up by the previous Coalition Government. In the four month period to the end of 1982, the agency advanced some £17 million to enable local authorities to issue house purchase loans principally to first-time purchasers.  The agency will have £50 million available for this purpose in 1983.  There has been a strong demand to date for the agency's unique loan scheme.  The agency will raise finance for its operations through the issue of State-guaranteed bonds linked to the rate of inflation and having a small real rate of return.  A first bond issue of £25 million was made by the agency in January this year.  The success of that issue augurs well for the future issues the agency will make.</P>
    <P>The conservation and improvement of existing houses is a very important facet of housing policy.  The scheme currently in operation provides grants for the provision of a water supply, sewerage facilities, a bathroom, increased accommodation to cater for overcrowding, chimneys in houses where none exists and necessary conservation works to the basic fabric of the house.  In 1982 my Department paid about 18,000 house improvement grants, excluding grants paid for group water or sewerage schemes with which I will deal later.</P>
    <P>For some years past a proportion of the moneys allocated for house improvements is earmarked for grants to provide improved accommodation for disabled <Col N="1115" /> persons and for essential repairs to certain houses in rural areas.  Grant assistance is available for the adaptation of existing dwellings to facilitate occupants suffering from severe physical or mental disability.  The essential repairs scheme applies to houses occupied by elderly persons and is designed to improve these houses so that the occupants can continue to reside in them for the rest of their lives.  Irrespective of the state of the nation's finances it is only proper that social services of this nature should not be neglected.</P>
    <P>Subhead E provides funds for an emergency programme to improve the living conditions of old people living alone in insanitary or unfit accommodation.  The range of works could involve, for example, repairs to a chimney or fireplace, the provision of water and sanitary facilities, the provision of food storage facilities, works to facilitate access to a house such as a ramp or handrail and so on.  Formalities are kept to a minimum and where an application is approved work is carried out at no cost to the applicant.  Generally, the programme is being undertaken with the co-operation of the health boards on a regional basis under the direction of the various community care managers.  There is also close co-operation with certain voluntary organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul and &ldquo;Alone&rdquo;.  I have provided a sum of £1 million in subhead E4 to enable it to be continued in 1983.</P>
    <P>In turning to local authority finance, let me first spell out in broad terms what I see as the problems in this area and what my objectives are in tackling those problems.  I am concerned at the trend in recent years of local authorities' increasing dependence on the Exchequer for the bulk of their current revenue.  This has come about with the derating of domestic dwellings in 1978 and the progressive derating of agricultural land, culminating in, for practical purposes, complete derating in 1983.  To put this in perspective &mdash; in 1976, about 38 per cent of local authorities' receipts on current account came from the Exchequer &mdash; by 1982, this had risen to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1116" /> In these circumstances the Minister for the Environment &mdash; any Minister for the Environment &mdash; could not write a blank cheque for local authorities and as a result central controls on local finance, particularly in the matter of striking the rates, were imposed.  Moreover, the deteriorating financial position of the Exchequer inevitably put a further constraint on the amounts by which local authorities were allowed to increase rates.  I believe that the increased dependence on the Exchequer and the control it brings is not good for local democracy.</P>
    <P>My approach to the question of local finances is based on the principle of restoring as much freedom and discretion to local authorities as is possible.  The Estimates before the House, together with other decisions we have taken and to which I will refer, represent a first step in the right direction.</P>
    <P>The Estimate published by the previous Administration provided £138 million under subhead O &mdash; grant in relief of rates &mdash; and £108 million under subhead P &mdash; grant in lieu of rates on agricultural land.  These provisions would, I believe, have spelt disaster for local authorities.  The £138 million for domestic rate grant was the same as the 1982 provision and was £17.5 million short of what would have financed even a freeze in rate poundages on domestic property. The £108 million for the grant in lieu of rates on agricultural land was the equivalent of a freeze in rate poundages had they been applicable to land.</P>
    <P>When one realises that those grants are spent on the day to day running of the essential services the local authorities provide, including fire and emergency services, water and sewerage services, roads, the wages and salaries of over 30,000 workers, together with the mounting cost of debt service arising from the expansion in capital programmes, it is not difficult to see that the amounts provided by the previous Administration were a recipe for serious cutbacks in the essential services of local authorities and, with the cutbacks, the loss of employment.</P>
    <P>I am pleased, therefore, that I was able to secure a Government decision to allocate <Col N="1117" /> an additional £31.5 million for these grants, notwithstanding the very difficult budgetary situation.  This increased the 1983 provisions to £163.5 million for subhead O and £114 million for subhead P, representing increases of over 18 per cent and 5½ per cent respectively, over what had been provided by the previous administration and 18 per cent and 28 per cent respectively over the 1982 provisions.</P>
    <P>I recognise that the extra £31.5 million still leaves a shortfall for local authorities which will have to be raised in other ways. My approach to this is to confer the maximum discretion on local authorities as to how the shortfall is to be raised.  I have departed from the practice of five years standing whereby the local authorities' power to strike a rate was effectively dictated from the Custom House.  This year local authorities were free to strike whatever rate they wished.  They will also be free under the recently introduced Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1983, to supplement their income by charges for services.  As this Bill will shortly be debated in the House, I do not wish to discuss the details here, except to make these points&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; the local authorities will have maximum discretion under the Bill in regard to the imposition of charges, while respecting that standardisation is necessary in some cases, as with the planning charges;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the charges required will be of moderate dimensions &mdash; and very moderate compared with the charges which would have had to be imposed if the rate support grants had stayed at the level provided for by the previous Government.  I hope this will be borne in mind by the Opposition when it comes to debating the Charges Bill.  </P>
    <P>That Bill also makes broad provision for hardship circumstances.</P>
    <P>I believe that the approach which I have described is the right approach.  I cannot claim that it will solve all the local authority financial problems this year, or that there are any practicable means of achieving that immediately.  In addition, <Col N="1118" /> therefore, to the immediate steps which I have described, I am arranging for a special examination to be undertaken of the means that might be adopted to ensure the financial viability of the local government system for the medium and longer terms, including the degree of financial independence which is essential to the health and confidence of democratic local government.</P>
    <P>We are dependent on roads more than most other developed countries as the principal means of transport.  The public road network accounts for some 96 per cent of all inland passenger traffic and 90 per cent of internal freight traffic.  The main improvements required to make the road network &mdash; and especially the national routes &mdash; adequate in regard to economic, social and environmental needs, have been set out in the Road Development Plan for the eighties.  Road grant allocations continue to be guided by the objectives of the plan.  With some 3½ years experience of its operation, I have now undertaken a thorough review of the plan.</P>
    <P>The Department's Vote provision for road grants this year amounts to £115.5 million an increase of 14 per cent relative to 1982.  This should more than compensate for increases in costs which are estimated at 11 per cent.  Between 1979 and 1982 total employment on road works declined from 11,500 to 10,000.  I expect this fall in employment to be halted this year.  Of the total Vote provision of £115.5 million £90 million will be spent on road improvement&mdash;£10 million more than last year.  The priorities in the expenditure of that sum must be given to completing schemes already in progress, such as the by-pass schemes at Naas, Santry and Swords in the Dublin area, the ring road and bridge in Kilkenny and major bridges in Cork and Waterford. The Naas by-pass is expected to be open to traffic by the end of this year.  Planning for a by-pass of Newbridge is under way. Public inquiries into the proposals for the new bridge over the Shannon and by-pass at Athlone have been arranged.  Dublin County Council have accepted a tender for the construction of a new Templeogue bridge, and in Dublin city, Ballybough <Col N="1119" /> bridge will also be widened.  The second stage of the new road to Dublin Airport is expected to start in the autumn.  Planning is also going ahead for a by-pass of Bray and Shankill.  I hope that local difficulties related to a by-pass of Chapelizod, the Southern Cross Route in Dublin, and a third bridge at Sligo will be resolved without undue delay.  In Galway the planning of a new Corrib bridge is under way and construction work has commenced on the road approaches.</P>
    <P>These are just some of the major works.  Grants have also been allocated for many other improvement works throughout the country.</P>
    <P>While the execution of road improvements is important an even higher priority must be given to preserving the existing network.  I am providing £25.5 million this year for road maintenance, an increase of 19 per cent compared with last year.  This will permit a reasonable standard of maintenance on our major roads.  There was also a modest increase in the block grant for certain works on main and county roads.</P>
    <P>It is important that we bring our major traffic arteries closer to the standards which obtain in Europe to offset disadvantages of our geographical position within the EEC.  These major arteries &mdash; the national roads &mdash; comprise only around 3,300 miles or 6 per cent of the total road network, but they carry some 35 per cent of the traffic.  Below this there is a further tier of non-national &ldquo;main&rdquo; roads &mdash; about 6,700 miles &mdash; and below that again 43,000 miles of county roads. Ireland has one of the highest proportions of road mileages to population in European countries, with consequential problems of improvement and maintenance of a widely dispersed network of which the major portion is of relatively low usage.  With the improvement in the state of local authority finances, to which I have alrady referred, I expect that local authorities will apply a fair share of their resources towards the surface dressing of county roads, of which over 7,000 additional miles have been taken in charge in the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that, given <Col N="1120" /> the limitations on Exchequer funding, ways and means must be found to supplement the roads programme by tapping other sources of finance.  The Joint Programme for Government referred to the possibilities of attracting additional private capital for urgent infrastructural works, which would have an important spin-off effect in maintaining employment in the building industry.  This proposal is being examined in my Department with particular reference to roads. The examination is aimed at establishing, <i>inter alia,</i> the best means of attracting and managing private capital for roads, and how such private investment is to be repaid, including the scope for the application of tolls for particular projects where such are considered to be appropriate and practicable.</P>
    <P>Last month, I gave formal consent to an agreement between Dublin Corporation, the Dublin Port and Docks Board and Ringsend Bridge Ltd. under the Local Government (Toll Roads) Act, 1979.  The agreement put a formal seal on a unique arrangement under which private enterprise has combined with public authorities in the provision of a modern traffic facility.  Work has now started on the construction of the Ringsend toll bridge which will cost about £8 million and will span the River Liffey linking East Wall Road with Ringsend.</P>
    <P>A provision of £3 million is being made for the Local Improvement Scheme in 1983.  As in 1982, the bulk of the allocations made to counties which benefit from the Western Package will be devoted to farm road projects eligible for EEC aid.</P>
    <P>A directive adopted by the EEC obliges member states to implement harmonised schemes from 1 January 1983 for the annual testing of certain classes of commercial vehicles.  Regulations to give effect to the terms of that directive were made in 1981 and the scheme is now fully operational.  At present over 3,000 vehicles are being tested every month at centres widely available throughout the country.  The introduction of this scheme should result in a substantial improvement in vehicle maintenance standards which in turn would be reflected in a decrease in defect-related accidents, a <Col N="1121" /> reduction in the incidence of costly breakdowns and an increase in useful vehicle life for operators.</P>
    <P>Provisional figures show that fewer persons were killed on our roads during 1982 than in 1981, but the issue of safety on our roads continues to be a cause for fundamental concern.  We have a long way to go before we can regard ourselves as a nation of safety-conscious road users. I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the various agencies which are concerned with the drive for greater safety on our roads &mdash; the Garda, the National Road Safety Association and An Foras Forbartha.</P>
    <P>The Department's Vehicle Registration Unit, which is now located at Shannon, is concerned with the maintenance of computerised national records of vehicle ownership.  The work involves the updating of existing computer records to take account of licence renewals, changes of ownership or other vehicle particulars as well as recording the details of first registrations.  The unit works in close co-operation with local motor taxation offices from which the relevant data is obtained.  The computerised system affords immediate access to a wide range of vehicle information, particularly to the Garda authorities, in the matter of traffic law enforcement and road tax evasion, as well as in crime prevention.</P>
    <P>Future developments will include the centralisation of all vehicle records at Shannon.  This will require legislation, which is currently in course of preparation.</P>
    <P>The total provision made in the Public Capital Programme for 1983 in respect of sanitary services is £109.8 million.  Of this £97.3 million is earmarked as non-voted loan capital for public water and sewerage schemes.  The balance of £12.5 million is made up of the £7.2 million for grants for private group water schemes and provision of £5.3 million for public water schemes designated for grant assistance under the Western Package of aid from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund.  The capital provision is adequate to cover 1983 expenditure on public water and sewerage schemes in progress and to allow <Col N="1122" /> financing to be provided for new schemes authorised this year.  It also allows an average increase of around 50 per cent in the allocations to local authorities for small public water and sewerage schemes, costing less than £50,000.  In many cases this will help to maintain direct labour employment.  The average direct employment on the sanitary services programme is projected to increase to 2,150 jobs in 1983.  This represents a 19 per cent increase on the comparable 1982 figure of 1,810 jobs.</P>
    <P>The subsidy to be paid by my Department in 1983 on loan charges incurred by local authorities on the approved cost of public water and sewerage schemes is estimated at just under £30 million &mdash; the relevant funding is provided under subhead F.1.  This is an increase of about £8 million on the 1982 allocation and reflects the growing commitment required to support the financing of loan charges on sanitary services investment.</P>
    <P>The Government recognise that sanitary services schemes have a pivotal role in promoting economic growth and development.  This is one reason why, despite economic and fiscal difficulties, sanitary services investment is being strongly maintained.  For the country to take advantage of an upturn in economic activity there must be a good supply of serviced sites available for industry and for other developments.</P>
    <P>In order to maintain the momentum of the programme in 1984, I have recently announced the release of 59 major public water and sewerage schemes with an estimated total value of about £75 million. The schemes approved include projects to serve housing and new industry; to eliminate deficiencies in existing services; to provide headworks for regional schemes, and to incorporate treatment facilities so as to prevent pollution being caused by sewerage schemes.  I am arranging for my Department and local authorities to co-operate in ensuring that work and employment commence as soon as possible.  The scale of these new releases will help in the build up of confidence in the civil engineering sector of the construction industry.</P>
    <P>By the end of 1982 more than 3,500 <Col N="1123" /> private group water schemes had been completed and approximately 107,000 houses and 80,000 farms had obtained water from group schemes.  Work was in progress on the installation of water in another 7,000 houses and 140 schemes had been designed to serve a further 4,800 houses approximately.  The rural piped water supply programme continues to benefit greatly under the Western Package.  Approximately £7,500,000 has been paid out since June, 1981 in grants in respect of more than 8,700 houses in the western counties under the scheme. The total allocation for 1983 of £7.2 million for group water scheme grants represents a 14 per cent increase on the outturn expenditure of £6.3 million in 1982.  This will be adequate to meet all estimated grant expenditure in 1983 in both western and non-western counties.</P>
    <P>The growth in fire risk which this country has experienced in the past decade or so has stemmed from economic and social change, and the introduction of new materials with fire characteristics different in many respects from the more familiar traditional materials.  We have to gear ourselves to the increased hazards. The changed situation calls for response not just from Government and local fire authorities, but also from the general community.</P>
    <P>Subhead U provides an allocation of £1.352 million for fire and emergency services in 1983, an increase of more than 100 per cent on last year's allocation.  The provision in the Public Capital Programme has also been substantially increased.  The 1983 allocation is £6 million. This compares with £2.5 million in 1981 and £4.75 million in 1982.  The increased funding will provide for an expanded programme of investment by the fire authorities in the construction of fire stations, and the purchase of fire-fighting, communications, rescue and other emergency equipment.  Since 1978 some 30 major fire station projects have been completed and proposals for financing the purchase of 78 new fire tenders and other equipment have been approved.  A subsidy scheme is payable at the rate of 50 per cent on loan charges <Col N="1124" /> and £1.2 million is being provided in subhead U1 for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Increasing attention is being paid to the need for a higher standard of training in the fire service.  Under the 1981 Act it is the duty of the individual fire authorities to ensure that training of fire service personnel is carried out and that adequate standards are maintained.  My Department complement these activities by offering advice and assistance, issuing guidelines on various aspects of training and by organising central training courses for selected fire authority personnel.  The financial allocation for training will allow for an expanded programme in 1983.</P>
    <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, has made significant improvements in the law in the area of fire prevention.  In particular it strengthens the powers of the local fire authorities to inspect buildings and secure adequate standards of fire safety. The Act provides also for the making of fire safety regulations relating to matters such as the use and management of buildings to which the public have access.</P>
    <P>The building regulations, to which I have referred already, will include requirements relating to fire safety in new buildings and in extensions and alterations of existing buildings.  The matters to be covered will include structural fire precautions and means of escape, and account will be taken of the technical recommendations made by the Stardust Tribunal.</P>
    <P>It is my intention also to avail of the powers in section 37 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, to make fire safety regulations which will cover the use, management and contents of buildings.  Priority is being given to places of public assembly, taking account of the relevant recommendations of the Stardust Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The passage of legislation and the introduction of regulations will not in themselves be sufficient to improve the overall level of fire safety.</P>
    <P>The Fire Prevention Council have been doing excellent work in promoting public awareness of fire safety since they were established in 1978.  This has been endorsed by the Stardust report.</P>
    <P>Deputies will recall that when the Fire Services Act, 1981, was before the House <Col N="1125" /> there was general agreement on all sides on the proposals for the establishment of a fire services council which would be empowered to provide specified services for the Minister and fire authorities, including in particular the provision of training courses for fire service and other personnel.  I am, therefore, going ahead now with the establishment of the council.  A primary concern of the council will be to provide for an expanded programme of central training for fire service personnel.  The council will have also the wider role envisaged for them in the Fire Services Act in that they will assist in the development of appropriate regulations, codes of practice and standards relating to fire and fire safety.  I have no doubt but that the council will have wide support from the fire service.  I hope to be in a position to announce shortly the details of the proposals.</P>
    <P>I am continuing the general review of planning law and I intend that special emphasis should be placed on identifying changes which would make the planning system more effective and speed up decision making.  In our present difficult economic circumstances it is essential that the planning process should not delay worthwhile development unnecessarily. Local planning authorities were asked last October to review their approach to development control and to examine their practices and procedures so as to ensure that the system is operating speedily and effectively.  To assist in this review a substantial memorandum containing advice and guidelines was issued by my Department.  I am now asking the planning authorities to report back on the action which they have taken as a result of their reviews and I am considering what further follow-up action may be open to me.</P>
    <P>I have expressed concern on a number of occasions about the operation of An Bord Pleanála and, in particular, about the build up of arrears of appeals awaiting decision.  There were 3,502 planning appeals on hands in the board at the end of March 1983.  This situation, quite simply, is unacceptable in its implications for employment and in the holding back of economic activity in the hard-hit building <Col N="1126" /> and construction industry.  I have had to consider how best the necessary turnaround in performance could be achieved, taking account also of the public concern which has been expressed. The Government have decided that the board should be reconstituted and legislation is being prepared and will be introduced as soon as possible.  In the meantime special arrangements are being made, involving the assignment of additional departmental staff to assist the board, to bring about the maximum improvement in the arrears position as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>While it is essential that the development control system should be working efficiently, I believe that planning should make a positive contribution as well to development and employment provision. I will be trying to bring about a revival of interest and emphasis on the positive potential of planning.  As a first measure guidelines on the methodology of urban plan-making are being issued to assist the local authorities.  The local development plans should set the scene, and provide the context, for the positive role of planning. If plans are to serve this purpose they must be of a good quality and the guidelines should be a help in that direction.</P>
    <P>The urbanisation process, and the need to get infrastructural and other investment programmes properly integrated, means that more attention will need to be given to the regional dimensions of physical planning.  Important work of the kind I have in mind has now been undertaken by the Eastern Regional Development Organisation aimed at identifying the best strategy for future accommodation of development in and around the capital.  There are, of course, special problems in that region and special urgency, but the regional dimension of planning is needed in all regions and I am aware that forward planning has, in fact, been undertaken by other regional development organisations as well.  My Department will be reviewing the happenings and the needs in this area.  There is a provision of £125,000 for assistance for the regional development organisations in 1983.  £50,000 of this is earmarked <Col N="1127" /> as a contribution to the eastern region study to which I have referred, leaving £75,000 for grants towards the general operating costs of the nine organisations. This is £25,000 more than in 1983, so that I will, in fact, be providing a stronger measure of support in this area than has been done in recent years.</P>
    <P>The introduction of fees for planning applications and appeals is in line with the approach of the previous Government. The considerable cost of operation of the development control system, involving processing of planning applications by local planning authorities and of appeals by An Bord Pleanála, has hitherto been borne by the public at large.  It is reasonable and equitable that the persons and interests who utilise the system and have the benefit of it should make some contribution to the costs involved. The fees which have been introduced are designed to achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>There have been some criticisms, and this is to be expected.  It would be nice not to have to impose any charges.  I believe, however, that the scheme of planning fees is fair and reasonable and will come to be seen that way.  But if there are unsatisfactory elements in the scheme, and this emerges with experience, I am prepared to take account of them and, if necessary, to amend the scheme.</P>
    <P>In accordance with a commitment contained in the Programme for Government, priority has been given to the reestablishment of the Joint Committee on Building Land, which has now held a number of meetings.  I sincerely hope that the committee will prove an effective means of reaching consensus as to the best approach to the question of building land prices.  The Programme for Government contains a commitment to the enactment of legislation by mid-1984 on the question of building land and this remains the target.</P>
    <P>I am reviewing the action to be taken in the matters covered by the Urban Development Areas Bill and the Dublin Inner City Development Authority Bill, 1982.  I am fully aware of the particular significance of the future development of <Col N="1128" /> the Port and Docks Board site alongside the Custom House and I do not rule out the possibility of special institutional arrangements.  But I have reservations about heading into a situation in which there would be demands to set up a number of new development bodies to undertake specific tasks in various areas, and the problems which this would be likely to cause in regard to financing, duplication and so on.  I am not sure that these implications were fully thought out by the previous Government.  This seems to be reflected, for example, in the issues which had been raised about the relationship between the proposed urban development commissions and Dublin Corporation.</P>
    <P>I would like to see as much progress as possible being made to deal with the very real problems of the inner city in the most effective way possible, which is through the existing local authority and other institutions concerned.  This possibility is being examined side by side with the review of legislation to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the Dublin Inner City Group, which works under the aegis of my Department, will continue to provide financial support for projects in the Dublin inner city which lead to job provision, improvement in community, recreational and educational facilities and in social provisions.  At this stage the group has dispensed over £1.5 million under this programme, and the Estimate provides for a further £300,000 for 1983.</P>
    <P>The physical environment is a prime national resource which in recent years has rightly become the subject of increasing public attention.  As the Minister with an overall responsibility for the protection and improvement of the environment, I welcome this tendency.  Significant changes in the surroundings are taking place all the time as a result of the pressures brought about by an expanding economy, our growing population, increasing urbanisation, industrial growth, changing patterns of agriculture and increasing demands for recreational facilities.</P>
    <P>The economic growth we need to achieve increased employment and <Col N="1129" /> improved living conditions inevitably means that the environmental pressures will continue.</P>
    <P>A formal environment policy statement was issued by the previous Coalition Government in January 1982.  The main aim of this policy is the protection and improvement of the physical environment side by side with economic and social progress.  The statement of policy was an essential step in promoting the interests of the environment.  However, of itself, a policy statement will achieve nothing unless there is a commitment to specific measures to give effect to the policy aims.</P>
    <P>There is, in fact, a lot going on centrally and locally, inside the local government system and outside it, that has a bearing on the policy aims set out in the 1982 statement.  I intend that early attention should be given to assessing the adequacy of the existing programmes bearing on environmental protection and improvement taking account, in particular, of the recommendations of the Environment Council in their report &ldquo;A Policy for the Environment&rdquo;.  The aim will be to identify gaps or weaknesses in environmental programmes so that whatever action is needed to deal with them may be undertaken. I am also proceeding with examination of the adequacy of the legislation relating to pollution control with a similar objective in mind.</P>
    <P>Another important development taking place is the preparation by An Foras Forbartha in association with my Department of a first report on the state of the environment.  This report will provide a factual account of the condition of our environmental resources so that we can take heed of undesirable trends and take corrective action.  I hope to see this report completed shortly.</P>
    <P>I was very glad to announce recently that £10 million is available for environmental works to be undertaken by local authorities this year.  Of this provision, £8 million is being financed by the Youth Employment Agency with the balance of £2 million coming from Subhead G of my Department's Vote.  I have notified local authorities of allocations aggregating £8 million.  It is important that the employment <Col N="1130" /> should be beneficial not just in terms of numbers of jobs created but also the quality of work and of the work experience.  I have stressed to local authorities the importance of developing the training and educational aspects of their work programmes in association with the appropriate authorities in their areas.</P>
    <P>A further allocation of £2 million is being made available from which funds will be allocated to local authorities for particular projects which will provide suitable training, work experience and temporary employment for eligible young persons in areas of particularly high youth employment.  Projects selected will be of a longer-term nature than those normally associated with the environment improvement scheme and the local authorities have been invited to submit proposals.</P>
    <P>I want to emphasise my commitment to the settlement programme for travelling people.  To that end, I will ensure that my Department continue to give every assistance and encouragement to local authorities to provide accommodation for travellers, whether in conventional houses, in special schemes or on halting sites.  This year £1.5 million is being made available under subhead S mainly to provide 100 per cent subsidy to local authorities for capital projects and 90 per cent recoupment of the salaries and expenses of social workers employed in the programme.  A sum of £1.25 million of non-voted capital is also provided to finance new schemes of accommodation.</P>
    <P>The Travelling People Review Group, which was set up jointly by the Ministers for the Environment and Health in January 1981, presented their report on 4 May. The report contains a detailed analysis of all aspects of existing policies, programmes and services which relate to the travellers and recommends a series of programmes involving action in the areas of accommodation, education, employment, health, social welfare and so on.  A Government review body, composed of the Ministers of State at the Departments of the Environment, Justice, Finance, Labour, Health, Social Welfare and Education has been established to ensure <Col N="1131" /> urgent consideration of the recommendations in the report and to identify those which are capable of implementation in the current financial situation.  The review body is under the chairmanship of the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.</P>
    <P>My own direct area of concern is, of course, the question of accommodation for travellers.  There have been real achievements in this area but these have been masked by the fact that the number of traveller families doubled in the past 20 years.  The count taken last November showed that 1,102 families were then in occupation of standard houses and a further 360 families were living either in chalets or trailers on authorised sites or halts.  On the debit side, however, we have to face the fact that the number of roadside families continues to rise and last November, stood at 1,387.  Besides, there are great discrepancies in achievement in different areas.</P>
    <P>There is heavy emphasis by the review body on standard housing as the predominant method of approach to settlement and this is very much in line with the policy which I have been pursuing.  On receiving the results of the 1982 count, I wrote to each city and county manager asking for intensification of effort in the accommodation programme and stressed that every traveller who applies for a house should be given full consideration in accordance with the statutory schemes of letting priorities.  I have also asked the managers to ensure that travellers get whatever assistance they need in making applications for housing.  My Department are now examining the detailed recommendations in regard to housing and other accommodation which were made by the review body and I will ensure that no time is lost in establishing an implementation programme.</P>
    <P>There are a considerable number of other expenditure items in my Department's Vote which I have not time to deal with but details are available in Part III of the Vote.  Areas not covered by me include subhead H (recoupment of expenditure in respect of the Register of Electors), An Foras Forbartha, malicious <Col N="1132" /> injuries, grants for the public library service, miscellaneous services in subhead Y such as grants to the Irish Water Safety Association and the Water Pollution Advisory Council.  The receipts for Appropriations-in-Aid are set out in subhead Z and are self-explanatory.</P>
    <P>I would have liked to go into more detail on some of the items in the Department's Vote but I do not wish to take up too much time so that Deputies who may wish to speak may have an opportunity to do so.  If Deputies want further information on any of the subheads in the Vote I will obtain it for them.  Overall, the voted expenditure, together with the non-voted expenditure and the income of local authorities, amounts to a very large sum of money which must be used in the most efficient manner for the benefit of the whole community.  It is my objective to achieve this.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Aire Comhshaoil agus comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis ar seo an chéad ócáid dó ag cur Meastachán a Roinne os comhair na Dála.  Mar a dúirt sé féin ag a dheireadh, tá a lán cúramaí éagsúla faoi sa Roinn seo agus is dóigh nach raibh seans aige san óráid a thug sé uaidh plé faoi gach uile ghné de chúramaí a Roinne.  Mar sin féin tá brón orm nár dhúirt sé tada faoi cheantair thábhachtacha a thagann faoina chúram. Níor dhúirt sé aon fhocal amháin faoi na ceantair Ghaeltachta a thagann faoina chúram chomh maith.  Cé go gceapann a lán b'fhéidir gurb é seo cúram Aire na Gaeltachta, leis an fhírinne a rá tá i fhad níos mó tionchair ag an Aire Comhshaoil ar fhorbairt agus áiseanna agus seirbhísí éagsúla síos sna ceantair sin ná mar atá ag Aire na Gaeltachta féin.  Is dóigh go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó airgid le caitheamh ag an Aire Comhshaoil don na ceantair sin ná ag aon Aire eile.  Tá mé ag rá seo chun a chur ina luí ar an Aire cé chomh tábhachtach is atá sé go mbeadh a fhios aige faoi na deacrachtaí speisialta atá sna ceantair Ghaeltachta, agus go bhfuil gá le leigheas éigin ar na deacrachtaí sin.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is dóigh gur ceist staire é go bhfuil na Gaeltachtaí lonnaithe in áiteacha iargúlta.  Dá bharr sin tá easpa áiseanna <Col N="1133" /> agus easpa shaibhris sna ceantair sin. Muna bhfuil tuiscint ag an Aire Comhshaoil cad iad na deacrachtaí agus go bhfuil gá len iad a shárú, feictear domsa nach ndéanfar aon rud fúthu.  Ba mhaith liom a chur ina luí ar an ócáid seo sa Dáil go bhfuil mé ag iarraidh air i fhad níos mó ama a chaitheamh ag breathnú ar na ceantair thábhachtacha seo agus ag freastal orthu, agus tá mé ag iarraidh air níos mó airgid, más féidir leis, a chur ar fáil chun cuid mhaith de na deacrachtaí sin a leigheas.  Cé go bhfuil cúram títhíochta i gcoitinne, ó thaobh dheontas de, ar Aire na Gaeltachta, ó thaobh bhóithre, uisce, séarachais, pleanála is é an tAire Comhshaoil atá freagrach as feidhmiú na scéimeanna sin.  Tuigim go bhfuil cuireadh faighte ag an Aire, ní amháin uair amháin ach roinnt uaireanta, ó dhaoine i nGaeltacht na Gaillimhe teacht anuas agus droch-staid na mbóithre a fheiceáil dó féin ionas go mbeidh airgead faoi leith á chur ar fáil sna Meastacháin don bhliain seo chun tosnú ceart a dhéanamh ar na bóithre sin a dheisiú.

      <P>The Minister for the Environment is the spokesman in the Cabinet for the construction industry, which is the second largest industry in the country.  His Department expend about one-third of the Public Capital Programme.  All physical planning development comes under his control, all the planning legislation and the building by-laws.  I am glad to see the Minister is now promising the House legislation on the by-laws.  That has been in gestation for the past 14 years and it is time it was written into our legislation. Roads and the sanitary services also come under the wing of the Minister for the Environment.  Many of the other developments affecting the construction industry, although not directly the Minister's responsibility outside of normal Cabinet responsibility for all matters, come under him.  He is the one person sitting at the Cabinet table who is there on behalf of the construction industry, who carries the general brief for the building industry. The state of the construction industry has long been the barometer for the economy in general.  It is accepted that a thriving construction sector indicates that the national economy is in a healthy state and, of course, <i>vice versa.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The construction industry is in a state bordering on collapse at the moment. Builder after builder throughout the country is going out of business.  Over <Col N="1135" /> 40,000 building workers have been made redundant.  The future looks very bleak. The industry and the country look to the Minister for the Environment and the Cabinet to deal decisively with the serious problems and to guide the industry away from the danger of imminent collapse. The Minister's response has been pathetic.  The half page reference to the building industry is the most pathetic response the construction industry has seen to its problems in recent years.  I am sure the industry will be very disappointed to see the matter treated in such a cavalier fashion by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Worse still, the Cabinet response has exacerbated the situation.  A sum of £220 million was cut out of the Public Capital Programme published by the previous Government.  Crippling new tax impositions have been introduced creating massive disincentives to investment.  This once proud industry is in disarray.  It is pathetic to hear the Minister speak of the drop in private investment in the construction industry and state that the Government cannot take up all the slack with public investment.  The Government have cut back on the Public Capital Programme and, as I will outline shortly, have introduced a whole range of disincentives which are driving this industry to the wall.  Nobody in the Government seems to care.  The word is out that official policy is to let the industry wither, to reduce the permanent work force in the construction industry by 50 per cent.  The Government have taken several important steps to achieve this objective.  I will list them.  I have 14 points which will illustrate clearly action taken by the Government which has acted as a disincentive to the construction industry.</P>
    <P>First is the reduction I have mentioned already of £220 million in the Public Capital Programme.  This is outlined in the booklet, <i>Budget 1983,</i> which on page 60 gives information which was not given in the speech of the Minister for Finance to the House on budget day.  Very little information was given on that occasion in the Minister's speech which was broadcast to the nation, but the sad information was disclosed in detail afterwards in the <Col N="1136" /> document <i>Principal Features of the Budget.</i> On page 60 of the booklet &mdash; which contains all these documents and speeches &mdash; details are given of this reduction of £220 million.  It is important that they be written into the record of this House, seeing that the Minister for Finance on budget day did not think it worth his while to disclose to the country the savage cuts he was imposing.  These cuts are under four headings: sectoral economic investment, productive infrastructure, global contingency provision and social infrastructure.</P>
    <P>Under the first, sectoral economic investment, the cuts were as follows: agriculture £16 million, industry £6 million, tourism £1 million, fisheries £2 million, forestry £1 million, miscellaneous £1 million, making a total of £27 million. Under the second heading, productive infrastructure, the cuts were as follows: energy £1 million, transport £4 million, roads, sanitary services etc. £18 million &mdash; the Minister passed over this very lightly in his address to the House today &mdash; telecommunications etc. another £18 million, making a total of £41 million. The global contingency provision of £120 million was removed completely by the Government.  Under the fourth heading, social infrastructure, housing suffered a reduction of £13 million, education £5 million, health £2 million, Government construction £12 million, making a total of £32 million.  The overall total is the £220 million which I have mentioned. There we have positive, clear indication of the Government's intent to wither this industry, to withdraw investment from it.</P>
    <P>Step No. 2 was the non-implementation of the £120 million projects mentioned in the Programme for Government which was published by the Fine Gael and Labour Parties after their meeting when they made arrangements to enter into Government.  On page 6 of this now infamous document, this record of broken promises, it is stated: &ldquo;There are a number of cases involving, we believe, up to a further £100 million of projects in which infrastructural work can be usefully undertaken&rdquo;.  The Minister also made similar promises to building unions when he met them, saying that he would <Col N="1137" /> see to it that an additional £100 million would be made available for the construction industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is just another indication of giving impressions and making promises which create expectations which when not realised have a very bad effect and act as a further disincentive and sap the confidence in this industry which, as the Minister knows, is reeling from the lack of investment and the lack of confidence and wondering where its future will lead it.  There was no mention of any details in the Minister's speech today or in the speech of the Minister for Finance on budget day as to how the £100 million would be expended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I move on to the next major move by the Government which is acting as a disincentive to investment in this industry. I do not want to delay too long on these points as there are 14 in all but it is important to get them on the record of the House.  The third is the abolition of the employment incentive scheme for the construction industry.  That scheme, which gave financial incentive to increase employment and had been helpful to stimulating job creation in the industry, was abolished by the Minister's Government. Fourthly, the abolition of the residence-related tax incentive scheme was discontinued from 6 April last.  It provided the construction industry with a useful incentive which resulted in <Col N="1139" /> investment.  That was withdrawn.  Fifthly, fees for CRVs were increased by 50 per cent.  Sixth, new planning charges estimated to take about £6 million out of the construction industry have also been introduced.</P>
    <P>Seventh, he proposed the introduction of development levies &mdash; which have been estimated by the construction industry as running as high as £10,000 per acre if the levies are as the Government intend &mdash; to recoup the full cost of services provided and which in itself could add up to £800 to the price of a new house.  No. 8 on my list is VAT which the Government increased by 2 per cent to 5 per cent on construction.  That has had a very bad effect on the industry, adding an estimated £700 to the cost of a new house. No. 9, restriction on mortgage interest relief would bring about a reduction in the cash flow to building societies by eliminating certain aspects of the incentive to invest with the building societies.  That is a very retrograde step.  No. 10 is the impact of the PRSI increases.  Wage bills in the construction industry are estimated to increase by about 3 per cent arising from those increases.  This is a further financial burden imposed by increasing costs by way of Government action.</P>
    <P>The eleventh point is the Housing Finance Agency.  The Government decided to reduce the allocation to this agency by £10 million.  This will reduce the number of loans that can be made available by the Housing Finance Agency by about 500 at a time when there is a serious drop in the number of loan approvals.</P>
    <P>The twelfth point is the failure to increase the number of planning inspectors to facilitate a speeding up in dealing with planning appeals lying with An Bord Pleanála, to which I will refer later on. There is very little point in the Minister being critical in his speech of the backlog of planning appeals awaiting decision with An Bord Pleanála.  He quoted a figure which applied about five years ago shortly after the board were set up when there were 15 planning inspectors, and I was told yesterday in answer to a parliamentary question that there are still only <Col N="1140" /> 15 planning inspectors.  In the first full year of the operation of An Bord Pleanála there were only 15 planning inspectors and the Minister now decries the fact that they are not turning out more decisions and that there is a backlog. If he looks at the statistics he will see that his argument does not stand up.  If he is anxious, as we all are, that planning appeals should be dealt with more expeditiously, then the obvious way to deal with it is to increase the number of planning inspectors.</P>
    <P>My thirteenth point is the failure to alter the clawback and provision of stock relief in the construction industry, which is in serious decline, and the Minister has not denied this.  The 1975 Finance Act, which introduced stock relief to combat the burden of carrying stock increases during a period of inflation, is the only major tax relief available to the construction industry.  In contrast, all other manufacturing industries obtain the benefit of a 10 per cent rate of corporation tax and grants towards re-equipment.  The output of the private sector of the construction industry is now in decline and, as the stock relief legislation is worded at present, any decline in a company's stock levels results in a clawback of stock relief and deferred tax granted in previous years.  Any funds available as a result of stock relief in previous years has become part of the working capital base and has been used to create investment in building, jobs in the private development of industrial estates, shopping, office and housing projects.</P>
    <P>In 1983 construction companies, large and small, are finding trading conditions difficult.  Both turnover and gross profit margins are falling steeply.  Many companies in the industry will show net losses for 1983.  Many have already gone out of business and others have been forced to implement redundancies of experienced staff and short-term working in an effort to maintain as many jobs as possible.  The compound effect of stock relief clawbacks because of declining turnover, at a time when cash flow and profits are at an all time low, can be devastating.  The system of clawback of past relief on a reduction in stock has the effect of clawing <Col N="1141" /> back in one year relief which may have been obtained over many years. This is particularly savage since on subsequent increases in stock no relief is available with regard to the relief previously clawed back on the drop in stock levels.  For a number of major firms in the industry borrowing to meet the tax clawback will create a problem so acute that, combined with the reduction in business levels, major redundancies will occur and the sale of assets necessary for the running of business will be ineviable. For two years up to 5 April 1975 stock relief was permanent, but since then relief is temporary.  I should like to impress on the Minister that it is vital for the Government to introduce legislation making stock relief permanent unless a company's trade becomes negligible or ceases.</P>
    <P>My fourteenth point is the failure on the part of the Government to increase house grants and to alter the amount of loans and the income limits for loans. These need to be increased to a realistic figure in line with inflation and wage increases.  There has been no indication from the Government that they intend to take any steps in that regard and the ever-widening gap for young married couples seeking to purchase homes is presenting a great obstacle.  The Government are delaying the making of that decision, resulting in a falling off in demand for houses, in greater unemployment in the industry and adding to the further depression which this industry is already suffering.</P>
    <P>I regret it but I am duty bound to accuse the Government of deliberately setting out to destroy the construction industry.  History repeats itself.  The periods of the 1951 Coalition, the 1974 Coalition and their present period in office have been disastrous for the construction industry.  In former years unemployed workers emigrated, but now there is no place for them except the dole queue or the black economy, which presents us with further problems.  An enlightened Government would introduce measures to restore confidence and incentives to encourage investment.  We sat today listening for an hour to the Minister for the <Col N="1142" /> Environment, who has the primary responsibility in Cabinet for the construction industry.  Not one idea or positive suggestion emanated during the course of his speech which would bring any hope to the depressed industry and to the thousands who are unemployed.  The industry has sought to bring its plight to the attention of the Minister on numerous occasions. In my own constituency in Galway there are now 14,048 unemployed building workers, an enormous increase on the figures of past years.  The construction industry estimate that that figure will increase to 1,700 by June because of closures, the falling off in investment and the many measures which the Government have introduced adding to the depressed state of this industry.</P>
    <P>A dangerous trend has emerged in regard to finance through the various agencies for house building.  The principal ones were named by the Minister &mdash; local authority loans and the new Housing Finance Agency, but the main one is the building societies.  The number of loan approvals has taken a fairly dramatic drop.  This is very ominous and I should like to draw it to the Minister's attention in the hope that some incentives will be introduced and that some of the disincentives brought in will be dropped from the Finance Bill.  I hope new incentives will be introduced to encourage private investment in the building societies.  At present the opposite is the case: in 1979 there were 19,509 loan approvals, which was reduced in 1982 to 15,255.  That is a very disturbing trend as the number of loan approvals is a fair indication of the level of activity in the house building industry.  That steady drop in the number of approvals confirms the crisis which has hit that industry.</P>
    <P>Local authority loans have dropped severely.  The financial provision made by the Minister shows that.  Local authority loans approved in 1980 were 10,381.  That figure dropped in 1982 to 7,595.  There is the same trend &mdash; a drop in the amount of loans, resulting in a drop in the number of houses to be built, resulting in further depression in this industry about which I am speaking, and about which the Government seem to care so little.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> A very disturbing change in the availability of finance is to be seen in the trend of loans approved by life assurance companies. I had hoped that the Minister would make more reference to this matter than he did.  Life assurance companies were a source of house purchase loans for many years, but their activities in this respect have shown a serious decline over the past number of years.</P>
    <P>In 1968-69, 2,286 loans were approved by life assurance companies.  In 1972-73, that figure dropped to 1,534.  In 1977, it dropped to 814.  In 1982, only 280 house loans were approved by life assurance companies.  The Minister should request the assurance companies to review urgently their policy and plans in relation to housing investment and encourage them to expand the level of such investment. The trend was towards a drop of about 5,000 in loan approvals between 1981 and 1982.  Were it not for the establishment of the Housing Finance Agency which had loan approvals of 1,845, the position would be now a lot worse.  There is still a drop of approximately 3,000 in the number of loan approvals.  I cannot see how the Minister expects to achieve his target of constructing 30,000 houses in any one year.  Funds are not being encouraged into the house building industry due to various Government measures and taxes, all resulting in a massive disincentive to investment to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>One of the major matters of contention in the local authority areas is the question of introducing charges for services.  On 7 July 1983 the Minister issued a circular in which it is stated that it is not possible at this stage to give a precise indication of the grants to be paid to local authorities <i>in lieu</i> of domestic rates and agricultural rates.  Will the estimates which were given as an indication in the circular be increased during the remainder of this year?  I should like the Minister to clear that up, because the tone of the circular suggested that they were merely indications. It seems to have emerged subsequently that that is it, and there is no more coming.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to state also <Col N="1144" /> what criteria are used by him in determining the amount of the fixed grant.  If no fixed formula is adopted, the Minister has complete discretion each year to vary the amount, thus putting a greater onus on local authorities to increase charges to make up the shortfall.  I recommend that a base figure should be established now, establishing the fixed grant and each year the Minister may increase the fixed grant in line with inflation.  This would give local authorities an incentive to broaden their revenue base, to increase charges for services and for the introduction of new charges.  As the revenue thus generated would be available to enable local authorities to meet their full financial commitments, local authorities would be able to plan for the future with some confidence.  At present they are staggering half way through each financial year before they know what money will be made available.  This is most undesirable and demoralising, and it defeats any attempt to operate on an efficient basis.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment have been pulverising local authorities in recent years.  The removal of domestic rates was approved by Fianna Fáil and Coalition Governments.  Their removal was signalled well in advance.  Fianna Fáil signalled it in 1973.  The Coalition signalled it in 1976.  The only difference was that the Coalition proposed to phase out domestic rates and started in that year with a 25 per cent reduction.  The intention was to remove them completely over a four year period.  Therefore their removal was signalled well in advance.</P>
    <P>Despite the time allowed to devise procedures for the removal of domestic rates, in my view a very crude device was used.  The Minister stipulated the limit to the amount of rate increase which could be levied.  In 1982, the Minister undertook to pay less than the full amount of this domestic rate.  There was a shortfall of £12 million in the Coalition's budget in that year.  They were defeated in this House on that budget and we went to the country.  Subsequently it was implemented by the Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    <P>This shortfall was further aggravated in 1982 when the courts deemed agricultural valuations unconstitutional and <Col N="1145" /> farmers withheld agricultural rates, further increasing the financial shortfall in nearly every local authority area.  The Minister has not made any allocations to reimburse the local authorities for the shortfall in 1982.  It is not good enough to instruct local authorities to increase charges and introduce new charges in May, to generate revenue to make up for a shortfall in 1982 revenue, and further massive shortfalls in 1983.  The total shortfall is calculated by the Minister at £65 million.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Environment should act as a benign umbrella organisation for the local authorities, setting policy guidelines, assisting co-ordinated policy implementation, and ensuring equitable distribution of State funding of capital works programmes of local authorities and funds <i>in lieu</i> of domestic rates and agricultural rates.  Local authority councillors are entitled to know where they stand <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Department They should know with some certainty the system for financing them in future years.</P>
    <P>Otherwise &mdash; and I say this sincerely &mdash; I can see many elected councillors of long standing opting out through sheer frustration.  Financial allocations should be known in each local authority area by 1 January each year.  I appeal to the Minister to clear up the mess which has been created by stating clearly what the method of financing local authorities will be in future years.  It is essential that the fixed grant <i>in lieu</i> of domestic rates and agricultural rates should be increased by a uniform amount in line with inflation each year, with 1982 as the base year. This would enable local communities to identify the proposed new charges as relating directly to the provision of a service from which they will actually benefit.</P>
    <P>It is imperative that the decisions on the levying of charges for services should be reserved functions.  In other words, the elected members must be the people to decide whether charges will be made and, if so, the amount of such charges. The Minister used some fine, flowing phrases praising local democracy and the need to devolve responsibility to the local <Col N="1146" /> authorities.  For some years I have been listening to and reading Estimate speeches by Ministers for the Environment. I contributed to some of them myself in the past.  All of us must say &ldquo;mea culpa&rdquo; for expressing these wishes and not doing enough to implement them.  From whatever experience I may have gained in the years which elapsed since I was in the Minister's position I can excuse my own lack of adequate action in this area &mdash; I did take some &mdash; but although all Ministers down the years indicated that they subscribed to the notion of devolving authority from the Department to local authorities very little devolution of power of any significance has taken place.  I urge the Minister to get on with that job immediately.  If he waits, time will pass him by.  He should grasp the nettle now and do what all local representatives say needs to be done.  The Minister, who has the unique distinction of continuing as a member of a local authority while Minister for the Environment &mdash; we hope that comes to an end very soon &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Fianna Fáil will fight with all vigour any effort to give authority to county managers to decide on the local levies or charges.  We subscribe fully to the concept of a devolution of power to local councillors in this regard.  That carries with it the right to decide whether they introduce charges or not and also to decide the level of the charges they will introduce.  We will oppose any attempt to make that an executive function, to give a county manager absolute power to decide on the level of charges.  I should like to ask the Minister to clear up the confusion which exists in this area.  I do <Col N="1147" /> not think he will have an opportunity of replying to this debate for some time but he can deal with that query by way of a statement to the newspapers.  He should outline the Government's intentions as contained in the published Bill.  I accept that the legislation is expected to come before the Dáil next week, but Fianna Fáil would like to know the Minister's intention before it is debated.  If it is the intention of the Minister to make the extent of levies and charges an executive function Fianna Fáil will seek to amend that in the Bill.  Inquiries I have made about this matter confirm that that is the Minster's intention.  To save me going around in circles I should like to ask the Minister if it is his intention to make it an executive function.</P>

      <P>The Minister is not giving me the information I require but he must realise that Fianna Fáil will propose amendments to the new Bill if the intention is to make all decisions in regard to the imposition of charges a reserved function. Elected members are answerable to the public.  Charges are a form of local taxation and should not be imposed at the will of a bureaucrat who does not have to face the judgment of the electorate. The new Bill, which is expected to be brought before the House next week, is a radical change from the provisions in the City and County Management Acts and Local Government Acts.  The type of charges levied in certain local authority areas under those Acts were minor and of little consequence.  They caused little pain to those who were obliged to pay them, but the Minister now proposes to introduce a whole new range of local taxation.  That is evident in the terms of the Bill which has been published.  The <Col N="1148" /> public should be made aware of that. Fianna Fáil have publicly stated that they accept the need to broaden the revenue base of local authorities but we do not agree that the power to do so should be left solely in the hands of an official, the county manager, as an executive function.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is where the responsibility must lie, with the elected representatives, and they cannot shirk their responsibility in such matters.  In former years they struck the general rate and that principle must be upheld.  Otherwise, the system will become a sham. Frustration will spread and there will not be any incentive to outstanding citizens to offer themselves for election to local authorities.  It is the wish of my party that local government is made as meaningful as possible and that leading members in local communities are encouraged to offer themselves for election to local authorities.  I can see a malaise creeping in out of frustration.  People will not be encouraged to go forward for election because of the lack of authority entrusted to local bodies and the manner in which they are by-passed by the Department and officials at local level.  In fact, many councillors are having second thoughts because of the role they play.  We are now being asked to deal with a major piece of legislation as far as local authorities are concerned and members of those bodies will have to face up to their responsibilities and decide if these charges should apply in their area.  If county managers try to impose these charges there will be a lot of dissent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister to outline to the House his proposals for improving the auditing and budgeting systems of local authorities.  The Minister should tell the House if the revised estimating procedures were introduced to enable local authorities to protect in programme form their expenditure and income and the results which the expenditure was intended to achieve for a period <Col N="1149" /> of five years ahead.  If that was done, in future elected Members would be able to take a forward look at what their programmes will achieve and at the levels of expenditure and income likely to be needed to sustain their programmes as well as reviewing annually the rate of progress towards the satisfaction of local needs.  If elected members were able to plan ahead in this way it would require a much greater devolution of responsibility and decision-making to local authorities. The Minister should tell the House if he supports this forward planning proposal and whether he intends to act on the question of the devolution of power to members.</P>

    <P>An application for the approval of the hospital for the training of an annual intake of 25 student general nurses is under consideration by An Bord Altranais. In the meantime a group consisting of representatives of the Southern Health Board and my Department are identifying as a matter of urgency the nursing and other staff requirements, including <Col N="1150" /> the nurse teaching staff, necessary for the commissioning of the hospital.  I am not in a position at this time to confirm that nurse training will commence with the opening of the hospital.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that there will be a nurse training school attached to the hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Arising from the working party's report on general nursing it was suggested that there should be direct liaison between the Tralee hospital and the regional hospital in Wilton. There will be a nurse teaching staff complement in the Tralee school.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of having the best possible training in the health board area, it has been suggested that there should be a degree of liaison and integration between the Tralee hospital training school and the regional hospital in Cork.  As such that would not diminish the general facilities in the proposed nurse training school in Tralee.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the proposed intake of 25 trainee nurses per year is rather low?  Will he arrange to increase this number?  Can the Minister say when An Bord Altranais, his Department and the health board will agree on the number of tutor nurses to be employed?  There is a relationship between the number of trainee nurses taken in and the number of tutor nurses employed.  The people of Kerry are not satisfied with the intake of trainee nurses from Kerry by the Southern Health Board.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Health Education Bureau is undertaking a multifaceted national programme to alert and educate parents and young people to the dangers of all forms of substance abuse including alcohol and drugs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One element of the bureau's programme involves the training of teachers, doctors, pharmacists, career guidance counsellors, health board personnel, gardaí and clergy as drug educators. These are available to act throughout the community and particularly in schools. This aspect of the programme is aimed primarily at parents to inform them as to <Col N="1153" /> the nature and extent of the problem, equip them to guide their children away from becoming involved with drugs and train them to react appropriately, organising treatment and support if their child has a drug problem.</P>
    <P>Young people themselves must be alerted, advised and educated outside the home as to the dangers of drug abuse and the bureau is developing a programme for children based on the school environment. The bureau also organised recently a series of regional seminars on substance abuse specifically for school principals and career guidance counsellors.</P>
    <P>The bureau has recently completed the design of a special alcohol education programme for second-level schools.  The aim of this programme is to develop a responsible attitude in young people to the use of alcohol.  The programme will be made available to schools from the beginning of the next school year.</P>
    <P>The House will also be aware that the Government recently established a special Governmental Task Force on Drug Abuse because of their concern about the growing menace of drug abuse.  This taks force are to review and report on the question of drug abuse, with particular reference to the inner city area of Dublin. The Government will then decide what should be done to tackle the drug problem based on whatever recommendations are in the task force report.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the current provisions are not adequate.  I equally accept there is a serious problem in the inner city area of Dublin.  Recent public reports have confirmed that appalling problem.  Therefore, we have asked the task force of Ministers to bring forward their recommendations within the next five or six weeks.  We have placed a very urgent time scale on it.  I stress <Col N="1154" /> very emphatically that whereas drug substance abuse, particularly heroin, is a very considerable danger, there is also a major problem regarding young people and alcohol, which is far more serious because of its prevalence in the community. It does not tend to be as dramatically emphasised as heroin abuse.</P>

The opening of the Buncrana unit must be viewed in the context of the additional costs involved and the restriction on the creation of additional posts in the public service.  All health boards have been directed to achieve a 2 per cent reduction in the numbers employed on 31 March 1983 as compared with the number employed on 21 July 1981.  Consequently, the opening of this unit would depend on the ability of the North-Western Health Board to redeploy existing staff and resources.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, in 1977 the health board put forward a proposal to the Department which involved the decentralisation of the facilities at St. Joseph's Hospital in Stranorlar, following which the building would be used as a residential centre for 100 to 150 adult mentally handicapped persons.  Then the proposal to use St. Joseph's for mentally handicapped was accepted in principle by the Department depending on the progress that could be made with proposals for the provision of places for the elderly who were being accommodated elsewhere.  Last December I gave approval for 15 posts to enable <Col N="1157" /> the first phase of the accommodation of the mentally handicapped to be commissioned. It is envisaged in relation to St. Joseph's that 26 residential places will be provided.  It is intended that the initial intake of 11 persons will be from the community, thus reducing the number on the waiting list.  A further 15 adults will be admitted from St. Conal's Psychiatric Hospital in Letterkenny, or from residential centres outside the region.  I think the health board are making progress in relation to the 46 mentally handicapped persons.</P>

      <P>Why is it necessary to give so many beds to people already in residential care?  The priority must be those who are waiting in the community.

      <P>There has been a very difficult situation in Donegal because up to now there have not been any special residential facilities for the adult mentally handicapped there.

      <P>While I appreciate that ideally the patients from St. Conal's should be transferred to a unit specially for the handicapped, would the Minister not consider that priority must be given to those in the community who are not, and never have been, in residential care? Because of this further development it will be possible to transfer patients from St. Conal's.  Those in the community who need residential care should be given priority, but the Minister tells us they will not get even 50 per cent of the places.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for the Southern Health Board.</P>
      <P>In October 1982 the health board made arrangements to accommodate patients from this hospital's pre-convalescent and orthopaedic units, which were underused, in one unit and to close the 14-bed orthopaedic unit.  The health board's purpose in the short term was to use the staff thus released to substitute for staff on holiday or sick leave and to eliminate the need to employ additional staff for relief duty.  The health board, like all health agencies, have been asked to reduce the numbers of staff employed by 2 per cent by 31 March 1983 and in these circumstances they have decided that the orthopaedic unit in Edenburn Hospital will not be re-opened during 1983.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the severe hardship which is likely to be caused to many low income families by his decision, which was announced on 1 March 1983, to increase by 43 per cent, the amount which non-medical cardholders must pay for drugs each month before being eligible for a refund; and the steps he proposes to take to ensure that the health of persons in this category is not endangered by inabilility to meet the additional costs involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the increase of £7 per month in drugs expenditure per family which will not be refunded by health boards will not cause any hardship to the vast majority of families. In the very exceptional case where undue hardship might arise it is open to patients to apply to health boards for a medical card.  I am confident that such applications will receive very sympathetic consideration and that health boards will make every effort to alleviate any such hardship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>To my surprise the <Col N="1162" /> number of complaints and representations I received in relation to this scheme, which is now limited to £8 million per annum, has been exceptionally small.  If hardship was imposed on any family the health board speedily responded and made every arrangement to facilitate those involved.  Naturally families had to produce evidence of income.  If the Deputy knows of any case where there is undue hardship, he should go to the health board and have their application reviewed.  This year £8 million has been made available and so far we have been able to cope with any hardship cases brought to our attention.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the Government's policy of refunding expenditure on drugs above a certain level to non-medical cardholders can end up costing the State more than if they had been medical cardholders and entitled to drugs free?  Am I correct in saying that at the present drugs supplied free to medical cardholders are charged to the State by the pharmacist at the wholesale price, plus a dispensing fee per item, whereas the drugs supplied to non-medical cardholders are charged by the pharmacist at the wholesale price plus his mark up charge &mdash; which can be up to 100 per cent &mdash; plus a prescription charge?

However, I assure the Deputy that, if he knows of any case of exceptional hardship being caused to any family in that regard, the health board will readily renew the provision.  As the Deputy knows, the scheme applies to non-medical cardholders.</P>

Would the Minister accept that his Government removed the £5 charge at hospital outpatients' departments for non-medical cardholders at a cost of £5 million and in order to recoup this £5 million they reduced the amount available under the drugs refund scheme from £13 million to £8 million?  The result of that has been to create major hardship for a number of people who are obliged every month to pay £7 extra for their drugs, whereas those using outpatients' services need only pay £5 either once or twice per annum at most.</P>

      <P>According to information supplied to my Department by the Garda Síochána, the total number of deaths caused by paraquat poisoning in the five-year period from 1978 to 1982 was 63.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Poisons Regulations, 1982, which came into effect on 1 March 1983, incorporate stringent controls in relation to this substance provided for in earlier regulations.  Paraquat may be sold only by pharmacists or other persons licensed by the health boards.  It may only be sold for use in agriculture, horticulture or forestry and may not be sold to any person who is not known by the seller or who is not certified in a manner provided for in the regulations as being a person entitled to purchase such preparation.  A record <Col N="1165" /> has to be kept of each sale of paraquat and must include the name and address of the purchaser.</P>
    <P>Paraquat must also be sold in its original sealed container.  It must have the words &ldquo;poison&rdquo; legibly written on the label and also the following warning:</P>
    <P>Keep out of the reach of children. Do not re-pack from this container. Destroy container when empty. </P>
    <P>There have been no cases of deaths resulting from the use of paraquat in accordance with the manufacturers' instructions and I cannot see that any tighter restrictions which I might apply to its sale would materially alter the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no breakdown as to age groups, but my information for 1981 showed that there were six cases of suicide, one accident case and two uncertain cause cases.  That gives a total of nine persons killed by paraquat in 1981.  In 1982, there were seven cases of suicide and one uncertain cause case, giving a total of eight.  However, the reduction has been considerable.  In 1978, there were 11 suicide cases and a total of 22 persons died.  In 1979, 12 persons died and in 1980, 12 persons died.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.  I presume that the Deputy's question has been prompted by my recent address to Comhairle na nOspidéal.  In the course of that address I referred to the very serious financial circumstances of the country, the need to reassess our priorities, and to redeploy our resources in the most effective manner possible.</P>
      <P>I stated that in the current situation Comhairle na nOspidéal would be obliged to assess the manner in which they carry out their functions.  I questioned the realism of the comhairle continuing to consider and approve appointments which cannot be funded in the foreseeable future and suggested that the comhairle, working with my Department, must adopt a revised approach to the processing of applications, both for new and replacement posts.</P>
      <P>I indicated to the comhairle that I would be instructing the health agencies that, prior to the making of applications to the comhairle, my Department must be consulted as to the financial implications. This will involve an assessment of the full costs of the application &mdash; not just the costs of the appointment itself but also the costs which could possibly arise from resultant requirements in other categories of staff, and in accommodation and facilities.  Agencies will be required to indicate if the additional costs involved can be borne by the agencies themselves from within their agreed budgets.  If the agencies cannot carry the additional costs, my Department will discuss with them the possibility of making funds available on the basis of the absolute requirements of the particular service involved and the options and alternatives that might be available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also told the comhairle that I would expect them to require agencies making application for posts to include in their submission an account of the outcome of their consultations with my Department. This arrangement does not hinder agencies in making applications to comhairle, nor does it represent any change in the <Col N="1167" /> essential role of the comhairle.  I have now formally instructed the health agencies to proceed in future along the lines I have indicated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely this represents a major change in the role of the comhairle? The comhairle had the statutory responsibility for regulating consultant appointments.  From the Minister's reply, am I right in taking it that in future appointments will have to be sanctioned by his Department before they can be made?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect it will mean that before the comhairle take the decision in relation to any application all the cost implications will be totally known to the Department, the comhairle and the health agency concerned &mdash; for the very simple reason that we have at the moment about 78 such applications and I have no money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister has no money, but surely this is interfering with the role of the comhairle and that it is a major change in their role that the Minister should take this attitude. The comhairle were set up and given statutory responsibility to regulate the consultant appointments.  Surely it is a major change in that role that the health boards now have first to go to the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious problem that any such appointment can vary in cost from £30,000 to £40,000 per appointment, up to £½ million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not been able to work out an average because the data has not been kept.  But one might be talking of at least £250,000.  Frankly, in a situation in which we are spending £1,000 million a year and, for every consultant one appoints, one has to appoint a battery of back-up staff, beds, accommodation and facilities, the implications of every appointment must now be absolutely known to each health board, to each voluntary health hospital, to each agency.  Above all we in the Department have to know <Col N="1168" /> what we are doing in terms of future revenue implications.  It is mainly in that line; it is not to cut across the statutory powers of An Chomhairle.  Comhairle na nOspidéal still retain the statutory power of appointment.  That is a necessary and eminently reasonable proposal.  I do not propose to interfere with that.  But, as far as the money is concerned, I have to find the money; they make the appointment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>One must accept that there is a change in their role.  In relation to the last part of the Minister's reply, does the Minister accept that there is a change in the role of An Chomhairle and that he himself is justifying it on its financial implications?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a change in so far as everybody, from now on, members of An Chomhairle, Departmental staffs and the administrators of the health services, will know the cost to the last penny, as far as I am concerned, of every appointment and the continuing implications of those appointments.  I am strongly of the view that, in the past, that discipline did not apply because we have now reached a plateau in many respects in terms of health expenditure.  It has been growing at a phenomenal rate and the taxpayer at large is just not prepared to put up any more money.</P>

      <P>The number of cases of infectious diseases notified to my Department under the Infectious Diseases Regulations, 1981, does not represent the true incidence of these diseases. Despite the fact that the diseases are under-notified, the current level of reporting does enable my Department and the health boards to monitor trends in the incidence of the diseases, based on which appropriate interventions may be initiated.</P>
      <P>Ideally, however, information regarding infectious diseases should be as comprehensive as possible and, with the objective of improving notification and reporting, my Department recently reviewed the appropriate procedures. Following this review, a comprehensive circular was issued to the health boards on 7 March last laying down revised guidelines designed to facilitate the collection and dissemination of detailed information regarding infectious diseases.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that, under the 1981 regulations, medical practitioners, including family doctors and hospital doctors, are obliged to notify the local DCC, and MOH on a regular weekly basis of cases, or suspected cases, of notifiable diseases seen by them.  Then the MOH, in turn, compiles a return in respect of his community care area and submits this return to the Department of Health every week.  We then compile a national return of the diseases on the basis of the returns furnished from the various community care areas.  We circulate national weekly returns back to the health boards, to all the community care teams and to the other appropriate personnel.  Medical practitioners are also <Col N="1170" /> paid to do it.  There have been some very old fees obtaining, for example, 12½p for each disease, except venereal disease and tuberculosis, for which for some reason a fee of 25p was payable.  I up-dated the whole lot.  Arising from a review carried out I am now paying a notification fee of £1.50 for each case or suspected case.  I have up-dated the other regulations.  As and from this year I think there will be a very considerable improvement.  I am gravely concerned about some diseases, for example, the under-notification in relation to venereal disease, indeed its massive under-notification in this country. The framework has to be tightened up very considerably.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the orthodontic services available to the South Eastern Health Board; and if he has satisfied himself with the level of such service in view of the number of patients waiting for treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>At present the health board provides orthodontic treatment for some patients through its own dental staff while some other cases are referred to extern orthodontists in private practice for treatment on a fee basis.  The level of the service is not very satisfactory at present but it should be greatly improved with the filling of the approved post of full-time consultant orthodontist to the health board concerned for which it is expected that applications will shortly be invited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not quite answer the question I put to him.  Surely he must be aware of the grave concern, particularly on the part of the parents whose children, particularly school children, need orthodontic treatment and that there are a few years only in which this treatment can be effectively given, that is between the ages of 12 and 15?  I have had cases of parents approaching me because their children had been waiting for three to four years for treatment. Because of the high cost involved for this very specialised treatment &mdash; between £700 and £800 &mdash; these people cannot afford to have it undertaken by private practitioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that as of February 1983 the situation in south Tipperary was singularly bad, there being 400 on the waiting list and the average waiting time being between two and four years.  Therefore, the appointment of a consultant orthodontist should alter the situation radically, because apart from <Col N="1172" /> the service that he will provide directly, dental officers of the health board will be in a position to provide certain orthodontic treatment under his direction.  This should result in a considerable improvement in the undesirable and unfortunate situation being experienced in south Tipperary.  In Waterford the waiting list has been reduced to 25 and the waiting period is between eight and 12 months, so by comparison the situation in the Deputy's constituency is singularly bad.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the critical situation in south Tipperary, would the Minister be prepared to authorise the South Eastern Health Board to allow patients attend private practitioners to have this treatment carried out in the interest of reducing the very large backlog of patients and especially in consideration of the fact that this treatment should be undertaken immediately and not delayed for four years?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being unduly critical of the Minister because this is a situation that obtained during his predecessor's time and indeed further back, but in the case of urgent need for treatment, would the Minister be prepared to authorise the health board to have the patients concerned treated by private practitioners?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will inquire into that.  It is possible to have some emergency cases and so on referred to orthodontists in private practice for treatment on an exclusive fee basis.  I will contact the Deputy again on the matter because 400 seems to be a very considerable number. If there are certain cases within that 400 in respect of which referral for private treatment might meet the need, I will ask the health board to communicate with the Deputy on the matter.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that there are more than 1,000 legitimate children in care and without any possibility of being returned to their natural parents, is it not a matter of urgency that the adoption laws be amended to provide for the adoption of such children?  Can the Minister give the House any undertaking in this regard?  Will the Children Bill deal with this matter?  I would remind the Minister that when the task force on child care were appointed in 1975 they were to have completed their deliberations within a year but did not report until September 1981.

      <P>I am hopeful that that will be the case.  The committee were appointed only three or four weeks ago but already have met on a number of occasions.  Regarding the first part of the Deputy's question, I have very strong personal views that children who are socalled legitimate should have the opportunity of being adopted.  That would be a major change but it is a change that should be made.  I understand that the review committee are examining that situation currently and if they recommend that this change be made, and if the Government so design, it will be by way of a statutory reform.  My own view is that the whole question of adoption should be broadened and following on that, that we would ask ourselves <Col N="1176" /> whether there should be adoption laws at all in that context.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That a sum not exceeding £606,009,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants in lieu or rates on agricultural land and other grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid. </P>
    <P>&mdash;(Minister for the Environment.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was speaking about the Minister's proposals to introduce charges.  I accept we will have an opportunity to discuss his Bill in the near future, as the Minister has told us he will bring it before the House shortly.  However, <Col N="1194" /> I cannot let the occasion pass without making some reference to some of the proposals.  In my view very radical changes are proposed in the method of financing local authorities.</P>
      <P>The Minister is proposing a new form of local taxation.  Under the old Acts there were provisions whereby charges could be made in some cases, which never amounted to great sums of money, but this will be changed and will be superseded by the Bill which the Minister proposes to introduce.  There is one disturbing aspect about this.  Following the abolition of domestic rates in the 1978 Act, an obligation rested on the Minister for the Environment to recoup in full domestic rate reliefs to each local authority. In the Bill circulated by the Minister he is reneging on that obligation.  In my view he is seeking to replace it with an open-ended facility to transfer most of the funding of local authorities to new forms of charges which will be applied locally for services provided by local authorities.  This is a fundamental, radical change and because of the open-ended fashion in which it was introduced leaves it open in the future for the Department to divest themselves of their present obligations to fund local authorities as provided for under existing legislation.  I will not say much more about this matter at this stage as I will have another opportunity to discuss it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to give some indication of the administrative arrangements he has made to enable local authorities to collect the proposed £65 million in extra charges.  Information has not been forthcoming from his Department regarding the cost of collecting the money or the new arrangements to be made.  The Minister did not refer to the anomalous situation with regard to rate collectors.  Formerly they were charged with the collection of all rates but because of legislation passed here they were relieved of their obligation to collect domestic rates.  Now agricultural rates have been abolished totally and, therefore, much of the work the rate collectors were employed to do is no longer required to be done.  Their duties and responsibilities are greatly diminished, <Col N="1195" /> but I am not aware that the level of remuneration has diminished in line with their reduced responsibilities.  The Minister could have given us some indication of his proposals in relation to rate collectors and the cost of paying those people who hold appointments.  Many people would support the notion that rate collectors should be involved in the collection of the new charges if and when this House agrees to legislation to enable the charges to be imposed.  We did not hear anything from the Minister about this matter.  I accept that he could not cover all the activities of his Department in an Estimates' speech.  The workings of the Department cover a very wide area but I should like the Minister in his reply to give us some indication of his proposals in this matter.</P>
    <P>With regard to local authority expenditure in general, I wish to ask what control local authority members exercise over expenditure in their areas.  When councillors sit down at estimates meetings the situation is pre-empted because they are faced with the inevitability of accepting proposals put forward by the manager. Of course, long debates take place upstairs between the engineering side and the administrative side in the county council before the figures are settled.  As I see the situation, the elected members play an increasingly less active part in the decision-making as to the items of expenditure to be agreed for the financial year.  Managers and officials seem to play off elected members in one electoral area against members in other electoral areas. I will explain what I mean.  The present expenditure proposals for each electoral area are presented in global form to the members, absorbing all available funds and councillors are obliged in the main to accept the proposals as presented.  Otherwise a councillor could be identified as having opposed a specific project in his own electoral area and would find it difficult afterwards to justify his decision on the ground of greater need existing elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I spoke earlier of the need to introduce procedures for programme planning and programme budgeting to enable five-year <Col N="1196" /> planning to be introduced in local authorities so that future expenditure patterns could be established and adhered to over a period rather than the disastrous <i>ad hoc</i> system which is operating and which is having a very bad effect.  Councillors can promote urgent and necessary projects in their own area for years.  They may raise the matter at council meetings, they may contact officials about them and generally they may put on considerable pressure to have certain proposals implemented. They may do this for years without success because of the way the system operates and because of the advantage which I considered officials are talking of the elected members.</P>
    <P>There was some understanding of this problem when the White Paper on Local Finance and Taxation was published in December 1972.  It set out recommendations to make financial control by the elected representatives more effective by bringing about a closer relationship between the independent resources of local authorities and the demand on those resources.  That has not been implemented and the frustration still remains.</P>
    <P>The time has come to have an independent assessment made of the cost effectiveness of local authorities.  I suggest that a start be made by selecting six local authorities on a random basis to see if the services they provide require their present level of funding or whether their staffing levels are really necessary.  It is my firm belief that competent, independent assessors would produce startling results.  Elimination of wasteful expenditure, more responsible supervision and a return to more realistic staffing levels could reduce local authority bills by millions of pounds.  However, because of the nature of things and the many vested interests in this system who will oppose such an assessment, it is unlikely that the Minister will take any action along the lines I suggest.</P>
    <P>I believe it is part of the malaise of Ireland today.  Striving for excellence seems to be a thing of the past.  Are we not already paying a high price for the general lowering of standards so evident in many walks of life today?  I take this opportunity, however, to urge the Minister <Col N="1197" /> to be his own man, to ignore the vested interests, to set in train an effective method of identifying waste and to take appropriate measures to eliminate recurring waste in the Department and in local authorities.  He would do well to start an investigation in the house maintenance sections of our major urban authorities.  Every pound saved is a major step on the road to economic recovery.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the private sector in his address and was critical of the lack of investment by the private sector in the construction industry.  The private sector cannot survive unless it makes a profit.  That is always there as a restraint on the activities of the private sector. There is no such slat tomhais applied in the manner in which public bodies carry out their functions.  I believe it is time, in view of the critical state of the nation's finances, to take a long hard look at the manner in which much of the ratepayers' and taxpayers' money is spent.  I believe a lot of the waste could be eliminated, waste which is well covered up, very hard to root out, which no councillor at an estimates meeting of a local authority will be clearly able to identify and prove because of the lack of information provided to him.  Waste is never referred to; it is covered up.</P>
    <P>Overstaffing is a serious problem.  As was mentioned in the debate this morning on the Transport Estimate, local authorities have been obsessed in recent years in merely maintaining their employment numbers.  If local authorities are merely to provide employment <i>per se,</i> without any cost effectiveness being applied, let that be the Government's policy and let them stand up and say it. Let the people judge whether that is the way they want their taxes spent.  I do not believe it is.  I believe there is a great need now to guarantee those who are paying the tax that the public service is giving value for money.  In the Minister's area of responsibility where, as he outlined himself, he controls the expenditure of hundreds of millions of pounds, I am convinced from my experience that there is room for a major overhaul resulting in the saving of millions of pounds for <Col N="1198" /> the taxpayer.  I doubt if the Minister will tackle that.</P>
    <P>With regard to the organisation of local authorities, the Minister said that a lot of thought had gone into this in the past.  If some of us had been given the opportunity we would have implemented proposals which were well publicised.  Successive Ministers, however, over the last few years have not really taken any action regarding the re-organisation of local authorities.  The White Paper in 1971 made certain proposals, but very few of them have been implemented since then and no serious review of the necessity to re-organise local authorities has been carried out since then.</P>
    <P>What are the Minister's views in regard to the organisation of local authorities? Surely he must agree that the existing structures need to be examined.  Many of them were established in the last century at a time when the population of some local authority areas was only a fraction of what it is today and the expansion of housing, commercial and industrial development since has been ten and 100 fold.  If one examines the basic legislation upon which the authorities are established, the areas of responsibility, the number of members on each authority and the areas which they are serving, one can see that the whole framework is in need of immediate overhaul and a more meaningful structure established to meet modern needs and the needs of expanded areas.</P>
    <P>The functions of local authorities need to be reviewed.  New areas could be identified, but in many cases the opposite is the trend.  I see the Department usurping many of the functions of local authorities. The National Building Agency has become a huge organisation.  It has developed into something which it was never intended to be at the outset.  It now seems to be performing the functions of various housing authorities throughout the country. It is a whole new empire inside the Department of the Environment and controls the expenditure of millions of pounds by local authorities.  It claims it is performing a very useful task.  Nobody has ever looked at that system to see if there is any need to continue the National <Col N="1199" /> Building Agency or whether it might not be an unnecessary lair of bureaucracy costing more money.  We cannot afford to continue waste.</P>
    <P>With regard to the administration of roads, it seems to me that a lot of the decision-making has drifted into the Department.  Slowly, bit by bit, with little bits of legislation here and little bits of new regulations there, all the decisions in regard to expenditure on the road network throughout the country are now made inside the Department.  The experience of elected members to local authorities in regard to their own areas and the specialised knowledge of local engineers are being disregarded by the Department officials, who are determining how much money there is and where the money shall be spent.  This is causing a lot of frustration at local authority level with the officials, engineers and elected members.  The Minister and the Department should know that this situation must not be allowed continue without being looked at seriously and the power and the decision-making returned to those who were elected by local people.</P>
    <P>We have the great scandal of O'Connell Bridge House and the Custom House administering housing grants, home improvement grants, water grants, group water scheme grants, which functions could be performed adequately at local authority level.  In my view and that of a substantial number of people it is absolutely unnecessary that a person seeking a grant from the Government should have to make an application to an office up in Dublin in respect of a house which is being built down the country.  To build a new house one must obtain planning permission.  It is the local authority who go out to look at the site and who make a decision in regard to the planning. All right, there may or may not be an appeal and that is a different matter, but in the bulk of cases the planning application is granted locally and the services and infrastructure available for that potential house are provided by the local authority.</P>
    <P>Nobody has a greater knowledge of the location of the house and the physical <Col N="1200" /> structure which is being erected on the site than those who are working locally. It seems absolutely ludicrous that an inspector from the Department of the Environment in Dublin must travel down to the house, look at it and approve it, making two visits in some cases before the grant is paid.  That has been the process for a long time.  All Governments have operated the system and it is not an answer for the Minister to tell us that this operated when our people were in power. I know there is room for improvement and I do not accept that things which we are criticising now should not have been criticised when my party were in Government. They should, and my criticism here is being made in a legitimate way.  This unnecessary waste, this double supervision prior to the payment of a grant in the housing area, must stop.</P>
    <P>The Government should recognise the role of the local authority in a democratic State.  The people can identify more easily with a local rather than central Government and decisions in regard to priority to be given to major local projects should be with the local authority who themselves are charged with implementing these projects and services.  It is of little use to allocate £10 million for improvements in, say, a national primary route or even other road networks in a local authority area if the elected members of that authority have no say in what section of that national primary route the money shall be spent.  I understand that all major decisions in regard to road expenditure are being made in the roads section of the Department with no heed to the views of the elected local representatives or council engineers.</P>
    <P>Somebody must call a stop or the local authority system will become a farce. Well-intentioned local leaders will withdraw from membership of local authorities. The frustration with the present system gives plenty of evidence of the possibility of dedicated councillors withdrawing from membership of local authorities.  People in the Department are public servants and should not have the power to dictate to local authorities as they have been allowed to do in recent years.  Local authorities are in a unique <Col N="1201" /> position to provide and maintain essential services and infrastructure and to operate State schemes in their sphere of influence.  More rather than less power should be allocated to local authorities. The Minister in his speech seems to agree with that principle, but the difference between the word and the deed in this regard has been very blatant over the years.  I hope that this Minister will take some positive steps and that we will see some positive results of the intention which he expressed here in relation to devolving the powers.</P>
    <P>How can succesive Governments condone the inefficient and expensive system of operating all these grant schemes?  The determination of the Department of the Environment to hold on to their grip on the administration of these schemes is not based on practical administrative principles. No.  Their determination has more to do with the perpetuation of a mini-civil service empire in the Custom House. This is a scandalous waste of money, and again I call on the Government and the Minister here today to take immediate steps to stop this waste, to reorganise the administration of these schemes and to ensure that, in future, legislation will be enacted and regulations made to ensure that they will be operated through the local housing authorities, the local road authorities and the local sanitary authorities. At present local authorities have these responsibilities in name only and the practical application does not arise. As a small example of the type of double standards which the Department apply under the Planning Acts, a local authority must decide on a planning application within a period of two months from receipt of application but in the case of an appeal &mdash; which formerly was made to the Minister and the Department of the Environment and now is made to An Bord Pleanála&mdash;no such time limit applies.  Why should this major difference exist?  Why should the obligation be placed on the local authority to perform within a specified period when no such obligation is placed on the higher, central authority?  That attitude of mind runs through many of the Acts and regulations administered by the Department and we <Col N="1202" /> cannot afford that luxury any more.  We must tighten the belt and ensure that cost effectiveness is examined and applied and that the taxpayer is getting the value of these services which public bodies and local authorities are giving.</P>
    <P>I go on to refer to the statement which issued to the papers on 15 March 1983 and I quote from <i>The Irish Times</i> under the heading &ldquo;Spring says Bord Pleanála under review&rdquo;:</P>
    <P>The Minister's statement reads:</P>
    <P>The operations of the Bord Pleanála have been under review, as already announced.  This review stems in the first place from the serious deterioration which has taken place in the arrears of work on hands in the board, and the implications of this for employment and for economic activity. </P>
    <P>I had a parliamentary question down yesterday &mdash; I have already referred to this and I will go into more detail.  The Minister has made big play and he has issued several statements regarding his concern about the operations of An Bord Pleanála.  He claims that the reason why he is so concerned is the backlog of appeals, the serious deterioration that has taken place in dealing with appeals. Where is the evidence of this?  I am as concerned as the Minister and the rest of the country about the delay in deciding planning appeals.  It is scandalous that large developments can be unnecessarily held up in this bureaucratic tangle in An Bord Pleanála.  There is no point in saying, as the Minister says &mdash; whether he is right or not he is so reported in the newspapers &mdash; that abolishing An Bord Pleanála and re-establishing it is the solution. I warn the Minister to tread very warily in this area.  If there are complaints about the performance of An Bord Pleanála let us deal with the mechanics of those complaints and see where the truth lies, There is a great suspicion of a much wider political implication in the Minister's intention in regard to An Bord Pleanála.  I warn him that if that is so he will be setting himself on a road which all of us in this House would decry. Boards are established and members are appointed to them by Government and <Col N="1203" /> if the credentials of the membership of thoses boards are to be questioned by new Governments after a change following an election, then the Minister will be bringing us into a new era something along the American style whereby when a change takes place in Government here, all those people who have been appointed by a Government to act on State boards would all be sacked and replaced by people more amenable to the new Government's way of thinking and doing things.  If the Minister is seeking to abolish An Bord Pleanála and to replace them with his friends I warn him that he is treading on a very dangerous road. There is no evidence in the figures given to me yesterday&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In 1978, the number of professional staff employed at the end of the year was 15 planning inspectors.  The number of appeals received was 3,551 and the number disposed of during that year was 3,722.  The Minister said that there has been a serious deterioration in the number of appeals disposed of.  In 1982 the number of appeals received was 4,740 and the number disposed of was 3,662.  That is 100 less than the number disposed of in 1978.  Where is the evidence of the serious deterioration in disposing of planning appeals?  To all intents and purposes the number is constant because the number of planning inspectors is constant.  How can you expect the same 15 men to turn out a higher output unless they completely ignore planning considerations involved and make hurried decisions?  The obvious need is to increase the number of professional staff in An Bord Pleanála.  It does not matter how many members you appoint to the <Col N="1204" /> board itself because they only make decisions on the report of the planning inspector and they cannot decide any appeal if the planning inspector's report is not brought before them.</P>
      <P>If there are not enough planning inspectors to accelerate the number of reports going before the board, you cannot have any increase in the disposal of appeals.  There is no logic in the statements which the Minister has been issuing over the past four or five weeks.  We on this side of the House must come to the conclusion that the Minister has ulterior and political motives for wanting to create the impression with the public that there is something amiss in An Bord Pleanála.  If there is, why does the Minister not State what it is because it is certainly not the rate of disposing of appeals?  The number of professional staff employed in 1978 was 15, in 1979 it was 16, in 1980 it was 15, in 1981 it was 15 and in 1982 it was also 15.  At this point in 1983 it is still 15.  The Minister should stop issuing these ridiculous statements&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister or his predecessors have not appointed sufficient staff to deal with the increase in the number of appeals.  The increase was not that <Col N="1205" /> staggering, the number of appeals received in 1978 was 3,551 and the number received in 1982 was only 4,740.</P>

      <P>It is the number disposed of in relation to the number of staff to deal with them.  How can the Minister criticise the fact that the same number of staff are not able to increase their output? Is that what the Minister is criticising?  Is the Minister criticising the individual planning inspectors because their output is not satisfactory?  If that is the case, the Minister should say so.  It makes no sense to say that An Bord Pleanála has to be reconstituted because of this.  There is no logic in it and there is obviously some ulterior political motivation on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any fairminded person looking at the output could not but arrive at the conclusion that there is an obvious need to increase the number of professional staff in An Bord Pleanála so that we will not have a backlog of appeals.  To date, the backlog is 3,500.  In 1982 it was 3,255 and 2,177 in 1981.  There is no point in giving any more figures.  Everybody will agree that there is a backlog of appeals waiting to be decided but the output of the existing number of inspectors has remained fairly constant.  From my experience one cannot expect to have a fixed time on each appeal because some of them involve complex work although others are fairly straightforward.  If you had an appeal for a smelter it could take up an inspector's time for six months but if there was an appeal for just one house it could probably be disposed of in a morning.  One has to recognise that just going by statistics is ignoring the human element.  The Minister is being very unfair to the dedicated staff of planning inspectors employed by An Bord Pleanála.  I do not know any of them but there have been only 15 since the board was started.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1206" /> I should also like to remind the Minister that a Joint Committee of the Oireachtas has been established to review, among other things, the operation of the Planning Acts, including reviewing the operation of An Bord Pleanála, development plans, how they operate and their effect on building land prices.  If the Minister wants that committee to carry out the functions which this House asked them to do it would not be helpful if he came forward with major legislation before that committee have deliberated.  I had hoped to ask the Minister to have a special look at some of the problems in my own constituency.  I hope the House will forgive me for referring to local problems but, as a Deputy for that area, it is of very great concern to me.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to a study carried out by An Foras Forbartha on accident patterns in the Galway and Donegal Gaeltacht areas, December 1982 Accident Patterns. It has some startling results in regard to expenditure of road moneys which if provided where they are needed would prevent the problems from continuing. There is no proposal to deal with the very serious condition of the roads in the area where all these accidents take place.  The conclusions find that the road between Inverin and Spiddal has a disproportionately high accident rate.  It should rate as a priority area for road traffic accident prevention, both relative to other roads in the country with a similar traffic flow and to the immediately surrounding roads.  Similar remarks apply to the Bunbeg-Derrybeg road in County Donegal.  Detailed investigations in conjunction with the local authorities are called for in order to identify appropriate counter measures to reduce the disproportionately high frequency of accidents. Before the Minister visits Galway to see the condition of the roads, I suggest he should read that report.  He can have discussions with the elected councillors in the Galway area and they will assure him of the need for heavy capital expenditure to improve the standard of that road which, unfortunately, has been the cause of many fatal accidents.  There have been 37 very serious or fatal accidents there over a short period of time.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1207" /> On the question of the lead content in petrol, I am very concerned that the Minister has not yet indicated what our attitude to this problem is and what action we propose to take.  Lead is a lethal poison. There is substantial medical evidence that the majority of urban children suffer brain damage as a result of inhaling lead from petrol.  I am told Irish petrol has the highest lead content in Europe. Ireland alone exceeds the maximum limit permitted by the EEC.</P>
    <P>If the intelligence of children is affected by the lead content in petrol sold to motorists, I consider that is a very serious matter.  I do not see why we should lag behind in bringing in legislation to change that situation.  At the moment Ireland has a 0.64 grammes per litre lead content in petrol, the highest lead content in petrol in Europe.  This petrol originates from our only refinery, Whitegate in Cork.  I know there are other considerations but, if the health of the nation is at stake, it is time we set up a programme to introduce lead free petrol as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>In Britain they made some major decisions recently.  We are allowed to exceed the EEC limits.  That is disastrous.  I do not care what the employment considerations are.  My party may take a different stand from mine.  I am expressing my personal view.  It is essential that we proceed immediately with the introduction of legislation to ban totally the sale of petrol with any lead content.  The engines in motor cars should be adjusted to enable them to run satisfactorily on lead free petrol.  I understand that is being done, and that imported cars will be able to use lead free petrol.  There are many other things I wanted to say but I have not got time to do so now.  Other Members from my side of the House will contribute to the debate later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to commence by agreeing very strongly with the previous speaker on one thing if nothing else.  I hope the Minister will attack and deal vigorously with the question of the lead content in petrol.  It has been fobbed off by successive Ministers.  I raised it in <Col N="1208" /> the House on a previous occasion.  Slowly but surely our children are being poisoned by the lead poison being thrown out by heavy traffic, particularly in the densely populated urban areas.  Lead poisoning is one of the most invidious forms of poisoning.  It stays in the blood stream on a permanent basis.  Our control regulations are the loosest in Europe.  It is high time drastic action was taken.  I know there is a cost element involved. That is too bad.  I am sure the petrol companies are making enough profits to enable them to absorb the cost of providing us with petrol which can be used without risk to our children.</P>
      <P>While I am on the subject of pollution, it is a fact that in the Dublin urban areas the level of air pollution, apart from the lead in petrol pollution, is becoming too high for safety and getting out of control. This has arisen primarily from the oil crisis of 1973 as a result of which so many thousands of householders have transferred from oil fired central heating to the use of solid fuel.  That is giving rise to serious air pollution in the Dublin area. It is invidious, unseen, but very real and that is being shown on an increasing basis.</P>
      <P>In the United Kingdom they have taken steps to provide smoke free zones, and to encourage the use of smokeless fuels.  Up to now we have lagged very far behind in implementing those essential safety measures.  I urge the Minister to have a look at this matter during his term of office in the Department.  These factors arise from the change in the levels of population over the past decade in particular. Successive Ministers for the Environment and successive Governments have not given the necessary attention to this subject.  The problem is highlighted in my own constituency and in County Dublin generally.  Three massive new towns were planned and built, including the largest of them, the new town of Tallaght, with a population now coming close to the 100,000 mark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The planning arrangements for the administration of the town of Tallaght bear no relationship to the situation on the ground.  Administration is in the hands of Dublin County Council, a body <Col N="1209" /> in virtually an unchanged condition since they were set up in 1898.  It is quite impossible for the present structures of Dublin County Council to cope in a localised and adequate manner with the three new towns which have been built up in County Dublin, the fastest growing areas, as has been said, in the whole of western Europe.  In the past ten or 15 years these towns have been built up from villages with a population of 2,000, 3,000 or 4,000, to the 100,000 mark.</P>
    <P>The whole concept of local Government is that there should be a local input. The local people living in their areas, and knowing their areas, should control the planning and development of their own areas.  Perhaps that was the situation in County Dublin years ago when it was a rural area.  Such is no longer the case.  For the most part County Dublin is now very much an urbanised area.  If we are to have proper local democracy in County Dublin, it is essential that the new towns be granted urban status.  I urge the Minister to introduce legislation, if necessary, or, failing that, to avail of the appropriate statutory procedures, to provide urgently urban status for the town of Tallaght and the other new towns which have been built in County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The existing structures for planning and control there have failed very badly. They have done nothing to meet the needs of the town of Tallaght.  As a result of the lack of proper control, Tallaght has been built up and yet the town centre is unbuilt land to this day.  The plans are there but to date not a sod has been turned to provide the heart of the new town, to provide the infrastructures, to provide the community services for which the people are crying out.</P>
    <P>The demand from the people of Tallaght for these services has been made known.  There have been communications to the Department, but the necessary steps to implement them have not been taken so far.  Tallaght has suffered very badly as a result of shortcomings and shortfalls in the planning system and in the planning control system.  We have suffered as a result of bad planning, bad planners, and at the hands of decisions made by the county council for which <Col N="1210" /> county councillors, or many of them, unfortunately have responsibility.  We have suffered also from some pretty appalling decisions at the hands of An Bord Pleanála.  We are suffering there from urban development blight.  For the most part the enforcement section of Dublin County Council is grossly overworked, grossly overstretched and they are quite unable to cope.  They are unable to provide the essential degree of control to ensure that the numerous new housing estates which are at various stages of development are completed in a responsible manner and that the developers of those estates are brought to book when they are in default.  I am sorry to have to say that all too often that is precisely the case.</P>
    <P>We have many massive estates in Tallaght where builders, after completing their houses in a manner of speaking, left the site, were away for years after taking their profits, leaving unfinished roads and paths, incomplete open spaces, lighting not working in a satisfactory manner and defective drainage and sewerage.  The enforcement section of the local authority have been doing their best and have brought legal proceedings but the complexities of those proceedings are such that notwithstanding their efforts the situation all too often in many estates is left as it was year on year.  That gives rise to intense frustration by the people who bought their houses in good faith and went to live in the new town of Tallaght. There is an insufficient degree of control over the planning process and a major look will have to be taken at it.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems arises from the fact that there is no law which ensures that what is necessary to be built to service people coming to live in a new area is provided within a specific time scale.  It is left in the hands of the developers to build what they want, how and when they want.  They put in their planning applications when it suits them and they provide the structures when it suits them.  Some arrangement ought to be made whereby when a planning application is lodged some type of bonding is insisted on to ensure that if the application is granted it will be implemented <Col N="1211" /> within a specific period.  The present sanction which exists of the wasting of a planning permission is altogether an inadequate one.  It ought to be the position that if a developer comes forward with a proposal he should be asked to give a bonding and a commitment to provide a shopping centre, or whatever the facility may be, within the period determined as necessary by the local authority for the service of the people living in the area.</P>
    <P>There has been a good deal of discussion about An Bord Pleanála today. Whether the problems of the delays in An Bord Pleanála which are reaching scandal point &mdash; I am not talking about what the reasons for that may be &mdash; are caused by the board, insufficient staff or whatever, I do not know but something will have to be done about the matter because there are appeals on the waiting list for up to 12 months.  That is an entirely unacceptable situation.  Something will have to be done about that.  I believe it was towards that end that the Minister was directing his comments in the newspaper report quoted by Deputy Molloy.  If it is found that additional staff are necessary then, clearly, the staff must be appointed.  However, many of the decisions given out by An Bord Pleanála have caused grave public disquiet.  The whole procedure there, the whole basis on which the procedure operates, will have to be looked at.  I was glad to hear the Minister's statement to the effect that new legislation is in the pipeline to deal with that.  The problem arises largely because An Bord Pleanála is too remote from the people.  That is the primary problem.  Nobody knows exactly who is making the decisions.  Are the decisions being made by inspectors, sub-inspectors, or the chairman of the board?  Do they have meetings?  Nobody knows who makes the decisions.</P>
    <P>When one makes an appeal from a court and goes to the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal or the Appeal Commissioners on income tax, or whatever, one can see who is making the decision that affects one but the situation in An Bord Pleanála is at a different <Col N="1212" /> remove.  There we have a situation where nobody knows who is making the decison, it is remote, it is behind closed doors, it is sight unseen.  That is wrong.  The procedure must be that a person who acts as a judge is seen to be the judge, particularly in the case of oral hearings which would suggest that there is a fair method of determining a decision.  Oral hearings are not conducted by the person who makes the decision but by an inspector who takes a note of the evidence.  At the end of the oral hearing he announces that he will make his report to the board.  Who is on the board?  What section of the board is involved?  Those people are not present to hear the evidence, the crossexamination of witnesses, to see the planners or the members of the public who attend.  If new legislation is to be introduced, as indicated by the Minister, it should be on the basis that the person or persons who will make the decision on planning appeals attends the oral hearing to hear the evidence.  They should be seen to be the judges.  Planning appeals are matters of great substance that affect the lives of people.  They relate to where toxic dumps are permitted, where factories that might cause problems in settled areas will be located and it is essential that the judges of those appeals appear before the public.</P>
    <P>We are left with many incomplete estates and faced with situations where many of the developing companies have gone into receivership.  The prospect of getting many of those estates finished in a proper manner and taken in charge is looking dimmer.  We will have to face that situation in a number of different ways.  In the first instance arrangements will have to be made to hold the directors of companies that go into receivership or liquidation, in many cases where wrongful trading has taken place, personally responsible to complete those estates. They have taken money from young married couples who put their life savings into buying a house.  It is intolerable that they should be allowed to escape and wash their hands of the company because it has gone into receivership while they are trading or building elsewhere and about to repeat the process.  Local <Col N="1213" /> authorities, or the central authority, will have to make provision to ensure that notwithstanding the receivership or liquidation those estates are completed.  We should not accept that the estates will be left there decade after decade and some of them have been in bad condition for many years.  Local authorities will have to accept a responsibility in this because it was up to them when they were granting planning permission to ensure that adequate security was provided to secure the completion of those estates.  All too often that has not been done.  They take out bonds from insurance companies to ensure completion but what happens?  No account is taken of the impact of inflation and with the passage of time the amount secured by the bond, which might have seemed adequate at the time, turns out to be derisory.  The local authority will have to accept responsibility for the completion of these estates.  The Minister will have to ensure, by consultation with the local authorities, that arrangements are made to bring the estates up to standard and complete them.</P>
    <P>An effort was made in the 1976 Act dealing with planning by means of the section 27 procedure to bring defaulting developers to book in a speedy and efficient manner.  That has been of some help to local authorities.  All too often, unfortunately, the complexities of many large scale planning permissions, involving 500 or 1,000 houses in one permission, as we frequently have in south County Dublin, mean that this procedure does not work efficiently.  It was intended to be a simple procedure but we have experienced difficulty in implementing it.  Much of the time of skilled staff has been taken up with it.  Developers have very skilled lawyers, planners and architects at their disposal to resist these applications.</P>
    <P>As regards defaulting developers, we will have to have a cheaper, more efficient but harder hitting District Court procedure.  Provision must be made for simple District Court summonses to be issued against them.  We must have realistic penalties.  The maximum penalties provided in existing legislation are inadequate and derisory.  We must have substantial penalties in order to compel <Col N="1214" /> defaulting developers to complete estates and carry out what they undertook to do when they received planning permission. We should make provision for directors of defaulting companies to be held personally responsible in addition to the company.</P>
    <P>When a local authority make an application to a District Court for an order directing a defaulting developer to complete, for example, a certain open space, the District Court should specify a reasonable time within which it is to be done.  In the event of default there should be a continuing offence for which there would be a penalty day by day.  That kind of arrangement applies in certain cases under housing legislation but not under planning legislation.  That could be a useful weapon in the hands of a local authority. It is badly needed in the County Dublin area.</P>
    <P>One aspect of the work of local authorities sorely in need of updating is the compulsory purchase order procedure which is as antiquated as the day is long. It is well known by landowners who are subjected to this procedure whether their land is required for housing, open space, road development or whatever that it can take three, five or seven years.  It can go through the courts and once that procedure is undertaken everyone is in for a long haul.  The land may be needed quickly to provide housing and other essential services for the community.  It is long past the time for new legislation to be brought in to speed up and simplify compulsory purchase order procedures.</P>
    <P>The itinerant problem is very serious, particularly in County Dublin and other locations.  There has been an enormous concentration of itinerant families in the County Dublin area, particularly in Clondalkin and Tallaght.  This has given rise to serious problems for the itinerant families and also for the settled communities living nearby.  The local authority, Dublin County Council, have made some efforts to try to deal with the problem. Provision has been made for halting sites at certain locations.  These were considered for many hours by the elected members of the council.  It has proved wellnigh impossible to secure the agreement <Col N="1215" /> of the elected members of the council to the provision of anything like an adequate number of halting sites even to begin to deal with the problem.  What has happened in every case is that when a proposed halting site is suggested for one location the local councillors representing that area come under intense pressure from the residents of the area and are prevailed upon to vote against the proposal. I came under that pressure and I am sure every councillor, particularly in the Dublin area, has experienced this.</P>
    <P>I have thought about this problem long and hard, as it is a serious and difficult one in my area.  I have come to the conclusion that the local authority do not have the political will to make realistic efforts to try to resolve the problem.  I do not say that in any sense of condemning any councillor; we all carry that responsibility on our shoulders as councillors.  If we are to have any hope of resolving this serious problem it will have to be done at national level.  I call on the Minister to accept that he will have to undertake the responsibility of tackling this problem.  I urge him to set up a task force for this purpose representing the local authority, travelling families, the local settled community, groups who assist and work with travelling people and any other necessary interests.  He should give them plenary powers to acquire sites at appropriate locations for the purpose of commencing a resettling programme for the travelling people.  This task force should be directed as to the type of dwellings and halts to be provided.  They should be given a specific direction that these settlements should be located in all areas.  We should not be faced with a situation where they are concentated in one type of area and where another type of area is considered exempt.  They should be fairly and equally distributed in all types of areas.</P>
    <P>This is an important and urgent matter. Unless the Minister is prepared to undertake this task we will make little or no progress in dealing with this human and tragic problem which is causing such difficulties both for the settled community and for the travelling people.</P>
    <P>As regards housing, as Deputy Molloy <Col N="1216" /> said, the building industry has never been worse off.  I have been looking at the building index with which we are furnished every month.  All one can see is a deterioration each month.  I urge that the maximum possible funds be made available, even in those difficult times, to give a fillip to the building industry in an effort to generate some activity in construction, particularly of houses so badly needed in local authority areas.  The housing lists in Dublin city and county are as long as ever and the demand is as great as ever, but the number of houses coming on-stream are not nearly enough to meet the urgent need.</P>
    <P>The Minister touched on something that has been in my mind and troubling me for some time.  I referred to it in my speech on the motion last night.  It is the importation of building materials to be used in housing and general construction throughout the country.  The Minister said that half of the imported materials, valued at about £350 million, could have been produced here and could create employment for as many as 10,000.  Relatively speaking, we have one of the worst trade balances in Europe in this respect, and in this area our exports have increased by only one-third.  Why is that? Who is to blame?  Are we to put the blame on the EEC, the Commission, the Council of Ministers?  Not at all.  The blame rests on nobody but ourselves because we have not taken any steps to redress the situation.  We are dealing here with controls on imports of building materials that could be produced at home.  All the other countries are doing it and that is why our exports increased by less than one-third and why our imports of these same materials have doubled.  Those countries are using protections against us.</P>
    <P>The recent report of the Council of Europe, published a few weeks ago, showed that 46 per cent of imports into the developed countries are subject to restrictive controls.  It is time we got wise to ourselves.  The argument, which is spurious, is to the effect that if we take action to protect our vulnerable industries there will be retaliation against us abroad.  The retaliation has been taken against us. <Col N="1217" /> Although we practise free trade, we get harassment by, for instance, the French, with their restrictions, tariffs and quotas. This was shown in the report of the Council of Europe to which I referred.  If we are suffering here we have ourselves to blame and I ask the Minister to look at the situation and to ask the Department what is being done to protect us against these spurious arguments that we cannot take steps to secure those additional 10,000 jobs the Minister referred to this morning.</P>
    <P>There are many other matters I wanted to refer to but I will confine myself to a few points because Deputy Durkan wants to get in.  One matter of importance is vehicle registration.  There is one aspect of that which, as a practising solicitor, I find most frustrating.  There is no method whereby it is possible to ascertain from the vehicle registration office details as to whether insurance cover is applicable to a particular vehicle.  One can write to the registration office and find the name and address of the last owner but they are not prepared to furnish details of what insurance cover that vehicle had.  There is no earthly reason for withholding that because in the file in relation to that vehicle they must have details of the insurance on the vehicle.  I urge the Minister to make regulations to insist that the registration office would be required to give the details.</P>
    <P>The Motor Insurers' Bureau Agreement is another matter.  This is a special hobby horse of mine.  The last bureau agreement, negotiated between the then Minister for Local Government and the insurance group of companies, is dated well upwards of 30 years ago and it is high time it was renegotiated and updated to take account of serious shortfalls.  It should be brought on a par, at least, with the equivalent UK agreement.  Serious shortfalls in the agreement affect the victims of hit-and-run drivers, and there are many such cases these days.  If a person is unfortunate enough to be injured or crippled by a hit-and-run driver the bureau disclaim liability or responsibility to compensate.  In the UK that was changed a long time ago and I beseech the Minister to renegotiate that agreement. <Col N="1218" /> If he does, many unfortunate victims of road accidents will be extremely grateful to him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I support the remarks of the last speaker in regard to imports of building materials.  At a time when we have 200,000 people unemployed it seems a terrible contradiction of our patriotism that we have such a high rate of imports when we could produce the same materials at home and thus provide 10,000 extra jobs.  It is an absolute scandal that we have vested interests who in this difficult time pursue a policy detrimental to the economy and to the woodwork manufacturing industry.  If that is allowed to continue the competition caused by those imports will send Irish businesses to the wall and we will have further need of imports.  It should be carefully looked at.  I hope the Minister will be able to bring pressure to bear so that in our local authority schemes Irish manufactured materials will be used.  We do not do that.  The hue and cry about unemployment seems so much hypocrisy because we have the means to remedy the situation and we should take whatever steps are open to us.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to the local authority house building programme.  In the last number of years it was not possible for the local authorities to meet their housing requirements.  In many countries there are vast numbers on the housing lists living in cramped, overcrowded and unfit conditions which are detrimental to their health and that of their children.  A typical example is a husband and wife with two or three children in a caravan or mobile home, without services, sometimes without any power, no sanitary services, living there for four, five, six or seven years in order to get a local authority house.  If they made any attempt to improve their housing conditions while on the waiting list they would automatically drop back in points and ultimately damage their chances of acquiring a local authority house.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present system encourages us to condemn our young population to live in conditions which are totally unacceptable and unworthy.  The time has come to <Col N="1219" /> encourage private enterprise, with the agreement of the local authority and the Department, to develop and build houses of the type required by local authorities. Those houses should be made available for sale to people on the housing lists under the Housing Finance Agency scheme.  This could be done under present legislation and more encouragement should be given to fostering such a scheme.</P>
    <P>Many people on those lists would be delighted to buy their own houses, and many of them would have sufficient income to do so under the Housing Finance Agency scheme if a suitable house was available.  I ask the Minister to consider introducing a pilot scheme along those lines.  In County Kildare there are approximately 2,500 families seeking rehousing.  Over the last number of years, particularly since 1977, we have been able to build approximately 180 houses per annum, far short of our target which is in the region of 600.  A scheme along the lines I have suggested would have the added advantage of relieving some of the burden on the State for providing local authority houses.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Housing Finance Agency.  That agency has given many couples the opportunity to buy and own their own houses, an opportunity which did not exist previously for the simple reason that there were insufficient funds available through the SDA loan system, and many of the people looking for loans did not qualify for building society loans because they did not have sufficient savings.  The Housing Finance Agency scheme goes a long way towards meeting those requirements.  Recently I met a young couple, both under 21 years of age. the husband was employed and anxious to house himself, his wife and his family.  The house was available at an agreed price but because neither was 21 years of age they could not enter into a mortgage agreement.  This means they are now on the local authority housing list.  The Minister might consider introducing a guarantor system.</P>
    <P>I must refer to local authority housing repairs.  Every county council have a <Col N="1220" /> problem in this area.  The present system is totally unsatisfactory.  A builder builds these houses and two or three years later a number of repairs need to be carried out.  Sometimes they are attended to and sometimes not.  If they are not the tenants usually get in touch with their public representatives to have these repairs carried out.  Over the last five or six years the amount of money spent on that area has increased dramatically, sometimes up to 300 per cent, and we appear to be getting little return for our money.</P>
    <P>I suggest that a new system be introduced. There should be stricter supervision by the local authority when the houses are nearing completion.  At the end of a six- or 12-month period the developer should be compelled to carry out any structural repairs needed.  After that the tenants could be told they were responsible for further repairs.  This is a waste of public funds, public representatives' time and the time of public officials who have to visit these houses, making reports, and refer them to the engineering section where they remain, because there are not sufficient funds to carry out the repairs.  I ask the Minister to consider some changes in this area in order to bring about greater efficiency from the point of view of the local authority and the tenants.</P>
    <P>The state of our roads is in the mind of every local authority member.  As a member of the Eastern Regional Development Organisation I would like to deal with the roads in County Kildare and the eastern region generally.  It is not commonly appreciated that in the eastern region there is more pressure on our roads than in any other part of the country because commercial and domestic traffic going to and from the capital city must go through one of the counties immediately adjacent to Dublin &mdash; Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  Because of congestion on our national primary routes, a great deal of that traffic has gone on our main and county roads.  The destruction of those roads has been nothing short of dramatic in the last few years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>On Tuesday morning last, the Radio Telefís Éireann eight o'clock news, and again the nine o'clock news, carried a fairly circumstantial report of a transcript of a telephone conversation which had come into the possession, according to the report, of a member of the ASTMS.  The explanation given for the fact that a transcript of a telephone conversation between two quite different people had reached the hands of this union official was that &ldquo;an uninvolved businessman&rdquo; had happened to have his telephone line accidentally crossed with a line on which this conversation was being conducted.  Equally accidentally, his answering machine happened to switch on in such a way as to record the whole of this conversation which ran for, as the report said, 20 minutes.</P>
      <P>That &ldquo;uninvolved businessman&rdquo;, by another accident, was reported to have happened to recognise the voices of the two persons taking part in this telephone conversation and recognised them as being the voices of two senior executives in two different insurance companies. According to this very circumstantial report, this &ldquo;uninvolved businessman&rdquo; had seen enough reason, uninvolved though he was, to keep the transcript of what he found on his answering machine when he came back from his business lunch and to hand it, some days later, to a friend of his, an official of the ASTMS whom he met on the golf course.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That report I heard by ear.  I have not seen a transcript of what RTE transmitted, but that is my recollection of it.  A very condensed version of that appeared in the newspapers on the same day, 10 May.  <i>The Irish Times,</i> for example, under a heading which by no means threw emphasis on the fact that we were dealing with a telephone interception, accidental or otherwise, concentrated instead on what that transcript purported to show, namely, that there had been some collusion or consultation between the insurance companies concerned and the Minister <Col N="1222" /> for Finance before the Minister for Finance expressed a certain view in regard to wage settlements, to which these companies had committed themselves. In other words, the substance of the matter as regards the wage settlements was uppermost and the manner by which the thing had become public, whether it was true or false, was quite secondary, ancillary, really scarcely deserving of a footnote, and that is about what it got from the industrial correspondents of the various papers.</P>
    <P>Eugene McEldowney, the industrial correspondent for <i>The Irish Times,</i> having led off his paragraph in which the collusion was revealed &mdash; I say that naturally under the reservation that I know nothing whatever about the collusion or the matter which the Minister, Deputy Dukes, has since contradicted &mdash; said the information was contained in a tape recording of a telephone conversation between two senior insurance company executives.  No further commentary seemed to be called for.  It was simply one of those old transcripts that might fall off the back of a lorry, so to speak.</P>
    <P>Before I say any more about Mr. McEldowney and his colleagues in the media &mdash; and I will have a couple of words to say about them &mdash; I want to express an opinion, which the privilege of this House allows me to do with impunity, about that story reported without comment of any kind by RTE and by the Dublin newspapers: that is, that I regard it as a grossly implausible history of how a recording was obtained; not only grossly, but contemptuously implausible, in as much as its implausibility is so strident that whoever thought up that explanation of it did not give a damn whether he was believed or not.  That is the amount of respect which whoever thought that story up, in my judgment, has for public opinion, for the feeling of this House and for the law of the land.</P>
    <P>I may just point to one of the implausible aspects of this operation, and this is &mdash; quite apart from the chance that any of us might happen to leave on an answering machine and happen to record an entire conversation on a crossed line from somewhere between two quite different <Col N="1223" /> people &mdash; what is the chance that an &ldquo;uninvolved businessman&rdquo; would actually recognise the two voices which had been, by an astronomical fluke, recorded on his answering machine while he was out at lunch?  He was able to identify them, one of them as the voice of a senior executive in an Irish company and one as the voice of a senior executive in an English company.  Possibly the two were members of the golf club at which he subsequently met the member of the ASTMS.  If so, of course, it lessens &mdash; rather like the comet now approaching within only three million miles of the earth &mdash; the number of noughts that you have to use in order mathematically to convey the degree of improbability in this suggestion.</P>
    <P>I regard that as a grossly implausible, and not to put too fine a point on it, untrue account of how that tape was obtained if, indeed, it exists.  I am assuming that it does.  A purported transcript which bears the circumstantial suggestion and mark of a genuine conversation has since been printed.  I have not heard any suggestion that it is a fake.  On the contrary, the union official who first revealed its existence said that he personally was convinced of its genuineness.</P>
    <P>I think that the story of how that tape came into existence is untrue or, I will put it this way, it is so untrue, and so contemptuously so, that Deputy Doherty must have been dumbstruck with admiration when he heard that explanation being offered &mdash; and swallowed by the guardians of civil liberties in this country, the media &mdash; and swallowed without a word of comment.  There were a few slightly incredulous lines in an editorial in the <i>Irish Independent</i> yesterday morning; and that is the only comment that I have seen in the press, although I cannot guarantee that I have scrutinised every inch of newsprint dealing with it, which might suggest that anyone anywhere in the media was inclined to take the slightest blind bit of interest in how this tape recording had been obtained.</P>
    <P>That implausibility was got away with, and Deputy Doherty, who never tried such a thing out himself, must have been <Col N="1224" /> dumbstruck with admiration at the nerve of the man who tried it out and got away with it until now &mdash; or, if I am all wrong about this and if that account is true, in other words that it really was obtained like that &mdash; what is at work is an effect known to telecommunications science as the &ldquo;Garda Nangle's fist effect&rdquo;.  Somebody happened to have his answering machine switched on, and it &ldquo;happened to connect&rdquo; with somebody else's conversation. I am not going to waste any more words on that.</P>
    <P>The clear suggestion of this story is that a conversation was deliberately intercepted, but I want to pursue that line because if I am right about that, a lot of other things turn on it.  No one interested in revealing collusion, if it existed &mdash; and I accept the Minister's denial that it did, though even if it did, what about it?  &mdash; no one interested in securing evidence of that kind could possibly know the hour of the day or night at which one insurance executive was going to telephone the other.  Therefore, one line or the other, or both, was under a continuous bug, or a continuous surveillance, and not a surveillance which represented an improper use of Garda materials or the Department of Justice machinery.</P>
    <P>At least when that happens, improper and outrageous and semi-criminal though it is, there is this much security for the public, that somewhere in the Garda, somewhere in the Department of Justice, there may be supposed to be some honest, decent consciences that would be outraged with what they see going on, that will keep a note of what is happening, and sooner or later will make sure it surfaces.  But when it happens outside, we have not even that pitiable degree of security.  So one or other of these lines, I conclude, was deliberately and continuously under surveillance by somebody who had no business to put it under surveillance and no show or colour of legal authority, even of the kind that Deputy Doherty would call legal authority, to carry out such a surveillance.</P>
    <P>That is the first conclusion for which I hope members of the Government would accept &mdash; naturally they are not responsible &mdash; in a sense, the need to be interested. <Col N="1225" /> The other line of reflection which this episode induces in me is something which naturally no Government could be expected to have any departmental interest in, so to speak.  That is the fact that a responsible union leader could lend himself, first of all, to the gathering and then to the use of a transcript of this kind, could use this material with this explanation. Secondly the fact that, as I said before, the press should let this matter pass with an almost zero degree of interest.</P>
    <P>I hope it is not going to become the case here that, merely because the bugging of journalists caused a convulsion a few months ago which resulted in resignations, rows, and generally in the roof falling in, public interest must now be deemed to be suspended in all such matters when people other than journalists are involved.  I hope that is not the case. Let me say that I believe the honour of the journalists I know at least would not allow me to think that.  It may be that they are just so punch-drunk from reading about bugging and transcriptions of telephone conversations that they have lost interest for the moment in this whole theme, and that interest will, in due course of nature, revive.  That may be so; I hope it is so.  I do not accept and I do not believe any ordinary reflecting citizen of this country would accept that privacy is anything but indivisible, that it is a quality and a right, yes, Sir, and a constitutional right, to which everyone in this country is equally entitled and that a breach of that right is no more outrageous when committed on a journalist than when committed on an insurance company executive or when committed on a trade union official.</P>
    <P>Although <i>The Irish Times</i> editorial of yesterday was broadly speaking, in a national sense, a helpful and good editorial, I am sorry to say that there slipped through their pen the following description of this episode: &ldquo;Crossed Lines!&rdquo; was how they headed it and it commenced:</P>
    <P>With the story of the alleged cross telephone lines we are back in the land of the grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre <Col N="1226" /> etc. ... a black comedy of errors to lighten our darkness just a little. </P>
    <P>There was no error here, sir, this was deliberate; it is black all right but it is not a comedy.  It may be a laugh, as our advertising said in the 1968 Referendum campaign, but it is no joke.  I repeat:</P>
    <P>... a black comedy of errors to lighten our darkness just a little. </P>
    <P>Whose darkness has this episode lightened? Who feels any the lighter of heart for this episode?  I do not reprobate an editorial writer under the pressure of time using an expression like that &mdash; and it is true that we have had really an overdose of stories about telphone bugs &mdash; but I think it important to say that this House would agree with me, that privacy is a constitutional right of citizens.  It has been, I will not say judicially declared to be so, but it has been judicially observed to be so by Mr. Justice Budd in the <i>McGee</i> case.  I have absolutely no doubt &mdash; for what my opinion on the matter is worth &mdash; that it is a constitutional right for the breach of which a civil action for damages would lie.  I have no doubt that either of these insurance company executives, could he identify whoever it was who deliberately intercepted and recorded his conversation, could recover civil damages against him.  I hope that that simple fact will not allow it to become the norm here that one takes transcripts of other people's telephone conversations as part of the ordinary ammunition and give-and-take of industrial or political relations, that we will not simply wave it through, either as politicians or journalists, as something about which one is really being a bit over-solemn in protesting.</P>
    <P>I hope I do not need to say &mdash; although it arises in the context of industrial relations and the interests of trade unions &mdash; I would say the very same thing with just the same vehemence, perhaps more, if what was at issue here was an interception which I believed to have been carried out to suit the interests of employers in the conduct of their affairs with unions. What kind of headlines would we have had over the last couple of days if this <Col N="1227" /> episode appeared to have been the other way round, if it appeared to have been the insurance companies that were bugging Mr. Hall?  What would have been said by the gentlemen in the press then or by the people on both sides of this House?  The Doherty affair would have been in the halfpenny place compared with it, perhaps rightly so.</P>
    <P>I want to ask the Minister for Justice, through his colleague before us, to consider whether, in spite of the very defective state of the law in regard to telephones &mdash; which I am very glad to see the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is about to remedy with an amendment to his Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982, circulated today &mdash; the Garda Síochána and the Director of Public Prosecutions might consider whether, perhaps &mdash; defective through the law may be &mdash; there is some offence here which has been committed by somebody who deliberately interferes with telephone apparatus in order to record somebody else's conversations.  I freely admit that it is not obvious or evident to me which section of which Act has been here infringed.  But I find it hard to believe that there is not a regulation somewhere with a penalty attached to it which that person has infringed.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister present to make a statement to the Dáil &mdash; naturally he cannot do so in the few minutes left to him today &mdash; at some moment convenient to himself, on the general state of telephone security.  By his amendment circulated today he is proposing to strengthen the law in regard to telephones so as to make it a specific offence, which it has not been until now, to intercept and pass on or record other people's telephone conversations without their consent.  That is a good thing and I support it.  I have not had a chance to study every line of the amendment but, when I do, I may be able to make suggestions about it.  I would like the Minister not only to do that but also to find some opportunity to give an assurance or make a statement in the House on the general question of the physical security of the telephone system.  Naturally, <Col N="1228" /> there is no such thing as 100 per cent security.  It is not enough for the ordinary citizen, the ordinary businessman, the ordinary insurance official, yes, or the ordinary trade union official to know that somebody who intercepts his line is committing a very serious offence; I and the rest of the House would like to know how easy it is physically for an unauthorised interception to be carried out either at the house exchange level, at the local exchange level, out in the countryside on the wires, or however it may be technically possible.  Most people are, so to speak, illiterate on the subject of telephone technology; they can hardly be expected to be otherwise.  It would be a good thing if the Minister were to give this House some general assurance about how safe and secure a telephone system can be made, apart from whatever security criminal sanctions may afford it.</P>
    <P>I should like to conclude by making two quick suggestions to this Minister. First of all, I would suggest that he might consider that where this offence, which he now proposes, of intercepting a telephone communication is committed by one of his own officials, or by one of the officials in the employment of An Bord Telecom, it should be a specially qualified offence with special consequences, because of the natural breach of trust and the natural breach of duty involved, over and above those which would attach to an outsider.  Secondly I think his section, at first blush, is defective in as much as it does not seem to provide any special prohibition on the publication, in print, of the transcript of an unlawfully taken conversation.  It makes references to &ldquo;make use of&rdquo;, something like that, such a transcript. But I think it would be helpful if it were made clear that when a transcript is unlawfully obtained and passed on, any newspaper proprietor or anybody else who publishes it does so at his peril.</P>

      <P>If I might deal with the last point Deputy Kelly made, the amendment circulated today proposing a new section 94 of the Postal and Telecommunications <Col N="1229" /> Services Bill, 1982, does cover the question of disclosing and says:</P>
      <P>New Section 94</P>
      <P>In page 43, before section 94, to insert the following new section:</P>
      <P>94.  (1) A person who&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  intercepts or attempts to intercept, or</P>
      <P>(b)  authorises, suffers or permits another person to intercept, or</P>
      <P>(c)  does anything that will enable him or another person to intercept, telecommunications messages being transmitted by the company or who discloses the existence, substance or purport of any such message which has been intercepted or uses for any purpose any information obtained from any such message shall be guilty of an offence.</P>
      <P>I might add that that section was drafted long before the present incident to which Deputy Kelly referred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully share Deputy Kelly's concern in this matter.  I have ordered and initiated an inquiry by my chief investigation officer into this matter. That is already under way.  For obvious reasons it would be inappropriate for me to indicate the lines such inquiries will take or to comment further on them at this stage.  However, I would like to clarify the position so far as my Department are concerned about three issues of a general kind which may give cause for concern arising from the publicity about this matter.  These are, first to what extent accidental overhearing of telephone conversations can take place; secondly, under what conditions equipment may be used to record telephone conversations and, thirdly, what safegaurds exist to prevent irregular interception of telephone calls.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the first point I am advised that conditions which give rise to accidental overhearing of telephone conversations occur only to a very limited extent.  They <Col N="1230" /> can arise due to a fault in a subscriber underground cable, in a junction cable or in a telephone exchange.  In the case of a fault in a subscriber underground cable, it is to be expected that the existence of the fault would be evident to the subscriber concerned and would be reported and cleared.  In the case of a junction cable, faults arise rarely.  They normally come under notice at a very early stage and would be cleared promptly.</P>
    <P>In the case of telephone exchanges, faults giving rise to the conditions referred to are most likely to arise in the case of the older type step-by-step exchanges, although they can occur on occasions on the modern crossbar exchange also.  However, conditions of the kind occur very infrequently even in the case of step-by-step exchanges.  Routine maintenance is carried out on a regular basis in all telephone exchanges but detection of faults which could give rise to overhearing can unfortunately be quite difficult and may not detected during the course of routine maintenance.</P>
    <P>About 25 per cent of subscribers in the Dublin area are connected to step-by-step exchanges.  The proportion connected to step-by-step exchanges in provincial areas is lower.  The step-by-step exchanges are being phased out and are being replaced mainly by digital exchanges most of them by the end of 1985 but they will be with us for some time yet.  Their replacement before they become unserviceable would not be justified.</P>
    <P>A special programme of preventative maintenance of underground cables in the Dublin area is being carried out this year.  This should reduce the incidence of faults but it will not eliminate them; indeed, it is not possible to guarantee that isolated faults involving overhearing will not occur.</P>
    <P>The position is therefore that, while every effort is made to guard against conditions which might give rise to accidental overhearing and to correct them promptly on the rare occasions when they occur, it will not be possible in the foreseeable future to guarantee 100 per cent security of the network against occasional overhearing.  This is not unique to <Col N="1231" /> Ireland.  No telephone administration that we know of provide such a guarantee in relation to their networks.</P>
    <P>The second point which may give cause for public concern is the use of equipment for recording telephone conversations.  It is illegal for anybody to make an attachment of a recorder or other device to a telephone instrument or telephone plant without the express approval of my Department.  Approval is given for two types of equipment for recording telephone calls but stringent conditions are attached to safeguard the privacy of telephone conservations.  These are that: before a telephone call is recorded, the person making the call must be advised that it is proposed to do so; the existence of a recorder on the installation must be indicated on the subscriber's notepaper on which the telephone number is quoted; and the existence of a recorder must be indicated by a symbol in the subscriber's entry in the telephone directory. Subscribers are required to give a written undertaking in regard to each of the three foregoing conditions before permission is granted to them for attaching a recorder to a telephone installation.</P>
    <P>As in the case of conditions giving rise to accidental overhearing, my Department are not in a position for obvious reasons to ensure that all subscribers comply fully with the conditions governing the use of recording devices on telephone installations.  Nor indeed can they prevent the irregular use of such devices without authority.  However, should such cases come under notice in the course, for example, of maintenance or by way of complaint, the sanctions available include withdrawal of telephone service.</P>
    <P>The third point which may give rise to public concern is the safeguards that exist to prevent irregular interception of telephone calls.  As I mentioned earlier, it is not possible to guarantee that conditions which may give rise to accidental overhearing of telephone calls will not <Col N="1232" /> occur, however rarely.  Neither is it possible to guarantee that individual telephone subscribers will not irregularly record telephone conversations without advising the caller in advance.  Deliberate unauthorised interception of telephone calls is a separate matter.  Safeguards exist against this, details of which it would be inappropriate for me to disclose for obvious reasons.  As I mentioned when replying to a recent parliamentary question, these are being reviewed at present.</P>
    <P>As a previous Minister for Justice I was knowledgeable about the area of telephone interception and consequently, I have been very concerned to strengthen the law in this general area of the privacy of telephone conversations. I am taking advantage of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill to achieve this.  As I have said already, and as Deputy Kelly has mentioned today by coincidence, 90 amendments to that Bill have been circulated and these include proposals for making it an offence in itself for anyone to intercept anyone else's telephone call or anyone else's mail.  It is proposed to make it a further offence to disclose the substance of any such telephone call or mail.  The penalties proposed in this regard are very severe.  In the case of a summary offence heard in the District Court there will be a fine of £800 or 12 months' imprisonment or both or, if on indictment, there will be a fine of up to £50,000 or 2 years' imprisonment or both.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly has suggested that people in the Post Office should be treated separately.  For them it is already an offence to intercept or to disclose without lawful authority the contents of a telephone call.  In his usual fashion, Deputy Kelly has very lucidly described the gross improbability of what has happened but I do not wish to comment on that pending the outcome of the investigation in progress in my Department.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 17 May 1983.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 29 of 27 January last in which I indicated, among other things, that on the basis of recent trends in public and private sector investment in building activity, and given the general state of the economy and the limitations on public expenditure generally, it was inevitable that the path to an upswing in the industry must come mainly through increased private sector investment.  In that reply I detailed matters which had been discussed at the meeting which the <Col N="1178" /> Minister of State and I had with representatives of the building industry on 17 January and the action proposed to be taken to assist the industry.  I also said at that meeting that I was not in a position to indicate at that stage what level of Government support for the industry would be available in 1983 since this had to do with budgetary consideration.</P>

    <P>The reduction in the SDA allocation reflects an expectation that some borrowers will opt for loans from the Housing Finance Agency in preference to SDA loans in view of the higher loan available and the more attractive repayment terms in the early years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As mentioned in my reply to the <Col N="1182" /> Deputy's question of 19 April 1983, the Departments of Health and Transport were reorganised in 1974-76 along the lines recommended in the PSORG report.  The published reports (Prl. 3445 and Prl. 4182 respectively) on which these reorganisations were based indicate in some detail the nature of the implementation work involved.  Following review of these experiments, the Government decided in October 1977 to restructure all line Departments along similar lines.</P>
      <P>In accordance with this decision, all line Departments were invited to prepare draft plans for their reorganisation. Experience showed clearly, however, that an intensive study would be necessary to develop these plans to the stage where they would form a blueprint for detailed reorganisation.  Accordingly, in late 1978 and early 1979, a special project team was established in the Department of the Public Service to work with Departments and develop detailed proposals.</P>
      <P>The project team, with the help of staff from each of the Departments concerned, carried out the necessary examinations and made recommendations for improved structures and management. The first stage of each exercise was to identify (on the basis of an analysis of each Department's functions and in the light of the requirements at the time) the new structures which could best be introduced in order to improve the working of the Department, within a framework provided by the PSORG recommendations.</P>
      <P>This involved consultation with staff interests as well as with the managements of the Departments concerned.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will appreciate, a Government Department is a major enterprise by any standard (the Department of Agriculture alone employs over 5,000 people); consequently these were virtually all major assignments.</P>
      <P>New structures in broad terms were designed and agreed with the eight Departments mentioned in my reply of 19 April 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next step is the &ldquo;detailed implementation work&rdquo; referred to by the <Col N="1183" /> Deputy in his question.  This is currently in progress and involves detailed field work with analysis of systems, procedures and processes.  These analyses are resulting in specific and detailed individual proposals on the establishment of executive offices, the functions and responsibilities of the management of those offices and the relationships of the offices with the Minister and with other bodies.  This work commenced at various times, depending on the availability of joint resources, from late 1979 onwards.</P>
    <P>Change on this scale is obviously a slow process, as basic procedures must be examined, recommendations developed, agreed with management and communicated to and, where appropriate, negotiated with staff interests.</P>
    <P>Departments have, of course, changed substantially since 1969 and continue to change.  There is no question of recommending structures which will not meet the needs of the latter quarter of the twentieth century.  Departments have to be adapted to meet constantly changing roles and responsibilities.  The current examinations are taking account of these changes.</P>
    <P>This reorganisation work will be brought to completion as part of the comprehensive reviews of administrative efficiency, schemes and programmes which are now being stepped up in all Departments.  The Government will shortly consider the question of the operative date for these organisational changes.</P>

      <P>Pending the completion of investigations arising from the accident he was paid disability benefit on an interim basis in respect of the period from 10 March, the fourth day of incapacity.  Following investigation injury benefit was awarded on 9 May 1983 with effect from 5 March, the date of the accident.  All benefit including injury benefit in respect of the period to 7 May 1983 has been paid, over and above the disability benefit paid on an interim basis to 30 April.</P>
      <P>Pay-related benefit was not payable on the grounds that the earnings in the relevant tax year were less than the minimum required to qualify for pay-related benefit.
