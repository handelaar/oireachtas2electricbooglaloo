    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the increasing distress caused to families where marriages have broken down irretrievably, he will introduce legislation for a referendum to be held to remove the constitutional prohibition on divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government propose that, after consultation with the Opposition, an Oireachtas Committee will be established which will make recommendations on the problems of the protection of marriage under modern conditions and of marriage breakdown and on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required.</P>
      <P>I anticipate that the constitutional prohibition on divorce will be considered by the committee, and I hope that it will be possible to get all-party agreement on the establishment and terms of reference of the committee shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that an all-party committee which sat about 15 years ago has already recommended <Col N="124" /> that the prohibition on divorce in the Constitution should be dropped, is it not time for this Dáil to have that constitutional ban done away with so that we may discuss proper legislation to deal with the problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This would be amongst the matters which we feel should be considered by this committee whose terms of reference are, of course, a good deal broader than the particular issue the Deputy raised.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any time limit as to when this committee will report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter for discussion between the Whips.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the agreement between the parties who make up the Government stated that it would be dealt with before the end of 1983.  Is that still the intention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That is certainly the intention but it is a matter on which we wish to consult the Opposition and, if possible, to secure their agreement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that is the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he has sought a meeting with the British Prime Minister; and, if so, the result.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There are no plans at present for a meeting but both the Prime Minister and I will, of course, be attending the European Council in Brussels in March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to rebut rumours or indications that have been circulating to the effect <Col N="125" /> that he has sought a meeting and been refused?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  No meeting has been sought, never mind refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to speak about our side in this regard.  There has been no approach for a summit meeting with the British Prime Minister which has been rejected.  It is important that we should understand that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government intend to proceed with the Pro-Life Amendment of the Constitution next week and the Bill has been restored to the Order Paper.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Taoiseach would indicate to us when in the Parliamentary programme it is hoped to take this legislation and also what Minister of the Government will be responsible for sponsoring it through the Oireachtas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hoped to take it next week.  It is a matter for discussion between the Whips but we hope it will be taken then.  The Minister for Justice will be responsible for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a change of responsibility which comes up under <Col N="126" /> another question later and perhaps we could deal with it better then.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I made clear in the programme for Government, the decision to introduce the Bill is a decision of the Government.  The question of voting on the Bill is, in the case of the Labour Party, a matter for individual members of that party.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the only collective agreement the Government have in this Bill?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Agreement was to introduce.  As I have said, repeatedly, in the case of the Labour Party the decision on the voting on the Bill is a matter for individual Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will be conscious of the fact that the Tánaiste has indicated that he has had legal advice which does not seem to be to the same effect as that available to the Taoiseach. Will the Taoiseach explain if there will be any attempt to reconcile the different legal advice given to the Tánaiste and that given to the Taoiseach in this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is anticipating the debate on the matter.  This does not arise at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is on the basis of legal advice that legislation is introduced here.  On the one hand the Taoiseach is satisfied, having received legal advice, that it is appropriate to bring it to this House but the Tánaiste, the Deputy Prime Minister, has legal advice which suggests another course.  Surely there is something to be reconciled before the House is asked to deal with the matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a matter for a Second Stage debate as it is going into the merits of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is the basis on which legislation is being introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is relevant having regard to what the Taoiseach has said. We are now talking about the principle of collective responsibility under Article 28 of the Constitution where it specifies that decisions made by Government are <Col N="128" /> collectively carried through by Government. Are we now, on the Taoiseach's own admission, in a situation where there are two wings in the Government who are opposed on this important matter?  Is he proposing to proceed by way of a device to obfuscate that situation until Second Stage debate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>My intention was to clarify rather than obfuscate.  I am sorry the Deputy has not followed me.  The decision to introduce the Bill is one to which the parties in Government agreed and have now implemented.  On the question of voting on subsequent Stages of the Bill, in the case of the Labour Party it is a matter for individual Deputies. That was made perfectly clear in our programme for Government.  I do not know if I have made that any clearer by saying it four times as against three times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Have the Government made a decision as a Cabinet with regard to collective responsibility in promoting this Bill?  This question is pertinent and germane to Article 28 of the Constitution and the whole establishment of Government within our Constitution and laws.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided to introduce the Bill and subsequent debate on the Bill will be carried on in accordance with what I have said. I have said this four times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is total evasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has told us that members of the Labour Party will have a free vote on the Bill when it comes before the House.  He did not say what would be the position with regard to members of Fine Gael.  Will there be a free vote as far as Fine Gael are concerned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fine Gael position as regards this matter was established clearly.  It is not in doubt that all members of the party are committed to vote for the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We are not talking about <Col N="129" /> voting.  We are talking about the collective responsibility of the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Taking it that there will be agreement from me, as Fianna Fáil Whip, to take this Bill next week, will the Taoiseach confirm or deny that the date in the Government's mind for the referendum is 23 March?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have not taken a decision on the date for the referendum other than the general commitment to have it prior to 31 March. The date will depend on progress in the Dáil and Seanad, subject to that constraint which we feel we are under in giving the undertaking that we gave.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In his consideration of the matter will the Taoiseach bear in mind the great deal of very valuable and important work that has been done over a considerable period in the preparations for the establishment of a national heritage council?  Will he agree that whatever other arrangements he may make with regard to the allocation of functions and responsibility for the cultural section of our administration that a national heritage council would be an important element in this area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Government have not yet considered the Bill but I do not want to suggest in any way that the Government are opposed to it.  Literally it has not been possible in the time available to consider the matter with a view to its introduction.  We must at <Col N="130" /> least consider the matter before it is brought before the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The details of such changes are as follows: &mdash; The Government, (a) on 5 January 1983 approved the transfer of responsibility for the affairs of the Council for the Status of Women from the Department of Labour to the Department of the Taoiseach; (b) on 7 January 1983 approved the transfer of responsibility for Youth Affairs from the Department of Education to the Department of Labour; (c) on 12 January 1983 decided that responsibility for the Pro-Life Amendment of the Constitution should be transferred back from the Department of Health to the Department of Justice which the Leader of the Opposition proposed on 24 September last should have responsibility for drafting the necessary Bill; and (d) on 20 January 1983 made an order entitled Industry and Energy (Transfer of Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order, 1983, formally transferring responsibility for certain residual functions in relation to the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards from the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism to the Department of Industry and Energy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach in a position to deny some persistent rumours to the effect that responsibility for Radio Éireann is to be transferred to his Department or to the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, in his Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Taoiseach a very simple question and I think we are entitled to some information about it.  My question is simply: is the issue of the transfer of responsibility for RTE from the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to the Taoiseach's Department under consideration at all?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree with me that it is regrettable that the legislation and subsequent referendum, having regard to the pro-life situation, should be transferred from the Minister of Health to the Minister for Justice?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In his reply the Taoiseach has indicated that the Government made an order transferring responsibility for this legislation from Health to Justice. Surely we are entitled to an answer?  Perhaps he would also give us some indication of his thinking in regard to this allocation because to most of us it would seem that the Pro-Life Amendment legislation would naturally and rightly belong to the Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This decision corresponds to a proposal by my predecessor, Deputy Haughey, in his memo to the Government on 24 September last which proposed that it should be drafted by the <Col N="132" /> Department of Justice.  This reversed his proposal of July last that the Minister for Health should have the Bill drafted.

      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment when it is proposed to provide an adequate water supply for the residents of the Hill of Howth; and when he proposes to make money available to Dublin Corporation in order that they may carry out the necessary works.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department conveyed approval to Dublin Corporation's preliminary proposals for the Howth water supply improvement scheme on 21 December 1982.  The corporation were invited to submit detailed plans for a first stage comprising a pumping station at Dungriffen, a new rising main and a new reservoir at Bailey Green.  The question of a financial commitment will not arise until the detailed plans are submitted by the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M.J. Cosgrave Mr. M.J. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the people on Howth summit were without water for two or three days weekly during last summer?  Is he aware that there is a constant danger of gorse fires in the area and that without a proper water supply the fire brigade are unable to attend and are hampered in their efforts to contain such fires?  In the light of that I ask the Minister to make available to Dublin Corporation, who tell me they cannot proceed with the work without money, the moneys to start the work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very happy to assist the Deputy and Dublin Corporation but we need to know precisely what Dublin Corporation propose to do before we can make commitments in relation to money.  I suggest constructively to the Deputy that as soon as Dublin Corporation are in a position to develop their proposals we will meet them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M.J. Cosgrave Mr. M.J. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot hear the Minister of State.  I have a great interest in Howth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The preliminary report on the Howth water supply was only submitted to the Department on 16 September 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJoeCosgrave" hpid="Mr. M.J. Cosgrave Mr. M.J. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M.J. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State said it was submitted on 16 September. Was that the complete works proposal?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The information I have is that the preliminary proposal was submitted in September and it was approved by the Department of the Environment on 21 December.  The ball is now back in the court of Dublin Corporation to develop that proposal and to get it properly costed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister of State any indication as to when the works are likely to begin and when they could be completed?  I agree with Deputy Cosgrave that this matter is very urgent, that there have been some very serious fires and great shortages of water there.  If the time scale looks like being very long would the Minister of State consider taking interim measures to deal with this matter on an emergency basis because this is a very serious matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department indicated to Dublin Corporation, when they granted their approval on 21 December, that as an interim measure Dublin Corporation should proceed with the first stage of the development, which would result in providing the kind of relief the Deputy is talking about.  We are encouraging Dublin Corporation to proceed on those lines.  The ball is essentially now back in the court of Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJWoods" hpid="Dr. Woods Dr. Woods">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State did not answer the other part of my question <Col N="142" /> which was if he has any indication of the time scale for the first stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It really depends on Dublin Corporation getting the necessary documents together.  I do not have that information in my brief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the seriousness of the matter would the Minister of State consider informing Dublin Corporation that he is prepared to look sympathetically at the matter in view of the difficulties that might arise on their part?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly look at that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the present position regarding Derrybeg/Bunbeg sewerage scheme, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Donegal County Council's preliminary proposals for Derrybeg/Bunbeg sewerage scheme submitted to my Department on 19 January 1983 are under examination.  I am not at present in a position to say when a decision thereon will be conveyed to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the terrain and the scattered conurbation type of development that relates to this particular area of Derrybeg, Bunbeg and Gweedore in general would the Minister of State's Department consider implementing this scheme in two or three stages over a few years, or is it intended that it will be one complete stage from beginning to end?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that this is a preliminary proposal which has been assessed within the Department but that ultimately it is the local authority, of which I believe the Deputy is a member, who will determine the order of priority and how it is to be implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>13.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment when he proposes to approve the contract documents <Col N="143" /> for the Ballybofey/Stranorlar sewerage scheme, County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The approval of this scheme must be considered in the context of the overall capital resources available to finance sanitary services and the need to conserve capital for schemes of the highest priority.  The contract documents for this scheme are under consideration in my Department, but I cannot say when I will be in a position to convey a decision on them to the local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the very urgent nature of this scheme and that it can be established that raw sewage is going into the River Finn in the towns of Ballybofey and Stranorlar can the Minister of State not agree to give this particular scheme some priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the documents have been in the Department for a very long time but I draw to the Deputy's attention the fact that the scheme is listed as No. 15 in the order of priority in Donegal County Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the sewage in this area runs directly into the River Finn and is causing considerable damage to fish stocks?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so aware and I would be very concerned if that is the case.  I would be very happy to talk to the Deputy about how we can move on this thing which has obviously been in the Department for some time.  If the members of Donegal County Council are anxious to contain it and are prepared to give it the kind of priority the two Deputies seem to signal it requires, then I would be more than happy to meet directly with them and discuss how best it can be implemented.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has yet finalised negotiations whereby the Department of Fisheries and Forestry will reinstate <Col N="144" /> roads which have been damaged in the course of extracting timber from forests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor brought this matter to the attention of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry last year.  I understand that his Department are considering the matter at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to raise Supplementary Questions on every item but I ask the Minister, in all sincerity, to ensure that some final decision will be reached in this instance because a number of people have had their roads, as well as access to the their homes and property destroyed?  The county council keep referring the matter back to the Department.  It is about time a decision was taken.  I urge the Minister of State to finalise this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have read the file and I share the Deputy's concern.  It concerns not only one particular area of the country but any area where there are forests has this problem and the roads are affected.  It is tied up between three Departments, the Department of Forestry and Fisheries, my Department and the Department of Finance.  It is in the interests of all, but particularly of local authorities, to get a resolution of this problem as soon as possible.  I assure the Deputy that I will be moving on it as quickly as I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that this problem will become aggravated with the opening of the timber-based industry in Tipperary this year, that huge loads of timber will have to be carried on our roads and this is something that needs immediate attention? Does he not feel that his Department must have a financial input to solve this problem, which needs to be solved this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe we have to have an input but I believe that some of the profit, which will now fortunately be generated from our State forests, will in part have to be contributed towards the <Col N="145" /> upkeep of the roads, particularly county roads, which were never designed to carry the kind of traffic that will be generated along them.  It will be my concern to ensure that some portion of the wealth that will come from the State forests will be used to ensure that people living adjacent to State forests will not suffer by having the roads churned up by heavy vehicles.</P>

    <P>15.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if every effort will be made in 1983 to have an emergency programme of repairs carried out on county roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is solely a matter for each county council to plan, to provide the finance required, and to execute whatever programme of maintenance works on county roads they may adopt for 1983.  I have no function in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State's Department be prepared to allow particular local authorities, who have a very large mileage of county roads an allocation of some funds from their national primary route grant or other grants to the block grant, which is the only source of revenue available to the local authorities at the moment for the repair of county roads?  In Donegal we find that we can surface roads only once every 17 years and this is very unsatisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that in the Deputy's constituency of Donegal, which has a substantial tourist dimension to it, there are arguments in favour of the case he is putting forward.  I suggest that if the county council, the elected members and the officials, can put up a sustainable case I will certainly look at it.  If it means that we invest efficiently in the road system then I am predisposed to look at it sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem is just not unique in Donegal.  It is a national problem. I suggest that there is sufficient <Col N="146" /> information available on files in the Department from every county to assist the Minister in making a decision on this. It is a question of finance.  The Minister of State is well aware of the problem because he and his party colleagues, together with members of the other party who form the Government, accompanied deputations to me when I was in the Department.  Can the Minister say if extra money will be made available in the budget this year to help the local authorities in regard to the county roads programme?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, I cannot give the information at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister considered the ludicrous situation whereby payments have to be made by the Department of Social Welfare as a result of local authorities putting men on three-day weeks at the end of each year.  This is a matter that has been raised by many other Members, including the Ceann Comhairle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would seem to be a separate question.  We cannot discuss at this point the whole area of the Department of the Environment plus the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept your ruling, I suggest that the question is not separate on the basis that it deals with the protection of taxpayers' money that has been invested in our county roads system.  We are trying to maintain that investment and I should like to hear what the plans are in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the large county road mileage in County Galway and also of the importance of the tourist industry there, would the Minister of State be prepared to make the same offer in regard to my county as he has made to Deputy Coughlan in respect of County Donegal?  Is the Minister aware that Galway County Council have made a very special submission to his Department outlining the particular difficulties they have experienced in recent years in regard to the matter of road deterioration?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has satisfied himself that there is no danger to children attending Laghey national school, County Donegal, in view of the close proximity of the school to the new national primary route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that this new national primary route is very close to the grounds of the national school and that there is quite a degree of tidying up to be done in terms of access not only to the school but to the village <Col N="148" /> of Laghey, would the Minister ensure that in the 1983 allocations sufficient funds will be made available to ensure that there is proper access to the village and that there would be no danger to the children attending the school?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, the Deputy is much more familiar with the area than I am but I understand that the county council are examining proposals regarding the provision of a bus bay, the lengthening of the under-pass adjacent to the school and also improvements to the junction between Laghey village and the by-pass.  I understand that these changes would go a long way towards allaying the anxiety expressed by the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the rapid deterioration in the surface conditions of county roads in Connemara, County Galway; and the action he proposed to take in the matter before these roads are eventually beyond repair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Responsibility for providing for road works on county roads in Connemara rests on Galway County Council.  Normally, such works fall to be financed from the local authority's own resources supplemented, in the case of improvement works, by the block grants allocated annually by my Department. The authority have wide discretion in the determination of the programme of works to be undertaken with these funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister prepared to accept that the funds available to Galway County Council are not adequate to maintain these roads at the standard at which they had been maintained previously? Will the Minister accept also that a serious deterioration of these roads is taking place and that the position as I have outlined is a possibility, that is, that the roads eventually will deteriorate beyond repair with very serious consequences for the whole economy of large sections of County Galway?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the Deputy's concern. As he is aware, the figures in terms of the amounts of money granted from 1980 through 1982 were substantial.  The Department are concerned that not only the local authority we are talking of but all other local authorities are experiencing problems in regard to county roads. We all recognise that part of that problem is the question of finance and we will have to think, in the context of the forthcoming budget and of future budgets, in terms of resolving the situation.  It is not something that can be resolved in one year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I did specifically mention that the spirit of the package was not being observed in some counties and I think, while it would be true to say that every council can truthfully and legally indicate that they have spent the moneys within the broad parameters of the scheme, the fact is that the moneys are being spent on matters which while important are not really related directly to farmers and their problems of access roads and lanes and so on.  Would the Minister look at this because it is well recognised that some councils are using the moneys for purposes that can only be very vaguely connected with the regulations but not in accordance with the spirit of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I will certainly have regard to what the Deputy has said but, if I may, I would suggest that the most effective way of looking at this at one level is that the members of local authorities themselves can supervise and scrutinise what managers are doing in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister examine this situation in which because of the shortage of money being provided for some years past under this heading the pressure to have roads repaired is such that nothing is being left for the less urgent or apparently less urgent jobs of minor drainage?  Would the Minister consider even within the moneys that are available that some percentage should be set aside out of the total so that some drainage work might be done?  Otherwise, the pressure for road repairs is so enormous that drainage would continue to be neglected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

If he is so aware, will he ensure that the allocation in the Estimates for 1983 will show a substantial increase on the amount provided in recent years?  In my view &mdash; and I should like the Minister to be aware of it&mdash;there seems to be in his Department a lack of appreciation on the part of the officials of the importance of the Local Improvement Scheme.  Is he aware that in previous years serious attempts have been made to reduce the amount of money <Col N="154" /> available under that scheme to local authorities?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the adaptation of the Local Improvements Scheme to take account of EEC aid available under the western package for farm roads it was necessary last year to advise the county councils concerned that:</P>
      <P>(a)  a specified minimum amount of their allocation should be devoted to farm road projects;</P>
      <P>(b)  that a minimum local contribution of 10 per cent, which is a necessary condition for EEC aid, would apply to farm road projects.</P>
      <P>In the case of that portion of their allocations not devoted to western package projects, it is open to county councils to apply the general principles of the scheme, which in appropriate circumstances may include a lower rate of or no local contribution, to other local improvement schemes.</P>
      <P>The provision for the Local Improvements Scheme for 1983, including the question of what funds may be available for particular elements which do not qualify under the western package, is being considered in the context of the determination of the Estimates generally for this year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that in practice the 10 per cent requirement is mandatory now?  The second part of his answer did not apply last year and because of that may I ask does he now subscribe to the principle that if you are poor and cannot afford to pay the 10 per cent you will not get your roads repaired? If he does not he will have to remove the 10 per cent requirement which has been a major disaster for hundreds of householders along the west coast.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not subscribe to the principle that if you do not have the money you should not get any benefit, but I would point out to the Deputy that in the areas to which I was referring the 10 per cent is not part of the legal requirement. If it has become the practice at <Col N="156" /> local authority level, then it is up to the local authority members, who have the power to ensure that the poor are not discriminated against in the way he has mentioned.</P>

    <Title>Private Notice Question. - Closure of Flour Mills.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if the Government will take steps to prevent the importation of flour and such other steps as are necessary to ensure the continuance of Ranks Mills in Limerick and Dublin which are due to close finally next week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the Government's wish to see all our flour requirements produced here but the provisions of the Treaty of Rome prevent me from prohibiting or otherwise restricting imports of flour from other member states.  The difficulties caused by the recent increase in flour imports from the UK has been taken up with the EEC Commission and I am urging them to deal with the matter as quickly as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While naturally I am concerned at the <Col N="159" /> closure of any flour mill in this country, I cannot interfere with the decisions of the owners in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the fact that over 300 jobs are involved, does the Minister realise that the production of such a strategic food as flour is of enormous importance?  At the moment Ranks have 32 per cent of the market and 16 per cent of our flour requirements are imported. If they are allowed to close next week 48 per cent of our flour will be imported and within a short time the amount will be substantially more.  In these circumstances would the Minister not feel it appropriate to invoke that article of the Treaty of Rome which allows a national government to take action where a particular industry is about to be wiped out or very seriously damaged, as is clearly the case in regard to the flour milling industry here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>My advice is that such action would not be allowed under EEC regulations.  This problem has not arisen recently but has been with us for several years.  We are very concerned about the level of importation of flour, from Britain in particular, and we are endeavouring to find some way of curtailing the extent of imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not aware that there is provision under the Treaty to enable the Commission to agree that a particular national industry is under serious threat?  In this case it is not just any industry but an industry which produces a strategic food.  In these circumstances could the Minister not make the Commission realise within the next few days &mdash; before this appalling event next week &mdash; the extent of the problem so that they will exercise their powers?  I am sure they will do so if the case is made strongly enough but if they do not, the Government here, whatever the short-term views of the Commission, should take the necessary steps, purely as a temporary measure, to keep this industry in being.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>This problem has been with <Col N="160" /> us since 1979 and Deputy O'Malley, a former Minister responsible for industry, must be well aware of the problems involved.  As I have said, my advice is that the measures suggested by Deputy O'Malley would not be in compliance with EEC regulations but nevertheless I will pursue that course to see if they would be acceptable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I raised this matter previously with the former Minister for Agriculture and I made the point that Ranks intended to import flour to supply their existing market.  Could the Minister indicate whether he has had any discussions with Ranks to find out why they intend to do this?  Could he also state whether he has asked the trade to refrain from buying imported flour, as the former Minister indicated he intended to do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Throughout his question Deputy De Rossa has been referring to the previous Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan.  We have had discussions with the flour millers and everybody involved in the trade.  As late as today, the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Hegarty, had a meeting with the directors of Ranks.  We are doing everything possible to avert the closure but vast sums of money are involved and I would not be in a position to give any commitment that we will be able to avert the closures in question.  We are doing everything we can.  It is also felt that there is capacity within the flour milling industry to provide for our own needs and there is not the necessity to import flour if we are in a sufficiently good marketing position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Article 86 of the Treaty provides for certain actions by any Government to protect the interests of any employees who are affected by unfair competition? While we have subscribed, some of us reluctantly, to the principle of free trade, we often forget the question of fair trade.</P>

As the Minister will be aware from the files, I met at considerable length all the trade union and milling interests involved.  At the end of the day the only real prospect is to seek agreement by the Commission under the relevant Article of the Treaty of Rome.  That matter must be pushed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the cause of this rather serious matter of the closure of two of Ranks' mills is related to the import of flour or might it be more profitable for the said organisation to import flour rather than mill it? If it is true that imports are the cause, what is to become of the other mills, much smaller and much weaker than Ranks, which are progressing and flourishing at present?  I would have a very grave doubt as to the bona fides of the whole argument made by Ranks as to the reason for closing these mills.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <P>In view of the grave public concern over recent events in regard to telephone tapping, bugging and so on, does the Taoiseach intend to make a statement to the House or to make time <Col N="407" /> available for discussion of this matter of great national concern, a matter which is of grave concern to each Member of this House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I think I had better clarify the position in regard to the Order of Business as I understand it, in order to avoid misunderstandings. Unless the Order of Business is controlled by Standing Orders and well established precedents it will degenerate into chaos which will not bring credit on this House or on Members of this House.  Standing Order No. 25 provides that the Taoiseach announces the order in which Government business is taken each day.</P>
      <P>There is no motion before the House and no room for debate.  Strictly speaking, even questions would not be in order.  One of my predecessors has ruled that, on the Order of Business, the only questions which may be permitted must relate, first, to the business of the day, secondly, to the taking of other business on the Order Paper and, thirdly, the taking of business which has been promised and which therefore can be anticipated, and fourthly, arrangements for sittings. Another of my predecessors has ruled that the Chair cannot and will not accept matters being raised on the Order of Business which are not relevant.  If this gets out of hand, any Deputy could raise any matter he or she thinks fit, which is not permissible.  For example, Deputy Mac Giolla, in all good faith, has raised a matter which could take up the time of this House for hours and perhaps days. That would not be permissible or in order.  I hope that I have made the position clear as I see it and as I intend to try to conduct the Order of Business.  I earnestly appeal to each Member of the House to co-operate with me.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we go too far with this matter, first, I would be grateful if the Chair would give us a copy of the document from which he has read, which outlines the matters.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I have the document for some consideration in due course?  I hope the Ceann Comhairle will give us an opportunity to return to this matter on some other occasion.  I agree that it is very important.  I cannot help remarking that the Ceann Comhairle, when on these benches &mdash; and, indeed, his own party &mdash; when we were in Government, availed of the device of the Order of Business to have many a protracted debate in this House.  However, if the Chair decides to reform us, even from the malpractices in which the Ceann Comhairle, with all due respect, indulged on many an occasion, then we from this side of the House can promise that he will have our co-operation.  We would be anxious that he discuss this matter with us a little further.  The Ceann Comhairle might have given us knowledge that he was proposing to make this outline of the ruling today so that we could consider it with him.  I will waive that and, now that he has made this initial announcement, I assure him that in principle we agree with what he is hoping to do, but we would like to have an opportunity of discussing it with him in some detail before it, as it were, becomes finalised.  There is one thing in what the Ceann Comhairle has read out which does disturb me as an initial reaction, which is that questions would not be in order.  Surely the Ceann Comhairle does not intend to maintain that particular stance?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>My predecessor ruled &mdash; and succeeded, I think in getting the House to accept &mdash; that questions would be allowed on the business of the day, on other business appearing on the Order Paper, on business which had been promised by the Government and which, therefore, could be anticipated, and on arrangements for sittings.  One of my predecessors so ruled at Volume 326, columns 541 and 543.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for his explanation of Standing Orders, with which I am not very familiar.  I raised this question merely because I believe that the credibility of this House is at stake and also because it appeared, from the manner in which two questions which had been addressed to the Taoiseach were deferred, wrongly I believe, to the Minister for Justice, to be an attempt to gag this House.  One specific question was definitely related to the Taoiseach and referred to an action taken by a previous Taoiseach, asking that the present Taoiseach take the same action. The fact that that question was deferred and will not come up for a couple of weeks seems to be an attempt to gag the House.  I hope that the credibility of this House will be upheld.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to ask a question which I think comes within the terms of the Standing Orders which have been <Col N="411" /> read out.  It is about the Book of Estimates. I was somewhat surprised to learn from the Minister of State, in the course of answers today, that the Book of Estimates has not been finally settled.  What is the exact position at the moment?  The Taoiseach knows that my Government produced the Book of Estimates.  There is a statutory or even, I think, a constitutional obligation on the Government to produce them.  Is it the position that the Book of Estimates produced by us is the Book of Estimates or will there still be a further Book of Estimates or some variation of them to be published?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the Book of Estimates produced by my predecessor is the Book of Estimates required to be published under Standing Orders and, arguably indeed, under the provisions of the Constitution.  However, at the time when the Government changed, the Government then in office had not reached the stage of taking policy decisions in respect of all of the Estimates which were published.  I have no doubt that they would have done so and validated the Book of Estimates in due course by so doing, had the Government not changed or the election not taken place.  This creates the situation that our Government have been left to take policy decisions involving £151 million in the Book of Estimates in respect of which no decision has been taken by the preceding Government as to how the Estimate is to be brought down to the level published. This situation is without precedent. Obviously we must decide whether, and to what extent, the particular Estimates can be validated by policy decisions in a particular area, or whether there are other policy decisions to be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are considering how, in those circumstances, we can present the data to the Dáil, because the normal situation in regard to a budget is that there may be a few changes, a few policy changes, to be announced in regard to the Estimates which can be fitted into the budget statement. That may not prove adequate in this situation and we are considering, <Col N="412" /> when we have completed the process of taking the decision which the previous Government had not concluded taking, how we can present the data to the House during the budget in a form which will facilitate debate and ensure full information.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I totally contradict the Taoiseach's statement that the previous Government had not taken the necessary policy decisions to validate the Estimates. That is not the issue here, but we can deal with it on another occasion.  I am concerned now with the technicalities. Are the Government accepting our Estimates as published and will they now proceed to decide how in their view those Estimates should be adhered to and implemented, which is perfectly within their jurisdiction &mdash; I am not disputing that?  On the other hand, do the Government intend actually to alter in some way, apart from budget changes, the estimates as published by us?  The Taoiseach will realise there are two separate matters: the first is the implementation of the Estimates by administration and the other is the Estimates themselves.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will give me an indication of the position in regard to both.</P>

      <P>If we were to arrive at a precise figure in regard to the Book of Estimates as the final figure to come before the Dáil we would have to take policy decisions in regard to £1,540 million of expenditure.  The question of the final shape of the budget is something to be disclosed in the budget speech.  It is normal practice for the Government to announce in the Budget speech additional expenditure or cuts in expenditure in respect of individual Votes.  The difficulty we are in, given the scale of the operation we have to undertake in regard to validating the Book of Estimates as published, is that it is possible that the figures in respect of a number of subheads and Votes will be different from what is in the Estimates.  The scale of that may go beyond anything that occurred previously. If that is the case it obviously poses a problem because the budget speech could be a very long one involving endless <Col N="413" /> detail, and we are considering how best to present such changes, because of their scale in order to facilitate the house on budget day.</P>

      <P>The question of how the Government will proceed is a matter of the greatest importance to us.

      <P>I appreciate that we will be having a debate on Dáil law reform later.  The problem referred to by you today has been outlined again and again. You quoted Standing Orders and I know from my experience as Government Chief Whip in the last Dáil that you know Standing Orders better than most Deputies. To arrive at your findings today you referred to the conclusions of previous occupants of the Chair.  The problem is that if you followed their line I could very easily quote the last Ceann Comhairle and the way he handled the Standing Orders that you have referred to.  He handled the matters completely differently from the way you did.  If you were to give, instead of the Standing Orders which you referred to, your understanding of the position it might have been better.  On a number of occasions I tried to get agreement with the Opposition Whips on this point and I failed to do so.</P>

      <P>Standing Order No. 25 reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every sitting of the Dáil shall be governed by a printed Order Paper which shall be prepared under the direction of the Ceann Comhairle.  The Taoiseach shall have the right to determine the order in which Government business shall appear on the Order Paper and, by announcement at the commencement of public business, the <Col N="414" /> order in which it shall be taken each day.</P>
    <P>That is it.  That does not allow for any debate or comment.  The other announcement I made was my understanding of the precedents here over the years.  They are precedents which I propose to adopt and do my best to enforce, with the co-operation of the House.  I am prepared to accept the invitation of the Taoiseach to discuss the matter either with the Whips or with the Leaders, or to have the matter discussed with the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the frustration of Deputies in this matter.  I do not want to anticipate the imminent debate on Dáil reform but I suspect that in that debate this is one of the issues that will be raised.  Some ideas were floated in the last Dáil with a view to overcoming this frustration.  If proposals are to be made in the ensuing debate to tackle this, the Government will take steps to implement some of the proposals as rapidly as possible without waiting for the completion of a whole programme of Dáil reform.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges could look at this problem when they have been appointed.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that its procedures should be reformed to improve efficiency and its control over the public finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is, I think, appropriate that the first item for discussion in Dáil Éireann in 1983 should relate to Dáil Reform.  The commitment of the Government to the reform of the workings of the Dáil has been expressed in a positive way by the creation of the position of Leader of the House with specific responsibility for <Col N="420" /> Dáil Reform.  However, I must also state that the present Opposition have publicly expressed desire for such reform through the comments of Deputies both here in this House and in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the fact that both Government and Opposition Whips readily agreed to a debate on this topic at the beginning of the session is an indication of the commitment on both sides.</P>
    <P>Our discussion today and tomorrow is a reflection of a growing feeling both inside and outside this House that the procedures under which Dáil Éireann operates are in need of substantial reform.  The parliamentary model on which the Irish system operates, indeed like many other democracies, particularly English-speaking ones, is based upon procedures evolved at Westminster in response to specifically English historical circumstances.  While many of these procedures have served us well, some have become irrelevant to the needs of modern day Ireland.</P>
    <P>We have seen over the past 60 years a dramatic change in the economic and social life of the country, which is reflected in the major institutions of State, in particular in semi-State bodies. But the Dáil and the Seanad have not kept pace with change elsewhere.</P>
    <P>To get this debate under way I wish in this speech to outline a number of ideas on how the Dáil should be reformed. Some of these are based on the already published Government discussion document <i>A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances,</i> but others are opinions of a personal nature.</P>
    <P>I think it is better that the Dáil should have an opportunity to discuss this subject on a general basis before it or the Government come to final conclusions on the line of action to be pursued.  Under our Constitution, the Oireachtas is given the &ldquo;sole and exclusive power of making laws for the State&rdquo;.  The question arises as to the extent to which the Oireachtas really exerts influence on the legislative process.  Government Departments prepare and draft the laws which are eventually passed by the Oireachtas, often completely unchanged by parliamentary <Col N="421" /> debate.  This happens because we have a very tightly disciplined party system. Thus, while there is ample procedural opportunity for detailed examination of a Bill, it is often not availed of because it has little effect.  This phenomenon also may be due to the fact that there is no facility for Members of the Dáil to take evidence from technical experts or interested groups on Bills coming before the Dáil.  Added to this is the fact that Oireachtas research facilities are limited by comparison with those available to Government and outside organisations.</P>
    <P>The growth of the State sector of the economy has tended to increase the power of the Government <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Oireachtas.  In most cases the State sector is accountable to the Dáil only after major decisions have already been made. The result is that the Oireachtas often does not have a constructive input.</P>
    <P>There has also been considerable growth in the power and influence of extra-parliamentary bodies, such as trade unions and employer organisations.  They seek to bring pressure on Governments, before decisions are taken, thus by-passing the elected representatives of the people.  There has even been a tendency for the links between major interest groups and the Government to become formalised in an institutional framework which further diminishes the input from the Oireachtas.  The Government are now engaged in working out new institutions for economic and social planning, so it is timely that the Oireachtas reform its own procedures so as to contribute effectively to this process.</P>
    <P>Dáil Éireann must reform its procedures and the Government must ensure that accountability to the Dáil is strengthened. Given its proper role, the Dáil would provide the Government with a counter-balance to pressure groups pursuing sectional interests.  This would make this elected assembly a focus for lobbying by interest groups, and confirm its role as the primary representative of the people.</P>
    <P>The public are relatively unaware of much of the work of this House.  In these days of instant news, the reporting of debates in Dáil Éireann tends often to be <Col N="422" /> obscured by other items.  Experience in other countries has shown, that where parliament is broadcast directly to the people, respect for and knowledge of the institution has been greatly increased.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to the specific areas of reform which this House might consider.  For back-bench Deputies, the opportunity of making a contribution to the major issues of the day is limited.  The two principal procedures open to them &mdash; apart from the Order of Business which we spoke about &mdash; are the Parliamentary Question and the Adjournment Debate.  Under the present system governing Parliamentary Questions, the subject matter of many questions has lost both relevance and urgency by the time they are reached.  This delay in the answering of Parliamentary Questions means that Question Time in Dáil Éireann is not being effectively utilised. The House might usefully consider, in this debate, how the system might be improved.</P>
    <P>The Adjournment Debate is by its very nature brief, topical and has the advantage of giving a Deputy a good opportunity to raise a pressing matter.  This process has served us well and should be continued.  Consideration should be given to an extension of the facility to Deputies to raise matters of urgent national importance in this House.  A possible way of doing this would be to permit more Private Notice Questions to be answered.  Clearly, there are drawbacks in that Ministers cannot always be available at short notice to answer such questions.  However, it is essential that we consider this issue in this debate.</P>
    <P>In recent years, the issue of greatest concern to Governments and the electorate has been economic policy.  Unemployment, national debt, and export performance are no longer topics discussed only by economists and academics.  While the Dáil does consider the budget, the Finance Bill and the Estimates each year, its input tends to be one of reaction to specific measures, rather than a more profound discussion of the economic circumstances behind them.</P>
    <P>In the case of the Estimates, these are not normally discussed until most of the <Col N="423" /> money has already been spent or committed. In such circumstances, debate is almost useless.  Nothing can be changed, no amendments can be put down and even if they could they would be meaningless because the discussion takes place after the event.  Furthermore, the format of the debate is not suitable to a detailed examination of the provisions of the Estimates.  A more appropriate format might be that which I referred to in the discussion on the Houses of the Oireachtas Supplementary Estimate on 14 July 1982.  This system, which operates in the New Zealand Parliament, allows Members to speak many times, but for no more than five minutes on each occasion, during an Estimates debate.  This allows for a type of committee stage discussion, with people speaking on a point, getting a reply and being able to contribute on a further substantive point later.  It allows Estimates to be examined on a line by line basis.  It does, of course, place an extra strain on the Chair both in terms of timekeeping and in keeping track of the number of times which a Deputy has contributed.  However, I believe it is worth looking at in practice, and perhaps the House might consider holding an experimental debate under this framework suitably refined to discuss some of the current Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Committee of Public Accounts examines the expenditures of Government Departments to ensure that money is spent in accordance with correct accounting procedures.  But it does not set out to analyse the underlying philosophy behind the expenditures, or the results expected from them.  There is really no assessment of the long-term impact of Government spending by the Members of this House.  For example, Deputies here have shown a consistent interest in the provision of an adequate health service.  Yet the facility has not existed for an examination of the service in terms of the resources it consumes and the level of care which it provides.  It is important that procedures be changed so as to allow Deputies to make this kind of examination in a constructive spirit <Col N="424" /> rather than simply criticising whoever the incumbent Minister may be.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, there is a vast area of the public service outside of Government Departments which depends upon the taxpayer to finance operations.  It is essential that a system be devised whereby Deputies can investigate non-commercial as well as commercial State bodies, without interfering with their day-to-day administration.  One must maintain a balance between effective management on the one hand and public accountability on the other.</P>
    <P>It was in the light of these considerations that the Government, following my statement as Minister for Finance in the Supplementary Budget of 21 July 1981, issued the discussion document entitled &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo;.  This discussion document outlined a number of ways in which improvements could be made.  A central feature of this was the reform of Dáil procedures so as to allow for more debate on the pivotal financial questions of the day.  Among the proposals was provision for a debate on the Public Capital Programme. This programme incorporates the Government's annual building plans together with public investment in roads, sewerage and other capital investment projects.  In view of the controversy often surrounding items of capital expenditure I believe it is high time that Dáil Deputies were given the opportunity of specifically debating the capital programme.  Allied to this is the question of borrowing and whether or not the finance raised through borrowing is achieving the right return.</P>
    <P>To increase accountability for public expenditure generally the discussion document proposed that a Committee on Public Expenditure be established backed up by the services of a Public Expenditure Commissioner.  It was envisaged that the committee would review public spending on a continuous basis and analyse the philosophy behind that expenditure.  The committee would be assisted in its work by the Public Expenditure Commissioner who would have fairly wide powers of investigation.  It was envisaged that the Committee on Public Expenditure would analyse programmes <Col N="425" /> in detail over an extended period.  For example, it could examine the area of education spending in detail and then move on to other areas of Government expenditure going right through the Departments of State over, say, a five-year cycle.  I should point out that this type of examination would be quite distinct from the normal Estimates debate which is done on an annual basis and where one is concerned, usually, with one year ahead.  The idea behind the suggestion of an examination by a committee on public expenditure is that it would take a long-term view of expenditure, looking at the type of trends that would not necessarily arise in a debate or be analysed in a discussion on an Estimate.</P>
    <P>It was also proposed that additional information be made available on financial matters, including the provision of an annual report on the budget deficit situation, if there is one, and a statement of expenditures likely to be incurred or to accrue from any new legislative proposal.</P>
    <P>In my view the most important proposal of all in the document was that debates on Estimates for public spending take place before the money is committed or spent.</P>
    <P>The discussion document &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finances&rdquo; contains proposals that range over a wider area than merely reforms of this House and I expect that my colleague, the Minister for Finance, will outline some of his thinking on these matters in the debate.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to aspects of Dáil reform outside the financial area. Experience abroad has shown that a parliamentary committee system can be very effective.  The Dáil might usefully address itself as to how committees might work better in an Irish context.  There are, of course, limitations.  The Dáil is a smaller Parliament than many, and thus the number of members available to serve on committees is less.  The House might consider the formation of committees with a smaller membership than has been customary to enable more work to be covered.  It might also consider giving members who are not on a particular committee the right to contribute, but <Col N="426" /> not vote, at committee meetings when they are discussing a matter in which he or she is interested.</P>
    <P>Committees not only strengthen accountability but they provide valuable experience for future office holders.  In order that a committee system would work effectively, and that Members would be prepared to give the necessary time to committee work, a way must be found to greatly enhance the public profile and prestige of committee work here.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the House might usefully consider if the introduction of broadcasting could be used to facilitate the establishment of a better committee system by giving committees particular attention in broadcasts.</P>
    <P>Another question that might be considered is whether chairmen of committees should receive some small extra remuneration for the extra work they must put in.  A study of experience in other countries might give us an indication of what would be appropriate.</P>
    <P>We must examine whether committees could play an enhanced role in the passage of legislation.  I have myself advocated the idea that the House establish investigating committees on some Bills. Such committees could, for instance, receive written or oral evidence from interested parties outside the House. This would assist Deputies in their consideration of legislation.  Obviously, some time limit would have to be placed on the deliberations of investigating committees so that the legislative process would not be held up unduly.  Deputies might usefully consider how this could best operate.  In this context we might also look at how best to keep an eye on delegated legislation.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I could elaborate briefly on the last point about investigating committies on legislation.  I have in mind that, where it has been decided by an all-party committee that Bills before the House were of such an important nature that the House would not be able to consider them adequately without receiving evidence from outside bodies who had done an amount of research on the subject matter of the Bills in question, the committee might decide, over a relatively <Col N="427" /> short period and obviously not a period of such length that it would interfere with the parliamentary timetable, to investigate the possibility of conducting hearings on those Bills.</P>
    <P>These hearings could receive written and oral evidence.  Possibly the best way to proceed would be to invite written evidence from anybody who wished to contribute.  When that was received, the committee might decide they wished to interview some of those who had submitted written evidence on the basis that the written evidence was of such a nature that further oral elaboration would be helpful to Members of the House.  This has happened before in regard to other aspects of committee work in the House. For instance, we had deliberations of the Joint Committee on State-Sponsored Bodies, but such a hearing procedure to my knowledge has never been contemplated in regard to legislation.</P>
    <P>With regard to controversial or fundamental legislation I would see merit in allowing some such input to be made.  An additional benefit would be that it would allow members of the public and interest groups to identify in some way with the legislative process.  By so doing they would feel a greater affinity with Parliament and with the Dáil than is the case at the moment.  We need to get away from the situation in which interest groups do not pay enough attention to the role of the Oireachtas in the making of national policy.  A proposal along these lines, which I concede is rather novel in the Irish parliamentary tradition, might be of help in this regard.</P>
    <P>The parliamentary question system might also be reviewed.  The aim should be that the time devoted to them be utilised to maximum effect.  Since the parliamentary question is such an important element in the democratic process, a system might be devised to allow a limited form of parliamentary question during the Dáil recess.  Obviously notice of questions during the Dáil recess would require to be significantly longer than is the case during sittings.  This might be worth considering in the House from every point of view.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="428" /> One obvious difficulty with the Dáil Session is the lack of hours available for debate.  It is my hope that they will be extended, possibly to Friday sittings, for an examination and debate of, for example, Private Members' Bills.  It is important that we do not simply extend the debating time as an end in itself.  In theory, if we could make our proceedings more efficient we might be able to do all our business better than we do it now, and in less time.  We should not simply extend the sitting hours to show how hard-working we are.  The objective should be to achieve results within the number of hours necessary to achieve them.  An examination could be made of the restrictions on the number of Private Members' Bills in circulation at any time.</P>
    <P>Another area which the House, together with the Seanad, might consider is the implementation of reports of the Law Reform Commission.  These reports are largely non-controversial in nature but provide the necessary basis for the updating of laws.  Given the expertise in both Houses, it would seem appropriate that a joint committee be established to consider Bills based on these reports.  I would be interested, not only in the views of Deputies on this, but also of Members in the Upper House, many of whom have shown a keen interest in reforming their own procedures.</P>
    <P>Finally, I should like to turn to what might be termed as the &ldquo;profile&rdquo; of the Dáil.  If Dáil Éireann is to be seen to be relevant, it must be as readily accessible as other modern institutions.  One of the reasons why Dáil Éireann has become less relevant is that other groups and institutions make considerable use of the electronic media &mdash; radio and television. This House has depended on older and more outdated means of reporting its deliberations.</P>
    <P>One way to bring Dáil Éireann closer to the people is for us to open our doors to broadcasting.  The Government have indicated their desire to do this along with implementing a number of other reforms in the joint programme.  It is important that the Dáil consider the most effective way broadcasting can be introduced. I personally believe that the introduction <Col N="429" /> of broadcasting would not alone make the work of this House more relevant in the public eye but would offer a considerable opportunity for the public to be aware of the less well-known and often more valuable work of the House. In particular, it would provide an opportunity to raise the profile of committee work in the House.</P>
    <P>There is one other matter which, as a longer term reform, the House might usefully consider, that is, the application to its operations of the advances which have been made in information technology in recent years.  I am not as familiar as some Members of the House may be with the possibilities of information technology. In many ways the function of this House is the exchange of information and opinion, and I am sure there must be many ways in which the House could do its work more expeditiously by using the most modern means available.</P>
    <P>I am sure also that technology could be of assistance to us in matters such as voting, and speeding up the decision-making process.  That is something on which there will be many and varied opinions. Some may feel that, even though the existing system is slow, it has many merits.  I heard a Minister in another Government say the only time he ever saw the back bench members of his party was when they were in the voting lobbies. I am sure that back bench members of Government parties would be very keen that any means of getting the attention of their Ministers would be retained by them.  However, there is no doubt that voting in the House does take a good deal longer than decision-making of that type takes in other organisations.  It is something the House might look at in this debate.  I do not have any preconceived ideas on it.  I do not see anything especially wrong with the existing system but, like all our existing procedures, it should be reviewed from time to time with a view to applying the best available ideas for its improvement.</P>
    <P>I also believe it is important that new Members of the House be given the opportunity to become acquainted in a formal way with the procedures of the House at an early date.  Speaking from <Col N="430" /> my own recollection, it must have been only after ten years' membership of this House that I felt fully confident that I understood Standing Orders and all the procedures that were available to me to make my views known.  I understand the Ceann Comhairle is investigating the possibility of providing some form of introduction to parliamentary procedures for new Members.  If that is so, it is a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>I hope that this debate will range far and wide.  I am quite sure that there are many possibilities for reform and improvement in this House that have not even been adverted to in my speech.  I know that other Members will have much to say about it.  During the term of the last Dáil, when we had considerable discussions, though not many conclusions, in the Committee on Procedure and Privileges on the need for Dáil reform, I was particularly struck by the very positive attitude displayed on all sides of the House on the need for reform.  In this regard I wish to refer to the positive attitude shown by the then Government Chief Whip, Deputy Ahern.</P>
    <P>I now look forward to Deputies making their views known as to how the Dáil might reform itself.  For my part and on behalf of the Government I can assure the House that the reform process will be pursued with speed and determination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>While we are very glad to participate in this debate it was not the party's first priority as we had asked for a debate today on economic matters which was refused.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I thank Deputy Bruton for his comments. In the last Committee on Procedure and Privileges we were working on an all-party basis, although the previous Dáil was not the best place to get agreement on these matters.  We started a number of processes to try to make this House more effective and open so that there would be a clear understanding by people inside and outside this House of what we do here in our daily work.  Deputy Bruton and Deputy Barrett worked very closely with other Fianna Fáil members and myself to try to improve the position and now, with the roles reversed, we would <Col N="431" /> like the Minister to know that he is assured of our support.</P>
    <P>I agree with what the Minister said about it being an open debate with everyone putting forward his or her views. Perhaps some of the views would not be supported by any party but they should be put forward nevertheless and afterwards the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or a sub-committee would examine all the suggestions which are made.</P>
    <P>People do not always realise that the monitors are switched on in Deputys' rooms and that they are listening to debates, but they should come in and speak in this debate because, too often, we read criticism of this House in the back pages of newspapers or hear it around the House.  There is an obligation on elected Members to put forward their views so that those of us who hope to work on reforming procedure in the House will know exactly what their views are.  The Government in their statement on 21 January indicated that the debate would take place with the agreement of the Opposition.  While the Minister has made a number of suggestions &mdash; and I know he has said they are only suggestions &mdash; I would like to make it clear that we agreed to this debate.  Any detailed suggestions on Dáil reform which the Government have in mind will be looked at very carefully by our Members. Deputy Bruton has done a lot of work in Opposition for his own party with regard to finances and other procedures so he has a good knowledge of what his party's policies are.  We will be submitting our proposals to whatever committee follows on from this debate.</P>
    <P>Back in the early seventies a committee to look at Dáil reform was set up but there has been very little change in this House.  We live, like all Government Departments, on precedents and procedures. Bureaucratic rulings tend to frustrate Deputies and make it more difficult for people outside this House to understand what we do.  Legislation, Questions and Private Notice Questions are so formal that they seem to stifle debate.  Time and time again Bills go through this <Col N="432" /> House without amendments and Members feel that, regardless of what they say or what contribution they make, they will not be in a position to amend a Bill.  It is very rare for an Opposition party to get Governments to amend Bills.  The civil service do an excellent job advising the Minister, and a Deputy on this side, with no adviser, tries to make his point but will eventually probably lose his train of thought or argument because he has not got access to the relevant files.  Perhaps if we had had outside businessmen or consultants down through the years much of the legislation at present on our Statute Book would be slightly different, not necessarily in content but perhaps in its detail and working.</P>
    <P>Major Bills, like the Telecommunications Bill, which is a massive Bill with several hundred sections, should be dealt with by a committee.  If it is debated in this House it will hold up other work and is a rather silly way of spending the nation's finances.  There is expert advice available to the Government and to the Opposition, although not necessarily from the civil service because they cannot be expert on every aspect of a Bill.  They should be entitled, for their own protection and for the good of the country, to have outside advisers to examine these matters.  That is the first reason we must put the committee system into operation.</P>
    <P>There is one major problem we must face at the outset.  Deputies are not active in committees.  Civil servants and clerks of committees spend much of their time trying to get quorums for their meetings. If we make changes they must be meaningful, necessary, practical and workable. Deputies are almost totally engaged in working for their constituents and while the problem has been eased slightly by the provision of one secretary for each non-office holder, Deputies do not have research facilities and any work they carry out in the Library must be done in their own time.</P>
    <P>Another major problem is the question of telephone facilities.  Ninety-five per cent of Deputies spend 95 per cent of their time working for their constituents and, even with the best will, they are not available to take part in debates of this <Col N="433" /> kind.  For instance, I have asked them to take part in this debate but I know there are problems.  I agree with many of the Minister's ideas but they will be workable only if people have time to devote to the matter.</P>
    <P>The present situation is that a group of Deputies may be working on some matter in Kildare House but when the bells in this House ring they must leave.  For example, 15 Members may meet in Kildare House at 3 p.m., the bells ring for a division which may take some time and then perhaps ten Members return to their work.  If there is another division 30 minutes later only five Deputies may resume their work.  The whole situation is ludicrous. I have sat on committees for almost six years and I am aware of the situation.  There should be pairing arrangements for people working in committees and there should be consultants available from within the administration and outside it.  Where it is necessary and where the Ministers have the time they should make themselves available to the committees.  The Minister suggested we might carry out this procedure on one or two Bills between now and the Easter recess.  If we could get this through we would do a good service to the nation.</P>
    <P>I am sure people in the Press Gallery will appreciate the following point.  Members come into this chamber and are told by their Whip &mdash; I have been guilty of this for a number of years &mdash; to keep talking for 45 minutes.  As far as the Party Whips are concerned it is not totally relevant what they say for that 45 minutes. During the years there have been people in this House who were excellent at saying nothing for one hour and 45 minutes but this is a total waste of time.  If something has to be said it can be said in a relatively short time and it should not really matter if a debate collapses at 3 p.m. or 4 p.m.  There should not be the attitude that the debate has to continue until 7 p.m.  Even if at the end of the day we were to have divisions on a number of Bills it would be better than having people waffle on &mdash; I hesitate to use that word but what goes on is not too far away from that situation.  I accept I have probably been guilty of this and I will accept <Col N="434" /> criticism on that score.  We must have constructive, short debates, with people speaking to the point, rather than worrying about divisions.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to Question Time has got worse during the years. Today we started with questions to the Taoiseach.  The position here is clear enough.  He will answer questions on Tuesday and Wednesday but not on Thursday.  After that questions are taken on the basis of seniority and in this instance the next person will be the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment and the other Ministers will take their turn in order of seniority.  The situation where a Minister can say he will not have to answer questions in the House for six weeks is completely wrong.  The questions raised today by Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Mac Giolla are correct. There are ways around that, as they will realise.  I did not want to tell that to Deputy Mac Giolla today but I will tell him in private.  There are ways to get round the matter but as he is a new Deputy he may not have known it.  Questions should rotate quickly so that each Minister will come to this House on a regular basis to answer questions.  It is essential that questions to Ministers should be answered within a fortnight or otherwise the whole situation is a laugh.</P>
    <P>Deputies are guilty in this matter because so many unnecessary questions are put down.  Last year the Association of Higher Civil Servants and representatives of lower ranks in the civil service wrote to us and spelled out the cost of parliamentary questions.  I met some of the members at the time and although I cannot remember the exact cost I know it was astronomical.  Quite senior civil servants have to work to get the necessary data.  The whole system is wrong.  Let us compare that with the situation facing an ordinary citizen who goes to a Department to ask a fair question.  That person will be dealt with by the most junior civil servant who may not be capable of answering the query.  However, in many cases silly questions are put down by Deputies but they have to be dealt with by assistant principals and principal officers. The system is quite ridiculous.  We <Col N="435" /> must look at the whole area of parliamentary questions and get some proper order into the situation.</P>
    <P>When I was in Government I agreed with a number of points put by the then Opposition and I feel even more strongly about them now.  I am referring to Private Members' time, Private Notice Questions, Question Time and statements.  At the moment it is difficult to raise any matter of national importance or public interest.  Parliamentary questions are not dealt with for many weeks and, as we saw today, Members who try to raise a matter on the Order of Business are ruled out of order because it does not come within Standing Orders.  Unless a Deputy is a senior Front Bench Opposition spokesman he will have no influence with regard to Private Members' time.  Therefore, the vast majority of my party, and the same applies to The Workers' Party and the Independents, have no chance of getting anything raised outside Government time.  If we could devote Thursday afternoon or a few hours on Tuesday or Wednesday night to debating such matters it would be of help.  It would also make it easier for Ministers because they would have notice of the matter.  At the moment people ask questions of a Minister on the Order of Business but he will find it difficult to answer because it will be only one of perhaps 100 matters with which he has to deal.  Consequently he gives a vague reply to get himself off the hook, to get out of the House and try to find out the situation.  It is a disorderly way to conduct parliamentary business. Perhaps we could have a system where if a Member wishes to raise a matter this week he puts down a question in the General Office.  Perhaps the House could sit until 8 or 9 p.m. on Thursday evening and devote three or four hours to dealing with this problem.  The Minister concerned would have a forewarning about the matter to be raised, he could speak for five or ten minutes, with the Deputy concerned also having the same length of time.  At least the Deputy would go home happy in the knowledge that he had raised the matter.  That will make matters easy for a Minister and an Opposition <Col N="436" /> spokesman, and an ordinary Deputy will feel that he is fulfilling his role in a parliamentary way on behalf of his constituents and many more Members will come into this House to raise issues.  The records will show that a large number of Members of this House who have been here for a very long time have never made a contribution to a parliamentary debate. That is sad but I am not critical of them. Unless one is something of a hassler or privy to what is going on on the front bench it can be very difficult to make a contribution.</P>
    <P>I have many notes on all these issues as have other members of my party who will contribute to this debate.  We should go away and look at this matter in committee and heed all the suggestions and recommendations made by the various Members.  We should set ourselves a deadline that by Easter the Committee on Procedure and Privileges or their sub-committees will bring before this House an all-party report on what can be done, and then perhaps we can implement at least a few of their recommendations.</P>
    <P>Perhaps sooner than that we should consider the question of the Order of Business for each day.  During the term of the last Dáil I suggested that if we had the Order of Business at 8.30 p.m. the House would be far more orderly than it is at present on the Order of Business. Members know that they can get very good publicity by raising issues that are in the papers that morning and asking the position on such matters, knowing well that they are out of order in doing so. The Ceann Comhairle tries to stop them but they have said what they intended to say.  They are horrified if later in the day they are informed that they can have time on the Adjournment or under Private Notice Questions to discuss such matters. They look to the sky and say, &ldquo;Oh, no, now we must do a bit of work&rdquo;.  Their purpose in raising such matters on the Order of Business is to get the media line, and my friends in the press will agree that such tactics work.  Something raised at 10.30 a.m. will attract notice in the media but if it is raised at 8.30 p.m. it will <Col N="437" /> not.  To help the House we should at least have order on the Order of Business, whatever about the rest of the day.  If as parliamentarians we can achieve that we will be seen to be at least slightly constructive. Five or six of my colleagues standing up and attacking five or six of Minister Bruton's colleagues will bring people to the public gallery on the Order of Business because they will say that the best fun is while Deputies are shouting at one another.  We are letting ourselves down and I do not enjoy being party to that.  We are here to try to do our best on behalf of people outside &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Maybe not to have it at all would mean being more orderly, but if we must have it then it should be at some time more orderly than at present. We should consider that matter immediately. It would help the Ceann Comhairle. Today he was running into trouble on what he was trying to set out.  I tried to assist him today by saying that he should spell out his interpretation because if he works on the basis of his predecessors he will be in great trouble. Each of his predecessors had a different interpretation of Standing Orders.  It would make life easier for the clerks who have to advise him on Standing Orders and precedents.  At this stage this House has so many bad precedents that we should try to get away from all that and start afresh.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many more of my colleagues will speak in this debate and I invite as many people as possible to speak on it.  It would be good to keep this debate going for the next five or six days in this House and try to achieve something from it rather than to continue to be seen by the public as a disorderly bunch not capable of running our own affairs.  I am afraid that many people outside have that opinion of us. As Members we must be seen to be responsible.  While it is good entertainment to have a little fun in here and to be disorderly at times, we must be seen as constructive politicians and parliamentarians at least earning what is a very bad <Col N="438" /> salary.  I am sure that by the time the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has finished with all the committees he will have us earning a better salary and working longer hours.  At least if we can convince the public that we are earning what we get at present they will not object to our getting more eventually.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not know that this subject was to be introduced or when it would be introduced.  I have come to the conclusion that you get to know more about the Dáil and its procedures from reading the columns of the daily newspapers than from being part of the system. I welcome the opportunity to say a few words.  This is the first opportunity I have had to say anything since I came in here.  As a new Deputy I consider it important that some of our newly elected Members of the House would say a few words on this subject.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I disagree to some extent with the previous speaker in relation to the importance of this subject.  I realise that the economic problems are of major importance but the economic position of the country is a typical result of the inefficiency of the Dáil.  If you have not got a Dáil with efficient operation then you cannot have an efficiently run country.  I have sat in the gallery on many an occasion for the last 20 years listening to debates and to Members of the House speaking for three-quarters of an hour or an hour and saying nothing, proposing nothing, making no constructive suggestion at all.  I agree with the suggestion of the Minister that it would be a very good idea if at least part of the business of the House was broadcast so that the public at large would be aware of what happens in this important House of Parliament. The information which emanates from the debate and procedures of the House is carried to the public by our friends in the press.  Live broadcasting of debate would create a greater interest in attendance here during debate.  Here we are discussing the most important subject that I can imagine being debated here, yet the benches are empty and people have gone away about their business.  An important subject such as this should be <Col N="439" /> debated in many other areas, such as in committee, before it comes in here for final discussion.  I would like to have had a copy of the Minister's speech before I came in here so that I could have some indication of what he was going to talk about and I could prepare some supporting or constructive ideas to put forward in a contribution about the main points he was making.  I have taken a few notes on the points he has made and wish to make a couple of suggestions.</P>
    <P>The Dáil as the Parliament of the State should be a model for other levels of democracy, local and county.  I see in corporations and county councils right up to the Dáil total inefficiency in the manner in which their business is carried out. I have not been long enough in the Chamber to make a detailed contribution on that situation, but I have watched from the public gallery and I have spent five or six weeks going around Leinster House trying to find out who is who and what is what.  Everybody on the staff here has been very helpful, but I did not know where to go or what to do.  I did not know anything about the procedures and nobody told me anything except what I asked.  I believe this point has been made already.  Some back-up facility should be given to each party located here in the miserable accommodation that we have, which in itself needs to be reformed.  This back-up should consist of some form of administrative research, some method whereby a Deputy, particularly a new one, can find out what are the procedures instead of having to wait until the Taoiseach comes in to read the Order of Business to know exactly what the order of debate will be.  I cannot understand why it is not possible for the order of debate to be dealt with and decided a week beforehand or two days beforehand and sent out to the Deputies so that they will know the order in which the debate will take place.  They would then be in a position to make a contribution to the different debates.  I can see no useful function in being a backbencher.  The main policy decisions of State are decided by the Government.  I do not know what contribution if any, a backbencher can <Col N="440" /> make to anything that may happen in the House.  Nobody has told me what the procedures are.  I should not have to come in here and participate in this debate to find that out.</P>
    <P>I believe that debate on capital programmes and where taxpayers' money will be spent should take place before decisions are taken.  I hear more on the car radio about what is happening in Government than I do in this Chamber. Shortly after Christmas I was having my tea at home when a gentleman rang me up and said &ldquo;It is a terrible disgrace about what has happened in relation to price rises.&rdquo; I asked him: &ldquo;What are you talking about?  I know nothing about that.&rdquo; He said: &ldquo;Were you not listening to the 6.30 news?&rdquo; I told him I missed it.  I felt an utter fool that a member of the public had to tell me about important matters which the Government had decided on and which I did not know anything about. Surely, if decisions of this nature are to be taken, at least backbenchers in the House should have an opportunity to contribute to them.  Perhaps a committee system, which has been suggested by the Minister, would be the forum where this type of debate could take place.  I would feel much more a part of Leinster House if I could debate legislation and if I had an input into legislation in a more positive way than the manner in which legislation is debated here.</P>
    <P>I believe the main thrust in relation to the development of this particular reform the Minister has referred to should be based on an input from all the Members of the House.  Some document should be presented to the Members which should contain positive proposals such as those contained in the Minister's address.  This document should be a combination of the views of all the Members of the House. We should have an opportunity of going into committees and discussing that in detail, proposing amendments and strengthening it.  Every Member of the House would then feel that he had an input into reforming what I believe to be one of the most inefficient institutions I have ever had the privilege of serving with.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe this is the most important debate the House has had for a long time.  Before I start I should try to set the tone of the debate by complimenting the Minister because he has put a lot of work into this area of Dáil reform.  He has written a paper on it and has obviously played a very important part in drafting his party's policy on it.  I have no hesitation in complimenting him on that particular work although I have different views about various aspects of his proposals.</P>
      <P>This is one of the most important debates which have come before us, for a number of reasons.  This Chamber has been operating for a long time as basically a nineteenth century debating Chamber and has not really availed of the management aids and skills.  It is quite clear to most observers that the way we run our affairs in the House leaves a lot to be desired.  I am only in the House for eighteen months having spent some time in the Upper House before that.  There is one thing I want to say very bluntly at the start: the relevance of this Chamber to the problems of 1983 is coming into question more and more every day.  Half the people of the country are young people. There are hundreds of thousands without jobs.  There are housing difficulties, there is poverty and terrible traumas now facing everybody, particularly young people in trying to live from day to day.  I do not believe they are inclined to look to Dáil Éireann as the kind of place that has the energy and the skills to solve those problems.</P>
      <P>It is our duty at the end of this debate to make the kind of decisions which will show that at least we are determined to put our own house in order.  It would also help to improve the bad image of Irish politicians if we could communicate with the public, as Members of the House, if we could reform our working day and our ways and means of making decisions.  If we can do those things we will have helped to improve the image of the Irish politician which is at a very low ebb indeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For many years a habit has grown for Ministers to make very important announcements outside the House at the <Col N="442" /> annual dinner of the chamber of commerce or the annual dinner of the vintners' federation or some place like that I would like to see that procedure changed.  I would prefer to see Ministers make serious major announcements in the House to bring back the dignity of the House.</P>
    <P>The committee system is the central core of the Fine Gael document.  While I agree with it we must be careful not to allow the committee system to stifle debate.  We must be very careful not to use the committee system to push debates into a back chamber where the public can eventually read the report of them in the library if they can get their hands on it. I do not see that as the role of the committee system.  I favour it, provided it is an open forum, provided the public know what is going on in the committee rooms, that we know what is going on in them and are not told that it is something we can pick up in the Dáil Library if we wish to read the report of that committee or this committee.  It could have the opposite effect if it is not an open committee and the public have not direct access to it.  The public are a little tired of the bickering and antics of politicians for many years past.</P>
    <P>We have had this bickering because we have concentrated on this adversary system of Irish politics where, if the Government say something is right, the Opposition will say it is wrong and <i>vice versa.</i> Life is not as simple as that and politics are certainly not as simple as that.  There must be a role for more consensus on issues that are very important, on issues that matter.  One area, for example, on which I fail to understand why some measure of agreement cannot be reached is the whole area of public pay.  This must be an area in which in the national interest politicians from all sides can try to arrive at some over-all conclusion rather than making a matter of such importance to the nation the subject of adversary politics from day to day.</P>
    <P>Still speaking about reports, I suggest that we adopt the British system whereby when a committee report to the House, rather than just evoking a short statement to the effect that the Government have <Col N="443" /> noted the report, it is mandatory for the Government within, I think, two months, to produce a formal reaction.  That formal reaction must deal with the substance of the report and then the whole picture emerges &mdash; the submission from the committee and the formal reaction from the Government.  That is very important because no matter how many recommendations we make, if they are pushed aside the whole exercise is a waste.  In this context I am thinking of the famous report on taxation which cost a lot of money but is still lying around.  Likewise, the McKinsey Report cost a lot of money and it is still lying around, too.  We should ensure that the Government make a formal reply within a limited time to any report submitted to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the formal reaction to which the Deputy refers then debated in the House of Commons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Apparently that is the case but when the report is submitted the Government formally submit a reply, a reply that is as formal as the report itself. That maintains the two-way system which is very important.</P>
      <P>The other point that must be made repeatedly is that the role of the Independent Deputy in this House is urgently in need of change.  This seems to be a place in which the Government run the show, where the Opposition Front Bench have a certain say but where, after that, the remainder of Members are here solely for the purpose of walking up the steps and turning in the right direction at the time of a vote.  That is not sufficient so far as elected public representatives are concerned.  Very often the reason given for not loosening up on a certain situation is that to do so would damage party discipline, would break down the party system.  On the contrary, it has got to the stage where a little more freedom, freedom to allow Deputies to put forward personal recommendations, can be worked out without breaking up the party system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of speakers have referred to the system of parliamentary questions.  I <Col N="444" /> suggest that by way of trial we might confine all questions of a local nature to the written answer part of the clár and allow only questions of national interest to be dealt with orally.  In some cases there might be difficulty in deciding on what is local and what is national but I am confident that this could be done with some degree of accuracy.  There is no excuse for questions of local interest being debated orally when they could be dealt with by way of written reply, though even questions for written reply have reached the stage that in terms of numbers the position is ridiculous.</P>
    <P>I accept that the House must have greater control over Government spending. The Minister's proposal that we should debate money before we spend it is so simple that one can only wonder why the House had not thought of it during the past 50 years.  It seems ludicrous that we have been spending billions of pounds and then coming here debating the expenditure and voting on it in the belief that we were carrying out our national duty.  I am glad that in their <i>Programme For Government</i>, both Fine Gael and Labour have agreed that Estimates be introduced in the House in September. I take that to mean that we will be meeting in September.</P>
    <P>An area that is of some considerable urgency is that of Dáil questions and motions.  Members on all sides of the House have been frustrated from time to time because of not being able to raise in the House matters of major national concern. We have had an example of this already today.  It does not make sense that matters of public importance and which are being raised in every public house as well as in every private house in the country cannot be raised here by reason of the procedure which provides that the question, after being tabled, must take its place on the clár and, consequently, not be dealt with for a couple of weeks though if the Government permit, it can be taken at shorter notice. That procedure is not good enough because it results in a situation whereby by the time we can deal with urgent matters the heat has gone out of them and we are unable to do anything about them. <Col N="445" /> That ties severely the hands of the House and it must be tackled.  If there are very urgent matters which are clearly important to the nation, they must be dealt with while they are controversial.  It is unfair that they be left aside for some weeks.</P>
    <P>In general, society has been passing out the laws that the Legislature have been enacting.  We seem to be unable to keep up with the changing pace of Irish society. In that regard I suggested to the House on an earlier occasion that we have a Freedom of Information Act, for example, and an Act dealing with the whole area of modern technology and the invasion of privacy.  The whole area of technology has gone way ahead of the law on technology.  Therefore, as a matter of some urgency we need the sort of legislation that I am advocating in that whole area.  Parallel to that we need to keep the laws up-to-date.</P>
    <P>When I spoke before on this subject of Dáil reform one of my main concerns was the relevance that young people attached to the House.  The whole question of pressure groups is one about which Deputy Manning has written considerably. If somebody wants action quickly the last place he would think of going apparently is Dáil Éireann.  Instead, he would go to the nearest pressure group who would then go off in search of individual Deputies for the purpose of seeking meetings with Ministers.  Ministers seem to spend most of their time with queues of delegations outside their doors waiting to discuss public business.  Leaving out some of the sensitive matters, there is no reason for such public business not being discussed in public with representatives of this House by way, say, of committee.</P>
    <P>The reason for the success and the importance of pressure groups in our society is the failure of this Chamber to respond to the pressures under which the pressure groups find themselves.  If, for example, we were able to provide enough housing, we would not need a housing pressure group.  If we were able to keep our family law up to date we would not need the various pressure groups in that area.  It is because of the failure of this <Col N="446" /> House to keep up to date with the legislation, to anticipate the pressures and to legislate for them rather than just respond to them, that pressure groups exist.</P>
    <P>I support also the suggestion that the Dáil should be the subject of some broadcasting. I would prefer in this context to concentrate on the committees rather than on this Chamber because in the future, we hope, the committees will be the fora at which detailed analytical work will be undertaken.  The broadcasting of such proceedings would let the people see that individual Deputies were able to handle the legislation that they were sent here to handle, or were unable to handle, as the case might be.  It is essential in the interest of democracy that such proceedings can be either seen by or heard by the public.  It is relatively easy to make a speech here in broad general terms but it is an entirely different matter to sit down and analyse in detail the various proposals that come before the House.  That is why the argument has long since been made and is, I think, almost totally agreed by all sides, that a suitable committee system is now essential.  Also, for that reason I would fully support the broadcasting of these committees.  The suggestion was also made that these committees should sit outside Dublin &mdash; I think it was the Minister's own suggestion. I see no reason why that should not happen.  The European Parliament, for example, meets in two locations.  I believe they spend a lot of time and energy moving from Strasbourg to Luxembourg&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe they have an office in three or four places.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is correct. Recently I heard it cost something like £5 million just to transport the documentation from one location to another.  I do not think we should go into it in that elaborate way: I do not propose that we move Dáil Éireann around the country as a travelling circus.  I would agree that some of these committees, particularly ones dealing with regional matters that are more relevant to an area, could sit in <Col N="447" /> certain areas outside Dublin.</P>
      <P>It is also suggested that minority reports could be forwarded &mdash; an excellent suggestion &mdash; because the Government always have a majority on a committee. That is one of the &ldquo;perks&rdquo; of being in Government, that you have a majority on all committees.  You are then locking in the minority as a permanent minority on that committee and a voting situation of 8 to 7 or 15 to 14 or something of that kind.  It is far better to have an honest report from a committee, take the majority view and the minority view and react to both.  The suggestion of having a special committee to deal with each Bill has long since been made and I agree with it and want to be on record as doing so.  It is important to head in that direction quickly.</P>
      <P>The length of the Dáil recess has been the subject of journalistic curiosity every August when editorials tend to appear about TDs' long holidays.  They also tend to appear in mid-January, perhaps taken out of the files and re-written at those times each year.  There is also the traditional call from some Deputy to have the Dáil recalled.  That usually comes about mid-September when everybody is getting back to work after the summer. Much of that ritual would not be necessary if we worked out a proper work schedule for this House and its Members. Perhaps one compromise would be that in September or July &mdash; sometimes the House rises early in July &mdash; instead of sitting every week and in order to keep the agenda up to date and keep in touch the House could sit for a few days and return again in, say, three weeks and again three weeks later.  That will avoid the enormous gap of three or four months or, if you must have a gap like that, you at least hit it in spots in between so that you can maintain some rapport and at least catch up on what has happened in the nation in the previous month or so. If we find we cannot shorten the recess I suggest that we have these intermittent recalls of the Dáil in an organised and sensible fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many other suggestions have been made to improve the House.  I think we <Col N="448" /> must reduce the adversary role, introduce in some areas more consensus, improve the role of the back-bench Deputy and put this House back in the centre of Irish politics because it has drifted a long way from that centre.  It must be put back quickly.  This House has been described as a passive agent, a conservative deliberate debating assembly, a 19th century debating forum &mdash; all these descriptions have been attributed to the House as it has been run.</P>
    <P>I want to mention the financial assistance given to the Oireachtas parties to improve their secretarial back-up and research facilities.  In the interests of democracy there is need for greater Exchequer assistance to the parliamentary parties so as to allow them to carry out their functions.  It is important at this stage to look at that matter.  While not mentioned directly in the proposals, the question of the multi-seat constituency is certainly implied.  As pressure grows on Deputies they realise more and more that the pressure and competition seem to be largely an internal party matter and that the people who suffer tend to be the constituents and the public at large.  I have no magic solution for the problem and I do not like the idea of not having proportional representation but perhaps we could again look sometime at the size of constituencies.  Recently, I was in Cork South-West and local people described the length of the constituency and the 150 miles or so that a Deputy has to travel from one end of it to the other and still get up and down to Dublin.  It is not possible to service constituencies of that size.  If a Deputy is to do all that, travel 60,000 or 70,000 miles a year and then get up to Dublin and after that be asked to sit down and become involved in a detailed way in a committee, it is not humanly or physically possible.  That area might be considered as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>The make-up of this Chamber at present without these committees favours policies based on the popular will and does not really lend itself to detailed analysis.  For example, the First Programme for Economic Expansion which was originally the blueprint for the economy was not even discussed in this <Col N="449" /> House.  Many economic plans which came after that were never discussed here.  They were &ldquo;laid before the House&rdquo; which means that they were in the Library.  We have run our economy since that first programme in 1978 without continuing to have fundamental debates on the direction of our economy.  Rather the fundamental decisions have been taken somewhere between the Cabinet and the public service, the National Economic Council, the employers and employees. All the decisions and inputs to economic plans came from somewhere in that area. The inputs by Deputies in this House to national economic planning have been absolutely nil since the first plan of 1958. This must change urgently.  Next time we have a national economic plan every Deputy should have a say in it before it is completed and put before the public. That is crucial.  The impact of our EEC membership and our experience in the European Parliament and in meeting parliamentarians from other countries must by now have shown us that there is a better way to run this assembly and that the role of the individual Deputy can and should be considerably increased.  That is rather urgent.</P>
    <P>In general the Fine Gael proposals to reform the Dáil by and large are on correct principles.  That is very much my own view.  The idea that you debate money before you spend it is a basic principle; the idea of giving Deputies a better role is also clearly desirable; the idea that you should open up the House and have the media here so long as this is done sensibly also seems acceptable.  We should be able to go ahead with a number of proposals pretty soon.  My parting shot returns to where I began, that the young people representing half the population do not see Dáil Éireann as a relevant chamber. The onus is on us &mdash; I am delighted we had the debate and I hope we can arrive at a precise conclusion &mdash; to show them that Dáil Éireann is still the main public assembly of the country and is relevant in trying to solve problems.  Young people feel that this is an arguing assembly where the parties have a great time arguing with each other without any real work being done.  We must dispel that <Col N="450" /> image.  Not only the image of this House but the image of the profession of the politician is at stake.</P>

      <P>It caused me some amusement recently when relatives and friends commented that I would be coming back to work today.  It made me realise that people believe it is only when this House is sitting that Members do any work.  Constituency work does not really feature in the public perception of the work of Dáil Deputies.  We would all accept that the work done in this Chamber is the fundamental and most important aspect of political participation. At least, that should be the case.</P>
      <P>Having heard only four speakers in this debate, it seems there will be a fair bit of repetition.  Perhaps this is no bad thing because if the same message is put over often enough it will be pressed home more fully.</P>
      <P>Perhaps my first serious remark in this context should be addressed to the Chair because it is concerned with the sound in this Chamber.  Probably I am speaking about refurbishing rather than reform but I have often heard Members having to ask that comments and questions be repeated, while those in the public gallery can hardly hear what is being said in the Chamber.  I would ask that it be recorded that the sound in this Chamber is not adequate and should be improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective of this debate is to make the work of the Dáil more relevant to people and to the institutions of the State. I am speaking from short experience here, having been elected in June 1981 and served both in Opposition and in the Government party.  I welcome the opportunity to contribute because the longer one is a member of a body such as this the more comfortable and the less dissatisfied one becomes with the flaws and deficiencies of that body.  I came here as a highly motivated person who likes to be kept busy and I found the approach to the business of the Dáil to be sluggish, slow and tedious, and there was a tendency to feel that it was rather irrelevant. I commend Deputy Bell for having made his maiden speech on this motion.  Very <Col N="451" /> few of us would feel equipped to make a maiden speech after only a few days in the House.</P>
    <P>I propose that we examine the matter of familiarisation sessions not only for new Members but for Deputies who might have been here for some time without fully understanding the procedures and operations of the Dáil.  When a new Dáil Deputy comes to sign on he or she is handed a copy of the Constitution of Ireland and the Standing Orders of the Dáil&mdash;not exactly light bedtime reading. There is much hassle over the interpretation of those Standing Orders.  Deputy Bell pointed out that he was rambling around trying to find out how the Dáil works and doing so more or less by accident. There should be sessions to explain to Members how the Dáil works and how best they can make an input and participate. Ideally this should be done on an all-party basis.  I was very fortunate as a new Deputy to participate in a very informal session where the workings of the Dáil were explained and which covered the area of parliamentary questions, the work of the Whip, the Ceann Comhairle's Office adjournment debates and Private Members' Business.  The maximum benefit could be obtained from such a familiarisation session if it took place after new Members had been in the House and seen its workings.  The Members could then ask questions at the session and be given helpful information. While one can obtain help to understand Standing Orders it is in seeing the House in session that one becomes really familiar with it.</P>
    <P>I would question the duration of speeches.  Deputy Ahern has already referred to the interminable length of speeches and most of us have at some time been responsible for long drawn out and repetitive speeches.  This is an abuse of valuable Dáil time and we should examine how speeches can be curtailed and made more relevant so that Members will not speak for hours.  Recognising the entitlement of all Members to put forward their views as fully as they deem necessary, I would appeal for a greater economy of words and a more varied <Col N="452" /> range of speakers contributing for shorter times.</P>
    <P>During the period in office of both the previous administrations, this House dealt only with essential business such as budget debates and Estimates and other financial affairs and social legislation have been noticeably neglected.  I would hope that this would be rectified in this Dáil and it is partially my responsibility.</P>
    <P>Other speakers have referred to Parliamentary Questions.  I recognise that the number of questions on the Order Paper has been quite incredible and very costly. I do not know the cost of each question but I know it is very high.  However, I would be sorry if anything were to happen to the system of asking questions.  It has been suggested that they should be curtailed but most Members would regret this because questions represent a valuable means of obtaining information for constituents quickly and accurately.  If better communications could be established between Deputies and Departments the volume of parliamentary questions would be reduced.  This would be a good thing.  It has been suggested that trivial questions should be disallowed, but who is to decide what is a trivial question?  For instance, a delay in a constituent's old age pension payment might appear to be trivial but if the information could not be obtained through the normal channels, it would not be.</P>
    <P>When oral answers are being given the Deputy who puts down the question might be given the answer earlier.  When in Opposition I found that to ask sensible supplementaries one needed to have a copy of the answer before one.  What we want are sensible supplementary questions, not just supplementaries for the sake of keeping the question open.  If it would not be an abuse of the system it might be a good idea to circulate the answer earlier rather than later in the day.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned Private Notice Questions.  Many of us feel very frustrated at the lack of facilities for bringing up crucial issues.  During the last session I felt very frustrated because I was not allowed raise certain issues &mdash; isues of crucial importance were ruled <Col N="453" /> out of order and the reasons were not given.  Private Notice Questions are considered on the basis of urgency and a matter of public importance, but it came to my notice recently by way of a circular in the ministerial office that an attempt was made to have such questions ruled out on the grounds that they are not urgent or of public importance.  This seems to be contrary to the purpose of Question Time.  I would like to make a case that Private Notice Questions be allowed more often while recognising that there can be abuses and that we must take the necessary safeguards.</P>
    <P>I would like the House to consider our system of voting.  Are we always to have the walking vote?  Our Constitution says that voting decisions must be taken by those present and voting, but should we not move towards an electronic system? This would be voting by index finger rather than feet.  I do not understand why we have still such an antidiluvian system in operation.  I have seen the system of voting used in Washington and we should consider it because it would save time and would be less tedious.</P>
    <P>Would it be possible to set one particular time of the week aside for voting? Obviously if there were a number of votes they could not all be taken the same evening, but if there were not too many, they could be taken at a certain time each week and we could get on with the business of the House for the rest of the week.</P>
    <P>The objective of this debate is to make our work more relevant.  In my view we should have radio and television coverage. I suggest we should have daily radio coverage of Question Time, as the BBC do for Westminster, and we should have television in the Chamber at special times &mdash; for example, the Budget speech, the election of the Taoiseach and debates on subjects of national importance.  There is avid public interest in such occasions. The voters are in many cases getting very good secondhand accounts of what is happening but I question why people can see in colour what is happening on the moon, on other continents, in Dallas, but can never see what is happening in the Oireachtas where vital decisions are <Col N="454" /> being made which will affect their lives.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the Minister's suggestion of debating the Estimates in advance.  This will require a great deal more time and will demand that we have much shorter recesses.  This is something I welcome.  Our summer holiday is too long and that is a valid reason for criticism.</P>
    <P>I am in favour of committee work. Having come from pressure group politics, knowing the frustrations of wanting to see specific measures incorporated in legislation and realising that this is not happening because there has not been the necessary consultation, I am very much in favour of consultation and support the idea of committees.  Would it be possible to let the public know about these committee sittings, as happens in Washington where the daily papers give a list of committees open to the public? Interest groups with practical knowledge in a specific area should be invited to put their views to committees.  These committees might be open to the media at specific times, with the agreement of the members of the committee.</P>
    <P>I am very pleased to have contributed to this debate.  We all agree that we should be more effective as a group and the more opinions and views we have about how people perceive their work here, the more able we will be to draw up the kind of reforms which are essential.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>My knowledge of the procedures is, like Deputy Barrett's, rather limited.  I am very pleased with the Minister's speech.  It has outlined difficulties and problems for Deputies, of some of which I certainly was not aware. He has highlighted these difficulties but has not yet indicated how they will be overcome.  Presumably, as he says, when he has heard the contributions, some decisions on this line will be made.  His point that laws are drafted by Government Departments and in many cases are passed unchanged because of the party discipline system has certainly been evident to the public in many cases.  He refers to the lack of back-up facilities for <Col N="455" /> Deputies leading to their being unable in many cases to contribute to the debates on Bills.  Certainly this is something which should be corrected.  There should be research facilities and information available to Deputies on whatever Bills might be coming before the Dáil so that they can contribute intelligently to the debate.  It is extraordinary that in 1983 it has been proposed that Estimates be debated before money is spent rather than after.  Without protest, for 60 years, people have debated the expenditure of money after it has been already spent.  It is good that Minister Bruton has highlighted this fact and that, presumably, some change will be made.  He is also suggesting a change in format which is better than <i>ad hoc</i> half hour and hour long contributions &mdash; a limitation of five minutes' contribution, but that Deputies could speak a number of times.  That would be much more satisfactory, both from the Deputies' point of view and from the fact that the contributions would be much more informed as the speakers would be contributing after hearing others speak.  From the Minister's speech, it would seem that the capital programme is not debated and it is now being proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Knock, presumably. This should be an item for separate debate.  It is quite shocking that this has not been so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A committee on public expenditure is an excellent suggestion.  Deputies could, either through a committee system or in some other way, examine the expenditure of health boards, for instance, or on education or in any Department, but <Col N="456" /> there is not such a system.  Deputies are aware that there is waste somewhere, but where it is they do not know.  They feel that there is wasteful public expenditure in a number of areas of Government Departments.  Through the committee or other systems they could make a contribution by being able to examine the expenditure and to see if there are ways of proposing savings or of giving a better service for the money being spent.  This is basically the most important point, particularly with reference to the health services.  If the service was good, people would be prepared to pay the money.</P>
    <P>The Minister also suggests &mdash; and I am surprised that it has not been done &mdash; that Deputies or the Dáil investigate non-commercial as well as commercial State companies.  I thought that all State companies were subject to the same examination, but apparently not.  In any area of public expenditure Deputies must have an input and be able to examine in what way the taxpayers' money is spent. The House is aware of the old slogan &ldquo;No taxation without representation&rdquo;.  Those who pay the money want to call the tune, to know how their money is being spent and they elect people to find out.  One of the basic functions of a member of the Dáil is to represent the taxpayer who is paying the money to run the country and who wants to know how his money is being spent.  It is right that all public companies be examined.</P>
    <P>A Deputy must also be able to examine private companies which are getting the taxpayers' money, either in subsidies or grants from Fóir Teoranta or whoever.  If public money is being poured into a private company, Deputies must be interested in whether that company are evading their taxes or whether they are withholding deductions from employees of PAYE or PRSI properly due to the Exchequer.  It has become quite a feature of recent bankruptcy cases that literally millions of pounds of public money have been withheld, deducted from the employees but not paid over to the Exchequer.  All public expenditure must be subject to examination, no matter to whom or in what way it is given.</P>
    <P>On the area of questions, I have not <Col N="457" /> yet come to understand the procedures. This is mentioned in the Minister's speech, but I do not see yet how it is going to be dealt with.  There are suggestions that local questions for oral answer should be given written answer.  That would not be acceptable to Deputies, but certainly there must be more time given to questions.  The possibility of Friday sittings has also been mentioned.  This is something which should be looked at. There could be time given perhaps on a Friday morning for questions on Private Members' Motions or Private Members' Bills.  This would allow for a greater volume of questions to be answered, not confining the decision to whether they be questions of national or local importance.</P>
    <P>On the subject of how to raise a matter of major national importance, it has been pointed out by a number of Deputies that there is no procedure for this, so that Deputies must try to raise these by false pretences.  There must be a system whereby Deputies will be enabled to raise matters of urgent public importance when the Ceann Comhairle recognises them as such.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not cover one important area, but it was mentioned by Deputy Brennan.  When we are asking why the Dáil is losing its relevance and credibility among the people, and too many people already have lost credibility in it, we must consider the importance Ministers give to the House when they choose to make major public pronouncements outside the House.  That procedure does not give the Dáil much relevance &mdash;such Ministers are conferring the credibility that should be given to the Dáil on chambers of commerce and other such bodies throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We have Ministers introducing mini-budgets during recesses.  On the last occasion they increased the prices of petrol, drink and tobacco, items which were always regarded as being relevant to the budget only.  The vast majority of the public had thought that taxes on these items were matters strictly for the budget, but on this occasion the Minister simply made a pronouncement that he would increase those prices at a time when the Dáil was in recess.  People have been <Col N="458" /> coming to Deputies asking them what they are doing, how prices could have been increased at a time when Deputies could not say anything about it or even ask questions.  The people have been asking Deputies: &ldquo;Is there any use in you being in there at all?  Does it matter? Does it mean anything?&rdquo; They think Deputies have no say in matters of such importance.</P>
    <P>The same procedure was adopted in regard to cut-backs in education.  It happened in Christmas week when Deputies were not in position to ask questions or to find out what had happened.  They learned of the cut-backs from the newspapers or the radio, the same as the ordinary man in the street.</P>
    <P>Another example of the irrelevance of the Dáil became apparent last July immediately after the last Dáil went into recess.  The Government at the time made a major change in their economic policy and Deputies, who for three or four months previously had been contributing to debates on major financial measures, learned that the Government had changed their policy from the major line they had followed in the budget.  At that time many Deputies asked for a recall of the Dáil because of that change in policy. Such a recall should be possible if sought by a sufficient number of Deputies.</P>
    <P>All these matters must be looked at by the Government so as to ensure that Deputies will be given more power of investigation, so that they will be enabled to contribute their knowledge, expertise, etc., so that more power will be restored to the Dáil and so that the public will see the Dáil to be relevant.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister on introducing this debate.  As some previous speakers have said, it is undoubtedly one of the most important debates that will take place during the current session.  On being elected eight or nine months ago, one of the points that struck me was the unfortunate situation in regard to the business of this House.  I saw the huge amount of legislation on the Statute Book which is outdated and the long periods of time being <Col N="459" /> wasted on issues of no great importance.</P>
      <P>Therefore, I think it is past time to initiate urgent reforms in the procedures and the structure of the House so that legislation which is so necessary for the proper government of the country would be enacted as a matter of extreme urgency and so that Deputies would be enabled to debate important social and economic matters of the day.  The sad situation is that Dáil Éireann has failed to move with the times: it is probably the one institution in the State which has failed to move into the twentieth century. The Dáil has been reacting to situations rather than giving leadership and propounding necessary policies appropriate to our changing times.</P>
      <P>Much of the legislation that has come before this Chamber in the months I have been here has been in the form of Bills to rectify unconstitutional situations.  Much of the time was taken up with debates concentrated on one party attacking another and so on.  This is bad, and as a young Deputy it has hurt me greviously. As I said already, if our young people had had an opportunity to see the last Dáil in session their cynicism towards Dáil Éireann and politicians would have become much greater.</P>
      <P>Since I became a Deputy I have noticed that administration work has formed the greater part of TDs' programmes.  I have come across much legislation which is grossly outdated and this has meant that many important reforms in all areas of society have not been possible.  I will mention one or two.  In the field of agriculture our most serious problem is land structure, but unfortunately the Land Commission are still operating under the 1935 Land Act which is completely out of date and which, if it has done nothing worse, has prevented the highly motivated young and talented work force in the Land Commission from getting on with the job they are employed to do.  In Land Commission offices in the west, for instance, the staffs are capable of remedying the serious problems which are choking agricultural development, but they are prevented from doing so by this outdated Land Act of 1935.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="460" /> In the area of the Criminal Law (Jurisdiction) Bill there is at present an outrageous situation obtaining because although crime is rampant our Garda authorities are incapable of tackling the problem because our laws are stacked against them.  For instance we have the ludicrous situation in which a garda has to warn a suspect of his right to silence, a situation in which a garda can apprehend a suspect on bail and know that that suspect will not be punished in any way for the crime he commits while on bail. Recently in many court cases throughout the country it has been the garda who has been on trial and not the criminal.  Yet we have had the parties in the last three Governments tell us about the legislation they proposed introducing.  Sadly, that legislation has not been forthcoming.  The situation has now become so serious that that legislation should be passed immediately.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Broadcasting Act, the situation obtaining is that there are at present pirates being allowed to operate the airways, mainly because the Broadcasting Act of 1926 has failed to keep pace with changing technology.  In the same way the Act which governs the broadcasting of television signals has been found to be grossly outdated, again because of modern technology, something which affects us particularly in the west.</P>
    <P>There is also the ridiculous situation obtaining in which Members of the House who receive British television signals are found to be breaking the law. Yet civil servants in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are not prepared to update that law to accommodate that technology.</P>
    <P>I have given those few examples but I could continue for another hour going through each Government Department giving similar ones.  In the eight months I have been here during the period in office of the last Government none of those serious, urgent matters ever saw the light of day as far as this House is concerned.  There is therefore immediate need to introduce into this Chamber the many Bills required to be considered by this House and passed by it as a matter <Col N="461" /> of urgency.  The Government Chief Whip mentioned on the radio yesterday that there were about 50 Bills emanating from different Government Departments ready for consideration.  Whatever Dáil reform is undertaken it must encompass a target of having those Bills introduced, debated in a constructive manner and passed as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <P>The procedures obtaining in the Dáil are not the only cause of the problem. There are two others.  One is undoubtedly the way in which legislation is initiated, drafted and considered in its infancy.  Therefore in order to reform Dáil procedures one must begin to look closely at the civil service.  Part of the reform about to be carried out will have a direct effect on the civil service.  Since becoming a Deputy I have held the view that it is about time we blew a breath of fresh air through the civil service because it is evident that, just like the Dáil, it is operating in the past.  It is quite clear that there are many outdated, cumbersome work practices throughout the civil service.  It is clear also that there is massive wastage of public finance in the civil service.  It has become evident to me that we have a fine group of people working in the civil service but, unfortunately, their initiative is stifled.  The work practices, the bureaucracy, the outdated procedures applicable within the civil service need to be examined carefully and updated.  It would be money well spent to have a professional work study team put through the civil service with a view to updating their procedures and work practices.</P>
    <P>Let me give the example in County Galway of a young person applying for a £1,000 house grant.  He sends his application to O'Connell Bridge House, where we must be paying a fairly high rent.  That application is then sent to an engineer.  As it happens the chief inspector for Galway lives in Cork.  Therefore some of those files will go to Cork requesting that man to inspect some houses in County Galway.  He will drive to County Galway, inspect the house and, when it is finished, he will drive there again in order to sanction the grant. <Col N="462" /> That same house will have been inspected, in many cases, on two or perhaps four occasions by a similar inspector or engineer from Galway County Council.  Administratively it must cost almost the same amount again to pay that £1,000 grant.  The sad situation is that those engineers from Galway County Council whom we have been told in the past are incapable of doing this work on behalf of the Department are found to be capable of examining that same house for a £14,000 local authority loan.  That may be a somewhat extreme example but it is an example of the kind of performance to be found throughout the civil service.</P>
    <P>In the same vein one only has to look at the administration of our different agricultural schemes.  In respect of most small farmers, and particularly in the west, I estimate that it is necessary to have six different officials visit a small farm in order to administer the different grants and subsidies payable to that farmer.  Yet the situation obtaining is one in which the amount of money paid out is abysmally small.  There is the situation also in which ACOT instructors, who probably constitute the most important part of our agricultural services, are in the ratio of one to 600 farmers in County Galway.  Surely it is time that system was changed, making one man responsible for all of the different grants, social welfare entitlements, medical cards and so on of those farmers.  Rather than having several personnel doing the same job one person should be wholly responsible for a group of farmers.  I estimate that such an arrangement would bring about a very large reduction in the amount of money spent.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that, unless we reform our civil service, reforming the Dáil will not be of much benefit.  Some speakers already have mentioned the need for improving the situation with regard to Dáil questions, recommending that irrelevant questions should not be put down. Although I have approximately 200 questions down today I must say I agree with those speakers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Do not change it until they are answered anyway.</P>

    <Col N="463" />
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I tabled those 200 questions for two reasons.  I did so because I asked Departments months ago to answer those questions but I have not received replies.  I am also anxious to show up a really inefficient system not in relation to the civil servants in those Departments but in relation to politics generally.  As politicians we are largely administrators and our role as legislators is, unfortunately, minimal.  That is another reason why there should be reform but without that reforming the Dáil will be an impossible task.</P>
      <P>Members must look closely at their role.  When I was first interested in politics I considered a politician to be a legislator, not an administrator or, to give it a more simple term, a messenger boy.  I felt there was a great opportunity for politicians to play an important role in shaping our society but since I became a full-time politician I have found that my time is largely taken up with administration. It is my intention to be good at that job because this is my bread and butter. Unfortunately, doing the work required in my constituency means that I cannot do the job I should be doing here, making constructive contributions to debates so that we as a group can initiate and enact legislation to bring the country forward into the next century.  It is unfortunate that that should be the case.  The Minister's task in trying to change the situation will be difficult but we must make a start. We must try to educate the Irish public that their representatives are more than just messenger boys.  We must make the public aware that the vast amount of the business we do &mdash; much of it is considered to be petty but it is important to all Members &mdash; should be done in another way. To that extent it is time we sought some other system of advice and administration to take some of the workload off public representatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ministers and politicians before have tried to make changes but their success was very limited in the overall context. Unless the Minister succeeds in introducing a method whereby we can become legislators and remove the important administration work he will not succeed. <Col N="464" /> We must realise that our role is as legislators and unless we do that it is a wasted exercise trying to reform the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Since I became a Member eight months ago I have found that from the time I arrive in the House at lunch time on Tuesday to the time of my departure on Thursday night I have to work flat out dealing with the problems referred to me by constituents the previous weekend.  I must emphasise that I have enjoyed the work and I have been careful to be efficient at it because it is my bread and butter.  I am glad to do that work but, unfortunately, there is more important work for me to do, as there is for all Members, and I do not have an opportunity to do it.  That is one of the reasons why Dáil Éireann has become so irrelevant and why our legislation is so grossly out of date.  There is a great potential for politicians at present but, unfortunately, it is not being taken up.  Another point worth referring to in relation to our role as politicians is the situation that pertains between Government and Opposition. The level of debate between Government and Opposition in the last Dáil saddened me.  In many cases the two parties felt they wanted to disagree for disagreement sake.  There was little concensus and, as far as one party was concerned, it was a case of opposing for opposition sake. There is now an ideal opportunity for the young Members to change that.  As a young Fianna Fáil TD I do not see the black and white situation that some older politicians see.  I enjoy good relations with the younger TDs on the Government side and I hope that will continue. In the debates from now on I hope we will consider the issues and never allow any personal vendetta arise between us. I hope we will show the type of consensus that has been absent in this House.  We should be prepared to see what is good on the other side, something that has been seriously lacking.  The House has suffered seriously as a result of that.</P>
    <P>We will provide the Government with constructive opposition.  We will strenuously oppose measures that we do not agree with or are introduced without proper consideration.  Already we have seen such legislation and, unfortunately, <Col N="465" /> we will have to strongly oppose it.  From what previous speakers have said it is obvious that all Members are in favour of an extension of the committee system.  I would like to see many of the technical problems in relation to the enactment of legislation, the problems on which Government and Opposition cannot agree, dealt with in a constructive manner at a committee meeting.  Both sides would then endeavour to find the best way forward.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why debates should not be broadcast.  We should look at other parliamentary systems, in particular in the US and Europe, to see if we can learn something.  In one system I have studied one of the normal procedures is that Members make short contributions which are well researched and, consequently, are listened to.  It is unfortunate that in the House we tend to make long contributions for the record but nine times out of ten nobody listens.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Parliament is one example.  If we improve our performance in the House we will achieve the results we all want.  We can speed up the enactment of legislation and we can shorten the long list of Bills which need to be introduced urgently.</P>
      <P>The Minister should look at this problem in three areas: first, to reform the structure and procedures of the House; secondly, to reform the role of the Members of the House; and thirdly, to reform areas of the civil service which affect our work in this House.  I want to refer to one other matter which is of vital importance to this House and to the country.  Many social and economic matters now affect us in our daily lives.  Many basic problems are affecting our economy but they never seem to come before this House.  The solution to many of those problems is within our own control.  I will mention one or two problems.  I have already mentioned crime.  There is also a need to create employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will give two examples which come <Col N="466" /> within the ambit of this House, politicians and the Government.  The first relates to the development of the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaign and import substitution.  The second is the development of our agricultural processing and marketing industry. There is also a need to provide greater incentives to work.  We have a great potential for the development of a better housing structure.  None of these problems seems to be debated in this House. When was there a constructive debate on the need for Irish people to buy Irish goods?</P>
    <P>With the exception of the introduction of the Housing Finance Agency Bill when was there a constructive debate on the housing problem?  The debate on the Housing Finance Agency Bill had to be finished in two days because of a guillo-tine motion.  When was there a constructive debate on the great potential for the sale and marketing in Europe of our agricultural products?  Unfortunately those issues which we could do so much about are never discussed in this House. On the question of buying Irish goods the fact that we import so many foreign products gives rise to a very serious problem and yet nobody seems to be concerned about it.  In my period in this House nobody has voiced that concern.</P>
    <P>The people should be motivated by this House to reverse the trends of recent years.  We are told that if we import foreign cement we will lose Irish jobs.  Ranks Limited in Limerick are closing because of the importation of cheap flour.  We see thousands of jobs being lost because we are importing millions of pounds worth of goods every year.  As politicians we could play a very important role in reversing this trend if we got the message across to our people and to the young people in particular.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>Those subjects should be discussed here on an ongoing basis. Every month there should be an important debate on measures to be taken by the Government to promote the selling and marketing of Irish goods at home <Col N="467" /> and to improve the quality and the value of Irish goods.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that require any changes in procedure which the Deputy has in mind?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>It involves changing the procedures and it also involves changing the basic way in which we consider legislation. There is no great need for the enactment of legislation to consider the problems I am now talking about, but measures should be introduced to create an awareness of them.  The ordinary people should be motivated to buy Irish products and that motivation should come from here.  The leadership required should come from here and it should permeate throughout our society and our educational system.  I give that as an example of a non-legislative area which should be discussed in the House.</P>
      <P>I wish the Minister well in his task.  It will be a difficult task and, for the good of this country, it is absolutely essential that he should succeed in it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister on bringing forward this proposal and the Opposition on their constructive approach to it.  It is overdue.  My experience in this House has been very disappointing.  The influence of a Deputy, whether he is a spokesman or a back bencher, on initiating legislation or examining legislation or State bodies is minimal.  I hope this is the start of a change in that regard.</P>
      <P>I regret that it was necessary for a Minister to introduce this matter.  I put down a motion on the Order Paper last year calling for Dáil reform and it was on the Order Paper for the life of that Dáil and was never reached.  That is indicative of the need for reform.  A Deputy cannot initiate legislation and he cannot even put down a motion and be sure it will be taken, or influence the House to take business on an individual basis.  A member of a large party may obtain the support of his party for such a motion, but the role of small parties of independents is completely restricted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The role of a Dáil Deputy should be <Col N="468" /> enhanced.  Mine is a multi-seat constituency and I represent 105,000 people not one-fifth of them.  I feel very frustrated on their behalf that in a sovereign parliament I cannot carry out the examination they would like to see carried out on their behalf.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey referred to the civil service and he was very kind to them while being very critical of the State.  If the civil service are due for criticism they should get that criticism.  For far too long we have protected people like civil servants, the Garda the Army, State-sponsored bodies and other people.  No matter how wrong they are, or what wrong they do, or how inefficient they are, we stand up here and say what wonderful people they are.  The first time one of us steps out of line and says that even a minority of the Garda or the civil servants are at fault, they nearly have seizures.  I believe that through Dáil reform we should use our powers to ensure that these people are held accountable for the powers invested in them by votes in this House.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the opening paragraph in the Minister's speech in which he moved the following motion:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann resolves that its procedures should be reformed to improve efficiency and its control over the public finances.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not want the word &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; to be equated with rubber stamping because we have got to the stage where we are expected to rubber stamp almost everything that comes before the House.  We need to introduce efficiency but, in the broader sense of that word, we must increase participation by the Deputy and thereby increase efficiency.  We are talking about the effectiveness of a parliament in a free, liberal democracy, probably one of about 15 democracies in the world.  It is hard to believe there are so few but, if you go outside Europe and North America there are very few countries which can be called free, liberal democracies.  If you ask for the views of this House I am sure that at least 150 of the 166 Members would feel that parliament is badly in need of overhauling and that they are not serving the best interests <Col N="469" /> of that liberal democracy as effectively as they might and that we are greatly in need of reform.</P>
    <P>I would like to see assistance for Deputies in dealing with legislation.  You arrive in here on your first day, nobody tells you what the procedure is with regard to the House or to a Bill going through the House unless you ask an officer of the House or an older Deputy.  Deputies come from all sorts of backgrounds, accountants, lawyers and business men and there should be some sort of induction course for legislators so that they will understand procedures in the House.  There should also be assistance for drafting amendments where necessary and for obstructing in a positive way, sections of a Bill without seeking to obstruct the whole Bill or sections of that Bill.  Even Members who have been here for many years do not know very much about Standing Orders or procedure.  For the newer Deputies it is a question of trial and error and seeing how far you can go and what you will get away with.</P>
    <P>I presume this debate will be short as there will be very little disagreement on the need for reform.  I am sure the Minister will examine all the suggestions made by Deputies and come back with his own proposals.  However, I do not think all the problems will be solved as a result of our first debate on the problem of Dáil reform.  I hope the Minister will agree to have a further review of progress at a later, fixed time when we can see if the reforms carried out at that stage are sufficient or if we need to change them.</P>
    <P>We give powers to State agencies and semi-State bodies who may not always act wisely on behalf of the public.  Deputy Fahey gave a good example of a person buying a house.  There are many occasions when people are left waiting because of rules and regulations which are archaic.  Having given the power to these bodies in the first place we should have procedures whereby we can call them to account if they misuse that power or where rules have been used to obstruct the very people that the civil service and Government are there to serve.  I also feel that because of the lack of ability of <Col N="470" /> the House to come to terms with that sort of problem many of the agencies to whom we give powers are laughing up their sleeves.  They know they can get away with a lot because there is just not enough time or structures available in this House to monitor or to examine some of the problems.</P>
    <P>Many of the suggestions made by the Minister with regard to committees are very good, especially those in the area of finance.  There are other areas, like foreign and social affairs, and we should consider setting up committees in these areas also which do not necessarily have to last for the full length of the Dáil.  They could be created for specific, urgent problems and be dissolved when they make their reports.  I have in mind, for instance, a committee on crime.  There is an enormous problem in this area.  It comes up constantly at public meetings and in representations to Deputies.  I am talking about all sorts of crime and a committee could examine the management structure and efficiency of the forces of law and order.  People may say that is a very sensitive area but the situation has got so bad that we should make no apology for setting up such a committee.</P>
    <P>Many people coming into Leinster House cannot understand why the Chamber is almost empty.  I suppose they find it even more difficult to understand that there are also committees in progress. Obviously, the work of many Deputies is done outside this House and they could not be expected to sit here all day.  It might help the Deputies' involvement outside the Chamber in reviewing legislation and Bills and preparing for committees if there was some sort of research facilities available to Deputies to assist them.  Unfortunately, there are no such facilities available and secretarial facilities are minimal.  We must look at the facilities which are available to Deputies to come to terms with their workloads and with the new proposed reforms, the necessary reforms, which will come along.  The facilities are not there and one cannot help but wonder if this has not been deliberately done by successive <Col N="471" /> governments to keep Deputies &ldquo;in their place&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to maintain farmers' incomes, to promote higher agricultural production and in particular to implement the £100 million exchange guaranteed cheap interest loans scheme for farmers to aid the restocking of the national herd as recommended in the Four Year Plan for Agriculture and as provided for in the Estimates published in November.</P>
      <P>This motion is concerned with two important related aspects, agricultural production and farm income.  It cannot be stressed sufficiently that the two points are inextricably related in that farmers' incomes can increase only as a result of increased productivity from the land.  In the motion we call on the Government to maintain farmers' incomes and to promote higher agricultural production.  In this we are talking about two inter-related objectives.</P>
      <P>During my period as Minister for Agriculture I was very conscious of that fact.  I had discussions with farming organisations and I found that the main thrust of the discussions at local, regional and national level tended to concentrate on doing something of a practical nature to increase the herd numbers, particularly cattle herd numbers.  This is an area in which we have not achieved any success in the past decade despite our membership of the EEC.  In that time they have devised a range of incentives and aids for the Irish agricultural economy that one would have thought would have resulted in a substantial rise in cattle herd numbers.  That has not happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have here an intractable difficult problem and it behoves whoever occupies the Minister's chair and the excellent <Col N="472" /> officials in the Department of Agriculture to work as a team to solve the problem. This motivated me to push strongly last year for the introduction for the first time of the calf premium scheme in the price package negotiations.  The full benefits of that scheme are accruing now and with the scheme continuing until next year as part of the package proposals I hope it will act as an incentive.  In my view the basic problem that needs redress is to raise cattle herd numbers and to provide the necessary aids and incentives to attain this objective.</P>
    <P>Last May we got agreement in Brussels on a package where almost £40 million was made available and which I hope will be made available in the coming year. That was an important help from the EEC but I saw that side-by-side with that there had to be a breakthrough in the area of lending.  Where a farmer was willing to make a commitment towards increasing cattle production he should be helped by way of reasonable credit arrangements to enable him to purchase stock or to replace it.  There should be a plan worked out over a four- or five-year period which was agreed with the advisory services, and on that basis a farmer should be able to raise the necessry finances.  Account should be taken of the land available and of the capacity, initiative and enterprise of the farmer.  The necessary credit arrangements should be made to carry that farmer through this difficult period.</P>
    <P>The problem with the farmer raising beef is that he has a longer cycle period to work out his profit situation.  I accept that aids are available in the form of grants from the EEC and at national level but a vacuum exists that requires to be filled to cushion the farmer who wishes to specialise in raising stock numbers, in replacing bad stock with good stock and in increasing his cattle numbers.  I have outlined the thinking behind this motion. I do not think the Minister or his officials &mdash; whom I respect, as I do the Minister &mdash; would disagree with that philosophy. It is a philosophy and thinking in accordance with the views of the farming organisations.</P>
    <P>In order that we would have the greatest <Col N="473" /> degree of concentration in raising agricultural output as well as the co-operation of the farming organisations, I established for the first time a committee that sought to concern itself with the preparation of a four-year plan for agriculture. This was a commitment we made in the general election before last and was one I implemented earlier last year when I became Minister for Agriculture. That committee met on a number of occasions and should shortly issue a report.  It was chaired by a senior official in the Department of Agriculture and had representatives of the farming organisations and the State and semi-State agencies concerned with agricultural development.  As part of their remit &mdash; and the Minister is aware of this &mdash; they gave me in advance of the publication of their final recommendations some interim recommendations that would form part of the final recommendations that could be implemented in a budgetary context in the coming financial year.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to do this in the interests of Irish farmers but as I saw it, delay might be involved in the committee deliberating about details and items over a period of time, running across the budgetary decision framework.  The Minister for Agriculture is as aware as I am of what I am talking about.  A committee could and should come in with a final recommendation by the end of this month or early next month &mdash; I would like elucidation on that from the Minister &mdash; but that would have been too late to implement some basic and immediate decisions which, I have come to a very firm conclusion after the sort of consultations and discussions I am talking about, could be implemented straight away without financial imvolvement to any great extent and without any great financial commitment.</P>
    <P>One of these matters, the important one, I refer to here in the motion.  It was a cheap interest loan scheme based on a Euro currency facility.  I will not spell out how that could be done, but basically what was involved was risk guarantee in regard to exchange changes.  Such a mechanism has been adopted previously in regard to industry and to agriculture. <Col N="474" /> Deputy Dukes, who was my shadow Minister for Agriculture, on both radio and television and also in the House thought that this was a sensible sort of facility that could be availed of and that there was no real difficulty in pursuing this.  For the record, what would be involved in this is making it available to the farmers I have talked about who would be engaged in a stocking, restocking or replacement scheme on a planned basis so that such farmers would have funds available to them at this low interest Euro currency rate that would run at somewhere in the region of a 10 per cent or 11 per cent repayment as far as the farmer is concerned. That was the type of loan scheme envisaged which would be substantial points below the current interest rate and would have a reasonable credit or loan repayment overhead which a farmer going into the type of enterprise I am talking about could carry.</P>
    <P>That proposal emerged after considerable discussion and negotiation with the farming organisations throughout the country.  That idea carried no financial involvement beyond a risk involvement to some extent, but even the most conservative estimates of risk prepared by my Department at the time did not envisage that any more than the £100 million which I have mentioned could be made available, £6 million potential risk as far as the current budget was concerned. There is no need to write that into the Book of Estimates, in case the Minister for Agriculture wants to make any point in that regard.  We were only talking about a potential contingency risk, and I emphasise that.  I would have the greatest expectation that at the end of the year one would be in a line ball situation where no real loss would be involved.  If there was a contingency or expectation of loss, that was a matter for which provision could be made in the budget if necessary by a line entry in the budget providing for such a loss.  A routine matter in budgetary preparations and in the preparation of Books of Estimates over a long number of years is that one puts in some money to cover a contingency.  That is all we are talking about.  We are not talking about an allocation of money as such. <Col N="475" /> What is imperative to remember is that we are talking about making available to the Irish farmer embarking on this type of productive enterprise a loan facility at attractive interest rates that would induce and encourage him to increase his herd stock.  That is what this scheme was all about.  It was a central scheme in my thinking and also, as it happened an important aspect of the recommendations made to me by this committee on an interim basis which of course will be incorporated in the total overall plan which will be produced by them, I hope, in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>It is there out in RTE and if the Minister for Agriculture or Deputy Hegarty wishes to go there they can confirm that.  During the election campaign we had a number of policy proposals in regard to agriculture &mdash; I will not go into them in detail &mdash; concerned with increasing production and so on in regard to this scheme.  Deputy Dukes said to me, and it is on record in RTE, that there is no need for any fuss about this. He said that he felt that I was making an enormous case out of nothing, that as far as he was concerned the provision of this £100 million on the loan basis I am talking about, based on getting money from European funds on a European currency facility that is there precisely for industrial and agricultural problems or difficulties of this kind, would present no <Col N="476" /> difficulty in ensuring that this type of scheme could be adopted.  Deputy Dukes said across to me on this RTE programme &mdash; I have not brought the tapes in but my recollection is reasonable enough and if he was here he would have to agree &mdash; across the table, &ldquo;Brian&rdquo;&mdash; we were Brian and Alan &mdash;&ldquo;there is absolutely no need for you to make any play about that facility.  It has been there before, it can be created or recreated again.  It is a facility that use can be made of and there is absolutely no problem.&rdquo;  To quote his words to me, there was absolutely no problem about adopting this scheme. Whereas we had disagreement in other agricultural areas, as far as this scheme is concerned we saw absolutely no problems. It was merely a matter of putting a line into the Book of Estimates making a provision for a contingency.  We proposed to do that in our budget and the Book of Estimates laid it totally open for us to do that.  That was our proposal.</P>
      <P>I have not so far gone into any political pyrotechnics nor do I propose to do so. I am talking about a single scheme which could be highly beneficial to the Irish agricultural community.  It is aimed directly at a key area of production which is to raise the cattle herd numbers and it is geared to the productive farmer who wants to make use of it, a man who will borrow some money as long as he is not crucified by excessive interest rates and can so it under this facility available in Europe, provided the Government take a very small risk in an Irish farmer who is going to do something productive on the land.  The risk in regard to that is minimal and the cost is minimal so far as any potential risk is involved.  Very briefly that is the whole purpose of our putting down this motion.  I would like to hear the Minister elaborate particularly on the central theme that I have sought to adumbrate.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because the last line states &ldquo;as provided for in the Estimates published in November&rdquo;.  I have the Book of Estimates here published in November 1982 and there is no reference whatsoever to the substance of the motion.  In actual fact I think the Ceann Comhairle made a mistake because he should have declared the motion null and void.  We are discussing it and I will get on with the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to deal at the outset with the broad policy of the Government towards agriculture and the conditions and environment in which that policy has to operate.  In our present economic circumstances, it is of more importance than ever before that policies for the individual sectors of the economy should be closely aligned with, and be complementary to, the national objectives, which have been clearly set out in the Government's programme.  The main thrust of these objectives relates to the need to foster economic recovery and growth.  In particular, in order that the Government can make a significant contribution to the country's economic recovery, measures must be taken to improve our competitiveness. These must involve the control of inflation and the phasing out of the current budget deficit.  Accordingly, agricultural policy must evolve in the context of the objectives which have been laid <Col N="478" /> down and within the very real constraints set by those objectives.</P>
    <P>In 1982 net output increased by 6 per cent and farm incomes rose by over 20 per cent.  It is the Government's aim to ensure that the momentum of the favourable trends in 1982 be maintained over the next few years.  Policy will reflect the basic principle that growth in agricultural incomes and growth in the national economy should be achieved in the most rational way possible, that is, through expansion of output and improvement in productivity.  This approach in turn implies that Exchequer resources must be devoted to those items of expenditure which can contribute most to the achievement of higher farm output and better incomes.</P>
    <P>In this context, the control of inflation must be seen as the most critical element of Government policy affecting the economy in general and agriculture in particular.  In recent years agricultural incomes have been squeezed as a result of rapidly rising input costs while output prices, being determined largely by the prices decisions of the EEC, have reflected the much lower inflation rates of the other member states.  Thus, a significant reduction in the rate of inflation here, combined with policies which enable us to derive the maximum benefit from the common agricultural policy will go a long way towards restoring profitability and incomes in farming.  They will provide the kind of economic environment in which output growth can be generated and substained.</P>
    <P>However, the control of inflation cannot be separated from the objective of the elimination of the current budget deficit. State spending on agriculture, in common with that of other sectors, must be examined and appraised afresh, with a view to ensuring that all of it makes a real and worthwhile contribution in terms of the rate of return accruing to the economy.  In present circumstances there can be little justification for the continuance of existing measures, or the introduction of new ones, which do not specifically contribute to the achievement of higher output.</P>
    <P>It is against this background that the <Col N="479" /> expenditure programme of the Department of Agriculture is being considered at present.  That examination has suggested that several areas deserve closer scrutiny.  One of these is expenditure on disease eradication.  While efforts to eliminate brucellosis are being quite successful and are showing positive progress, the same cannot be said of the TB campaign, which in fact accounts for the bulk of the money spent.  Ways must be found to ensure that expenditure in this area brings rapid and tangible results in the shape of a reduced incidence, and finally eradication, of this damaging disease.  We are looking at the various items on which expenditure occurs to see whether the money is going on the right ones and whether it could be spent more effectively, and with greater benefit to those farmers whose herds are affected by the disease.</P>
    <P>Moving away from these more general considerations, I would like to turn now to the specific question of low interest loans achieved through the granting of exchange guarantees by the Exchequer. This cannot be considered in isolation from the overall position in regard to national indebtedness and the cost of debt service which, as everyone is now aware, is a huge constraint on the actions of the Government in the public expenditure area.  External debt service costs represent a huge drain on Exchequer revenue and is, of course, a type of expenditure over which little or no discretion can be exercised.  While interest must be met on these debts, there is also the payment of exchange losses when, as has indeed happened on several occasions, currencies such as the Deutschmark and the Guilder are revalued.</P>
    <P>So far as agriculture is concerned, the State has commitments in respect of over £150 million of foreign borrowings by the ACC and a further £50 million authorised for lending to farmers by the associated banks.  In view of the potential cost of exchange losses in all the areas covered by State borrowings and exchange guarantees, it is obvious that the utmost caution must be exercised in undertaking further potential liabilities.  The scale of <Col N="480" /> the commitments already entered into just cannot be ignored in any consideration of new proposals involving further exchange guarantees.</P>
    <P>As regards the scheme referred to in the motion, I think it would be useful to say a few words about experience of a similar scheme, which has operated for some years now.  I am referring to the Eurocurrency Exchange Guarantee Scheme which has been operated since 1980 by my Department in conjunction with the associated banks and the ACC. Under this scheme the banks and ACC were each authorised to draw down a total of £50 million in EMS currencies for on-lending to farmers at rates which reflected prevailing European interest rates and also included an element to cover both the margins of the lending institutions and a contribution to the exchange risk.  Loans up to a maximum of £25,000 are available for a variety of purposes, principally for additional livestock, for working capital, for the erection of essential buildings and for land improvement.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that this type of scheme is virtually costless and can, therefore, be introduced without reference to efficiency and cost-effectiveness criteria.  A recent review by my Department has, however, indicated that the ultimate cost of the present scheme over a five-year period could be in the region of £20 million to £25 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It might be argued that expenditure incurred to date under this scheme does not show such a high cost. However, the nature of this type of scheme is such that much of the liability arises close to the termination date; hence a lot of the exchange loss will not actually arise until 1985, when the exchange guarantee terminates.  While on the subject of cost I would like to set the record straight and make it quite clear that, contrary to what is stated in the motion put down by Deputy Lenihan, no provision for a new scheme was included in the 1983 Estimates.</P>

      <P>Deputy Lenihan states that Deputy Dukes while Opposition spokesman on agriculture gave a commitment on the same lines but Deputy Dukes did not have to draw up the Book of Estimates and did not have to give that definite commitment.  He did not make the comment when advocating such a scheme that if it were to be brought in corresponding reductions in foreign borrowings would have to be made &mdash; quite a reasonable alternative but it is not as Deputy Lenihan has stated, merely a potential contingency risk, and that at the end of the year everything would be in a line-ball situation.  The actual nuts and bolts of the situation are that it would cost the Exchequer approximately £6 million for <Col N="482" /> which there was no provision in the Estimate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Far from being costless, schemes of the type suggested are potentially very expensive.  This is demonstrated by the fact that the financial institutions are unwilling to enter into such a scheme for farmers without an assurance that any exchange loss will be met by the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>As regards the interest benefit received by farmers, the review of the existing scheme has shown that this benefit is highly variable.  Since the start of the existing scheme the benefit has varied from virtually nil in some periods to almost 7 per cent in others.  A farmer who borrowed for a five-year period at the start of the scheme would to date have had an average advantage of less than 3 per cent compared with domestic interest rates.  Another point is that the cost of the scheme at any time does not necessarily bear any relationship to the benefit to farmers.  For example, there have been periods during which the interest benefit was low because European interest rates were then relatively high, but exchange losses continued to be realised and could not be avoided.</P>
      <P>With regard to the purposes for which the existing scheme funds have been used, approximately 50 per cent has been used for working capital and one-third for the purchase of livestock.  But the funds used for livestock purchase have not necessarily facilitated growth in the breeding herd.  Much of them seem to have been used largely as working capital by farmers involved in the various stages of beef production.  While some of the funds have been used to support production which might otherwise have been lost, on the whole, the scheme does not appear to have had the full impact on production which it could have if the funds were applied to the most productive areas of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At no point during the operation of the scheme has the total of £100 million availise <Col N="483" /> able been fully utilised.  At the end of December some £17 million of the £100 million was the amount available for lending and further funds become available according as repayments of earlier loans are made.  Thus, there is still significant scope for continued activity under the existing arrangements.</P>
    <P>In the light of the foregoing analysis of the existing scheme, caution in the consideration of any new and similar scheme is justified.  I have in fact initiated discussions between my Department and the lending institutions with a view to finding ways in which the existing mechanisms can be used more effectively to help to promote increased agricultural output, principally through expansion in the breeding herd.  These discussions are currently going on.</P>
    <P>I should like to re-emphasise that at no stage were moneys provided in the Estimate for such a loan scheme.  It is highly inaccurate for Deputy Lenihan to try to give any other impression.  I am confident that the motion was tabled without this knowledge being available but I will leave it at that and trust that the Deputy will see the wisdom of the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a rural area I can assure the Minister that farmers throughout the country will be shocked to learn that the money in question will not be available to them.  One is sometimes mystified to hear the Government announce that so much of what they are implementing was already decided on by the previous administration but in the case in question there was no decision on the part of Fianna Fáil about not implementing what was being requested by the farming organisations.  Instead, we were proceeding with their submissions.  There was a definite understanding on the part of the various farming organisations that the negotiations would be proceeded with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is giving a very simple answer when raising the question of whether the £6 million was included in the Estimate.  The greatest need in agriculture today is for investment.  The farmers are waiting for the Government to <Col N="484" /> indicate what money will be available to the farming community in the years ahead.  Livestock is the lifeline of agriculture. This £100 million that we hear of would have been used as a cash flow.  It would have strengthened the market and would have helped to keep up prices thereby giving encouragement to farmers and in particular to the dairy sector to produce more livestock.  Every day we hear our trade union friends shout about more employment but they, too, must recognise that it is in the agricultural sector that the greatest contribution to employment can be made.  Despite this, we have the new Minister for Agriculture telling not only the farmers but those working in other sectors that he is not interested.  If we do not produce more livestock we will not produce more jobs. Many farmers are unable to pay the high mortgage repayments they have incurred.  These people were looking forward to the £100 million being provided at a low interest rate but the Minister has indicated clearly that he is not interested in their problem.</P>
    <P>A £6 million investment into this area would have encouraged and enabled the farmers to increase production.  Many farmers will now have to scrap the many plans they had drawn up after consulting with professional people on production costs and so on because these farmers will not be prepared to incur further debt while those farmers who are not already in debt will not borrow money at rates of 20 or 25 per cent.  The message from the Minister appears to be that the farmers should forget about increasing production. It is clear that what the farmers want is a fixed low interest rate in order that they be in a position to plan their business just as anybody else can do.  I wish to record my great disappointment with the Minister's announcement and to warn him that the farmers will not forget the day the Coalition made such an announcement.</P>

      <P>We never made any commitment about this £100 million loan.  We are speaking for ourselves and this commitment was not <Col N="485" /> made.  It is important to have that recorded.  I do not have to emphasise to the House the importance of farming to this country; we know that it is the cornerstone of our economy.  Agriculture is for us what oil or mineral wealth is for other nations.  If we can develop our agriculture to its maximum it will be of enormous benefit to the entire economy.</P>
      <P>It is fair to say that Irish farming is at a watershed in its development.  We have had the initial impact of EEC membership which brought higher prices, more secure markets and significant improvements in output and efficiency.  Irish agriculture has shown itself to be well capable of taking enormous strides in development in the past and it can do so in the future.  During the greater part of the seventies the achievements of the farming sector were of major importance to the economy with beneficial effects on employment, incomes and exports. During the period 1970-78, the value of gross agricultural output rose from £344 million to £1,593 million or by over 34 per cent in volume terms; cattle numbers increased from 5,956,000 head to 7,125,000 head; average yields per cow rose by over 140 gallons per cow and cereal yields grew by 30 per cent.  Processing plants were modernised and expanded and educational facilities available to farmers have been vastly improved.  It was really a boom time in agriculture.  Through the farm modernisation scheme and other developmental schemes, farmers have been encouraged and assisted to improve their land, farm buildings and equipment in order to increase efficiency.  The harsh reality is that this bonanza is over, and we are confronted with a new situation compounded by the current widespread economic difficulties throughout the Western World.  These difficulties are further compounded by our inability to bring our economy and inflation into line.  The big problem about farmers and borrowing &mdash; and I know many farmers &mdash; is that most of them have over-borrowed and many are in difficulties as a result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware of the fact that over the past year or two the industry has been experiencing difficulties.  These difficulties <Col N="486" /> have had an impact on other sectors of the economy because agriculture supports such a large proportion of our population and because so many businesses and services are dependent on it.  However, we must look to the future and do everything possible to overcome the problems of the agricultural industry. Our task is to provide the encouragement and incentives to ensure that the industry gets back quickly on the path of progress and development.</P>
    <P>Any gains we make from now on in the agricultural sector will be harder to achieve.  I have been heartened in recent times by the growing realisation among farmers and those working in the industry in co-ops and so on that we will have to fight our way out of the current difficulties. It is heartening that they are prepared to make sacrifices for the ultimate survival of all.  Despondency helps nobody, and I think we should have confidence in the ability and strength of our own industry.  Getting this positive message across is often difficult as bad news generally seems to get better exposure.</P>
    <P>Agriculture in this country is fundamentally sound.  The gains we have made from EEC membership have helped us enormously and the agricultural industry has built up a position of considerable strength.  But we still have much untapped potential for future growth and development.  Of course, there are problems that we now face in both the short term and the long term.  The very substantial investment that has been made in capital and land improvement will continue to provide the infrastructures necessary to support increases in output over many years to come.</P>
    <P>In the long term our priorities must be to increase output.  That does not simply mean producing more cattle, milk, cereals etc. and leaving it at that.  We will secure that full value of increased output only if we attend to the other aspects as well.  That means producing more efficiently at farm level, having better processing and handling capacity, but above all marketing, an aspect that has certainly been neglected in some areas.  We must market the product more effectively at its highest value.  Everybody admits that <Col N="487" /> we have scope for the development of added-value products.</P>
    <P>The manner in which land and people &mdash; our most important national assets &mdash; combine together determines the general pattern of farming.  An obvious feature of our agriculture to anyone travelling through the country, is the great variation in type and quality of land used here.  At one extreme, we have many top-class farmers who use their land very efficiently to get the best possible return from it.  At the other end, there are many who make very poor use of the land they have.  In between, we have the majority &mdash; those farmers who do a fair job but who still have considerable potential for further development and increased output. We have the potential to get more out of the land and not just in what are regarded as poorer areas but in all areas of the country.  We must work to achieve that potential by improving the efficiency of farming wherever possible.</P>
    <P>Otherwise, we cannot achieve the growth in output that our country so badly needs.  Any country with a precious and limited resource, whether it be oil, mineral wealth or land has a moral obligation, in the interest of its people, to ensure that the resources are used to the best advantage.  Every effort made to develop our farms and expand production will generate extra employment for our growing population &mdash; not only on the land itself but in the processing, marketing and servicing areas.  In this way the benefits from development spread right through the community.</P>
    <P>One effect of the current difficulties in agriculture has been to highlight the fundamental importance of this industry in our economy and the vital role it plays in terms of employment, export earning and the balance of payments situation.  I believe that other sectors and groups in the economy appreciate the extent of the recession in agriculture and the need to get farm production expanding again. This emphasises the interdependence between the urban and rural communities and shows also how quickly people can recognise the importance and extent of this interdependence in a time <Col N="488" /> of difficulty.  It should bring home to us even more clearly that there is no real basis for a rift between urban and rural people, which is so often said to exist.</P>
    <P>A feature of and indeed a contributory factor to the problems in farming has been the decline in output which has meant a loss in throughput for the processing sector.  Jobs have been lost as a result and the decline is all the more unwelcome in that in recent years there has been considerable investment in plant and equipment with a consequential increase in capacity.  This is especially true as regards the beef and dairy sectors. People in my own constituency will be particularly aware of the consequences of the loss of throughput for the beef industry.</P>
    <P>Never before have farmers had such a variety of back-up services available to them to improve farm efficiency.  We have the opportunity to expand our agriculture and use our farming resources to an extent which was largely denied to us before accession to the EEC.  Any farmer who wishes to embark on development can be assured of first-class support in terms of grants and advice.  I want to see farmers making full use of the services that are available to them.  We have many farmers that have made outstanding and commendable progress in recent years. We need to have more of these.  I am particularly anxious to get through to the not so progressive farmer, the individual who for one reason or another has not seen fit to undertake any kind of expansion. The establishment of ACOT has added a new dimension to training and advisory facilities.  These problems are now being tackled in a co-ordinated fashion and I am confident that we will see worthwhile results.</P>
    <P>I can promise that the Government will give the maximum support possible at all times to the agricultural sector.  The response at farm production level and in the various other sectors of the industry, for the sector and the national economy as a whole is of vital importance.  For their part, the Government will do all they can to create the right environment for progress and expansion.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the greatest single <Col N="489" /> need in the borrowing and lending scene is to try to put right the situation where so many farmers have overstretched themselves in borrowing.  Here I must say that the rescue package which is progressing very favourably in conjunction with the ACC and the banks is beginning to bear fruit.  It is easy now with hindsight to say that perhaps farmers were a bit foolhardy to borrow such large sums of money, but we must remember that they were borrowing at very low interest rates and they certainly did not anticipate the kind of inflation which occurred.  In Deputy Lenihan's Estimates there were severe cutbacks and we must look to the end result.</P>

      <P>There were cutbacks.  If we are to bring the country back to solvency we will have to cut expenditure and if we are to bring interest rates to a realistic level we must be careful in our housekeeping.  It will be our rather difficult job to ensure that any hardship will rest lightly and that money will be provided in the areas where it is most needed.  I would hope that in 12 months there would be a fairly substantial improvement in inflation and bank interest rates.  Most of the farmers in the EEC are more than happy with the price increases negotiated each year but because of our inflation and high bank interest rates farmers here are less than happy with the prices they receive.  It behoves us on all sides of the House to try to put our finances in order before it is too late.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="490" /> This Government have the difficult task of stopping the rolling stone of inflation and difficult measures must be taken. We will be looking at all aspects of farmer borrowing and we will expedite the schemes already in existence.  We will examine these schemes, together with the scheme for additional heifers, in an effort to make them more workable.  We will also try to streamline the financial packages from the lending agencies.</P>

      <P>No, the Deputy spoke about new borrowings whereas I am talking about existing borrowings.  Additional borrowings will not solve any problems at this stage.  The farmers who are in trouble are those who have already borrowed heavily.  These are the farmers who are most progressive and who are producing most, very often on limited acreage and with very limited assets.  We must try to help them.  It is unfair of the former Minister to say he had made provision for this.  It is not the case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this motion.  I wish every success to Deputy Deasy in his position as Minister for Agriculture and also extend good wishes to the two Ministers of State.  They are charged with a very important responsibility, whether the life of this Government is long or short.  Agriculture is our most important industry, regardless of the foreign industries which have been brought in.  When this country was at a crossroads during the war years, when the nation needed to be fed and people had to be made secure in their homes, farmers, under a Fianna Fáil Government and a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, rose to the occasion and were not found wanting in producing the necessary food for our people and the livestock to create wealth for the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the new Minister for Agriculture is shilly-shallying about the very important groundwork laid down by the previous Minister when he called in the farming organisations and the banking groups for discussions over a period of nine months in order to find <Col N="491" /> the best possible means of helping the farming industry.  That policy is to be thrown into reverse but I appeal to the Minister to reconsider.  Thousands of farmers cannot qualify under the existing schemes, not through their own fault but because of technicalities and for various other reasons.  The proposed scheme would help such people and it is a shame that we should hesitate about it.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the necessity to create jobs and this is an area in which there is potential for thousands of jobs. Many of our meat factories are working well below capacity because of a shortage of livestock.  We must ensure that more livestock will come on stream.  Many jobs could be created in creameries and processing factories.  In my own constituency the firm of Robert Wilson laid off over 100 people in Cahir due to the shortage of livestock.  I appeal to the Minister to reconsider his decision to pour cold water on the hard work done during nine months.  What will be the opinion of those who participated in the discussions held by the former Minister?</P>
    <P>The only way to create lasting jobs is through agriculture, our main industry. It can give employment and create genuine exports.  It has been proved that money invested in agriculture is money well spent and thousands of new jobs have been created in rural areas.  I am confident that the farming organisations will alert the Minister to the dangers of his decision.  I am sure the Minister and the Ministers of State watched closely while Deputy Lenihan was developing his four-year plan for agriculture.  It is sad that this is now to be thrown aside.  What is £25 million in the context of our chief industry?  We are pouring millions into industries that may not last very long and £25 million would be used up by only a small number of industries.  The people who suggest that the £25 million to support this scheme is money badly spent do not have the interests of this country at heart and are not interested in creating jobs or helping the farming community. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter before budget day.  This scheme was well thought out and researched by <Col N="492" /> the officials of the Department, the Minister, the banks, the IFA, the ICMSA and the ACC.  I do not know why it is being suggested that this scheme should be put on one side.</P>
    <P>About an hour ago Deputies were speaking about reforms in this House but simply because we have a change of Government is not a good enough reason to throw out a good scheme.  Another hard look should be taken at this scheme because it will give hope to our young farmers who were caught in the trap of buying land at very high prices.  These men developed their holdings and will now have to sell portions of their holdings to survive, thus making their holdings less economic.  I appeal to the Minister to look at this scheme again because if he throws it out he will regret it in years to come.  The Minister comes from rural Ireland, as do his Ministers of State, and I hope they will put pressure on the Minister for Finance between now and budget day to think again for the sake of the country, the farmers and the young people looking for jobs.  It has been proved over the last 60 years that if our farmers are down, the country is down.</P>

      <P>I am delighted to have this opportunity to say a few words on this very important subject. I cannot but take notice of the air of sensationalism on the Opposition benches.  I agree with most of what they said until they discussed the problem at hand.  Listening to Deputy Byrne one gets the impression that the only problem facing our farmers is whether we have enough cheap money for productive purposes. From my knowledge of farming &mdash; I am a farmer &mdash; some of the enormous problems facing our farmers go back over the past four or five years.  What is important at this stage is that we do all in our power to help the people who over-borrowed. A man with a wife and family may have over-borrowed through no fault of his own.  He carried out the plans laid out for him at a time of low inflation and when it was expected that the green <Col N="493" /> pound would be devalued each time we went to Brussels.  The best of farmers got caught in that situation.</P>
      <P>The last Coalition Government spent a lot of time trying to get a rescue package off the ground and so get these people out of that terrible fix.</P>

      <P>The chief agricultural objective of this Government is to secure real income increases for the many thousands of farm families dependent on the land for a living.  In addition it is our ambition to achieve a period of sustained growth in the volume of farm output.  The land of this country represents our most important national resource.  We have an obligation to use it productively and fully. In our present economic situation we cannot afford to have an agricultural sector working at less than full capacity.  It is essential, therefore, that agriculture be at the forefront of any economic recovery.</P>
      <P>Farming in this country has been locked in a price-cost squeeze since the beginning of the recession.  I believe that the key to success in the future lies in enabling the industry to break free from this constraint.  Only then will it be in a position to increase the volume of output, to improve performance and to realise its full potential.  I think we can achieve this objective by a combination of three policies; securing the best possible benefits and increases at EEC level; through reducing inflation, and by taking action to identify and implement the most efficient use of the resources, land labour and capital.  We must be price competitive and this principle applies to agriculture as much as it does to any other sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At EEC level I am under no illusions as to the magnitude of the task in hand. The price proposals recently published by the EEC Commission are unsatisfactory though there are some aspects which I welcome, such as the continuation of <Col N="495" /> the very important calf subsidy scheme. I would emphasise that these are only proposals.  The final outcome will be determined by what happens at the negotiations which will take place at the Council of Ministers in the coming weeks.  In whatever discussions take place we will attempt to secure the best possible price increase for our farmers &mdash; and I give the House that guarantee tonight.  We will also seek other measures which we consider necessary to assist our agriculture and we will oppose those measures which are not in the best interests of the industry.  The low rate of price increase proposed reflects a very different situation at EEC level.  We all know that the CAP has been under considerable attack and we have to accept that some change in that policy is inevitable from time to time.  However, what we will not accept is any tinkering with the basic principles of the CAP.  I want to give an assurance that the Government will be staunch and determined in their defence of these principles.</P>
    <P>The future success of policies to reinvigorate agriculture is dependent, not just on our success at EEC level but also on efforts to reduce domestic inflation. The common agricultural policy cannot provide the full solution to our problems while domestic inflation continues at rates significantly higher than those being experienced by our colleagues in the Community.  Indeed, as everybody well knows, one of the big problems that we have always had is that, no matter what price increase we get in Europe, because our inflation rate is so high, by the time that price increase is related to Irish agriculture we do not have even a net increase.  Thus policies being produced now to increase inflation, including the elimination of the current budget deficit and the achievement of moderation in wages and incomes, will have, we hope, an immediate effect on profitability in agriculture.  The key to success lies in all those component parts being put together.</P>
    <P>Finally, success at EEC level in securing maximum benefit for our farmers and the further impetus to be derived from a <Col N="496" /> reduction in domestic inflation must be consolidated by efforts to improve efficiency and productivity on every individual farm.  Each farmer must re-examine his farm programme to identify the most efficient use of the resources at his disposal. In this context there is great scope for immediate action not requiring large new investments.</P>
    <P>On many farms it still appears that the basic element of grassland management, and particularly the provision of winter feed of a sufficiently high quality, is an important factor in our low output.</P>
    <P>In addition, we will be looking to the western region for increased output over the next couple of years.  With the many incentives that are now available through the western drainage system, the western package, lime and AI subsidies, the various disadvantaged areas aids and so on, the scope for increased output which exists in that region should be readily forthcoming.  £300 million is available over a ten-year period under the western development programme for various infrastructural improvements, commonage division, provision of agricultural training centres, on-farm improvements and forestry development.  In order to make full use of this money, every farmer should evolve a planned improvement programme in conjunction with his ACOT adviser.</P>

      <P>1982 has already brought a very welcome reversal to the downward trend, particularly in the dairy sector.  It will be remembered by many farmers as being the first year in which they could see a light at the end of the tunnel &mdash; in particular those who had not borrowed.  This is an important point, because the subject that we are discussing is, in my opinion, how best to help those who over-borrowed.  In my short time in the Department of Agriculture, I have been convinced that agriculture has a primary role in the economic recovery of the country.  It has always occupied a prominent position in our economy and will continue to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="497" /> Fundamentally the industry is sound and, indeed, considerable progress has been made in many facets since our entry to EEC.  However, that is not to say that there are not defects and problems to be tackled.  It is a fundamental part of our task to ensure that these problems are identified and tackled efficiently and quickly.  We will also ensure that the maximum possible proportion of available development resources is channelled into agriculture.  I think that by now everybody is convinced that there are limits on the availability of public resources.</P>
    <P>Agriculture cannot be granted immunity from the process of review and examination that is now going on with respect to all areas of spending, and inevitably demands for resources will exceed the supply of funds.  However, the end result may be beneficial in that the industry will become more cost-effective, more competitive internationally and better equipped to respond to new opportunities arising in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, like my colleague, Deputy Seán Byrne, I should like to congratulate Deputy Deasy on his elevation to the Ministry for Agriculture, and also Deputies Hegarty and Connaughton. The latter two, and I have reason for saying this, have been deeply involved in agriculture and actively engaged in farm organisations, with great success.  However, with regard to Deputy Deasy, I have reservations.  He is hardworking and will probably lend himself pretty well to the job, but in order to be a good Minister for Agriculture one needs at some stage or other to be involved in agriculture from the practical point of view.  However, I wish all three Ministers the very best.  Being involved in farming, they must not let the Labour Party impose their philosophy on them, which is, has been and probably always will be anti-farmer.  This was clearly evident from the actions of previous Coalition Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our economy, in my opinion &mdash; and, thankfully, still in the opinion of most &mdash; is dependent on the state of agriculture at any time.  It is no surprise that now <Col N="498" /> when the economy is in an extremely bad state, agriculture is at its lowest.</P>
    <P>The motion before us, apart from this £100 million which has been dealt with fairly adequately by the former Minister and by my other colleagues, also asks the Government to maintain farmers' incomes and promote higher agricultural production.  Now that the Minister is in Europe negotiating a price increase, he should look for a reasonable price increase which will encourage production, one such as suggested in our motion. We were told to expect a price increase of about 4 per cent.  I would like to know of any other sector of the community which would be satisfied with such a price increase.  Any groups I have heard tell of are looking for increases of 15 per cent and upwards, certainly in double figures. One can be sure that, whatever the sector, they will certainly get above 10 per cent.  Yet, our farmers are expected to be satisfied with a 4 per cent increase, and we are told that it may not even be as high as that.  We have for far too long suffered from small price increases and will not continue to accept that position. The Minister has the responsibility of doing all in his power to ensure that farmers do not receive 3 or 4 per cent price increase, but far higher.</P>
    <P>The timing of the price increase is of vital importance.  Last year, I admit, it was delayed for far too long.  Let us not have the same experience this year.  Many millions of pounds were lost to many sections of the farming community, particularly the milk sector.  I hope that that will not happen this year, and that the Minister will learn from last year's experience.</P>
    <P>My time is short but I ask the Minister, when he is negotiating the price increase, not to be intimidated by threats from any source, particularly from the British Minister for Agriculture.  We are told that the British housewife will not buy Irish agricultural goods if we adopt the attitude which is being promoted.  I ask the Minister to continue promoting that attitude.</P>
    <P>During the last period of Coalition Government one of the first things done was to reduce the grant levels to farmers. A grant is not a handout to farmers.  It <Col N="499" /> often means the difference between development taking place and no development. Therefore the Minister should not bow to party or sectional interests to get away from the grant system.  Farmers have always spent their money well and therefore anything given to them by way of encouragement should be continued.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, our economy is dependent on the state of agriculture.  If agriculture is in a reasonable state so is the economy.  I will give an instance of that from County Wexford. The firm Albatross has taken a fair rapping and 300 workers are affected. Graves, which were engaged in the provision of farm buildings, are on the point of closing because agriculture was not doing well and farmers have not been buying sheds and other farm buildings. The Minister should get his colleagues to accept all these things because if he does not agriculture will be in difficulties and so will the entire economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had a constructive debate, but frankly I am disappointed at the lack of response from the Government benches.  We have heard expressions and sentiments of goodwill for agriculture but there was no reference to the basic practical aspects of the proposals I introduced for Government approval and which I announced last November.  I refer to the scheme for making use of our Euro currency facilities to enable Irish farmers to replace their long-term cattle stocks over a four-year period.  The proposal was to make available to them money at 10 per cent or 11 per cent, making use of a 5 per cent differential between our bank rates and Euro finance.  At that time Deputy Dukes, the shadow Minister for Agriculture, did not see any value in that scheme and he adopted an attitude to faze me during the election campaign by saying this was easy, that Fianna Fáil were making a great balloon out of something which in his view did not represent any problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dukes was right, but he is now Minister for Finance and therefore running the Department of Agriculture and <Col N="500" /> telling that Department that in the interests of narrow financial considerations this is not possible.  All that is involved is a contingency risk in regard to exchange rates.  It is a matter that can be adopted in the budget where you could have some sort of nominal figure to cover a contingency exchange rate.  There would not be any difficulty in adopting it.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Agriculture I got my Government colleagues to agree to it and there would not be any difficulty for the Minister, Deputy Deasy, now, provided he does not allow Deputy Dukes as Minister for Finance to dictate otherwise.  It only needs a reasonable degree of commonsense.  I have with me the relevant documents of my proposals in the interests of Irish agriculture.  I will refer to the Department of Agriculture memo to the Government.  My officials and I on 10 November last submitted to the Government a memorandum whose reference is A.P. 1/82 setting out a four-year plan.  They were interim recommendations. In that memorandum I referred to a document of 26 October 1982 on the subject of interim recommendations of a working group on a four-year plan for agriculture.  We got approval from the Government but I will not go into details of what the Government agreed to.  Paragraph 2 on page 1 of the document stated that the total sum the Minister had in mind was £100 million over a four-year period and the document stated that the provision of Eurocurrency funds would involve an exchange risk for the Exchequer of the order of 13 per cent of the capital amount, based on past experience of EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>There was nothing unique or strange about it.  It was agreed to by the Government. On 17 November, the week after, I made a press announcement in regard to the interim recommendations of the working party who, I hope, are now proceeding to the final conclusions.</P>

In that statement I said also that in the meantime the Government proposed to proceed with the provision of Euro currency funds at approximately 5 per cent below existing commercial rates for the purchase and retention of additional stock and associated working capital.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Kerry Factory Closure.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of raising this matter on the Adjournment is to <Col N="505" /> ask the Minister for Industry and Energy the steps taken by his Department to prevent the closure of Kingdom Tubes in Tralee with a loss of 295 jobs.  The Kingdom Tubes industry closed down last Friday and caused consternation and gloom in Tralee town where 295 jobs were lost involving an income loss to 295 families. The Kingdom Tubes industry was set up in Tralee about 22 years ago and gave much-needed employment.  It was set up by a German firm and there is a sister factory in Germany manufacturing tubes.</P>
      <P>This is an appalling situation in a town where there is a very serious unemployment problem.  This is no time to let an industry close down.  What steps were taken by the Minister for Industry and Energy and his Department to get the Government agencies to rescue this industry which had many orders?  I believe those orders were transferred to the factory in Germany.  The Tánaiste represents the North Kerry constituency and Tralee town.  One would imagine that he would take steps to ensure that a vital factory would not close down in his own town where the unemployment problem is so serious.  There is wholesale unrest in the town over the closure.</P>
      <P>The men will not get redundancy payments and this is a very important factor to be taken into consideration.  The unemployment problem in County Kerry is very serious.  Kerry should be declared a disaster area by the IDA.  In the county we have 8,411 unemployed, that is, 19.5 per cent of the working people, an increase of 800 unemployed since December.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 3,295 people unemployed in Tralee, that is, about 25 per cent of the working population. Given those figures the Tánaiste and the Minister for Industry and Energy should do something to keep that factory open.  I am demanding that the Tánaiste should do something to keep that factory open for the workers of his own town. <Col N="506" /> He represents the Labour Party and it is his duty to introduce a rescue package to save this industry.  In the past, Fianna Fáil rescued many industries by using the Government agencies and by providing finance where necessary.</P>
      <P>There should be a rescue plan for the Kingdom Tubes industry.  The Tánaiste should initiate a rescue plan.  Fianna Fáil provided £500,000 by way of grant for this industry in Tralee.  The factory was closed down a week ago.  The IDA, the bank, the management and the workers got together to try to keep it open for another week.  The management and the IDA gave an assurance that, if it were kept open for another week, the workers would be paid.  The workers were paid on Monday last and when they presented their cheques they were not honoured. Their cheques are bouncing like rubber balls around Tralee this week.  One trader in Tralee who cashed some of the cheques was caught for £9,000.  It is the duty of the Government and the Tánaiste who represents this constituency to save that factory and ensure that those cheques are cashed.</P>

They put a lot of energy into County Cork and provided industry for that county in the past.  Now we need them to concentrate on Tralee.  I call on the Minister for Industry and Energy and the Tánaiste to save the Kingdom Tubes industry for Tralee.  The families of the 295 people who are unemployed will have very little income from now on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>This factory has been in operation for almost 22 years.  The redundant <Col N="507" /> workers spent most of their lifetime in that industry.  Many of them will never be re-employed because they have reached the 55 years age bracket.  As Deputy McEllistrim said, many of these cheques have been in circulation since the weekend.  I believe a figure of £20,000 is involved.  I appreciate the commitment given by the Tánaiste and I have no doubt that he will arrange to have them honoured. Tomorrow a further week's wages are due, plus redundancy payment.  I trust that the Minister will arrange to have them honoured.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this matter in the House.  I share fully the concern expressed by the Deputies regarding the closure of this long-established company, particularly having regard to the effect which this will have on the employment situation in Tralee and its surrounding areas.</P>
      <P>The final decision on the closure of a firm remains with the employer, the proprietor and the management of that company. Within this constraint the Industrial Development Authority, together with the other State agencies, endeavour to assist in so far as they can to maintain employment at the highest possible level.</P>
      <P>In the case of Kingdom Tubes since it became clear in December 1982 that some cuts in employment or, indeed, closure of the factory was contemplated, the IDA have endeavoured, in close consultation with the Irish management and the German promoting company, to see if such drastic steps could be averted or at least minimised.  Throughout this period the IDA have been in constant touch with the parent company and with the Bank of Ireland in an effort to prevent a closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At that stage it appeared that a restructured <Col N="508" /> operation with a reduced workforce could be achieved, and I am still hopeful that such an arrangement can be brought to a successful conclusion.  Negotiations towards this end are at a very delicate stage at present and I should not like to jeopardise those negotiations by making any precipitate comment.  However, I can assure the House that all the relevant State agencies are prepared to co-operate positively to the fullest extent possible with any feasible proposal which may be put forward.  Naturally I would prefer if the restructuring operation held out the prospect of the vast majority of the workers being re-employed, but I understand this would be difficult to achieve.</P>
    <P>With regard to the pay cheques issued to the workers which have not been honoured, I understand from the receiver that this problem has now been resolved and that cheques will be issued as soon as possible not only to cover the cheques which have not been honoured but also to meet the further week's wages still due to the workforce.  It is most unfortunate that this problem arose, but it is only proper that I should put on record my appreciation of the expeditious manner in which the receiver acted to ensure that there will not be serious hardship for the workers and their families.</P>
    <P>I am aware of the unemployment situation in Tralee and the surrounding areas.  This did not appear overnight.  As in other areas throughout the country it arose over a period.  This Government are as committed to keeping factories open with the assistance of the State agencies as any Government in the past. I should not like Deputy McEllistrim to be under any illusion about that.  The Tánaiste shares my concern and has been very involved in this matter at Government level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 338 and 339 together.  Private site subsidy is not payable directly to individuals, but under section 9 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, a subsidy is paid by my Department to housing authorities towards the annual loan charges incurred in respect of the provision by them of sites for private houses. The subsidy is one-third of the loan charges incurred on borrowings, up to a maximum for such borrowings of £1,500 per site.</P>
      <P>The payment of the subsidy is dependent on the fulfilment of certain conditions relating to the eligibility of the purchaser, floor area of house, density and sale price of site.  The value of any subsidy payable is generally passed on to the purchaser in the sale price of the site.</P>
      <P>Subsidy claims from Dublin County Council, including claims in respect of sites at Alpine Heights and Oakwood Grove in respect of the persons named, are at present being examined in my Department and payment will be made in due course if in order.</P>

      <P>I am not so aware.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the provisions of the Housing Acts, it is incumbent on local housing authorities to assess the housing needs of their functional areas, to prepare building programmes to meet these needs and to allocate houses in accordance with the statutory schemes of letting priorities.  In carrying out their programmes, authorities must have regard to the amount of the capital resources available and to the <Col N="206" /> need to make the most economic use of such resources.  In this regard, it has been the policy for a number of years to encourage the building of local authority dwellings in groups integrated with existing communities and to provide isolated dwellings in rural areas only in special cases of particular need.</P>
    <P>I understand from Galway County Council that, where it is necessary for them to provide isolated dwellings, they are generally provided on suitable sites supplied by the applicants themselves at low cost.  However, where suitable sites are not available, efforts are made to obtain alternative sites from other sources (such as from the Land Commission etc.) or the applicant is offered alternative housing in local towns or villages.</P>

      <P>If the fire proof partition proposed by the applicant gives the required fire rating, it would be accepted.  My Department's inspector will be in touch with the applicant about this matter.</P>

The vessel is of a completely new design and will be fitted with a heli-deck and hangar for the operation of helicopters as a regular feature.  The vessel is due for delivery in April, 1984.</P>
      <P>Improved performance and enhanced surveillance capability will ensue for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(i)  better sea keeping qualities because of increased length, greater displacement and retractable fins for <Col N="223" /> roll damping in adverse conditions, providing improved conditions for helicopter operations from the ship's flight deck;</P>
    <P>(ii)  greater cruising range and faster speed due to good length and power/weight ratio;</P>
    <P>(iii)  better detection range due to higher radar efficiency and</P>

      <P>In February 1980, the Union of Professional and Technical Civil Servants requested that the position of Local Government Auditor be designated as a professional position to which the provisions of section 6 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, should apply. This would have enabled notional years of service to be added to the pensionable service of the staff.</P>
      <P>In order for these provisions to apply, it would first have been necessary to change the entry requirements so that future appointees to the grade would be required to have a certain minimum number of years of pre-recruitment professional experience.  The union was informed in July 1980 that the proposal was likely to hinder, rather than help, recruitment and was not, therefore, acceptable.</P>

As indicated in a statement issued by my predecessor on 5 November 1982, before any licences could be issued it would be necessary for applicants to produce satisfactory evidence that copy-right agreements had been obtained from the broadcasting authorities concerned.

Children's allowance in respect of the claimant's <Col N="300" /> youngest child born 29 June 1982 was awarded with effect from 1 July 1982.

The amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced to him had to be recouped to the health board out of the unemployment assistance to which he became entitled.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefit) Regulations, however, preclude concurrent payment of invalidity pension with widow's pension and disability benefit. Therefore, if she transfers to invalidity pension, which is payable at the rate of £35.50 per week, both disability benefit and widow's pension, totalling £51.08, would cease to be payable, resulting in a cash reduction of £15.58 in her weekly income.  However, if she did transfer she would be automatically entitled to a free travel pass.

      <P>In the reply, given on 4 November 1982, to an earlier Question by the Deputy on this case, it was explained that an appeals officer has <Col N="322" /> decided that the person concerned is not entitled to old age pension.  The assessment of his means, consisting of half his wife's earnings and the weekly value of holdings, the transfer of part of which has not been accepted for pension purposes, exceeds the statutory limit of £38.  The appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive in the absence of new facts or fresh evidence.</P>

      <P>She appealed against the decision and the case has been referred to an appeals officer.

      <P>On 16 December 1982 the local pension committee awarded old age pension to the person concerned at the reduced weekly rate of £12.45 plus an increase of £6.30 in respect of his wife. The assessment of his means, consisting of half the weekly value of a holding, entitles him to payment at this rate. Representations received from the Deputy were accepted as an appeal against the committee's decision.  However, an appeals officer, to whom the claim was referred for consideration, has upheld the decision.</P>
      <P>Information supplied by the Deputy suggests that what is at issue is the fact that the pensioner's sons, who are grown up, are unemployed and, because of this, are dependent on him.

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit at the reduced rate of £65.70 from 5 June 1982, based on his insurance record of 33 contributions paid during 1980-81, the contribution year governing his claim.</P>
      <P>Following a review of his claim, however, it has been established that he is also entitled to be credited with a further 19 contributions in respect of proved unemployment, thus giving him a total of 52 for the 1980-81 contribution year and qualifying him for payment at the maximum weekly rate of £68.05 appropriate to a married man with two qualified child dependants.</P>

    <P>The Land Commission have no plans for the division of these bogs in the near future.</P>
    <P>The cost of developing the Lurgan and Arderroo bogs for division would now be prohibitive.  However, it is proposed to lease some 50 hectares of Lurgan bog to the owners of an adjoining bog for commercial development involving the sale of machine-cut spread turf for harvesting by individual purchasers.  Considerable development work has already been carried out on Loughaunbeg bog and the question of its future use is at present being examined.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I propose to take Questions Nos. 955 and 956 together.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, early release is discretionary and is granted or not on the basis of my appraisal of the different facts of each individual case.  A few parliamentary questions have been put down on individual cases in the past and information on them has been given in reply.  Those cases, however, might be regarded as being of more than usual public interest.  I do not think that, as a general rule, it is appropriate to use the parliamentary question procedure as a method of obtaining information on the use of the discretionary power in question.</P>
      <P>I can say that one of the two offenders in question is now unlawfully at large and is being sought by the Garda.  The Deputy was given a reply by letter to an inquiry he made in November in the other case and a further letter will be sent to him shortly.</P>

The best indication I can give is that, in the District Court, the number of barring orders made during the judicial year which ended on 31 July 1981 was 1,188.  It would not be possible, except by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of staff time, to determine the number of orders made in the High Court during that period, the number of orders currently in operation or the break-down as between <Col N="382" /> husbands and wives.

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): There has been a long-recognised need in Galway city for a training centre for young people in the 16 to 21 years age group who are on probation for minor offences.  A voluntary management committee was formed locally with a view to running such a centre in association with my Department's Probation and Welfare Service. Early in 1982 the Department purchased the premises at 15 Lower Merchants Road, Galway, which will be leased to the local committee for a nominal rent. The committee have plans prepared for the adaptation and renovation of the premises.  This work is to be carried out partly by a local contractor and partly through AnCO's Community Youth Training Programme.</P>
      <P>I am aware that Galway Corporation at their meeting in October last passed a resolution indicating concern at the siting of the proposed workshop in Lower Merchants Road and calling for its location elsewhere.  Subsequently a suggestion was made that some of the councillors might wish to visit and examine the operation of the probation workshop in Ballinasloe, which is similar to the proposed centre in Galway and which has been operating successfully since 1978 without adverse reaction from local residents. This suggestion has been taken up by the corporation and arrangements have been made for three councillors and some representatives of the residents to visit the Ballinasloe centre in early February.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>As regards the provision of a new Garda station in Ballybrack, the position is that the existing Garda station at Shankill has to be replaced as the accommodation there is no longer adequate and its location is not considered to be sufficiently central to the general Shankill/Ballybrack area.  Accordingly, it has been decided to proceed with the acquisition of a site for a new station at Shankill Cross to serve both the Shankill and Ballybrack areas.  The Office of Public Works are at present negotiating the purchase of the site, which forms part of the Dorneycourt development.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 964 to 969, inclusive, together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a general account of the arrangements <Col N="386" /> made to deal with possible out-breaks of fire in the prisons and places of detention and of the consultations that take place in that regard, I refer the Deputy to the answer given on 25 February 1981 to a Parliamentary Question in the matter (Dáil Debates, Vol. 327, Column 262 to 264).</P>
    <P>The Chief Trades Officer in each establishment is responsible for demonstrating to all members of the staff the functions of the varied fire fighting equipment located at the establishment.  Practical demonstrations of the use of the equipment take place at frequent intervals. Courses have been organised in co-operation with the Army and commercial companies for chief trades officers and other selected officers.  The emphasis is on the procedures for the rescuing of any member of staff or prisoner whose life may be endangered.  In recent years about 40 officers have attended such courses.</P>
    <P>Details regarding the number of prisoners who died or suffered injuries when fires occurred, between August 1972 and August 1982 are set out below.</P>
