    <Title>Dáil Reform: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion.</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann resolves that its procedures should be reformed to improve efficiency and its control over the public finances.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Industry and Energy).</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying yesterday, <Col N="511" /> this is a very timely Bill.  I also said that Dáil Deputies and spokespersons, not junior Ministers as reported, play a very small role in initiating legislation. We should ask ourselves, while examining Dáil reform, what is the role of the Deputy apart from representations, bullying civil servants or carrying out what some sections of the press described as the messenger boy element of our duties.  Our duty is to be part watchdogs, legislators and initiators.  At present our role as watchdog, legislator or initiator is very small and is confined to that of public representative making representations at various levels to the civil service, within the party organisation or to local authorities.</P>
      <P>This attempt at coming to terms with Dáil reform is very welcome because of the opportunity I hope it will give under the headings of watchdog, legislator and initiator.  One of the things I have found which stifles that role most is the Whip system.  Obviously, with the sort of procedures we have in our parliament, it is very necessary to have a Whip system. The public are entitled to know that a Government will last and will operate in a disciplined way but I found, to my dismay, that the Whip system is operated to quite a ridiculous extent.  It is very difficult on some occasions for speakers to contribute on anything of an interesting or important nature while on other occasions when there are very uninteresting matters going through the House the Whips are looking for speakers.  If a Deputy wishes to raise something that is relevant to his constituency he may be seen as a dissident or out of line.  I should like to see a tradition established whereby Deputies would not have to kowtow to the Whips and where it would be understood it is not disloyal to the party if a Deputy is doing his duty.  I do not think the whip should be applied quite to the extent it is applied and in considering Dáil reform this point should be examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nowadays people are prepared to accept that there can be disagreement and that there need not be total unanimity. Where the public interest is to be <Col N="512" /> served in a constituency and where it does not take from the interests of the party, a Deputy should not be as confined in putting his view as has been the case up to now.  In that regard Deputies, whether Government or Opposition, should be given a greater role to play in the business of the House.</P>
    <P>I regret that so much of the procedures of the House are organised on a Government-Opposition basis.  Yesterday and today in this debate there has been a valuable opportunity for Deputies to speak their minds without having to defer to the Whips.  It is an open debate, an attempt to hear all points of view. There are many occasions when this kind of debate should be allowed rather than the situation where Government Deputies must support a certain move and Opposition Deputies must oppose it simply for the sake of opposing it.  I do not believe that should be the procedure in every case.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus in the House that something needs to be done about crime and even an agreement on precisely what needs to be done.  That subject does not need to be approached on a Government-Opposition basis.  Many such areas should be approached on a more representative basis from all sections of the House.  If the House is to sit on Fridays perhaps that day could be used to encourage areas of debate and examination that would be representative of views throughout the House and which would not be organised on a Government-Opposition basis.</P>
    <P>I was glad to see in the Minister's speech a reference to the system in New Zealand whereby Deputies have an opportunity to get in several times on various Stages of a Bill even though their contributions must be made within a certain length of time.  That is a worthwhile idea and would encourage more participation and fuller attendance during debates.  The suggestion that more leniency be shown with regard to Private Notice Questions is a good one.  Often in the past where urgent matters have arisen affecting a Deputy's constituency he has been confined to raising the matter on the Adjournment and has not been able <Col N="513" /> to avail of a Private Notice Question.  I should like to see that situation changed.</P>
    <P>One of the problems is that it is very difficult to initiate a Private Members' Bill and even if this is possible it is usually succeeded by a Government Bill almost exactly the same.  For instance, in the previous Dáil the Bill dealing with community offenders was brought in by the Opposition but the following day the Government printed an identical Bill at considerable cost to the State.  If Members of the House come forward with worthwhile suggestions, particularly in non-controversial areas, Private Members' Bills should be proceeded with.  We should not insist that every element of legislation be initiated by the Government.</P>
    <P>One of my regrets is that the role of Deputies has been eroded by commissions and State bodies.  Some relatively junior civil servants have taken control of many matters which the Legislature should monitor more closely.  Whenever there is talk about any area of controversy &mdash; the latest being the Garda authority &mdash; there is a suggestion that we set up a commission.  If we continue to set up these bodies there will be very little left for Deputies to do.  We must say that we are the people who stood for election and who were given that responsibility. We should not continue to hand over to commissions and other bodies responsibilities that rightfully rest with this House and committees of the House.  Where we have handed over responsibility the commissions and State bodies should be held more accountable to the House and its committees.  It is vital that Deputies be given proper facilities, not for the sake of grandeur or prestige but simply to give them the tools to do their job.  I believe the whole system has been deliberately retarded.  Deputies are afraid to say they need the facilities to do their job because they may be castigated in the press as looking for extra grand facilities for their personal use.  That is not the case.  Deputies need the facilities to carry out their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The monitoring of expenditure after it has been spent is an important role and in this the Committee of Public Accounts <Col N="514" /> play a major part.  However, the suggestion that the Estimates be brought before the House and that the House should examine expenditure beforehand is an excellent one.  This has been referred to by other Deputies and I will not dwell on it at length.  The consensus seems to be that we should set up a committee system and I wonder if we could allow some kind of parliamentary questions procedure at the committees, particularly the ongoing committees.  For instance, in the case of a committee dealing with crime, would it be possible for a Deputy to raise questions, even for written answer, rather than having to come back to the House to seek information he may need for his work on the committees?  If the House is not sitting and the committees continue to sit, it would be a good opportunity for Deputies to get the necessary information quickly.  The replies might be given in written form as Ministers may not be required to attend the committees.</P>
    <P>Yesterday I spoke about the need for induction courses for Deputies coming into the House to acquaint them with the procedures and to help them to become effective legislators.  The House might give some consideration to the whole question of whether the privilege of Parliament is not sometimes abused not just by Members but also by others.  For instance, this may be done occasionally by members of the press.  If we are serious about the reform of Parliament we should ensure that there are certain minimum standards to which everyone must adhere.  Much of what is written in the press about Leinster House is not only inaccurate but is totally manufactured.  I accept criticism that is fair and balanced but some of the press reports are scandalously manufactured.  We should ask ourselves if there should be something such as breach of privilege applying not only to Members but also to those who are privileged to report the proceedings of our national Parliament.  I do not want to be misunderstood.  I welcome any form of constructive criticism and even would err on the side of not getting it right, but some of the reports one reads are so inaccurate that they could not have been <Col N="515" /> written by anybody attending at this House.</P>
    <P>The last point I want to make is about the voting procedure.  One of the difficulties we have in this House is that we did not inherit the tradition.  We have built it up since the 1920s in about 60 years.  One tradition we have is that of voting with our feet.  I would like to see that procedure continued.  It is good to have tradition, and voting with our feet does not cause any undue delay or any difficulties in the voting procedure or in public understanding.  The good traditions that we have should be continued. We can build on tradition, and that is a good thing.  An electronic voting system or some similar system would not necessarily enhance or reform the proceedings of the House.  Our present voting system is a good one.</P>
    <P>I would welcome the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings.  It was done on one occasion in this House in recent times and it gained great public interest. It would enhance the level of debate in the House.  I would welcome also the occasional televising of the proceedings.</P>
    <P>All in all, I thank the Minister for introducing this motion and I thank the Opposition for the constructive way in which they have approached the debate. I hope that it will be the start of great Dáil reform.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I am very pleased that it is on such a topic as Dáil reform that I have the opportunity to make my first speech in this assembly. Like many of the speakers from all sides of the House, most of whom I listened to yesterday, I am of the opinion that the present Minister has done a service not alone to the House but to the nation at large in bringing this very important topic to the floor of the House.  In my span of public service at local authority level, at Seanad level and now at Dáil level, I am struck by one factor: the public perception of people in public life is not good. However much we have contributed to that perception, however much of it has grown among the people themselves and however much the administration and <Col N="516" /> day-to-day running of both the Seanad and Dáil institutions have contributed to it, they have all made their input, but we must play our part in rectifying this situation.</P>
      <P>In my other life when I was a secondary school teacher I had occasion from time to time to bring groups of young people to this Chamber.  When we would be travelling back home by bus or train I was always struck by one factor.  These young people never saw the Dáil as having any relevance to their lives.  These would be girls of the age group 16, 17, 18, approaching voting age and the time when they would become citizens of their country in their full right.  These pupils would leave school with A and B levels and the trappings that are taken as making a successful person nowadays &mdash; I would have my own remarks about that in another context &mdash; yet they would have no idea of how the Dáil system worked. Their visit here would not have given them any confidence in that system.  They would go home without any further enlightenment.  They saw the Dáil as a place where people came in and talked to an empty Chamber about unintelligible things which had no relevance to everyday life.</P>
      <P>I see this debate as the start of making this Dáil assembly with all its great importance in our history and its pivotal importance in our lives &mdash; and it must remain of pivotal importance &mdash; highly relevant to us.  We can no longer afford the luxury of the present-day system in the Dáil.  If we continue as we are we have only ourselves to blame if we become like the characters in Alice in Wonderland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Much of the discussion document which the Minister presented to us yesterday is practical and, given the broad acceptance which this debate has achieved already, many of the points can be implemented without undue delay.  I refer first of all to the points which seem to have been accepted among the speakers who spoke yesterday and today.  The broadcasting of the debates in the Chamber would achieve much more care by speakers in their contributions in the Dáil.  It would lead to much more thought being put into those contributions <Col N="517" /> because one will know that at any given time one can be heard over the air-waves. It would lead to a tightness in contributions. This leads me to the second point which the Minister touched upon in an underlying way.  I refer to the length of the contributions.  I do not want to appear presumptuous on my first speech, but as a result of my Seanad experience I feel that too often people get to their feet to talk on and on, perhaps experiencing vicarious satisfaction, and of course their is always local consumption of what is presented in the media, but to continue to talk for the sake of doing so is ridiculous. I do not know whether the Minister envisages a cut-off point for contributions in debates, but I think it would be highly desirable.  Apart from doing away with irrelevancies it would allow many more people to contribute.  Often I have sat in the Seanad, and probably it will be the same in the Dáil, hoping and hoping to get in while the debate went on and on. Therefore, a cut-off point would be highly important.</P>
    <P>The committee system is the salient factor of this discussion document.  I have read and re-read what the Minister has said about it, and I have read also about the experiences of the parliamentary system pertaining in Westminster.  Generally speaking the committee system appears to be a more effective way of running the nation's day-to-day business than the sometimes long-winded debates in the Dáil.  I would like to enter a <i>caveat</i> on this point.  There has been much talk of consensus politics and having the committee system whereby important issues of the day, particularly social structures and planning and also financial planning, would be discussed by Members of the House on all sides.  This is highly important. I do not want to carp but I want to make the point that in a democracy healthy tensions are very important.  Naturally there must always be a Government but also there must be an alternative Government with a coherent, planned Opposition policy.  I would like to see a balance kept always and that the committee system would not be seen as everything being agreed upon.  Listening to the speakers yesterday would give the <Col N="518" /> impression that life would be very happy and everybody would live very happily when the committee system would have had its say and we would all come in with set formulae to answer the problems of the day.  Of course, life is not really like that, and perhaps that is just as well.  It is important that the healthy tensions between Opposition and Government be always maintained, not in a destructive sense.  With other speakers I abhor utterly constant adversary politics whereby because Minister Bruton would say something, Deputy Mary O'Rourke would say &ldquo;No, I do not agree with that&rdquo;. That is silly and to the young people it is outmoded and outdated.  The normal, differing ideologies and intentions of the political parties and their different sets of policies should be allowed expression and the debate should take place following on the committee system.  This is very important for democracy and we should keep it very firmly in our minds.</P>
    <P>The second point, an underlying philosophical one, arising out of the discussion document presented by the Minister is that if we discuss Dáil reform we are in effect discussing Deputy reform, we are talking about ourselves.  There has been much comment recently on radio and television that Dáil Deputies should be legislators, that they are getting their roles mixed and that we are being seen primarily as people who just go out to get things for people who would normally get them, that we should be legislating and thinking of it.  Both points of view are right.  That is what I intend to do in, I hope, my long Dáil career but I also believe that if we immune ourselves in the Dáil Chamber and we sit on committees and find ourselves talking to one another for ever, there is a slightly unreal atmosphere in that.  When we find ourselves in this Chamber, in the corridors around this House and in committee rooms we can grow in on one another and think that this is life, that life is Dublin, Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  Life is part of this but it is also down the country among your people hearing their points of view.</P>
    <P>How can I effectively contribute to a committee on education, in which I am <Col N="519" /> interested, or on the environment and housing, which is my greatest interest, unless I have been listening to people, hearing what has gone wrong with their entitlements and what they want to see in house grants, loans, building, construction and roads.  Each Deputy must get the feedback from people before he or she can come into this Chamber or go into a committee system and give their views.  It is only by intermingling with people that one can do this.  I would like this point to be on record.  The Minister has not said anything about this but it arises out of his discussion document, which is the underlying philosophy of the role of a TD as perceived by the people, the media, but, most of all, as perceived by ourselves.  If we ignore the highly relevant everyday life of people for what is, too, highly relevant, the committee system and the Dáil system, and we do not merge the two things, we will have lost an essential element of what must go into it.  We must be practical in our legislation and we must not be in a cloud up in the sky.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make is in relation to the very valid point brought up yesterday about holidays.  I do not know which Deputy brought it up but the point was made that perhaps holidays could be broken up into sections.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It was Deputy Seamus Brennan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not remember which Deputy it was.  He said he would like to see the Dáil holidays broken up into sections so that we would not appear to be away from our jobs for a long time, which is wrong if we are to govern the country and to be seen to govern it.  The Minister spoke about the Estimates and about how it is ridiculous that we talk about the money when it has already been allocated.  That is like a housewife going out to do her shopping when the money is gone and she cannot say what she can put into the supermarket trolley on that particular Friday.  The same is true about the Estimates.  He brought up <Col N="520" /> the point about the New Zealand example where members of the House of Parliament can interject not in an argumentative sense, but having five minutes on a discussion point, which can be taken up by another member and by the Minister and brought back when the point is clarified so that the member who originally made the point could then stand up and contribute to it again.  This is an ongoing debate where the member can put his or her input into that debate.  This is very good because very often when one stands up and contributes to a debate a very relevant point comes up later in the debate and one cannot get in again and answer that because one has already spoken. The rules of the debate state that you can only speak once and you cannot speak again in many of the debates which take place here.</P>
      <P>I am in agreement with more time for Private Members' Questions where matters of very important interest can be dealt with on a more relevant day-to-day basis.  The Member would then have the satisfaction of having what was to him or her a very important matter being discussed at that point.  With regard to future legislation and the committee system, I believe the Minister means that we would have at our disposal experts in various fields who would come to the committees and give us their points of view.  That is important because very few of us are experts in any particular field. It is important to call on the expertise of people who have spent many years in management, health services, the environment and many other fields.  That can be very good for legislators.  Existing legislation very often needs a revamping. The Minister should look into this matter to see if it is possible along with his hoped-for committee system for future legislation to have a rethink on past legislation whereby it could be amended and brought again to the floor of the House to keep pace with what has occurred in the meantime.  We are a very fast moving society and we appear to be two steps behind everyday life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must now take my own words to heart and not go on and on.  The salient points of my speech are that the healthy tensions <Col N="521" /> must remain between the Government and the Opposition.  I welcome the committee system and the broadcasting of the debates.  I am very glad as a new Member to have made my first speech on what I will be glad to say to my electorate, half of whom are young people, which is the case in all constituencies: &ldquo;Yes, I am your TD, I came to the Dáil as your messenger to relay what you have said to me&rdquo;.  The most important message I got from my constituency of Longford-Westmeath: &ldquo;Make your job more relevant, tune it, sharpen it, bring it to the point, make it more in touch with everyday life&rdquo;.  I welcome the Minister's report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a few points which strike me about this debate.  One point is the number of recently elected Deputies who are contributing to the debate compared with the number of longstanding or older Deputies.  This is perhaps an indication of the type of frustration new Deputies feel when they come up against the longstanding procedures and precedents.  Another point which has come out of the debate is the need to make what is going on in the House relevant to what is going on outside the House.  While this is an important debate, the question of Dáil reform is not on the lips of everyone in the streets at the moment, it is the question of whether the Government were right in demanding the retirement of two senior police officers, whether they were right in divulging the names of two journalists whose phones were bugged and so forth.  The debate is important but is not relevant to what is going on outside the House and is not what people are concerned about at the present time.  While the issue may be important this is not the most opportune time to be discussing it.  It is not what people are concerned about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past couple of days both Deputy Mac Giolla and I have been attempting to raise certain issues but have been precluded from doing so by reason of Standing Orders and precedent. Because the Government as well as the major Opposition party are not anxious to discuss the issue in question, we are unable to have it discussed here.  In order <Col N="522" /> to prevent this sort of situation in the future we should ensure that included in whatever reform is decided on, there will be provision for a party such as ours, for Independents as well as for individual members of parties to raise issues of importance and have them discussed here in a reasonable and mature way.  It should not be necessary for Deputies to be in breach of Standing Orders or to cause problems for the Chair in their attempts to raise certain issues.  The matter of phone tapping is important but it cannot be dealt with adequately by way of private notice question or even by way of an adjournment debate.  It is an issue that requires an open debate in which any Deputy who so wished could express his opinion and then the Government could state what steps they intended taking in order to protect the privacy of the citizen and, of course, of Deputies.</P>
    <P>During Private Members' Business last evening we had a debate on the very important question of agriculture. Deputy Mac Giolla was anxious to contribute to that debate but was denied the opportunity of doing so because of the time factor.  There were speakers from the Government side and from Fianna Fáil but none from The Workers' Party. Private members' time is regarded as the preserve of the major party in Opposition. In the last Dáil it was the preserve of Fine Gael and Labour.  Neither Independents nor Workers' Party Deputies were allowed initiate motions for Private Members' Time.  All Deputies who were returned here by the people to represent the people must be given the opportunity of speaking on any issue that is being debated in the House.  It is not good enough that the Whips of the three main parties decide among themselves who is to speak and exclude other elected representatives.</P>
    <P>One of the major points that has been made during the debate so far relates to making the House more relevant.  The Dáil should be leading the people but unfortunately in recent years we have had a situation in which the courts have been more progressive than the Oireachtas and have forced this House to take legislative measures to deal with developments <Col N="523" /> which were necessary, which were required by the Constitution.  It appeared that the political parties were reluctant to tackle issues that might be regarded as sensitive.  Again, I refer to yesterday's proceedings when The Workers' Party attempted to raise the question of divorce, a question that has been a matter of discussion for at least 20 years but which is to be referred again to an all-party committee for further discussion. At the same time there is being introduced a Bill relating to abortion, an issue that has never been discussed by an all-party committee.  This House must lead public opinion.  It is fine to say that there may be a general consensus on a certain issue but in the long-term political, economic or social interest of the people, it is our opinion that a different approach should be adopted.  Deputies should not be reluctant or afraid to stand up and express their opinions on so-called sensitive issues.</P>
    <P>The whole question of Dáil reform is much wider than simply deciding that contributions be reduced from, say, one hour to half-an-hour or 45 minutes. There is a need to ensure that everybody elected to serve here has the opportunity to initiate discussion, to ensure that where the Government are reluctant to discuss a particular issue of importance, there are procedures which will enable individual Deputies to ensure that a debate on the issue takes place.</P>
    <P>It has been said that many young people visiting the Dáil do not consider the proceedings to be relevant to their experience outside.  That is to be expected when one considers that for generations we have had what I would call personality politics, when there has been the tendency always to side-step major economic questions, to push them into the background.  During the election time the media concentrate almost exclusively on the personal attributes of individuals.  While questions of integrity and honesty are very important in regard to personalities, it is not right that they be concentrated on almost totally to the exclusion of discussion on political and economic issues.  Generally, people come <Col N="524" /> to visit the Dáil at times when they think there may be something of interest being debated.  Usually that is at Question Time.  However, visitors find that the matters discussed are not of general interest to the public.  Yesterday, for instance, we spent a good part of Question Time discussing county roads.  While such matters are important, they are not the sort of questions that the citizen expects Deputies to spend their time discussing. Local authorities are elected every five years and they are capable of dealing with such matters as the development and resurfacing of county roads.  Visitors to the House would expect to hear discussion on such matters as job creation, the development of agriculture, the problem of dealing with marital breakdown and the question of eliminating the stigma of illegitimacy.  Until such time as Deputies move away from the idea that they are simply some kind of exalted county councillors and get down to discussing and thinking about important national issues, all the Dáil reforms in the world will not change and give heed to people's views and attitudes to Dáil Deputies.</P>
    <P>At present if a Deputy wishes to introduce a Private Members' Bill, as I understand it, he must have it supported by seven other Members of the Dáil or he may raise it in Private Members' time at which point he gets five minutes to express his views on why it should be proceeded with.  If the Government oppose it, that is the end of it.  In other words, no individual Deputy can bring a Bill into the House and have it processed through the various Stages to a point where it is either accepted, amended or defeated.  There is no opportunity for an individual Deputy who feels strongly about a particular matter to bring in legislation here and have it processed.  The idea of having an arbitrary figure of seven Deputies to sign a Bill in order to have it debated or that a Deputy must have ten Deputies to stand in their places in order to get past the Second Stage is in my view an outrageous and completely arbitrary way of approaching the work of a Deputy and deciding on the merits or otherwise of what a Deputy wants to have discussed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="525" /> I dealt earlier with personality politics. The great social changes that are taking place in this country at present arise, I believe, directly from the urbanisation of Irish society.  The fact that the population is moving very quickly into urban areas and has such a high proportion of young people means that personality politics will no longer be relevant or acceptable and any party or Deputy persisting in promoting personalities at the expense of clearly expressing the political and ideological position of himself or his party on the various economic and political questions we face will end up in disarray.  We are seeing an example of this in the problems which the Fianna Fáil Party are experiencing at present when the differences existing between the two major conservative parties are practically nil in real terms.  You now have a major party that does not know where it is going, what it is going to do or who it wants to lead it because it cannot find a place for itself in Irish politics.  That is because the ideology which it expresses is very effectively and efficiently being expressed by the Fine Gael Party and unfortunately, by the Labour Party in Coalition with them.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to prolong my contribution and I conclude by saying that the relevance of this Dáil will only improve when Deputies elected to it find a way of discussing the issues which are important to the people outside &mdash; jobs, houses, security and so on.  Only then will people begin to have respect for this House and the Deputies in it.</P>

      <P>Like other Deputies on all sides I welcome the fact that we have <Col N="526" /> an opportunity to discuss this issue and in particular I welcome the motion to the effect that Dáil Éireann resolves that its procedure should be reformed to improve efficiency and its control over public finances.  To my mind the motion is somewhat narrow and I do not believe that was intended by the Minister in proposing it.  I believe it is the Minister's intention to deal with the inadequacies of the Dáil and its procedures in a general way and the general lack of control by the Dáil not merely over matters of public finance but over all aspects of Government in general.  That is the issue in a nutshell.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recent difficulites in the public finances have highlighted the impotence of the Dáil in tackling this area, its inability to deal in a realistic way with departmental Estimates, to come to terms with the financial problems of the State and to exercise any real control over annual plans produced through Ministers for Finance, through the Department of Finance in the context of general economic development and recovery.  All too often in the economic area the Dáil has seen to be asked to approve matters that in many instances have already been implemented.  It is often asked to approve expenditure of money already spent and in other instances it is asked to rubber stamp decisions already made and in respect of which there is no possibility of making a change.  This applies not merely in the area of public finances but right across the board in the context of powers exercised by Government.  My remarks are meant to refer not merely to this or the preceeding Government or to the brief term of seven months of the last Coalition Government, which was my first experience of this House, but in a general way to the control of this House to which the Government are supposed to be responsible.  The fact is that this House has very little real control of the Government.  I believe the Government take very lightly in many instances that responsibility.  The system of checks and balances implicit in the Constitution and which is an essential integral part of any parliamentary democracy have now ceased to operate in the context of the <Col N="527" /> relationship between this House and a Cabinet Government.</P>
    <P>I think it is acknowledged by Deputies on all sides that the procedures in this House are archaic and ineffective.  In real terms there is no possibility of any systematic inquiry in a general way into Government behaviour or action and no real control over Government action. There is a lack of adequate backup services to assist Deputies in the proper examination of legislation.  Bills introduced in the House are effectively within the domain of the Government and jealously guarded by Government Ministers to the extent that even if Government backbenchers or Opposition Deputies propose amendments to Bills, Ministers often regard such proposals as an attack on their political virginity.  The Minister who accepts an amendment from a back-bench Deputy usually regards it &mdash; and very often appears to regard it &mdash; as a suggestion of ministerial incompetence rather than, as he should, as a valid contribution by a Deputy to the legislative process.</P>
    <P>In my brief experience in this House as a backbencher on both the Government and Opposition sides it has been clear that the vast majority of Ministers in both the preceding Governments have been loth in any circumstances to accept amendments to Bills.  There are a variety of reasons for this but it is clear that Governments are not willing to regard Deputies as legislators, no matter how much Deputies wish to be so regarded, and are not willing to accept that amendments proposed by backbenchers on the Government side or from within the ranks of the Opposition are very often proposed by Deputies having an expertise or an interest in a particular area. The usual presumption of Ministers when amendments are proposed is that somewhere lurking in those amendments there lies some form of political malice or a political trap into which the Minister may fall.  Whereas on occasion it is correct to say that this is the case, much of the legislation I have seen pass through this House would have gone through no matter which party were in Government. <Col N="528" /> Much of that legislation is produced by civil servants and is politically non-contentious but many aspects of this legislation have been legally defective.  Often Bills are legally defective simply because Ministers are not willing to consider amendments.</P>
    <P>There are few Deputies who seek to act in a legislative capacity and they are often criticised by people outside this House for their failure so to act.  I believe that criticism attaches more to Government than to Deputies.  Any Deputy who has had experience in this House over a period of time will rapidly learn the futility of seeking to promote amendments on the various stages of Bills.  Something may be achieved by way of publicity exercise but as a legislative exercise it is futile in the vast majority of cases.  Often one sees the nonsensical spectacle of a Minister who has resolutely opposed the acceptance of an amendment in this House suddenly realising what a good amendment it is and proposing that same amendment in his own name in the Seanad.  He could just as easily have accepted the amendment in this House but Ministerial purity might have been in danger if he were seen to accept advice from a backbencher or an Opposition Deputy.  There is a need for Ministers to get away from that type of approach to business.  They must move away from the straitjacket view of their function and their view of their self-importance.</P>
    <P>If Members are to participate properly in the legislative process it requires not only a change of approach and of perception on the part of Ministers but also requires the provision of expert back-up facilities to Deputies.  Few people outside this House are aware of the absence of necessary facilities and of the fact that no research assistance of any nature other than from the librarians in the Library is available unless Deputies are willing to employ people themselves.  Until last February there was a pooling system whereby three or four Deputies had one secretary availably for their entire work, either of a constituency or a legislative nature.  Deputies have been hog-tied by the physical environment here and they will continue to remain so until such time <Col N="529" /> as adequate and proper facilities and research assistance are made available.</P>
    <P>Successive Governments have acknowledged the inability of this House to tackle major issues of political and social importance and this awareness has resulted in an erosion of the importance of this House and an erosion of the function of Members.  There are a large number of examples.  It is acknowledged on all sides, although different members of different parties would have different approaches and different ideological stances, that reform of our taxation system is long overdue.  What do we do about this?  Do we set up a committee to consider it?  Do we debate the matter in detail?  We do neither of these things.  We set up a Commission on Taxation, a body outside this House, to examine the whole area of tax and report back.  What do we do when we want to look at industrial policy and industrial relations?  Is there an expert committee of this House to examine that issue, make recommendations and consider what action should be taken?  Of course there is not.  We commission the Telesis Report and that report, produced by a body outside this House, is apparently to dictate our industrial policy.  We want to examine the area of children's services and child care.  It has been known for two decades that there are major deficiencies throughout this area.  How are these problems dealt with?  Are they debated in detail?  Is a committee of Deputies appointed to recommend legislation?  No, there is not. We set up the Committee on Child Care Services to report to this House.  We recognise that there is a need for civil legal aid to be made available to people who cannot afford lawyers' fees.  Is that issue considered by this House?  No.  We set up the Pringle Committee to examine the area and make recommendations.</P>
    <P>By setting up such committees successive Governments have recognised the inability of this House and the failure of its procedures to enable Deputies to tackle the major issues of the day.  That responsibility has been abdicated and passed to outside commissions who produce very often comprehensive and expert reports which subsequently languish <Col N="530" /> on the shelves of Ministerial offices and are never discussed here.  Two of the reports to which I have referred, the report on child care and children's services and the report of the Pringle Committee, have never been debated in this House, although one report was produced as long ago as 1976 and the other was first made available to the Minister for Health in September 1981.  Neither the report of the Commission on Taxation nor the Telesis Report has been discussed and there are many other such reports.  Not only is there no initial input to policy and into the development of reports into this nature by Members but ultimately when the reports are published they are not even considered or discussed here.  This indicates the need to reform procedures.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies have mentioned other inadequacies and they are worth reiterating. In real terms this House is not an independent legislature.  It is a Government-dominated legislature, no matter which Government are in office, in which Government have the monopoly of legislation and there is no real possibility of the individual Deputy, be he an Independent or a backbench TD, initiating legislation of any kind.  Legislation is basically dependent on the Government. In general, if a Deputy gets the opportunity to initiate a Private Members' Bill &mdash; and these are few and far between &mdash; it is a highly unusual occurrence for a Government to say that that Bill is a good idea, well drafted, that its provisions are accepted and that it will be supported and passed through the House.  Ministers do not behave in that way because they would regard the acceptance of such a Bill as an attack on their ministerial responsibility and ability in the particular field to which the legislation relates.</P>
    <P>There is a need for a major reform of procedures of this House to permit the introduction of Private Members' Bills, to enable them to be fully debated, to enable Deputies on all sides to promote Private Members' Bills in areas in which they have a particular interest and expertise. There is also a need for Ministers to accept that if a Bill is produced as a <Col N="531" /> Private Member's Bill which contains valid and worthwile provisions in an area which requires legislation, it should be passed through the House and should not be greeted with the often ludicrous approach that &ldquo;we agree with what is in the Bill but if the Deputy withdraws it we will produce our own Bill.&rdquo;  Then two years later the same Minister produces an identical Bill for which he can claim responsibility at election time.</P>
    <P>Deputies in real terms perform only one real function in this House and it is time we realised it.  This is something many Members conceal from their constituents and often from themselves.  All Deputies like to pretend they play a reasonable and sensible role in the legislative process.  A Government Deputy feels he has to maintain an image, for members of his own party and to impress his constituents, of somebody who is making a real and vital input into the Government and the legislative programme of his party.  Similarly the opposition Deputy, be he on the front or back benches, very often portrays an image of the Deputy playing a vital role in the national Parliament, in the development of legislation and in the introduction of reform.  There are very few Deputies in real terms who play such a role and I will shortly illustrate the very few Ministers who also play such a role.</P>
    <P>What most Deputies are doing in this House is role playing.  This House is very much like a stage.  Upon it we all play out party political antagonisms and take up party political attitudes.  We play to the gallery.  The press have an enormous role in the functions of this House.  How many of us would contribute to debates, criticise and comment if the ladies and gentlement of the press were not there to listen and, hopefully, report?  Very often it is the reports in the media that give Deputies' contributions a seemingly greater importance than they really have in the legislative process.  I always feel that the activities of this House read far more interestingly and sound far more exciting, when one picks up one's <i>Irish Times, Irish Independent</i> or <i>Irish Press</i> the next day than they were in reality.  That is due <Col N="532" /> to the writing and entertainment skills of the journalists who report this House.</P>
    <P>I believe the time has come when TDs need to have a look at the purpose they fulfil being Members of this House. There is a lack of perception of the importance of the Dáil and Seanad as a legislative body; there is a lack of perception that this House is independent of Government and that Government is dependent on this House, and there is a lack of perception that Deputies can and should play a role in the development and introduction of legislation and the general development of policy in the context of the wide variety of areas that are the concern of Government.</P>
    <P>The lack of control over public finances is merely symptomatic of the Dáil's general lack of control over Government.  I welcome the need to establish specialist committees of this House.  When these committees are fleshed out, I am not sure what function they will really have.  I am concerned that if we establish such committees they could become merely legislative window-dressing.  They could make it appear that Deputies have a real role in the development of policy and legislation, while not really giving them such a role.  There could be the establishment of groups of committees in which Deputies would behave and perform in the same manner as they do at present in this House and Ministers would continue to behave and perform in a similar way, jealously guarding their legislative prerogatives against attack, change or amendment from members of such committees.</P>
    <P>Some committees of this House are said to work well &mdash; the Committee of Public Accounts, the committee concerned with the examination of statutory instruments and the committee on the EEC.  Much of the work done by these committees is anonymous, their reports are often produced many years after their relevance has passed, and they are very rarely raised and discussed in this House. If we are to establish specialist committees we should appoint chairmen and the committees should sit regularly, should have power to sit in public, which should be the norm, and occasionally in private <Col N="533" /> in the context of certain functions to which I will refer shortly.  If these committees are to have any meaning, they must have power to interrogate Ministers and civil servants, hear at first hand representations from interested groups and publicly engage in the type of committee work which similar committees perform within the legislative process in the United States.  The establishment of committees of this nature would be part and parcel of the functioning of this House and would go a long way towards restoring the system of checks and balances which is so important in a parliamentary democracy.</P>
    <P>Again I emphasise that if these committees were established without the type of expertise and back-up services which the Members would require to form independent judgments on matters of policy and take independent views of legislative proposals, they would descend into toothless wonders and be little different from the type of function performed by the House at present.  Each Deputy should be entitled to his own personal research assistant.</P>
    <P>There are a number of different types of committee that one could propose and, indeed, to date this area has not been fully and properly thrashed out.  We are familiar here with the establishment of committees to consider a single issue or a single piece of legislation.  We had a committee to consider a Family Law Act, passed in 1976; a committee is to be established to deal with land, the value of land and problems of planning &mdash; very specialist areas &mdash; and one to deal with the problems of the family and marriage. When these single issue committees complete their reports they will cease to function. What we need are permanent committees with the powers which I have described, to deal with the major areas of Government.  These would, within themselves, develop such expertise as is possible and would, by their functions, influence the development of governmental policy, recommend the initiation of legislation, possibly sponsor such legislation in this House on occasion and play a very serious role in the whole legislative process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="534" /> I am going to suggest a number of these committees, but they are not all-embracing. They are the type of committee which I would envisage could perform a function in the House and give Deputies a real opportunity of making a relative contribution to the legislative process.  I am suggesting that we establish committees to cover a number of areas.  The first would be a social affairs committee, the second an economic affairs committee, the third a foreign affairs committee and the fourth a justice and security committee. A number of others could be suggested. The intent would be that within the context of those committees considerable expertise would be developed in the areas with which the committees would be concerned.  These committees would not necessarily be confined to dealing with the area of one Minister's responsibility, but could, of their very nature, embrace a number of different areas.</P>
    <P>Let us first take the proposal for a committee on finance.  All or many of the matters referred to by the Minister in the context of public finance come within the terms of a finance committee.  The Minister is proposing the establishment of a committee on public expenditure.  He has proposed that in future this House be given proper time to consider the Estimates and that individual discussion, examination and debate should take place on the capital programme.</P>
    <P>It is acknowledged by everybody in this House that Estimate debates on individual departments as at present constituted are a farce.  They are a waste of the time of this House and of the Minister's time, with no real relevance in the context of ministerial policy or expenditure. Very often, one is debating the Estimates of a Department six, eight or 12 months after that Department have started spending money on foot of the Estimate being debated.  It is clearly acknowledged by all that Estimates should be considered in advance, as should the Government capital programme, and future public expenditure by the Government prior to budget day.  The expenditure needs of the country could thus be examined in the context of the raising of finances and <Col N="535" /> an input could be made by Members of this House in this area.</P>
    <P>All of these functions, firstly, could be performed properly by a finance committee of this House, such a committee not depriving all Members of the House of the opportunity to debate these issues, but being established to develop a degree of expertise and which could question Ministers and civil servants on their proposals in these areas, receive representations or take submissions from a variety of interest groups which at present send such submissions to Deputies and Ministers and by so doing contribute to the formulation of policy and reports which in a number of instances could ultimately be debated in this House.  The establishment of such a committee would develop within the House an expertise in the area of finance, financial policy and economic policy which at present does not exist.  As this House functions at present, there is no possibility of Deputies developing that type of expertise.</P>
    <P>This type of committee should have been involved in the preparing of the report published by the Commission on Taxation.  This type of committee should be examining the proposals in the report prepared by the Commission on Taxation on behalf of the Members of this House. That committee, sitting in public, hearing submissions from interested groups and examining legislative policy proposals from the Ministers would greatly increase public awareness of the financial problems of the State, of the different ways of tackling those problems and free them from the secrecy in which they are often shrouded in the Department of Finance.</P>
    <P>What function could a justice and security committee have?  It could have a number of functions.  They are functions which at this stage this House does not exercise at all.  We are aware that the Minister has referred to this problem to some extent and that since 1976 we have had a Law Reform Commission in existence. This commission have produced a variety of reports recommending reforms in a number of different areas.  I am not aware of a single debate ever taking place in this House at any stage on any report <Col N="536" /> emanating from this commission. Indeed, no legislation has ever been enacted in this House on foot of a single report or recommendation from them. The Law Reform Commission reports are published, sent to the Taoiseach's Office, no doubt find their way into the inner sanctums of the Department of Justice, never again to emerge.  Dáil Deputies have at no stage played any role of any nature in this area.  A justice and security committee would have a specific role in examining all the reports coming from the Law Reform Commission and, where that commission do not themselves prepare draft legislation, possibly themselves prepare it.  We constantly hear from Ministers that they are in favour of this, that, or the other law reform but there is no time given in the House to process such legislation, or the parliamentary draftsman is so busy he cannot draft the legislation.</P>
    <P>A committee such as this could have a function in examining such reports if they had the proper staff, in preparing draft legislation on many of the reports which would not be politically contentious, and the chairman of such a committee could have a role in introducing such legislation. In that context, after a full Second Stage debate on such legislation in the House the Committee Stage could be taken in the committee with contributions not only by the formal members of the committee but Members of the House being entitled to appear and to contribute and to propose amendments if necessary.</P>
    <P>We have a criminal legal aid system which is rarely discussed in the House.  It is a scheme that should come within the ambit of such a committee.  Each year many millions of pounds have been spent on legal aid since 1962 but at no stage has there been an examination by this House of the efficiency of the criminal legal aid scheme, the desirability to change the scheme or not.  At no stage has there been a cost-benefit analysis of the scheme.  Of course, there has been a report by an independent group chaired by a judge which, equally, has not been considered by this House.  That is something that should be dealt with in the <Col N="537" /> context of the committee I have been suggesting.</P>
    <P>As well, we have the civil legal aid scheme.  It is a wondrous administrative scheme established by the Department of Justice and funded by them, and a number of Government law centres have been opened throughout the State.  That has never been discussed in the House.  It has no legislative base, no legislation has been passed in relation to the scheme, no debate has taken place in the House on the scheme, but I understand there was brief debate on it in the Seanad.  The Legal Aid Board have produced two reports, one of them yesterday, but the earlier report produced more than 12 months ago has not been considered in this House.  This is clearly an area that could come within the ambit of this committee.</P>
    <P>Many other matters could be dealt with by this committee, matters of a serious nature which are important to restore the checks and balances to legislative and governmental processes that are implicit in the Constitution.  Functions are at present exercised by the Minister for Justice or the Government or the Garda that are never properly reviewed by the House, in respect of which the House makes no input except possibly on occasions when we ask Dáil Questions.  They are matters that on occasions during the years have caused public concern, some recently. There is a need to see that the House will have a role to play in a number of those areas.</P>
    <P>Recently we read much about the procedures applicable in regard to telephone tapping.  We were told that the normal procedure is that the Commissioner or an Assistant Commissioner of the Garda would recommend to a Minister that a person's phone be tapped in certain specified circumstances and that the Minister could issue a warrant for telephone tapping on foot of that.  When such tapping takes place it takes place in secret and this House would rarely if ever become aware of it; this House would never know whether it was justified or not; the House would never know the number of circumstances in which telephone tapping or a system of interception was used by the <Col N="538" /> Garda in pursuit of crime; and the House has no means of knowing or controlling such, no means of knowing ever whether such use was justified in individual cases.</P>
    <P>Clearly this is an area of law that requires reform, and I think there are very few people who have any doubt about that.  Any reform in this area not only must ensure the individual's right to privacy but also that the Garda and security forces have all necessary powers to fight crime.  It must also ensure that the House will be aware of the use of such facilities, the use of telephone tapping or other types of interception, and that there will be a system of checks and balances so important in preserving individual liberties.</P>
    <P>One of the reforms needed in this area has no direct relevance to the motion before us in the context of improving the efficiency of the House, but it is directly relevant to the second reform that I will refer to.  I believe it is quite clear that legislation should be introduced that would permit telephone tapping to take place only on an application by a member of the Garda to a judge of the High Court, that such tapping should be permitted only on a warrant issued by a High Court Judge in certain specified circumstances laid down in statutory legislation in compliance with the European convention that deals with this area.</P>
    <P>In effect, such tapping would be permitted only when the Garda required it in the pursuit of serious crime.  However, it is not enough merely to introduce that reform.  The introduction of a High Court judge to the process would insure a degree of independence from Government that is essential in this area.  It would ensure a degree of checks and balances necessary in this area.  However, such a reform is not sufficient because there would be no knowledge on the part of this House whether such application to the High Court judge was ever justified or necessary, and Members of the House would never know to what extent such procedures were being used by the Garda.</P>
    <P>Therefore the justice and security committee of the House I am proposing would have a very clear role.  I believe if <Col N="539" /> the first reform was introduced it should be incumbent on the Garda Commissioner to make an annual report to the committee in regard to the number of instances such applications were made to the judge for telephone tapping, the number of prosecutions that were brought against individuals whose telephones were tapped, and as to the success of such prosecutions.  It is important that it would be seen that there would be some co-relation between tapping and the success of the fight against crime, and it is important that it would be seen that there would be some control by the House.  Merely abdicating the function by sending it from the Garda Commissioner and a Minister who at present exercise it and in that sense are all powerful, to the Garda Commissioner and a judge would not afford us a system of checks and balances.  However, without that suggested committee system, the judicial approach would be preferable because it would be politically neutral. However, that does not satisfy the need for checks and balances.</P>
    <P>That is why I suggest that such a committee, which normally would sit in public, would be given the right to sit in private.  I suggest that members of the justice and security committee should be fully covered by the Official Secrets Act in the context of matters that are of concern to the security of the State and in the fight against crime.  That committee should be entitled to take evidence in private and receive reports in private from the Garda Commissioner.  It should be open to members of such a committee to have made known to them the names of persons whose telephones are being tapped, or who are being bugged in other ways so that the system of checks and balances is available to ensure that these powers are being fully and properly exercised. This is an area from which this House has steered clear for far too long. It has been recognised in many countries, particularly in the United States, that if one moves away from the system of checks and balances required, if the Legislature abdicates its role over an area of civil liberties, an area in which fast developing <Col N="540" /> technology is now streets ahead of present legislation, not only does the Legislature become irrelevant but civil liberties are seriously eroded.</P>
    <P>That is a very serious function that such a committee should perform.  In this context also such a committee should and would obviously report annually to Members of this House as to the number of occasions on which telephone tapping has been engaged in and the number of prosecutions brought subsequently against people whose telephones have been tapped and the success or otherwise of such prosecutions.  Obviously it would not be acceptable for such a committee to publish names of people whose telephones have been tapped but they should have that information available to them.  In certain circumstances they should be able to act on information if they believe that telephones have been tapped in circumstances in which positively they should not have been.</P>
    <P>Another serious function this committee could perform is in another area that on occasion gives rise to great public concern and which at present effectively is the preserve of Government.  I am referring in particular to the question of judicial appointments.  We are fortunate in this country to have an independent Judiciary who serve the country well, who serve us well in our courts and who are seen generally by the public to be independent once they are sitting on the bench.  But there is always great concern expressed about the manner of judicial appointments.  At present judges are appointed by the President effectively on the advice of the Minister for Justice.  In real terms the appointments are made by the Government and Minister for Justice of the day.  It is fair and accurate to say that different Governments and different parties have and do appoint members to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court and Supreme Court, very often, who have had in the course of their legal careers, prior to their elevation to the bench, connections with the party in Government when they are appointed. In some way they may have been involved in politics, be it simply by advising Deputies, Governments or by having <Col N="541" /> connections with individual Ministers, affiliations to particular parties, or perhaps having been failed Dáil candidates on some occasions.  In fairness to all Members of the Judiciary it is also true to say that one never comes across members of the Judiciary betraying their independence when on the bench.  Indeed many judges who have been appointed by Fianna Fáil Governments have made judgments of a constitutional nature and otherwise against Fianna Fáil Governments with which I am sure the Fianna Fáil Government of the day have been unhappy.  Indeed many judges appointed by Coalition Governments have subsequently delivered court decisions with which probably Coalition Governments have been unhappy.  I would not suggest that our judges, once elevated to the bench, have not acted independently; they have and no doubt will continue to do so.</P>
    <P>However, there are two areas of concern in that regard, The first is that Governments when going out of office, often with indecent haste, appoint people to the bench, be it to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court or Supreme Court.  Often in the dying days of Governments any posts needing to be filled are filled.  It is fair to say that whilst our judges preserve their independence very few lawyers would disagree with the comment that some people who have been appointed to the bench in the past have not had the ability for that appointment. As a practising lawyer I have no doubt I will not be thanked by members of the Judiciary for making that comment but it is a reality.  All practising lawyers know it to be a reality, as also do many Members of this House.</P>
    <P>There is a need for this House to play a role in finalising or confirming in some way judicial appointments proposed by Government.  It is a function exercised in the United States by Congress.  It is a function I believe we should take on ourselves. If the Government have a proposal for somebody to be appointed to the Judiciary that person should have to come before the Justice Committee of this House for the purpose of being questioned by Members of this House so that <Col N="542" /> Members might satisfy themselves that that prospective appointee has the ability to sit on the bench be it in the District, Circuit or High Court.  Such a procedure also would prevent governments appointing people to the bench in their dying days in office after they have lost an election because, if this House was not sitting and if such confirmation was necessary, it would not be possible for such appointments to take place.  This House has a responsibility to ensure that persons appointed to the Judiciary have the ability to carry out their roles.  I might emphasise, in making that comment that one must pay tribute to the Judiciary we have at present, to those people who have served us well in our various courts.  But I see no reason that such judicial appointments should be the sole prerogative of Government Ministers without any Member of this House having a contribution to make.</P>
    <P>The same could be said about promotions the Governments can make in the Garda.  I believe this House should have some role to play there to ensure that the political independence of the Garda is preserved at all times, in turn to ensure that persons appointed &mdash; be it to the post of Commissioner or other high-ranking office &mdash; are appropriate people to hold such appointments.  The very fact that appointments could be vetted by such a committee before becoming law would prevent Ministers in different Governments from ever appointing a member of the Garda to a higher office than was appropriate for such a member. Again, for far too long, this House has had no function in any of these areas.</P>
    <P>I referred to the establishment of a social affairs committee.  There are a number of functions such a committee could perform.  I believe the establishment of such a committee is as urgent as is a committee to deal with finance. Whereas the recent budgetary difficulties and problems encountered in the context of Government Estimates have underlined the inability and failure of this House to tackle fully problems of public finances and to control a government or governments who are unwilling to deal realistically with economic problems, the <Col N="543" /> abysmal record of this House on social affairs is a clear indication of the need for new forms of procedure to enable this House to deal with these areas.  In vast areas of what I would describe as social affairs this House has abdicated its function to the courts, has failed to tackle areas of major social importance, sometimes due to political cowardice and at other times due to simple ignorance of the existence of problems.</P>
    <P>If one looks at the vast number of social areas in which new policies or new legislation was forced in recent years by judicial constitutional pronouncements rather than emerging from the legislative chambers of the Dáil or Seanad one will see clearly the dismal failure of the Houses.  I should like to list some of those areas.  The problems relating to family planning were never tackled fully or properly disposed of, or even dealt with in this House until the courts through a constitutional action struck out an old piece of legislation and set out clearly what the law should be.  The whole area of rent restriction, where there were massive problems for landlords and tenants going back many years &mdash; Members with any knowledge of constituency work would have been aware of them &mdash; was never properly tackled by the House until judicial constitutional pronouncements were made in a court case.  The gross inequity in the taxation system in so far as a married couple could be required to pay a greater sum by way of income tax than two single people living together was well known to Members before I was elected to the House but nothing was done about it.  That was only reformed as a result of a constitutional case and the courts striking down aspects of our Income Tax Acts as being repugnant to the Constitution.</P>
    <P>In the adoption area until 1974 couples of mixed religion were prohibited by our laws from adopting and an orphaned child born to a couple of mixed religion could not be adopted.  That was creating problems where couples who were suitable adopters were refused children and children who could be adopted were kept in institutions but it was not tackled until <Col N="544" /> a constitutional case was brought before the courts.  We continue to have such problems.  There are massive problems in the area of family law which I do not intend to go into in any detail today because it is not appropriate to this debate.  However, it would be appropriate to raise such matters at meetings of the justice committee I have suggested. One area where law and social reality are vastly different is in regard to our nullity laws.  Hundreds of couples have obtained Church Annulments but they do not have any chance of obtaining a civil decree of annulment.  What is happening?  The Judges are developing the law because they realise that our law which goes back to the last century is inadequate.  To some extent, in so far as is possible, the Judiciary have stepped in and the law is being changed in a piecemeal fashion to fit into modern social realities.  That is one of the areas that could be dealt with by a committee dealing with family and marital problems.</P>
    <P>Another problem I should like to deal with is the subject of a report produced by the Attorney General in 1976 with comprehensive recommendations for reform but it has not been considered by the House yet.  The committee I have suggested not only need to involve themselves in legislation but to examine the efficiency of many of the existing schemes in the area of social affairs which I take to include social affairs and matters of health which are interwoven.  Our health service costs the country millions of pounds and while it provides many worthwhile and essential services the cost effectiveness of that service has never been examined to see if some things could be done in a more efficient way for the benefit of those who use the service.  We have never examined the service to see if some things could be done in a more cost-effective way.  The House has not had any function in examining that matter. We have had reports produced by Governments in the areas of social affairs and health but we have never considered matters of great public concern and I find that astonishing.  During last summer the Minister for Health produced a report about the circumstances which gave rise <Col N="545" /> to two children dying at the hands of their parents and the parents being successfully prosecuted through the courts.  That report, to some extent, referred to failures on the part of Department of Health officials or officials from the Eastern Health Board and, to another extent, it emerged that there had been a major failure in that area.  A report of that nature in similar circumstances coming before the Westminster Parliament many years ago provoked enormous public response and led to lengthy debates in the House of Commons.  As a result of those debates legislation was produced but we produce reports like that by way of Government press release and they are never discussed or debated in the House with the result that one never knows whether problems are being tackled in a proper manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>We had an all-party health committee in the House but the Deputy's party scuttled it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The failure to consider a serious report of that nature is an indictment of the failure of the procedures of the House to deal properly with Government and make a good contribution in the area of legislation and Government policy.  Such a report should be considered by a social affairs committee, if it is established.  There are many other areas that could be covered by such a committee but I was anxious to indicate the relevance and functions of such committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The final committee I suggest is one to cover the area of foreign affairs.  Foreign affairs are rarely discussed here.  The subject arises occasionally by way of question and, at intervals, we have a debate on an individual issue but the House does not make any contribution to the development of our foreign policy.  Most Members know little about the area of foreign policy.  There is a total lack of information available to the House as to what we are doing in the area of foreign policy or our involvement in the UN.  The Resolutions we are involved in in that assembly, or assemblies connected with the UN, are not circulated to the House.  One <Col N="546" /> reads about such matters in the newspapers, if they are reported.  We do not involve ourselves in any way in the development of general foreign policy matters or in the conduct of the foreign relations of the State.  That is a major failure in the context of the functions the House performs. There is a need to establish a proper foreign affairs committee such as exists in many parliaments in Europe and elsewhere.  Such a committee would afford us the means of participating in the foreign policy area.  It is an insult to Members to learn about matters relating to foreign policy only through the news media.  Journalists here are better informed on Irish foreign policy initiatives than the vast majority of Members.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that the establishment of such committees would have a further role, and I endorse his view.  They would lead to a body of expertise in the House in different areas of Government concern which would result in a vast improvement in the legislative process.  The reality is that many Ministers, irrespective of the party in power, go into Government as little more than arbitrators or administrators rather than initiators.  Very often &mdash; if it appears to be the norm rather than the exception &mdash; Members of different parties are appointed to ministerial rank in areas of responsibility in which they do not have any real expertise.  The effect is that, for the Minister's first couple of years in office, provided the Government last that long, he spends his time trying to ensure that no problems arise and acting purely and solely on the advice given by his civil servants.  He has no original input of any nature to make as Minister exercising responsibility.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate, indeed, that we have the expert civil service we have.  Very often the reality in some Government Departments is that without the civil servants the Department would collapse entirely.  We will not have swifter legislation, more responsible Government and more responsible legislation until we have developed a system whereby at least those people appointed to ministerial responsibility are recognised as having some degree of expertise in the area of <Col N="547" /> their responsibility at the time they are appointed.  Very often a person who has developed into a good Minister has developed the expertise only at the time he is leaving office or is being shifted to a new Department.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies mentioned the need to change the procedures of this House to enable Deputies to raise matters of national importance and to extend the Private Notice Question procedure.  I endorse that.  There is a need to ensure that the procedures of this House are reformed so that Deputies can respond quickly to matters of public or national importance.  There is little evidence to date that this House can do that.</P>
    <P>There is a need to develop something else as well.  There is a need for all Members of all parties to look at the role they play in this House, and the role they play as legislators.  There is a need to recognise that much of the legislation which goes through this House is not ideological in content.  Very often the general principles of it are agreed.  Often amendments should be made to legislation but, when a vote is called, sheep-like we troop through the lobbies in party political blocs no matter what we really think about a particular legislative proposal.</P>
    <P>This House has failed to attain the degree of political maturity which is essential for a Legislature which regards itself as having an independent legislative function and as truly playing a role in a system of checks and balances.  If a Deputy votes for an amendment which his Minister feels should not be made, this is regarded at best as an act of defiance, possibly as a challenge to the leadership of his party, and definitely from the point of view of his party supporters as something approaching a reserved sin.</P>
    <P>There is a need for Deputies to perceive themselves as legislators.  There is a need for us to act as legislators.  There is a need to change the public perception of what we are doing in this House.  Members of this House should be able to vote in a freer manner than they can at present on certain types of legislation which do not involve fundamental Government policy to which they are committed.  If <Col N="548" /> they do so vote, it should not be interpreted as a challenge to the Government or to the leader of a party, but as an expression of a legislative point of view.</P>
    <P>If we started to do that on all sides of this House we would start acting as legislators. The fact that we might force the Government to amend the Bill, or the fact that the odd Bill might be defeated, should not mean automatically that there should be a vote of confidence in the Government.  It should not be interpreted as meaning that a person who voted against a Bill proposed by a Minister was in some way in opposition to his colleagues in Government.  It should be seen as a legislative contribution, and not as a political act of defiance or challenge to the leadership.  Until such time as we take upon our shoulders the job of legislators, this House will continue to be largely irrelevant to the development of Government policy and the passing of legislation.</P>
    <P>I agree with previous speakers.  It is astonishing that the proceedings of this House are not broadcast.  It is essential that they should be broadcast on radio and, if Telefis Éireann wish to tolerate us all, television cameras should be given access to this Chamber as well.  We are not engaged in a secretive process of trying to pass legislation or engage in debate behind the backs of the people. This is an open Parliament.  People can come into this House and view the goings on.  All too few people do that.  When a major issue of national interest is being discussed in this House, the facilities are totally inadequate to accommodate the vast numbers of people who want to watch the proceedings.</P>
    <P>Radio and television access to this House is essential in a democratic society operating in the last quarter of the 20th century.  No rational argument can be made against the provision of such facilities. The establishment of such facilities would greatly enhance the performance of this House and would force upon Members of the House participation and a relevant contribution to the legislative process.  It would force the Government to provide facilities to enable such contributions to be made.  I hope that, within <Col N="549" /> the very short term, it can be agreed to give radio and television access to this House.</P>
    <P>Another matter which must be mentioned in the context of the efficiency of the House and the performance of Dáil Deputies is the matter of the physical facilities available to Members of the House.  People outside Dáil Éireann believe that Deputies dwell in the lap of luxury, sitting back and being served by masses of experts, secretaries and other assistants.  The facilities in this House are appalling.  That is the only way to describe them.  Deputies find themselves working five, six or seven in a room and often with three or four typists typing away while Deputies attempt to do their work.  Some of the rooms are no larger than some of the public lavatories outside this House.</P>
    <P>The facilities for Deputies to carry out their work as legislators in this House are little short of farcical.  If Members of the public viewed these facilities they would be astonished.  They are facilities which the most junior member of a small company would not tolerate on a daily basis.  For far too long they have been tolerated.  If we expect Members to make proper contributions to the legislative process, at the very least they should have the physical environment within which they can make that contribution.</P>
    <P>It is an obvious thing to say that at least a TD should have an office available to him in which he can do his work, interview constituents, meet delegations and people and conduct research.  I do not think it is looking for luxury to suggest that his secretary should have a separate room in which to carry on normal secretarial functions.  At present this is a facility which is impossible to obtain because of the physical structure of the House.  Until such time as proper facilities are made available to Deputies, including facilities for research, they will continue to play a small role as legislators.</P>
    <P>I should not like the view to be taken that I do not believe Deputies have a role to play as regards constituency work. There is no doubt that a Deputy has a dual function.  He must act as a representative of his constituents and as an <Col N="550" /> intermediary between the Government and his constituents.  That is the role he plays in the context of constituency work. He also has a role to play as a legislator which he cannot properly fulfil at present.</P>
    <P>Consitutency work is important for two reasons.  When people have problems they must be given access to Members of the House and Members must have the facilitity of assisting them in the resolution of problems where Government are directly involved.  Much constituency work could be done just as efficiently by social workers.  To some extent Deputies are amateur social workers, lawyers, parish priests and so on.  I am not saying this is a function which Deputies should not perform.  A Deputy has a role to play in this area.  Much constituency work is due to the inefficiency of the Government, the civil service and Government Departments in their administrative affairs which renders it impossible for an individual to get simple answers to simple queries without going to their local TD. The two classic Departments in this area are the Department of Posts and Telegraphs which, in the Dublin area has descended into total and utter chaos where not only does the right hand not know what the left hand is doing but the fingers on one hand do not know in which direction each one is tapping, and the Department of Social Welfare.  It is impossible for the public to get quick answers to simple inquiries on matters to which they have strict entitlement.  Deputies are forced to interfere and further clog up the administrative process.</P>
    <P>Deputies have a function in representing their constituents views to the Government.  It is a self-perpetuating process.  Deputies are often criticised by people outside the House and by the media for doing nothing other than constituency work.  I have already explained the reason for that.  It is because Deputies quickly learn they have no real role to play in the legislative process.  If a Deputy did not do constituency work and merely sat around the House he would rapidly become a patient for the nearest pyschiatrist. The only way to retain one's sanity and the feel one has to any relevant function is to carry out constituency <Col N="551" /> work.  It is also a way of retaining one's seat.  Most Deputies are known for their constituency work and not for their legislative contributions.  For many Deputies it is a self-perpetuating system of frustration.  One exists here feeling frustrated and one works at constituency work to ensure one does not go totally mad.  If one does constituency work efficiently one is re-elected.</P>
    <P>I hope substantial reforms will follow from this debate.  I know of the Minister's concern and belief in the need to reform this House.  I am cautious in expressing that hope because I am not sure that the Government at the end of the day will be willing to create a system of committees that will exercise real control over the Government and Ministers, which will to some extent water down powers Ministers now have and in so doing loosen the control the Government have in this House.  I hope these committees will be meaningful and play a constructive role. I know many Deputies will not continue to tolerate the type of system we have in the House for very much longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like, as other Deputies have done, to welcome this debate.  The relevance of the debate is limited to how seriously the Leader of the House, Deputy Bruton, and others who may be involved, take the debate. As with all previous debates there is no obligation on any one to act on anything which may be said by any TD.  That is the main reason why this House could be termed a national county council or a national district court in its appearance and in the way it operates.  Unfortunately, our outmoded procedures have led us to a situation where the power of the Oireachtas has been eroded to that of a rubber stamp.  The legislative process has been overcome to a great degree by rulings of the Supreme Court which make it imperative on the House to change legislation.  The relationship between pressure groups and the Government have brought about a situation where the Dail is only secondary in terms of applying pressure on any Minister or any Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> I shall be as concise and practical as possible in my contribution.  I realise there are many Deputies who wish to contribute.  We should make suggestions which may not be obvious to the people drawing up reforms.  There is need for reform in the area of financial procedures in which TDs at present only pay lip service.  The legislative process needs to be reformed.  State bodies have been set up by successive Governments to solve problems in different areas &mdash; for example, Bord na gCapall and the health boards.  We set up the boards but have no relationship with them.  We must also look at the whole area of Leinster House as opposed to the Dáil Chamber and see how we can make it more relevant.  There is the question of the Dáil timetable &mdash; parliamentary questions, adjournment debates, Private Members' time and so on.</P>
    <P>We have a budgetary procedure which, through the various Stages of the Finance Bill, allows us a fair deal of scrutiny over this legislation.  However, there is little or no flexibility as regards making amendments and any changes there would be welcome.  In relation to the public capital programme, there is no effective discussion or debate, as has been recognised by all sides of this House.  A programme should be set up whereby all Estimates &mdash; I hope they will be accurate so we do not have to go through the procedure of having Supplementary Estimates at the end of each year &mdash; are published in August, considered through the autumn by the financial committees and the recommendations of those committees are brought before the House in October.  There should be a full debate, as in the secondary stage of any legislation, in December so that Members can discuss all aspects of the expenditure either on the capital or current side and ensure that prior to the budget there would be a knowledgable understanding by all Members of the exact details of expenditure and perhaps a realistic change towards allowing Deputies to have some decision making capacity in relation to those financial procedures.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Public Accounts Committee or whatever economic committee <Col N="553" /> would deal with these matters, I have a number of suggestions to make. All Deputies should be allowed to submit queries which the committee would have to answer within a set time.  It is not obligatory under our debating structures for any Minister to answer any specific query on the public capital programme or on any Estimate prior to expenditure.</P>
    <P>It was also recognised by the Opposition Chief Whip that there might be difficulties in getting the participation of Members.  There should be an open participation and this has not happened heretofore in any Dáil committees to my knowledge.  If Deputies have a particular interest in any committee at any time they should be able to get involved and to participate in that committee.</P>
    <P>We should be totally unapologetic in the areas of broadcasting our remuneration. For too long too many politicians have been demeaning their own profession by refusing to accept increases in expenses and salaries to which they are entitled.  That matter should be dealt with in a businesslike manner as affecting Members of a national Parliament and should not be seen as a scrounging exercise on the public purse.</P>
    <P>The committees should also have full expenditure allowances to ensure that they can <i>subpoena</i> expert witnesses and also have a research back-up team to help Deputies, since they simply do not have time for dealing with these matters.  The whole question of the effectiveness of committees is related to the fact that it must have some obligatory action on the Government so that the Government must act upon the recommendations of any committee, especially in the area of public accounts.</P>
    <P>The memoranda circulated with Bills being introduced in the Dáil are not sufficiently explanatory or helpful to Deputies to enable them to make an effective contribution to debates.  They are usually too complex and need to be simplified.  A proper memorandum, along the lines of the Minister's briefing from his civil servants, should be circulated to all Deputies. With regard to amendments to various Bills, if there was sufficient interest shown by Deputies on both sides of the <Col N="554" /> House, an <i>ad hoc</i> committee should be set up when a Bill is presented at First Stage to the House.  This Committee should have the necessary research and back-up to investigate the Bill.  Its recommendations should be circulated to Deputies so that when the Bill came to the Second Stage or to Committee Stage the House and the Minister would be in a position to accept amendments.  Far too many laws recently enacted by this House have been full of Ministerial orders.  The effect of having 21 days to annul it would mean that Deputies would have to have a great degree of knowledge in that area and a great deal of alacrity to ensure they were in the right place at the right time to annual Ministerial orders.  When legislation is being examined by these committees there should be a review of Ministerial orders because they simply erode further the involvement of the Dáil and its Members.</P>
    <P>I understand that over a 100 State-sponsored bodies, both commercial and non-commercial, have been set up by successive Governments to deal on behalf of the Government and the Dáil with specific problems.  I do not accept that the glossy annual reports which Deputies receive are sufficient accountability in dealing with the question of whether the board in question is dealing satisfactorily with the problems put before it.  There should be another <i>ad hoc</i> committee set up to deal with these problems. The Members of this House have never had an opportunity to discuss in detail all the consequences and details of the scandal of Bord na gCapall.  As always, the ladies and gentlemen of the media have had far more insight and involvement than Members of this House who are responsible for allocating the money for boards of this kind.  Committees of inquiry should be set up to look into the areas and involvement of State boards.</P>
    <P>In this regard there should be limits laid down by those committees for all State boards in relation to annual reports. It is quite common for many boards to produce their annual reports 12 months or more after the year in question has ended.  This can also apply to annual <Col N="555" /> accounts and can lead to certain rumours and so on.  The level of accountability there is very slight and needs to be improved by these committees of inquiry with investigative powers to ensure that there will be full accountability.</P>
    <P>Hardly a week goes by without redundancies being announced in some part of the country.  Experience should be gained from particular companies.  There must be warning signals which should be heeded prior to the &ldquo;last rites&rdquo; on any company.  Perhaps there would be an advantage in a committee of inquiry investigating with State agencies a sequence of major problems in our society, whether it is drugs or redundancies or whatever.  Recommendations could be made and put to Ministers in that way. Governments have set up commissions in the area of law reform, taxation commissions, child care and so on and all of these have had no follow up from the Dáil, except for summary debates.  Perhaps committees should be set up subsequent to commissions being established to ensure that there would be a proper follow up.</P>
    <P>Leinster House, as distinct from the Dáil, is an area where there is the greatest scope for reform.  It is wrong if people think that all there is to Dáil Éireann is this Chamber.  While the plenary session is proceeding here there is no reason why three committees should not meet simultaneously to discuss various matters.  I will make a number of suggestions on how improvements might be carried out.</P>
    <P>The point has been made by many previous speakers that Deputies have not enough time to deal with major legislative proposals. Deputy Barry, who shares an office with me, can confirm that there are ten people in one small room.  There are eight telephones but we need one more because Deputy Barry and I have to share one phone.  We are rural Deputies and this puts us in an impossible situation when one considers the constraints and demands on us.  I have between 60,000 and 70,000 constituents to serve and they are quite entitled to contact me with their problems which I <Col N="556" /> am obliged to follow up.  I do not have the facilities to do that.  Members of this House should explode the myth that our time is spent eating in the subsidised restaurant and drinking in the subsidised bar.  The reality is different.  Our only hope of getting improved facilities is the fact that our secretaries have been unionised and in time they may demand reasonable accommodation and facilities. That is a logical assessment of our situation which is completely ridiculous. Even the lowest grades in private industry and State employment would not have to endure what we have to endure with no media attention and no prospect of improvement.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of research facilities in the Library of Leinster House.  I must compliment the individuals concerned.  They are considerate, helpful and attentive to the needs of Deputies but the situation frequently arises where Deputies are presented with volumes of material.  There is no one to process this material in order to get the relevant data.  If further assistance were given in this area, Deputies would be able to participate more fully in various debates.</P>
    <P>If nothing else is done in the area of Dáil reform I should like the following change to be made.  I am talking about when the Dáil is in recess but when the staff are working and the House is open. I do not see why Deputies should not have the facility to get written replies to questions within one week.  That is the least Deputies might expect.  During the summer recess various issues arose and the Deputies concerned said they would put down questions but by the time the Dáil re-assembled the questions were no longer relevant.  There must be some method whereby Deputies are able to table questions whether of a constituency or national character.  There must be some answerability from the Government. This may be only a small point but it would have top priority in my estimation.</P>
    <P>I take great offence when working in Leinster House, especially when the Dáil is not sitting, when I am told at 9 p.m. or 9.30 p.m. that I must vacate the premises <Col N="557" /> because the building has to be closed.  If I want to work until 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock, I see no reason why this House should not be kept open.  Deputies have to work irregular hours and often they have to work in Dublin.  They should be allowed to work as they please.  I heard a story recently of a Deputy who tried to arrange a meeting in this House but there were no facilities.  One cannot have people in one's office because of the size of the room.  There is no official room where one can meet people in privacy to discuss any problems that may arise. With regard to the release of Government statements, Deputies on all sides are not informed.  There should be a standard practice where TDs would be circularised with all Government statements at the time of their release.  These letters might be left with their mail but there should be some simplified system where they are notified of Government statements.</P>
    <P>The Government of the day orders all the business and any changes in relation to the Order of Business are dependent on the will of the Government.  However, there is a need for a new set of rules and orders.  It is wrong that so many rules are dependent on precedent.  New Members find it bewildering; they do not understand why something is technically in order or not in order simply because of precedent or tradition.  These precedents must be written out in a clear form so that they may be altered as the situation requires.  This would ensure that there was no doubt or argument.</P>
    <P>If an extra hour-and-a-half on Thursdays were devoted to parliamentary questions it would be of considerable help.  Many questions that appear on the Order Paper are unnecessary.  These matters relate to constituency queries and they should be answered but they should not appear on the Order Paper.  I would limit the number of oral questions &mdash; say five questions to a Deputy at one time &mdash; on the Order Paper.  This would speed up the answering of questions.  If a Deputy puts down a question about CIE or certain State boards it is most annoying to be told that the Minister concerned has no answerability in the matter.  That <Col N="558" /> is quite wrong.  We should work out a system to ensure that some person is answerable and will give the information required.  I repeat the point that has been made that if a parliamentary question is submitted on a Monday it should be answered by the following Monday whether the Dáil is in session or recess.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why there should not be more adjournment debates.  However, I wonder if certain matters that are raised on the Adjournment would not be better answered by way of Private Notice Question.  If a Deputy has a query regarding redundancy or a factory closure in his constituency or if he wants a capital works programme, a piece of infrastructure or whatever, expedited in his constituency he raises it on the Adjournment. Frequently on the Adjournment there is no answerability.  The TD makes his contribution and that is terrific for local media consumption, and the Minister gives his vague response.  It would be far better if the Minister had to answer some questions and to undergo a certain amount of cross-examination so that everyone in the area would be more knowledgeable in that regard.  The whole area of Private Notice Questions and adjournment debates needs to be examined in a new light.  If more time was allowed for Private Notice Questions and more Private Notice Questions were allowed and more time was given to adjournment debates &mdash; say instead of half-an-hour, a time of an hour-and-a-half &mdash; nobody other than the Ceann Comhairle would be inconvenienced. The House is usually empty at that time. TDs could pursue policy questions on adjournment debates, but that never arises.  Certain policy questions in the area of education or health, for example, could receive some enlightened discussion.</P>
    <P>To find the time for this, one way is obviously to shorten the ridiculously long periods of recess.  One month in the summer when everything closed down absolutely, when TDs would not be expected by anyone to be available, would be far better than three months when TDs are expected to be everywhere in their constituencies and are criticised for not being <Col N="559" /> in the Dáil because it is not open.  At present TDs are not on holiday when they are alleged to be on holiday and they do not get a holiday when they should get one.  If that could be reformed to 10 days at Easter, 10 days at Christmas and a month in the summer with the Dáil open for the rest of the year we would have more debating time to deal with many of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>In relation to Private Members' Bills, if seven members of either side of the House put sufficient interest, work and effort into their preparation, the Bills could be published and therefore allowed to go before a new committee.  There is no encouragement through the party and Dáil structures for anyone to prepare a Bill in any area in which he might have a strong interest.  The availability in the House of a draftsman would be an essential prerequisite in this regard.</P>
    <P>Another area in relation to practical Dáil procedures is that of voting.  Ever since I have been a member of this House I have not been able to understand the haphazard nature of voting and the antiquated procedures in relation to the locking of doors, ringing of bells and so forth. I cannot understand why it cannot be regulated in such a fashion that every TD in the House would know that votes would take place at 10 a.m., 8,30 p.m. or whatever fixed time &mdash; perhaps lunchtime &mdash; so that they could order their business of the day in such a way that Governments would not fall or change overnight simply because TDs were somewhere else when the bell rang.  In regard to the method of voting, while I appreciate the historic traditions and the need for respect for and continuation of them, there is a strong argument for having a more modern and efficient system of voting.</P>
    <P>The whole aspect of Dáil reform and the implementation of the small number of, I hope, constructive suggestions I have made are dependent on the Government's commitment to Dáil reform.  The Government wield the axe.  They are in a position to make real changes, something the TDs cannot do.  TDs can only <Col N="560" /> suggest, as in all debates heretofore.  The Government must react to this.</P>
    <P>If major Dáil reform is to take place, if it is realised that TDs must have a great involvement in the Dáil and participation in debates, simultaneously they must be afforded facilities to give them the opportunity to match the expertise and experience of the civil service.  If they do not have similar facilities they will simply not be able to contribute constructively under particular debated headings. Office equipment, working facilities, research and back-up of committees and of TDs must be provided if TDs are expected to make a meaningful contribution.</P>
    <P>In relation to all committees which are a fundamental aspect of Dáil reform proposals, written in must be some new measures that will make it obligatory upon Ministers, Departments and the Government of the day to have some effective response to the recommendations of the committee.  If that does not happen, TDs will simply not become involved.  Most people in this House are aware of the difficulty of TDs in relation to time constraints, that unless those safeguards are written in so that they can see some effective consequence of their involvement in a committee, the TDs will not bother their heads about it.  All of the goodwill towards Dáil reform must have a bottom line, namely, the Government must react to TDs suggestions, must take them seriously, and there must be obligatory safeguards for committees and TDs.  Governments must give an effective response.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The first item of Dáil reform which could be put into operation could come from ourselves, and I hope to abide by this today.  I am referring to a much gerater degree of self-discipline on the part of Deputies in speaking briefly and to the point as far as possible in a debate and not indulging in repetition and going over points which have been made already.  I hope that in what I say this morning I will not fall into that trap. One thing which drives people away from this Chamber is the knowledge that someone is speaking just for the record, <Col N="561" /> going through the motions, and that nothing real will be said at the end of it.</P>
      <P>It was right to have this as the first debate of the new session.  It is getting this Dáil off to a good start.  It is right that we got through this exercise of taking a cold, hard look at ourselves before we head into what probably will be the toughest Dáil session of the toughest Dáil in the history of the State.  The approach of the Minister is right.  This attempt at consensus, to look at ourselves and talk to ourselves, to bring all parties along on reforming the way in which we all work together, is good.  We are all bonded together.  We are all parliamentarians, we all fought hard to get here and we all believe in the supremacy of Parliament, but if we do not stand up for our rights, if we do not project ourselves as being serious about discharging the responsibilities under the Constitution, then we cannot expect those outside even to begin to take us seriously.  I am glad that all parties have joined in this debate and I am very impressed with the spirit of contributions from all parts of the House.</P>
      <P>Parliament and politicians have taken a bashing recently.  I hope this debate will be the first stage in a fight back by Members of Parliament to restore us to our rightful place.  However, it would be wrong to see what has happened to our parliament in isolation.  What has happened to our Parliament over the last 20 or 30 years has happened to parliaments right across Europe.  The power of Parliament is declining for reasons outlined by various speakers here today and yesterday, the growing power of pressure groups, the growth in the complexity and size of governments, the growing power of the civil service and the difficulties we all have in penetrating the civil service to find out who exactly took what decision and to see where the real centres of power are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The media with the growth in technology and the growth of interest in them have focused attention probably more than ever before on the leading personalities and also on what is ephemeral and dramatic rather than on the substantial detailed work of parliament.  I do not blame them for that because that is what <Col N="562" /> sells papers and interests people.  Other things that are done have not the same headline interest.  However, this greatly distorts the public perception of what goes on in this House.</P>
    <P>Other countries have suffered from the same phenomenon but in their parliaments they have fought back.  They have found ways to give themselves greater power over the public services, to give themselves greater means of consulting with pressure groups, to allow the ordinary member a greater say in the formulation of policy.  We have been slow in going about this.  Perhaps now that we are doing it we can learn the lesson of other countries.  We can see the mistakes made and we can pick out the ideas that have worked in other countries.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister is approaching this in a very undogmatic way asking: &ldquo;What can we do?  What has worked elsewhere?&rdquo;.  This is what impresses me about the approach of the Minister.  I am glad he is not here so that I will not embarrass him.  The Minister for Industry and Energy was accused of being a conservative but I believe he is one of the most radical Members of this House.  I believe he is looking for a radical approach to the whole question of Dáil reform but he is doing it by consultation and by getting the distilled wisdom of the House on the things that should be done. If the reforms we are talking about today go through then I believe the name of the Minister for Industry and Energy will become part of the history of the Parliament of this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to mention one other person who I believe has done more to improve the conditions of ordinary Deputies in the House than anybody else. I refer to Deputy Charles Haughey, the Leader of the Opposition.  We owe thanks for many of the improvements in the working conditions of ordinary TDs, the provision of secretaries, typewriters and better facilities, which are still far from perfect, to Deputy Charles Haughey when he was Taoiseach.  I would like to put that on record on what cannot be a very easy day for him.</P>
    <P>I would like to go very briefly over some of the points made by the Minister <Col N="563" /> and other speakers.  Everybody agrees that the Dáil timetable has to be changed. We are all aware of the criticism which comes from outside because of the long recesses.  There is no justification for the Dáil being out of session for three to four months.  Life goes on, crises arise and there are issues that have to be tackled. It is a public scandal that the Dáil is out of session on such occasions.  It may well be that there are good reasons but I submit that the main reason is that Governments of all parties do not like the inconvenience of the Dáil sitting too frequently.  In France, where General De Gaulle, in drawing up his Constitution, deliberately wanted to shackle the power of Parliament, he brought in a law which says that Parliament will sit for only two periods not more than six months a year. That was done deliberately so that there would not be scrutiny and Governments could get on with what they saw as doing the business of governing without having to put up with the nuisance of Parliament. We are here to be a nuisance, we are here to ensure that government is done properly and openly, that Ministers do not, often for what they see as very good reasons, abuse their powers or short-circuit the elected assembly.  I believe there is a strong case for having longer sessions of the Dáil, for having fixed time periods as far as possible and ensuring that if there are breaks they do not last for three or four months as happened in the past.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about Question Time.  I agree with most of the proposals made, that Deputies should show greater discipline in putting down the number of questions they do, that greater use could be made of the written answer. I support the proposal of Deputy Ivan Yates that written questions be available even when the Dáil is not in session.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that sufficient attention has been given to broadcasting the Dáil and Seanad.  One of the problems we face in Leinster House is that we are remote from the people.  People find it difficult to come in here, they do not feel that it is their Parliament and they do not feel that we are working on their behalf.  One way of breaking down that sense of <Col N="564" /> remoteness, of bringing closer to people what happens here, is the introduction of broadcasting.  We are the only parliamentary democracy, apart from India, which does not broadcast the proceedings of Parliament on a regular basis.  Maybe we are lucky that we are coming into this a bit later because there are problems. There are problems of editorial control. Politicians are often very sensitive about journalists editing what they say.  Even on the excellent but far too short &ldquo;Today In The Dáil&rdquo;, if we appear we complain that perhaps the wrong part went in or some gems we uttered were overlooked. I believe, by and large, that we can trust our journalists.  I believe there are sufficient in-built checks and balances within their system of operation to ensure that we will all get a fair crack of the whip.  I do not believe we have anything to fear from the type of broadcasting which exists in the BBC's &ldquo;Yesterday in Parliament&rdquo;, which I believe has brought the reality of parliament much closer to interested people.  It will obviously never be &ldquo;top of the pops&rdquo; but at least there will be an interested audience who will want to find out what is happening.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an extension of the occasional introduction of television to this House.  There are obviously problems but they have been overcome in most other countries.  We do not need the large arc lights.  There could be fixed cameras for set debates such as the election of the Taoiseach and budget day.  The people have a right to see what is happening in their Parliament.  Very few of them can come in here, sit through debates and see it as it actually is, so the introduction of radio and television into the Dáil would obviously help greatly in that regard and would be to our benefit.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about a proper committee system.  I believe we will get one so I need not elaborate too much on that.  The type of committee system which allows Members to specialise must also have proper powers.  Committees must have the right to send for civil servants and to send for files.  Committees must have their own research so that they can approach civil servants.  I do not see civil servants as enemies but if we are to talk <Col N="565" /> to them at their level we must have the background and the information.  These committees must have the right of access to proper independent research if they are to operate in any sort of meaningful and real way.</P>
    <P>The great value of the committee system is that it allows people to talk away from the artificial atmosphere of a debating chamber like this, it allows consensus to develop where there should be consensus. There will not always be consensus but the experience of the West German Parliament, for instance, is that the committee system results in something like 85 per cent consensus on most legislation going through.  In a House like this there will be general agreement on many technical and legal matters where there is no great question of principle.  In that way Governments are not forced into situations where they are afraid to give way nor will Oppositions take up extreme positions simply for the sake of it.  If we are to have committees let us have them but let them be proper committees brought in with the proper range of back-up.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the point raised by Deputies De Rossa and Mac Giolla about the frustration of wanting to raise a matter of topical interest.  We all do from time to time and some way must be devised whereby even a half hour or one hour's topical debate once or twice a week can take place where matters of major importance can be raised and can be discussed fully.  It is ridiculous that these issues can be discussed on <i>Today Tonight</i>, on John Bowman's programme and so forth and not discussed in this House.</P>
    <P>I will leave the reform of financial procedures but there are a few other matters which have not been raised so far.  I believe the present spate of reform should include the Seanad.  I believe, having served in the Seanad for a brief period, that there are many ways in which it could become far more effective.  I would start by reforming the electoral system which is out-dated and does not serve the purpose for which it was intended.  We should take a very hard look and see how we could either make <Col N="566" /> it a truly vocational Seanad or else devise some other form of second Chamber. There are ways in which the Seanad could be useful, for example, as was intended, by being a forum for distinguished visiting speakers.  Also, the Seanad could act as a committee of investigation on major national questions such as drug abuse or transport policy.  The Seanad has that flexibility.  It could be a place where Members of the European Parliament would be given right of access to address the House whereas they are cut off.  It is important that we retain our ties with the European Parliament.  These then, are some of the suggestions I should like the Upper House to consider when they assemble in a few week's time.</P>
    <P>If we are looking at the over-all question of parliament we must consider our electoral system.  Much was said in this regard yesterday, especially in regard to the multi-seat constituencies.  These produce a degree of competition between party members that is not healthy but which also forces people to devote disproportionate amounts of time to constituency service often of an unnecessary or useless nature and at the expense of other duties.</P>
    <P>It might be no harm either to consider what I regard as one of the great missed opportunities of Irish politics.  I refer to the failure to adopt the Norton amendment at the time of the second referendum in 1968.  The single-seat constituency with the PR system might take some of the pressures off Members of the House and might be a better type of electoral system.</P>
    <P>Unlike my colleagues I do not find the voting system here either cumbersome or archaic.  There must be some type of ceremony, some type of drama, about the House and going into the lobbies to vote provides a small element of drama.  In addition, it is one of the few times when one is with all one's colleagues, when one can chat with the people on the other side and when one can discuss questions of some importance.</P>
    <P>While the conditions obtaining for Deputies here are bad, the situation is much worse for those in the media.  The &ldquo;Pol. Corr's room&rdquo;, as it is known, is an <Col N="567" /> urban slum and should have been included in the Gregory deal for some kind of assistance.  By and large, as has been the case regarding so many aspects of the House, there have been rapid developments without there being provision for proper facilities.  Any redevelopment of the House must include plans for a proper media corridor and proper studio facilities for the people of the press who are doing this vital job in very bad circumstances.  Very often what we may regard as misunderstandings might not have arisen had there been better conditions and better facilities all round.</P>
    <P>I wish to follow my own advice and not spend a lot of time going over points that have been made already.  I commend the Minister for having introduced this motion and I am grateful that the Government have given us the opportunity to have such a debate.  I trust that people outside will realise that we are serious about putting our own house in order.  If we begin this session on that basis I am confident that we can win back the respect which, not entirely through our own fault, we seem to have lost in recent times and so we can be more fulfilled in carrying out the job we sought and which we were privileged to be sent here to do in respect of both legislation and representation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be somewhat impertinent of me as a new Deputy to endeavour to make any contribution to this debate but there are a few points that I should like to refer to briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Though I missed the Minister's contribution yesterday, I commend him for his initiative in bringing this motion before us.  However, I regret the rather cynical attitudes of Deputies on all sides of the House who vacated this Chamber as soon as the debate was resumed this morning. While everybody seems to acknowledge the need for reform it was disillusioning to me as a new Member to witness the mass exodus from the Chamber this morning.  I am prompted to speak by a mixture of surprise, disappointment, amazement and disillusionment at what <Col N="568" /> I have found during my first few days in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>I am surprised at the cumbersome procedure involved in the Dáil while I regret the way in which new Members are absolutely abandoned.  There is no procedure of initiation for new Members.  Instead, there appears to a be belief that you either know the proceedings or should know them.  I was not even aware that I had to put my name down before I could speak.  I was under the impression that because there were so few Deputies present I merely would have to indicate by way of raising my hand that I wished to speak.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the questions that are asked here during Question Time, for example, the question of when a bog road in Donegal is to be fixed.  This demeans Parliament even further.  It is ludicrous that such questions should be asked in the National Parliament.  These are the sort of questions that I object to being asked at county council and urban council level.  They are merely cosmetic questions for consumption by constituents and they can be answered easily as a result of application to Departments and to Ministers.  Their appearance at national Government level is a sad reflection on us after 60 years of being masters of our own destiny.  I find is saddening to see so many questions of a mundane nature being tabled by eminent politicians.</P>
    <P>Deputy Séamus Brennan in a very fair submission yesterday suggested that the lack of facility for raising questions of national importance was sadly missed in this Assembly.  There are burning questions at present which, as the Deputy said, are topics of conversation not only in every public house but in every private house but not here.  There is the question, too, of law and order.  That is of paramount importance to everybody but we spend our time talking about repairing bog roads in Donegal.  I trust that something will be done in the lifetime of this Dáil to eradicate that problem.</P>
    <P>Another situation that I find disappointing is that although there are 166 Deputies here I do not know where they all are at this moment.  They may be <Col N="569" /> writing letters to constituents or they may be drinking or eating but I suggest that they should be participating in committees. I consider that I have let down my constituents in County Louth by wasting my time here for the past couple of days. While the desire to have more work done in the Dàil is a valid aspiration, many backbenchers are merely wasting their time.  This leaves me with a sense of foreboding for the next three to four years at my lack of contribution as a backbencher. Instead of this waste of time I could be devoting my time to helping people with their many problems.  Therefore, I urge that a more meaningful role be devised for backbenchers.</P>
    <P>There has been reference to the question of journalistic licence.  While I am not yet aware of any breach of procedure in this House, this is an area in which the journalistic profession should be involved.  Coming from a journalistic background myself I view with dismay the increase in the level of scurrility that has come into the profession.  There should be some procedure by which journalists are made to adopt a more responsible attitude particularly in their contributions from this House.  That is a valid point and I should like to see some measures taken to deal with it.  Finally, if these problems are not seen in the proper light and if something is not done very soon I will spend very little time in this Assembly. If I cannot take part in meaningful discussion in the form of committees I shall spend my time in my own constituency helping people with their very definite problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MyraBarry" hpid="Miss M. Barry Miss M. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I heartily welcome this debate on Dáil reform which is a matter of great interest to everybody in the House and outside it.  I regret that Fine Gael are largely conducting this debate on their own.  Due to the parliamentary party meeting this morning Fianna Fáil Members have not been participating in the debate for the past while. This goes to show that there is real need for Dáil reform.  I believe every Deputy knows this and knows that the need must be met quickly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This archaic House seems to suck the <Col N="570" /> blood and soul out of many Deputies and leave them like robots.  Many people looking in from outside ask &ldquo;Why?  What has gone wrong?  Why is the Dáil not a most progressive place?&rdquo;  While it is very easy to be critical from outside the greatest reason why the Dáil is not a more constructive forum and more progressive is because the structures are frustrating, inhibiting and stifling.  There is great need to change the structures and bring about reform.</P>
    <P>Dáil reform is needed for many reasons.  First, we have inheritred rules and procedures from the Westminster Parliament which are 60 years old.  Little has been done to change or up-date these rules.  At the same time our society has developed rapidly and the Dáil is not now in a position to cope with the complexities of life in Ireland.  We should have a tandem evolution, an evolution of society and an evolution of procedures and structures in the Dáil.  These have been sadly neglected.</P>
    <P>My first impression of the Dáil when I was about six or seven was very similar to what it is today.  When I walked into the Gallery there were about three Deputies in the House to my amazement because when you read the papers following a day's sitting you imagine that all the TDs were sitting down eagerly listening to or participating in the debate.  Nothing has changed in all these years.  The Dáil Chamber and the House remain very much the same and there seems to be very little interest in Dáil debates.  It is easier to judge why this is so when one is inside.  Basically, Government Departments draw up Bills and the motion is put to the House.  If you are in Government, you agree; if you are in Opposition, you oppose.  This has led to Government for the sake of Government and opposition for the sake of opposition with very little constructive input or criticism so that you have a situation of cowboys versus Indians. People go on with long, boring filibustering speeches for the sake of press coverage or publicity in the local papers. Little is achieved by this kind of political game playing.  There is no progress when much progress is needed.</P>
    <P>There is a consensus from all sides of <Col N="571" /> the House on some of the steps that could be taken to ensure updating of the law. Illegitimacy is one example.  Four years ago we set up a committee in Young Fine Gael to examine the whole question of illegitimacy.  We drew up a Private Members' Bill which was introduced when I was not in the House by the Fine Gael spokesman for law reform.  That Bill is still on the sideline and it seems nothing is to be done about it.  Yet, there is general consensus across party lines that we should abolish the status of illegitimacy. Why is this not being done?  Too much time is spent on rules and procedures which are so complicated that I feel nobody knows all of them.  The rules for the Chair were last updated in 1967 and Standing Orders were revised in 1974. Surely the rules and regulations need updating and summarising to make them more relevant to the needs of 1983.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the Chair moves on precedent which seems to be everything in this House.  It takes a lot of research time to find a precedent of 70 or 80 years ago.  I suggest that a computer be installed here which when you press a button will show every precedent.  This would save a lot of the hard slogging and research that generally goes on.  Sometimes when we come in here an hour is spent on a point of order and in point scoring and there is no logical debate.  Time slips away unnoticed.  I suggest that Dáil structures be made more relevant to the complexities that have developed.  The Government is like an octopus which encompasses all areas of social and business but the Dáil is not so.  We have become a nation of pressure groups for which I blame Deputies and the Dáil itself.  This is a very sad reflection on Irish life because you have sectional groups each pursuing their own interest.  The only aim of a pressure group is to succeed in their objective.  They do not have to take anybody else into account and their policy is &ldquo;mé féin&rdquo;.  We have developed into a very selfish society.  When pressure groups have so much power the weaker sections of the community suffer.  For example, people under 18 have no vote and, so to speak, have no voice.  There is <Col N="572" /> little relevance for them in the whole political structure because they are not a lobbying group.  Nobody looks after their needs because they have not enough political muscle or clout themselves.  The older people in our society who have made the country what it is are not a homogeneous group.  They are very heterogeneous and do not have the political muscle to organise themselves into pressure groups to achieve their demands. Older people and the weaker sections are often forgotten.  This is a very sad reflection on democracy because every Deputy represents all his constituents.  A pressure group, be they farmers, employers or trade unions, seek only their own interests but a Deputy must stand back and be objective about these interest groups while remembering also the interests of the old and the sick.  Pressure groups are becoming very powerful and often they have more power than Dáil Deputies. During the past three years pressure groups have been more successful than Deputies in achieving their aims.  That might not be a bad thing if we were well off as a nation but there are one million poor people and many are homeless and ill.</P>
    <P>Our form of Government allows large expenditure on such things as Knock Airport, the Talbot deal and the Gregory deal.  Surely this is not democracy.  Precedents have been established by these deals and all members of society are not striving for the same thing.  The attitude of my constituents is that if the people of Mayo can get an airport they should also get something.  Every Deputy is faced with the same problem and these precedents will have an adverse effect on democracy.  Every week people are made redundant and some of them receive very low redundancy payments.  Naturally they ask why they cannot have the same kind of deal as the Talbot workers.</P>
    <P>During the lead up to elections political parties are under pressure to make promises in an effort to secure the maximum number of votes.  Often they do not consider the consequences of these promises. Upon the dissolution of the Dáil it should be decided that no political party will make any promises during the election <Col N="573" /> campaign.  The policies of political parties should be known well in advance so that promises would not be made and projects such as Knock Airport would not have to go ahead.</P>
    <P>This House is autocratic and power is vested largely in the Cabinet.  We have inherited this system from the British. The Government make all major decisions and there is very little input by Government backbenchers or the Opposition. Power should be shared in a more constructive way and this can best be done through the committee system. There are areas of consensus where progress can be made by using this system.  It would certainly make the Dáil more relevant. There should be a committee on youth affairs because young people cannot make their voices heard.  Many of them are idealistic and unselfish and they do not make the same demands on the Government and the political system as are made by other sectional interest groups.</P>
    <P>The practice of bowing to the Ceann Comhairle when entering or leaving the Chamber has also been inherited from the British system.  We can have respect for the Ceann Comhairle without bowing. I always feel stupid when I do so and half the time I do not bow.  The practice should be abolished and we should move with the times.</P>
    <P>Due to the lack of power sharing Deputies become immersed in constituency work.  A Deputy can get some sense of achievement from constituency work, which is not the case when speaking as an Opposition Deputy.  The system is geared towards constituency work but people are now expecting Deputies to do much more legislative work and structures must be changed to enable us to have an influence on legislation.</P>
    <P>A new phenomenon has emerged in that many major decisions are being made by Ministerial order.  We can all recall the major decisions made during the summer recess.  The running of the Dáil and Seanad costs approximately £7 million every year.  What is the point in electing 166 Deputies if the real power is outside this House?  Do we really need a Dáil?  When the then Taoiseach took off <Col N="574" /> to the Blaskets during the summer he left it to a few higher civil servants to announce the expenditure cuts.  That is the kind of autocratic system we are beginning to accept.  A Minister should put his decisions before the House and allow them to be discussed before signing an order.</P>
    <P>Now that we have established the need for reform, how do we go about it?  We must increase the efficiency of the Dáil and of Government.  In any walk of life a person needs basic training, whether he or she is to become a teacher, a carpenter, a cook or a mechanic.  The irony is that a Dáil Deputy is supposed not to need any training.  He or she is a Jack-of-all-trades and a master of none.  When I entered this House the only information I received was a copy of the Constitution and I read on the first page that all powers are vested solely in the Oireachtas.  With hindsight this seems very funny.</P>
    <P>Very little power is vested in the Oireachtas.  There should be an introductory course for new Deputies. They should be told how the Dáil is run and the procedures and privileges in this House. Deputy McGahon is no different from anybody else.  We did not know what to do if we wanted to speak, because nobody told us.  It is a question of finding out as you go along.  When I came to this House first I asked a Deputy to explain procedure to me.  He said he was in this House 11 years but still did not know how things worked.  In my view a person could be in this House 30 years and still not be any wiser about procedure.  There should be information available about legislation at all times to enable Deputies to play a bigger part in the working of this House.</P>
    <P>Research facilities are totally inadequate. Most people have a very good knowledge of their own subject but Deputies are not in a position to know about everybody's job.  To be a Deputy a person needs to be a solicitor, pyschologist, psychiatrist, accountant, social welfare worker and so on, but we are not all those things and never will be.  That is why we need people to do our research. Unfortunately there are only 24 hours a <Col N="575" /> day and if we were to process all the literature and reports which have been gathering dust on the shelves for many years, there would need to be many more.  A great deal of the information contained in those reports is very good but no use is made of it by TDs because they do not have time to read it and, in some cases, they do not even know these reports exist.  A good research assistant could read all these reports and keep the TDs up to date with the relevant information.</P>
    <P>Question Time is the most relevant part of Dáil procedure for about 100 Deputies because that is the only time they feel they make any input to the proceedings or can get information from the Departments.  In my view Question Time should be extended a further 1½ hours each week.  At present only about 30 questions are answered each day and there could be up to 1,000 questions on the Order Paper.  I have often put down a question but did not get an answer for six months when it was no longer relevant. This can be very frustrating.</P>
    <P>There is one positive aspect to written questions.  To an outsider these questions about telephone kiosks, delayed social welfare payments and so on, may not seem very important, but I was here for 18 months before I put down a written question.  I used to spend frustrating hours on the telephone without getting any satisfaction from the Departments. Then I decided to put down a written question.  Within a week I had my reply from the Minister.  The excuse given by the Department of Social Welfare when asked about delays in payments was that the Department was becoming more computerised.  The computers have been installed for two years but there are still many problems.  If the Department was more efficiently run there would not be a need for so many written questions.  I thought Deputy Yates's suggestion that written questions be put down during the recess was a very good one.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of talk about the number of sittings of this House, and still the country has kept going.  Last session the Dáil sat five-and-a-half <Col N="576" /> days.  That is a sad reflection on the need for a Dáil.  A Dublin Deputy has more advantages than a rural Deputy.  I suggest that the Dáil meets earlier each day.  There is no reason why it should not start at 9 a.m. or 9.30 a.m.  That would mean another 90 minutes for debating. Rural Deputies cannot understand why this House does not sit until 9 p.m.  In recent years I noticed that Dublin Deputies' demands were accepted while rural Deputies were left out in the cold.  On Tuesdays the Dáil starts at 2.30 p.m. and finishes at 8.30 p.m.; on Wednesday it starts at 10.30 a.m. and finishes at 8.30 p.m. and on Thursday it starts at 10.30 finishing at 5 p.m.  That is not making the maximum use of Deputies' time.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the summer recesses are too long.  A period of three months is uncalled for; two months would be adequate. In recent years the Taoiseach of the day decided we should take an extra few weeks' holidays.  Last Christmas we had a long holiday but the Christmas before that we had three months' holidays. The Ceann Comhairle should say how often Deputies should sit, not the Taoiseach of the day.  Sometimes it suits the Taoiseach to stay out of the House because once he is out of the House he is not answerable to anyone.  It is easy to implement a decision by way of Ministerial order.  That will not get as much attention from the Press as it would if it was decided in the Dáil and recent Taoisigh seemed to realise this.</P>
    <P>Our present voting system is another time-wasting device.  A Deputy might come to this House at 3 p.m. and leave after 4 p.m. having voted but once.  It does not take much imagination to come up with a more efficient and quicker way of voting.  Different devices are used in America and European countries.  If we had an electronic voting system it could save up to half an hour of Dáil time each day.  We could have the card system or the system where we press a button to vote, but either system would need security and safety devices.  There is no reason why this could not be done.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about introducing radio and television to the Dáil. That would improve the situation.  If all <Col N="577" /> the Deputies knew that a television camera would be operating in the Chamber there would be a full House in a couple of seconds.  That is the reality of the situation and it would not have to be a special day such as budget day or the day of the election of a new Taoiseach.  That would be the cheapest way of ensuring a full attendance.</P>
    <P>The facilities in this House are absolutely atrocious and are certainly not conducive to TDs' carrying out their business as legislators.  Rooms are packed with Deputies, secretaries, typewriters, phones.  To concentrate in such conditions is virtually impossible for the vast majority.  Even on the minimum requirements for office conditions, this House would fail on a number of counts &mdash; space, noise level and so forth.  It has been proved that the environment in which one works has a direct effect on one's output, but Dáil Éireann does not seem to have recognised this fact.  I envy people working in offices in the Departments, semi-State bodies and private companies.  These offices are of an extremely high quality.  Nowhere else are there such bad conditions as in this House.</P>
    <P>The committee system could solve many problems.  It would recognise the consensus approach, which is not so at present.  It is simply Government versus Opposition.  We all know that strong Government and strong Opposition are needed but opposition for opposition's sake is not the way towards progress.  Our people are looking to us for that progress and we are very sadly falling down on our responsibilities by not providing the necessary reform of legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with my colleague, Deputy Barry, in congratulating Minister Bruton on bringing forward this debate on Dáil reform.  Equally, I compliment Deputy Barry for her fine, wide-ranging contribution.  I have no doubt that some of the points which I shall make will duplicate what she has put forward, but that is the whole point of this debate.  It is a healthy debate.  One could almost call it a public examination of conscience, a public confession of what we are about, <Col N="578" /> of what has been done wrong, or what we could do to improve the system and make it more relevant to present Irish society.</P>
      <P>The Standing Orders, with which I was presented along with a copy of the Constitution when I came in here, bear the date 1974.  The last listed amendment is 1974.  However, there have been subsequent amendments, principally one to change the title of Parliamentary Secretary to Minister of State.  There also have been amendments brought in by way of Resolutions to the House.  The fact that I have had to gather all this information is an indictment of the inadequacies of the present system, merely on the technicalities of trying to find out what it is all about, when first we come in here.  On 11 June 1981 I was elected to this House for the first time and on 12 June I received a telephone call from a new constituent who asked about the situation concerning fair rents.  I replied, &ldquo;Quite frankly, I cannot tell you.&rdquo;  I tell that story to illustrate that the public perception is that at 12 noon on the day of a TD's election a vast body of people assume that automatically he or she knows pretty well everything that is going on regarding legislation and the running of the country. The plain truth is that they do not.  As Deputy Barry says, it is like any other calling.  To be a doctor, lawyer, plumber or carpenter one serves one's apprenticeship, receives a third level education, trains oneself for that vocation.  Politicians have much to answer for regarding some of the inadequacies and relevancies of the present system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us examine how most of us come to be elected to this House.  One way is through local authorities.  Many have become TDs through involvement in county councils and then progressing to becoming candidates in general elections. A proportion of Deputies come into the House with a good experience of local authority matters but otherwise, unless they happen to be trained lawyers and know something about legislation, or trained accountants or economists, generally speaking their knowledge of how the country is run is very limited.  I say that with the greatest respect to us all.  It is a fact that there is no course which <Col N="579" /> trains people to be practical politicians. One can take out a degree in political science but that is not relevant to our work here.  It might make one more used to researching matters but it does not help in dealing with the practical problems of being a Deputy and representing one's constituents and taking part in the whole legislative process.</P>
    <P>The public image of the Dáil is very important.  It is vital that the people who elect us see us as having some relevancy to the system and to the country today. At present most do not see us as having any relevance.  If someone asks to come into the Dáil, I usually recommend Question Time or Order of Business time, which are the most lively sessions.  At those times there may be some furore or excitement.  Generally speaking, the only time one sees a full press gallery is at Question Time, particularly with questions to the Taoiseach and when something interesting is raised by way of Private Notice Question.  Most of the time &mdash; and the present is no exception &mdash; there is one learned friend in the press gallery.  The public do not know that the reports in the papers are generally based on questions and written answers to questions. It is embarrassing to have to explain that one was not in the House when a particular matter was being discussed. People think that one is not working. The usual comment when the Dáil is about to resume is, &ldquo;I see that you are going back to work tomorrow&rdquo;, as if we had been doing nothing from the time the Dáil adjourned until the next session. That is an indictment of us politicians.  It is important to increase the public's perception about our job and its relevance. Anybody who knows politicians personally appreciates that they do a little more work than is apparent from just coming in here for 60 or 70 days each year.  Their days start as early as 8.30 and finish as late as midnight throughout the year. During the summer, perhaps, when pressure groups and associations are on holidays, politicians get a break.</P>
    <P>We appreciate that is the job we took on and most of us get satisfaction from it and a feeling that we are contributing <Col N="580" /> something.  It would be a good idea, however, to enlighten the public as to what we are doing so that people will have a hightened awareness of it.  Reform is needed right throughout the system and I suggest that it could begin with the different parties from which nearly all Deputies are drawn.  There is a need for reform within those parties so that when candidates are being selected they will have acquired some expertise or knowledge of the system, of the work involved in being Deputies.  Branches and cumainn should be engaged in explaining to their members the political structures and all relevant facts appertaining to Deputies' work in and outside the House. In other words, there should be more knowledge at grassroots level.</P>
    <P>During visits and holidays abroad I have taken the opportunity to visit other parliaments to learn how they work and to see the facilities they have for their members.  In Dáil Éireann when we bring in visitors we begin by taking them on a quick run around and giving them a short history of Leinster House.  I am afraid that the accoustics in this House are not what they should be and therefore voices from the House itself do not carry to the Gallery.  We should improve that.  We should think in terms of modern technology. We should have some kind of film prepared on the history of Leinster House and of the Dáil since the State was founded.  We should have a small room available for visitors where we can show them video recordings of the film.  I suggest that the booklet on Leinster House, which has not been reviewed for many years, should be brought up to date. Through all this reform we would give visitors a better idea of what political life is all about and at the same time save the time and the trouble of the ushers.</P>
    <P>Many of us came in here with very little knowledge of parliamentary life.  When I was elected in June 1981 I had no idea, not having legal training, of how Bills were prepared.  Twenty-two new Deputies came in here at that time and all of us together formed a strong lobby and accordingly we got a useful briefing by members of the staff.  Even now we find it impossible to know all the Standing <Col N="581" /> Orders, and I am sure even the best of our Ceann Comhairles did not know all the rules and regulations in that book.  I still find it difficult to separate the different Stages of Bills because unfortunately the briefing we were given when first elected did not imprint itself indelibly in our minds.</P>
    <P>Because of the unstable political life of the past 18 months our committee system did not get off the ground in any Dáil session since.  I have served on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Joint Committee on Development Co-operation, but we had only two meetings and they dealt mainly with procedure. Therefore, new Deputies who were elected 18 months ago, and those who came in last February and November, have been finding it very difficult to appreciate what goes on.  We come in here to listen to First Stages of Bills and sometimes Second Stages and we get in only if we are lucky because more experienced Members contribute more often.  If we could arrange that committees would be set up immediately on the formation of a new Government we would be able to gain experience from the workings of those committees where there is not the same tearing of each other apart that we get in the House itself when we are sometimes engaged in playing to the media.  In committees, where there is not the same political crossfire, we would be able to gain experience and knowledge. It is for that reason that I suggest that we do not leave the formation of Standing Committees until four or five months after the new Dáil has been elected.</P>

      <P>Regulations were made on 26 May 1981, governing the operation of the vehicle testing scheme in respect of certain commercial vehicles.  Under these regulations the operation of the scheme is devolved, under my general direction, to local authorities who are motor vehicle licensing authorities.  The testing of vehicles under the scheme is carried out by testers appointed by the local authorities.  When a vehicle has passed a test the tester issues a statement to that effect.  The vehicle owner must then make application to the local authority for the issue to him of a certificate of roadworthiness.</P>

      <P>Implementation of the Litter Act, 1982, does not in fact require large scale additional expenditure.  Local authorities already spend considerably, and employ workforces, on street cleaning and waste collection and disposal and in some cases on publicity and other campaigns. Over the years various measures have been taken to prevent and control litter using the powers then available. The Act strengthens the powers to control litter and related offences and this should lead to a reduction in these problems and in the need for local authority spending on cleaning-up operations.</P>
      <P>Under the Litter Regulations, 1982, moneys accruing to local authorities under the Act &mdash; for example from fines-on-the-spot or from charges &mdash; are available to them as an offset against costs involved.

      <P>In these circumstances I do not believe that it is unreasonable to expect local authorities to meet the modest expenditure that implementation of the Act involves.

      <P>I am aware that it is in a deplorable condition.  I have received representations from a number of Labour <Col N="587" /> councillors in the area.  I can tell the Deputy that the transcript of the proceedings of the public hearing was sent to the inspector who held the inquiry on 13 January 1983 and his report is awaited.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will establish <Col N="588" /> a committee to re-assess the whole question of house improvement grants with particular reference to clauses which militate against rural areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>A review of the house improvement grants scheme is not at present contemplated. The scheme, which was introduced in October 1981 and expanded to include an additional category of works in April 1982, is of general application throughout the country.  There are therefore, no clauses which militate against rural areas as suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of applicants for house improvement grants were refused because they had commenced work prior to the date outlined when the scheme commenced and in view of the fact that very few people are involved will the Minister consider incorporating such people under the terms of the scheme?  I am sure the Minister is aware that many people in rural areas did not see the advertisements in the national newspapers outlining details of the scheme and this led to some applications being rejected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy.  My information is that already 2,000 applications have been refused or turned down on grounds such as the Deputy referred to.  I understand that initially upwards of 30 per cent of the applications received by the Department for such grants were rejected on the grounds that work had started before the inspector arrived on the site.  In those circumstances, and in view of the fact that at least three of my predecessors held the line in regard to relaxation of the terms of the scheme because a change would create a precedent, I am not prepared to accept the Deputy's proposal.  I am aware of the difficulties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the grant in 1972 was £900 is it not reasonable for the Minister, 11 years later, to consider increasing it?  The grant is £1,000 but since it was increased to that figure inflation and building costs have increased.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>On the surface, what the Deputy says appears to have some validity but if one looks at the effect the grant had on the price of housing one would see that in real terms the benefit did not go to the house purchaser.  The whole idea behind the scheme was to give first time purchasers of houses direct financial assistance.  I suggest that the £3,000 mortgage subsidy scheme introduced by the Deputy's party is a more effective way of meeting the social requirement the Deputy has identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should bear in mind that many elderly people cannot be considered for the latter scheme because a prerequisite of it is that they must have negotiated a loan.  That clause militates against such people. Obviously there is an imbalance in the system.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 15 together.</P>
      <P>In relation to the general question, there is provision under the current scheme of house improvement grants for the payment of a grant up to £600 in respect of the carrying out of major necessary works to the basic fabric of a house, subject to the conditions of the scheme being fulfilled in particular cases. An application for such a grant arising from storm damage would be considered on its merits.</P>
      <P>As regards the particular case raised by the Deputy, a grant could not be allowed because, contrary to a qualifying condition of the scheme, the work had commenced before an inspection of the house was carried out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like the Minister to reconsider the terms of his reply.  Will the Minister agree it is unfair where a person of little means suffers storm damage to a house and rain comes through the roof that a reconstruction grant is not paid although it would be imperative to arrange for immediate repairs to be carried out?  How can people be expected to continue to live in a house with the rain coming through the roof?  Will the Minister agree that it is most unreasonable of his Department to expect a person in <Col N="592" /> such circumstances to wait up to five weeks, with the rain coming in, for an inspector to arrive?  I am sure the Minister will agree that that is ludicrous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  The scheme is not designed to meet the storm damage conditions the Deputy has described, particularly in regard to houses that are not insured.  Approximately 70 per cent of all homes have household insurance which would protect them in such circumstances but it is in the interest of the other 30 per cent who are not so protected, and our interest, to protect our housing stock with some type of arrangement.  If the Deputy has any specific suggestion I will consider it.  It may be possible to have some system of certification through the Garda that the damage existed and that the work had to start immediately.  I am open to suggestions.  The scheme as presently designed does not address itself to the problem the Deputy has identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister consider making a change in arrangements to have emergency cases considered as a priority? The Minister should be given some discretion in regard to the payment of grants for emergency cases such as those I outlined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the immediate steps he proposes to take to deal with the crisis in the building industry as recently outlined by the trade unions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>The building industry depends on two basic elements to promote activity, namely, public expenditure and private sector investment.  Public investment in the industry in 1982 was about 70 per cent of total investment &mdash; a much higher proportion than normal. Between 1979 and 1981, private sector investment fell by over 30 per cent.  On the basis of these figures and, given the general state of the economy and the limitations on public expenditure generally, it is inevitable that the path to an upswing in the industry must come mainly through increased private sector investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that I had a most fruitful meeting with representatives of the industry on 17 January.  We had broad-ranging discussions covering present trends and the difficulties facing <Col N="598" /> the different sectors which go to make up the industry.  Matters dealt with included public capital expenditure, unemployment, house construction, incentives for private investment, taxation and the general outlook for the immediate, medium-term and longer-term futures.  I am now giving careful consideration, in conjunction with my colleagues in Government, to the points put forward at the meeting.</P>
    <P>I am very much aware of the central importance of the industry in the economy, particularly in relation to employment.  While I am not in a position to indicate the precise level of Government support for the industry this year, Deputies may be assured that my aim will be to create a positive and supportive environment for the industry which will help to generate the stability and confidence necessary to attract private investment. In particular, I will be seeking to remove, or at least lessen the effects of existing obstacles and constraints affecting the industry by streamlining control procedures, promoting efficiency and cost effectiveness and maximising the spin-off effects of construction activity.</P>
    <P>I also have in mind the setting up of a broadly-based council which would be representative of the different interests involved in the industry and would provide a regular forum for ventilating issues affecting the industry.  The council would operate within the context of the overall planning framework envisaged in the Joint Programme for Government.</P>
    <P>I might make one final point.  The political uncertainty of recent years has not helped the industry.  I am satisfied that the years of stability and continuity which lie ahead will create a climate which will restore confidence in the industry and promote private investment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the thousands of persons formerly employed in the building industry who now unhappily find themselves unemployed, will not take any great joy from his statement?  Does he agree that because of the crisis in employment in the building industry and output in that <Col N="599" /> industry, there is a need for immediate action and not vague promises of efficiency in the future and other waffle such as is contained in the Minister's reply? Unless there is immediate action and an indication of what steps the Government propose to take, the prospects for employment in the building industry do not seem to be very bright.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is being a little optimistic if he expects me to take all the blame for the crisis in the building industry.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 30 and 31 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme for Government includes an aim to raise housing output towards 30,000 houses a year.  While no specific time scale was laid down in the programme, I am concerned that there should be no avoidable delay in making <Col N="600" /> progress towards the achievement of this target.</P>
    <P>Subject to the constraints necessarily imposed by the overall financial situation and the limitations on public expenditure generally, I will be endeavouring to secure as high a level of activity as possible on the local authority housing construction programme.  As final consideration of the 1983 Estimates has yet to be completed, I cannot, at this stage, give precise details of the number of local authority housing starts expected this year.</P>
    <P>Output in the private housing sector is, of course, affected by the general economic situation and in particular by the level of demand.  In so far as demand is influenced by the availability and price of mortgage finance, my priority will be to ensure as far as practicable that there is an adequate supply of such finance available at reasonable interest rates.  In this regard, building societies are at present accepting loan applications on a more open basis than for some considerable time; local authorities are similarly in a position to meet the demands for loans being made on them and the Housing Finance Agency &mdash; which has had a successful initial bond issue and which can be the means of making private house purchase possible for additional categories of persons &mdash; is now in full business.</P>
    <P>Apart from the question of mortgage finance, following my meeting with representatives of the building industry on 17 January, I am having a special examination carried out with a view to creating an environment conducive to private house building by, for example, easing constraints in regard to matters such as land costs, bridging finance and planning and by-law controls, which otherwise might have a disincentive effect in regard to private sector investment and private house purchase.</P>

      <P>On 21 December 1982, my Department sought applications from all housing authorities for capital allocations to finance on-going commitments on their 1983 housing programmes, including the provision of rural houses.  Applications received are being examined in my Department at present and a decision on the initial allocations will be made by me when the examination of claims has been completed.</P>
      <P>The question of the acceptance by Donegal County Council of further tenders for rural houses is primarily a matter for the council themselves, having regard to the amount of capital available for their housing programme and provided that the normal procedures governing the provision of local authority houses are complied with.</P>

No State has alone declared itself a nuclear weapon-free zone.</P>
      <P>I might add, in regard to nuclear weapon-free zones, that aside from the special case of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 which prohibits measures of a military nature in the Antarctic, the only nuclear weapon-free zone to be created by an international agreement is that established for Latin America by the 1967 Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America.</P>

      <P>The cost over-run came to the notice of my Department in August 1982. At that stage the allocation of £1.276 million included in the 1982 Estimates, which was intended to finance the construction of the building to completion, had been almost entirely expended and a considerable amount of work still remained to be carried out.</P>
      <P>Investigations have been carried out and a preliminary report available to me indicates that among the immediate factors which contributed to the over-run by the institute were inaccurate assessment of costs, ineffective liaison between the institute and the building contractor and lack of cost control procedures.</P>
      <P>I propose to have a further in-depth inquiry carried out but this will take some little time to complete.  I share the Deputy's concern and I intend to make a detailed statement on the matter when the investigation has been completed.</P>
      <P>With regard to architects' fees, the information which I have is that the fees already paid to the architect, in relation to the total cost of the project, were in accordance with the appropriate standard scale.</P>
      <P>In the past year or so, my Department have intensified the monitoring of expenditure by State bodies generally.  I am satisfied that this process should be further intensified and I am considering the areas in which specialised resources available to my Department need to be strengthened for this purpose.</P>

      <P>I would like to ask the Minister two questions.  In view of the fact that my question was originally put down to the Minister for Finance, would the Minister bring this very gross over-run to the attention of his colleague in the Department of Finance?  I would like to invite the Minister to agree with me that no private enterprise about which a history like this could be written would survive <Col N="608" /> for a day in the cold wind of competition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to both questions is yes.  I am very concerned about this matter.  I have been concerned in other capacities with the general question of over-run on State projects of this kind where the estimates have been exceeded for reasons which would not be normal in commercial practice.  It is a matter of considerable worry to me that this has happened on a few occasions in respect of bodies for which I am now responsible.  I take a very serious view of the matter and I am asking my Minister of State, Deputy E. Collins, to look specifically at the circumstances of this case which is the subject of Deputy Kelly's question.  He will be able to give it the time and attention which, unfortunately, through other commitments, I am not able to do at present.</P>

      <P>Ireland has a well developed craft industry employing 2,500 people in full-time craft production, embracing pottery, rural crafts, gold and silver work, jewellery, musical instruments and hand-weaving.  In 1982 the Industrial Development Authority and the Shannon Free Airport Development Company approved grant aid for a total of 110 craft projects, with the potential to create over 400 jobs.</P>
      <P>The strength of the craft industry is evidenced by the achievement of £2.18 million sales of craft products at the recent Crafts Trade Fair in the RDS.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As part of the strategy to develop the industry craft centres have been provided by the IDA at Marley Park and Powers-court Townhouse in Dublin; Strokestown, County Roscommon; Roundstone, County Galway and by SFADCo <Col N="609" /> at Ballycasey, County Clare.  Further craft centres are being developed by the IDA in Donegal town, Pearse Street in Dublin and at the Shandon Butter Exchange in Cork.</P>
    <P>In addition, the Crafts Council of Ireland, which is representative of craft interests and receives an annual subvention from the Exchequer, has established a post-graduate training centre at Kilworth, County Cork.  This centre has been providing experience both in craft and business skills with AnCO training grant assistance for a number of graduates from the Cork Regional Technical College and the National College of Art and Design since January 1981.</P>

However, I would be happy to furnish the information to the Deputy, either by means of a letter or in response to a further question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>In its Industrial Plan 1978-1982, the Industrial Development Authority set a target of 1,200 new grant aided jobs for County Laois and 1,800 for County Offaly.  In the first four years of the plan &mdash; Janaury 1978 to January 1982 &mdash; 1,263 jobs were created in County Laois and 989 in County Offaly, representing 105 per cent of the target for County Laois and 55 per cent for County Offaly.</P>
      <P>In addition, during the past two years, a number of new or expanding projects were secured for these two counties.  A substantial proportion of the associated jobs have yet to be provided.</P>
      <P>During 1980, the Shannon Free Airport Development Company's role in the promotion of small indigenous industry was extended to the area of west and south-west Offaly.  This area has been particularly badly affected by a lack of industrial development.  Since then SFADCo has approved for grant assistance 25 small industry projects with the potential to create 250 jobs.</P>
      <P>At present 70 acres of industrial land are available for development at five locations throughout County Laois and in County Offaly the IDA have five sites totalling 115 acres.  In County Laois the IDA have over 75,000 sq. ft. of factory space at Portlaoise, Mountrath and Rathdowney and in County Offaly they have over 90,000 sq. ft. available at Tullamore, Edenderry, Clara and Birr.  These facilities are being vigorously promoted by the IDA for suitable industrial projects.</P>

There are over 300 people unemployed in the town of Cahir. Could the Minister throw any light on the rumour that a very noted firm, similar to Weatherglaze, are prepared to buy the Cahir plant but cannot do so because the receiver want the Dublin and Cahir <Col N="612" /> plants disposed of together?  Will the Minister see if something could be done? The workers in the Cahir factory were shocked at the announcement of the closure of the unit in Cahir.  The management of the factory and everyone concerned gave them the highest praise.  The output of the factory as compared with the sister factory in Dublin was something of which the workers in Cahir were proud.  There was very little absenteeism.

      <P>I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on what he has just said.  I have indicated that discussions are taking place on the matter at the moment and anything I might say here would run the risk of not being helpful.  I can assure the Deputy that his concern in the matter will be conveyed to the appropriate quarter.  He referred to the general employment situation in Cahir.  There has been a significant increase in unemployment in the Cahir area.  On 2 January 1981 unemployment as per the live register was 312.  That rose by 31 December 1981 to 401 and at 31 December 1982 it was 618.  Interestingly enough, there has been an increase in employment as well.  I am not talking of Cahir specifically but of a group of towns, including Cahir, Cashel, Clonmel, Tipperary and Carrick-on-Suir which I appreciate is a larger area than the Cahir area.  The net changes in job numbers, taking losses as against gains, would indicate that there was a net gain in 1980 in the number employed of 205, in 1981 the number was 202 and the provisional estimate for 1982 is 89 persons.  What is happening is that the population of young people seeking employment is increasing at a faster rate than the number of jobs being created.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 48 and 49 together.</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Authority set a target of 600 new jobs in grant-aided manufacturing industry for the town group Dungarvan, Cappoquin, Lismore and Tallow in its Industrial Plan 1978-82.  Six hundred and twenty-five actual jobs were created in the first four years of the plan.  These gains have been more than offset by job losses, particularly in the traditional industries.</P>
      <P>In recent years a number of major projects and expansions have been secured for the west Waterford area.  In Dungarvan, Stafford Miller (Ireland) Ltd., a subsidiary of the Block Drug Company, US, is at present recruiting its workforce.  The company plan to employ 131 people at full production.  Discussions are continuing between the IDA and Rumson Chemicals concerning the implementation of a project with an employment potential of 130 people in Dungarvan.  In Tallow, the former Jyden project, which went into receivership in late 1982, has been taken over by Kingsford Industries who will maintain the existing 90 jobs and who plan to provide a further 50 jobs within the next 18 months.</P>
      <P>In addition, the IDA are continuing to promote their 10,000 sq. ft. factory in Cappoquin, the two 3,000 sq. ft. factory units in Dungarvan and their land bank of over 70 acres in west Waterford, together with the 11.5 acres industrial park provided by Dungarvan Urban District Council.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy may be aware, the previous Coalition Government had this matter before them.  They were under some pressure to nationalise the Clondalkin Paper Mills but they did not make any such decision despite the pressure they were under at that time.  In recent days I met a delegation arranged by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who expressed their concern in the matter. I indicated to them, as I have indicated to the Deputy, that the incoming Government must consider the matter in the light of all the circumstances and come to a decision.  I realise that the workers concerned have been waiting quite a time for a definitive answer on a matter which undoubtedly is of concern to their future and the future of their families.  I appreciate that delay in this matter should be as minimal as possible and I will use all my endeavours to have this matter brought to Government and decided on at an early date.

      <P>Before Question Time I was talking about image-building and the improvement of the image of this Parliament with regard to the perception that the public have of us here.  Even this debate, which is perhaps a public wearing of sackcloth and ashes, the showing up of where we as politicians have fallen down on the job and where the structures have fallen down, in itself is part of an improvement in giving a better perception of what we are doing here.  We have just gone through an hour of Question Time.  For most Deputies, certainly for new Deputies who have come in here in the past 18 months or two years, Question Time was about the only time they saw <Col N="633" /> any relevance to what was going on outside and to what they hoped they might be able to achieve in here.  I am a member of a local authority who have standing orders under which we may table a limited number of questions for our county council meetings.  Generally speaking those questions relate to telephone boxes, footpaths and issues very local in our constituencies.  I was under the impression that perhaps Question Time in the Dáil would relate to trying to elicit information from Ministers as to what policies they hoped to pursue in Government, what policies they said they would pursue and were not pursuing, and generally matters dealing with the Legislature. Question Time deals almost exclusively, certainly 75 per cent of the time, with matters which are grist to the mill of our journalists and of satirical and Mike Murphy type programmes which feature plenty of discussion about telephone boxes on the furthest peninsulas of the island, drainage schemes etc. and the answers produce certain merriment. Question Time could be used much more productively in following the progress of government and bringing about changes in legislation.  However, it would be naive of me to say that we should forbid questions of the nature that we are getting now as long as the system exists in which Deputies find it so difficult to get that information from the various public service Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In seeking Dáil reform we must also look at reform further back along the line at the grassroots level of political parties so that people coming into politics are better trained and equipped for the job. Equally when talking about Dáil reform we must talk about reform of the public service and the mechanisms whereby those people elected to represent constituencies can get the information they need, and so that the public themselves can get the information they need, thus ensuring that Deputies do not spend their whole political careers sitting at clinics listening to problems which the people themselves should be able to tackle and solve.  Unfortunately, almost 80 per cent of the time of most Dáil representatives here is spent in dealing with constituency <Col N="634" /> work.  That is a sad reflection on our whole parliamentary system.  Once elected to the national Parliament one should be able to address oneself to the changing, amending and preparation of policy and legislation.  That is what the national Parliament should be about. Most of us spend a great deal of our time dealing with problems for our constituents because they themselves cannot do it.  It is not because they do not want to but because after making 20 phone calls they become so frustrated that they go to their public representative in the hope that the use of his name might get them the information they seek.  Therefore, we must build into Dáil reform, reform of the public service and the structures whereby information can be got by the general public and by Dáil Deputies.  If my North County colleague, the Minister for the Public Service, gets an opportunity to contribute on this debate he might address himself to areas of reform in the public service which would make the jobs of Dáil Deputies easier so that they can have more time to deal with the job they came here to do.</P>
    <P>More use could be made of written answers to Dáil questions.  In that way we could get through more questions.  Sometimes the answer in written form is just as satisfactory as being given in public and the media will utilise written answers to questions as they will use the oral answers.  There is no point in raising the level &mdash; I use the word advisedly &mdash; of the questions put down for answer here unless we raise equally the availability of the information we seek here at the public service level.</P>
    <P>Politicians themselves must take a share of the blame for many of the problems we have about the lack of image of this Parliament.  I came in here in June 1981 and a budget was put through in July.  Then we spent weeks and weeks of debate discussing that budget that was long since gone.  All the necessary mechanisms had been put through to implement the various duties, raises in prices and changes in social welfare payments, yet we went on for weeks debating that budget.  I put my name down to contribute to it and I asked what one should talk <Col N="635" /> about.  An old hand here in the House told me to use it as a forum to say anything that I wanted to say, to start at A and work through to Z and speak about anything.  That may have certain merit in allowing new Deputies to give an airing to some things that they would like to air, but in the order of things it is not a very constructive way to run our country, to spend weeks after a budget and Finance Bill have been gone through debating something that none of us can change. That change put forward by Minister Bruton should be brought about as quickly as possible whereby the Estimates and the financial situation are discussed before the final decisions are taken so that at least the backbenchers feel that somebody down there or up there is listening to what they have to say and that some of their ideas and thoughts can be put into the final frame of the budget and the Estimates.  I hope that that area of change will come about very quickly.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the Dáil committee system and the fact that standing committees on various topics that were to come up have not got off the ground in the 18 months that I was here.  I managed to serve only on the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and except for two meetings I did not manage to serve on any committee that got down to talking about policy.  That was a pity.  I hope that these committees can be set up very quickly.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have raised the question of radio and television coverage of debates here.  I think that that is long overdue.  It may be in one way a surprise to the public to hear what goes on in here.  This coverage must have a good effect on the standard of our debating. We must all be conscious of what we are saying, more so when it is to be broadcast on radio.  I am not saying that radio coverage of what goes on here will comprise fantastic listening and that people will be sitting with their ears glued to their radios to hear every golden syllable that drops out of our mouths, but it would serve the purpose of allowing the public to know what is going on here and would heighten <Col N="636" /> their awareness that matters being discussed here effect them, contrary to our image at the moment of doing nothing in here except talking about telephone boxes, drainage schemes and so on.  The radio coverage of committees should also be considered because of the good non-party type of work that they do.  The general public are becoming tired of the image that everything we do is based on one party or another and that never the twain shall meet.</P>
    <P>There are many areas, particularly in relation to social reform and social policy, where there is no disagreement in the House.  It is important that the public realise that there are areas where there is a lot of agreement on improvements and reform.  I believe if the committee system was carried by radio that it would help people to realise that we were not all at each other's throats and are not bringing about changes principally because I am Fine Gael and somebody else is Fianna Fáil, that I do not want to see an improvement coming in because it was put forward by a Fianna Fáil Member or <i>vice versa.</i>  It is important that we are seen to have areas of consensus, that those areas of consensus can be brought forward to those committees and put into our Legislature for the betterment of the country.  I join with the other Deputies who have called for radio coverage of what goes on here.</P>
    <P>With regard to the setting up of a committee system to deal with legislation we will have to be realistic about this.  I have heard a number of people, in the House and outside it, informally saying that we should extend the sitting time to an extra day in the week and perhaps that extra day, Friday, could be used to have meetings of committees to process legislation. Let us be realistic.  A very high percentage of Deputies travel many miles up here for three days of the week and their constituency work necessitates that they be in their constituencies for at least two or three days a week.  They and their families must insist on having some time together.</P>
    <P>My worry about bringing in committees that would meet primarily on Fridays is that rural Deputies eventually could <Col N="637" /> play no part in those committees because they would find themselves leaving here on Thursday evenings to attend their clinics and to attend all their meetings, that are held on Fridays and Saturdays, and those committees would be composed of Dublin city and Dublin county based Deputies or the counties just surrounding Dublin.  That would be a very one-sided type of committee to deal with legislation and would not be good.</P>
    <P>Anybody looking at setting up committees must realise that just setting up committees to sit on Fridays would not meet the purpose behind setting up those committees.  I urge that we look at this very carefully before we decide to set another day aside for parliamentary business: that there would not be any divisions on that day, there would be no whip on Deputies to be here and the committees would fall down.  I gather in 1974 and 1975, when committees were set up to deal with various legislation, that the attendance was not always very good.  It is difficult, until we change some of the other structures, for Deputies to put the kind of time they would like into those committees.</P>
    <P>We are talking about Dáil reform but those of us who are preaching about it must also accept that it is in our hands to bring about that Dáil reform.  We are all crying that we do not get enough time to talk about nitty-gritty things of policy formation but it is in our hands to give ourselves the time to do that, to give ourselves the power to do that and to set up structures to allow us to do that.  We must not leave ourselves open to the criticisms involved in the old phrase: &ldquo;Me think you doth protest too much&rdquo;.  We can protest and protest.  I hope when we set up some new structures in the House that we will take on the responsibility that those new structures will put on us and take part in all these new committees, try to change our role so that we will be able to utilise research facilities, which are not very adequate at the moment.  A number of us &mdash; I am sure many of those on the other side of the House were also asked &mdash; were asked if we would like to take a research assistant, some person coming from America. <Col N="638" /> When I was asked about it I said I was not really organised enough to know enough about what what going on here to make much use of a research assistant. That was an indictment of myself but I believe it was also an indictment of the 18 months I have been in here that I have not managed to take part in the preparation of any legislation.  I am not learned enough to know about the whole system to be able to utilise the services of a research assistant, to be able to give that person work and tell that person to go off and research this or that for me.  I had to say that I needed to do the research myself so I could learn what I am about in here.</P>
    <P>We are now having this open debate. I hope the Minister for Industry and Energy will gather all the suggestions and the complaints that have been made across the House by the various Deputies, some with far more experience than I have.  Perhaps the newer Deputies can look at the matter with a fresh mind and see perhaps some of the mistakes that are there easier than some people who have been here for many years.  I hope all those will be compiled so that we can see the immediate effects of this debate, that it will not be just another talking shop, something prepared and put into a report which is lodged in the Library to gather dust there until the next session when somebody else will come in and say that we should have a debate on Dáil reform. I hope we will be able to follow the momentum created by the wisdom of having this debate, bring about really legitimate changes that will see a change in our system, to make our role more meaningful here to ourselves and the general public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Several speakers in the debate, including Deputy Owen, have drawn attention to the undeniable fact that a large proportion of the time of nearly all Members of the House is devoted to what is broadly called constituency work and Members have found themselves unable to give the time or attention that is required to the legislative or committee work that Deputy Owen and others have described.  That is a perfectly <Col N="639" /> accurate statement but we have to face the fact that in the circumstances in which the Members of the House are elected we will never get away from that problem if we do not make some radical changes.</P>
      <P>One of the major problems of this Parliament is that its members are elected in multi-seat constituencies by single transferable vote.  One is always under considerable pressure or potential pressure in one constituency.  In electoral terms one responds to that by meeting non-legislative needs, to put it at its highest.  The phrase I use covers a multitude.  It is tiresome, repetitive and not very stimulating but still it is taken for granted.  I often think that it is a wonder that at times any legislative work can be carried on here because of those kinds of pressures. It is very few people who can ignore them.  Some good men who sought to ignore them in the House are no longer in the House as a result of the exercise by them of that choice.  This is a very great pity.  What can we do about that? I do not believe there is a lot we can do about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only two unsuccessful referenda held in this country were to get rid of proportional representation.  That failed and I doubt if any Government will be sufficiently foolhardy at any time in the future to try it again.  Of course we could retain proportional representation with single-seat constituencies.  In 1968 the then Deputy Norton proposed that system as an amendment to what was the second of the referenda being promoted at that time but the Government of the day and the House rejected the proposal. However, that sort of proposal could be brought forward again.  There are arguments for it and possibly some against it also.  There is a third alternative that has never been considered seriously, that is, some form of list system whereby PR could be retained but because the condidates would be on a list they would not be under the same pressure in a constituency and could devote a very much higher proportion of their time to parliamentary work as opposed to the provision of social services and advice bureaux. <Col N="640" /> In that way perhaps we could bring the situation of Members of this Parliament more on to a level that is akin to that enjoyed by members of many other parliaments where their primary function as legislators is recognised and is accepted in practice.</P>
    <P>The Constitution makes it clear that the sole power of making what are referred to as laws for the State is vested in the Oireachtas.  In practice that means primarily in this House but law also has a particular meaning in that article of the Constitution.  In effect it means only laws that are enacted because they are Acts of the Oireachtas.  It does not mean anything else because the power to make all the other laws, many of which are enormously important, has been delegated long since by the Oireachtas.  If this had not been the case the congestion in this House would be even greater than it is but on the other hand the degree of delegation has perhaps gone far beyond anything that could have been contemplated when that system was first put into practice.  It is possible, for example, under the European Communities Act of 1972 to make an enormous number of statutory instruments and regulations which would have the power of amending law in this country or of making new law involving a huge range of topics that are in any way connected with our membership of the EEC.  Under many other individual Acts there are considerable powers of legislation other than by the passage of Bills through both Houses here.</P>
    <P>The most startling development perhaps that has come about in recent years and of which we had a very good example earlier this month is the imposition of huge taxes by way other than by the passing of law in both Houses.  It could hardly have been envisaged in 1956 when that relatively innocent Act was passed that entire budgets involving enormous tax increases would be introduced while the House was in recess and by virtue of an Act which was meant to enable us to exercise some control on imports at a time when protectionism was the current economic policy here and before we had moved into the era of free trade which <Col N="641" /> we now enjoy.  For philosophical and trade policy reasons that 1956 Act should be repealed.  It should not be used budgetarily as an instrument for surreptitious vacation which is what has been happening.</P>
    <P>I was chairman of a committee which sat in 1971 and reported in 1972 on reform of procedure in the Oireachtas. We were not very adventurous.  We seemed to have a fairly limited remit, a remit not really to look fundamentally at the procedures of the Oireachtas but to look at the existing ones and see how they could be updated.  We made 40 to 50 recommendations which I think were put into practice and were of some help. As paragraph 5 of that report indicates, we believed that a wide-ranging examination might profitably be undertaken to establish how effectively the Houses of the Oireachtas were discharging their functions in the circumstances of the time.  That was more than ten years ago and this debate is probably the first serious effort since then to come to grips with some of the problems.  Many of the speeches are somewhat like that report in that they contain suggestions as to how procedure could be improved within the present framework and there has not been a serious attempt on the part of many Deputies to go back to fundamentals and ask whether the general procedures that are enshrined in Standing Orders and in precedent are even remotely relevant to our present circumstances.</P>
    <P>By and large these tend to emanate from what was appropriate parliamentary procedure in Victorian England. Victorian England is a long way away in terms of social, political and economic terms from the Ireland of the eighties and its problems.  It amazes me that we should consider it good enough for our Standing Orders simply to fiddle around with the details of an essentially Victorian and British institution.  We must go much further and consider repealing the entire Standing Orders and think out a whole new approach that is relevant to today. One of the most compelling differences between the overall social, economic and political system that existed in Victorian <Col N="642" /> England and that which exists in Ireland today is the fact that the State sector as we would now call it in its broadest sense played very little part in the affairs of Victorian England and did not have to be reflected to any great extent in the parliamentary procedures which they drew up at that time as being appropriate to their then circumstances.</P>
    <P>Let us consider the difference in Ireland today.  The State dominates, indeed domineers, everything.  In areas in which the State does not play a major part we hear calls frequently for it to play a major part.  People no longer consider that they can operate on their own with the result that the State has its clammy hand on virtually every form of human activity in the State.  But our parliamentary procedures do not reflect that situation. We have been reminded during this debate, for instance, that the Public Capital Programme which is of enormous importance in our economic life is never debated here except incidentally perhaps in the course of some other debate.  It never has to be passed despite its having the most fundamental and far-reaching consequences for economic planning and development.</P>
    <P>There is a presumption running through our Constitution, and indeed through our Parliamentary procedure, that taxes may not be imposed on the people unless this House so agrees and unless the proposal to impose taxation is moved by a member of the Government. Still we had the budget of 8 January when the House was in recess and it has to be retrospectively validated, I think, by legislation before 31 December of next year, almost 24 months after it was imposed &mdash; not here but in Merrion Street.  That runs entirely counter to the spirit of our Constitution and the spirit of what is meant to be our parliamentary procedure and which is quite unable to deal with it. Should our parliamentary procedure therefore not be radically changed to take account of this?</P>
    <P>We have at present nearly 100 semi-State bodies engaged in commercial activity or economic promotional activity of one kind or another.  When our Standing Orders were drawn up in 1923 we had <Col N="643" /> no semi-State bodies and we have taken no account of them since.  In so far as they are discussed here it is almost by accident.  Some of them need occasional legislation to increase their borrowing or capital limits and it may be that there is a debate every five or ten years as a result. More of them do not need that kind of legislation and as a result there is never a debate.  Ministers are not answerable to this House for the activities of those bodies because they are seen as autonomous but they have an enormous effect on the economic and social life of the country and they are a major part of the already too-big State sector.  Are our procedures, therefore, not very unreal when we take no account of that?</P>
    <P>The first account that was taken, I think, was when a committee was set up two or three years ago to look at them one after the other.  It was very much a once-off procedure and it is likely that many of those bodies will not be looked at again for several more years.  Would it not be better, if we are going to continue our attitude of the dominance of the State sector and the encouragement of further incursions by the State, to get our procedure clear in this House to reflect that back?  If we do not get our procedures to reflect that back, is there any hope or point in asking that we might have a change of heart and move away from this excessive obsession with the necessity for the State to involve itself in so much of what is happening in this and other countries?</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech and in some of the documents he published before it, laid much emphasis on all the work committees could and should do here.  We did, I recall, consider that in 1972.  There was a definite problem that had better be recognised; this House is simply too small to have taken that kind of committee system envisaged and it will not be able to work because everybody who is in Government or is a Minister of State is more or less excluded.  The Ceann Comhairle and Leas-Cheann Comhairle are excluded and quite a number of Deputies <Col N="644" /> for one reason or another are not in a position to make a contribution over a period to committees which are involved perhaps often with technical and difficult subjects.  The result is that there is a relatively small pool of people available for that kind of work and they will not be able to do it.</P>
    <P>It is not enough to make facile comparisons with the US where the House of Representatives has about 450 members and the Senate 100 and where they have to deal only with federal matters.  They do not have to deal with State matters. We have to deal with both.  We have nothing like the facilities they have and our system is fundamentally different because no members of the Government of the US are members of either House and cannot be.  The British system is also quite different with 635 members in the House of Commons.  Their possibilities for the use of committees are far greater than ours.  Nonetheless, within certain limitations greater use should be sought to be made of them and I look forward with interest to see how that develops.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies, particularly Deputy Frank Fahey, yesterday drew attention to the fact that often the debates here seem unreal and far removed from the actual problems existing. We often have very prolonged debates which become repetitive fairly quickly.  He listed many things that are rarely if ever discussed here or have not been discussed for quite a number of years and which are of great importance. He omitted one significant area that has not been debated here with any sort of regularity but which is of crucial importance. That is the situation in Northern Ireland which is so rarely touched on.  It is hard to believe that only 60 miles from this House there is this awful situation where on average several people every week die violent deaths and where our names are often invoked and our State in aid of some of the appalling deeds perpetrated there.  Why does it seem so remote from us?  Why does it seem so remote from this House, from the business, deals and discussions here?  I often think those of us in this Chamber must in some way be like the players on the <Col N="645" /> Abbey stage at the first production of Synge's &ldquo;Playboy&rdquo; because we are vainly trying to carry on the play while all around there are riots in the auditorium and we pay little attention to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>This is possibly one of the more interesting days on which one could make this comparison but it has often been a feature of this House that the interest is so infrequently on what is done or said in this Chamber and so much on what goes on elsewhere.  That reflects itself in our willingness to debate at considerable length at times things that have lost their relevance.  These extraordinarily prolonged economic debates which go on for weeks on end are an absolute waste of time and money.  I hope the Government and parties generally through their Whips will agree to bring an end to that system and begin to look for the first time at a fundamental reappraisal of what should be important in a national parliament rather than accept that because certain methods were appropriate to the England of the 1880s they are appropriate to Ireland of the 1980s.</P>
      <P>I have been a frequent complainer about our inability to bring our legal system up to date and put greater reality into it.  It is difficult to criticise them, slow as they are, when our parliamentary system is at least as archaic as our legal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion, I can see absolutely no reason why debates in this House are not broadcast at least on radio.  I see no valid objection to broadcasting them now and it might do much to raise the standard of debate.  The television question is rather more difficult and, frankly, it might be a facility provided on more limited occasions but I do not see why radio broadcasting should not be a permanent feature. We have no reason to believe that it is likely to be abused or that quotations will be taken out of context.  Reporting of this House by RTE over the years has been, by and large, pretty accurate and fair.  It would do a great deal to raise the standard of the House and make it a more <Col N="646" /> relevant place if selected parts were available on radio to citizens who might never have the opportunity of coming here.  My mind boggles a little at the thought as I am about to sit down and Deputy John Kelly is about to stand up that RTE might want to broadcast a commercial for cornflakes between the two of us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin by taking up three points made very well by Deputy O'Malley during the past few minutes.  He castigated this House for long, rambling, irrelevant debate on financial and economic matters, largely absorbed in mutual castigation as predictable as a ritual oriental battle dance where the audience, rather like children who have become accustomed to the words of a fairytale and will not tolerate any deviation from the canonical wording, have grown accustomed to a certain pattern of events and have an almost superstitious dread of departing from it. I agree unreservedly with Deputy O'Malley that such debates are irrelevant and the reason is that there is no point of principle between us, so far as the biggest element on either side of the House is concerned.  Although I have differed bitterly from Deputy O'Malley on many matters in the past, provoked no doubt by partisan feelings of my own and provoked beyond any and all endurance by his partisan feelings, I heartily endorse every word he spoke on the subject of the changed nature of the State compared with Victorian England, about the apparently unstoppable encroachment of the State into our affairs and the necessity for any kind of a free parliamentary system to exercise control on the enormous sums of money dispensed in its name by the very body for which Ministers here are not answerable.  There is no issue between us on this and many other matters of this kind would come into the same category.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason this House has often spent weary weeks in economic debate is that there is nothing to discuss, except to emphasise how much money we handed out and how mean the other side are or were, to boast about one's own achievements, modest though they may be and <Col N="647" /> however great the extent to which they are attributable to the initiative of some nameless public servant, and to belittle the achievements of others.  That is the reason these debates are irrelevant.</P>
    <P>It is Deputy O'Malley's stock-in-trade and that of Deputy Woods, Deputy Bruton and myself to take up the point of view that one's party is historically right and cannot ever be otherwise and that the other party is historically wrong.  If we could get away from that conception even one day a year or once every four years, perhaps on 29 February, and look at what we are up to from the perspective I have been trying to outline during past months, perhaps matters would look a little different and the truth of what I am saying &mdash; if it is true &mdash; would become evident.  If debate here is dull, boring, predictable ritual, it is because there is no serious ideological issue between us.</P>
    <P>I was on the other side of the House following our defeat in the first election of 1982 and I remember a curious novel sensation when I heard for the first time Deputies Sherlock, De Rossa and Gallagher, particularly Deputy Gallagher who seemed to have an absolutely sincere, venomous detestation of much of what the rest of us stood for.  I felt a kind of thrill, a quite unknown sensation as I listened to Deputy Gallagher and, to a lesser extent, his two colleagues.  I could feel for the first time since I entered this building in 1969 the thrill of real political debate.  Deputy Gallagher had a conception of Ireland which I do not share but I hope I have enough humility to suppose that perhaps he may be right.  Perhaps we will both live long enough for him to convince me.  He has a conception of Ireland which is radically different from the one my party stand for and the one I belive Fianna Fáil stand for.  We do not get enough of that kind of debate here. I am by no means pleading for venom or, with due respect to the former Deputy, the sour mode of address which was habitual with him, but he and his colleagues made this House relevant in a small way.  They represented a point of view and they did so very well considering their numbers were so small.  I do not <Col N="648" /> share that point of view and were it to reach the ascendant I believe it would lead us all if not to a state of political destitution and tyranny then certainly to economic ruin.</P>
    <P>That is my conception and I may be wrong, but whether I am right or wrong that is what politics ought to be about.  It ought to be about the kind of thing we saw here only in short but illuminating flashes during the months when these three Deputies gave hell to those around them.  No doubt they had their own reason for doing so.  I do not think they are any more sincere, saint-like or disingenuous than anybody else.  It may be as many suspect that some people in that party take their orders from elsewhere, from quarters that are never seen or mentioned in this House.  It may be so.  I am voicing a suspicion I do not harbour persistently but others may do so.  Those three Deputies provided the only serious political debate I have heard in this House.  Occasional gusts of rhetoric from Deputy Michael D. Higgins, Deputy Taylor or Deputy Quinn might have given the impression that we were listening to real issues being thrashed out by people who felt really strongly about them but by and large that does not happen, for the reasons I have tried to explain.</P>
    <P>Another point made by Deputy O'Malley related to the committee system. With respect to the Minister in front of me, perhaps too much is claimed for the committee system.  I have very bitter recollections of my sweating efforts to make something of the committee system when I was Government Whip between 1973 and 1977.  In those years I succeeded in getting on their feet more committees than in all other Dálaí put together.  We had six or seven special committees on Bills such as the Wildlife Bill and the Bill setting up the National Board for Science and Technology.  This represented more committees than all other Dálaí had been able to set up since the State was founded.  My recollection of those committees is that they did their work efficiently but it was a bit of a problem to get Deputies to attend because the proceedings were not as well covered by the <Col N="649" /> press as if they were taking place on the floor of the House to the exclusion of other business.  That is a valid enough reason for reluctance to be a member of such a committee or to attend it and I will deal in the course of my speech with the role of the press in the life of this House and of any kind of parliamentary democracy in this age.</P>
    <P>We made an effort with those committees to take material from the floor of the House because the agenda and the work of the House in those years was desperately clogged, partly because of the policy the Fianna Fáil Party adopted in 1973 which was to break our necks by exhausting us physically.  We started off with a very small majority and by gradual inches and persistence on our part but they were the people who were worn down.</P>
    <P>In my time as Whip I had to organise 400 divisions in those four-and-a-half years. That was beyond all reason.  A very large proportion of these divisions took place on the Committee Stage of two Bills, which I freely concede were highly contentious and controversial &mdash; the Wealth Tax Bill and the Capital Gains Tax Bill, I forget if the Capital Acquisitions Tax Bill came into the same category.  I suggested to the Opposition, through my friend Deputy Lawlor who used to take advice on such matters from Deputy Colley who was Finance spokesman, that the Wealth Tax Bill and the other financial legislation, controversial though it was, should be removed from the floor of the House and sent to a special committee which could have dealt with it efficiently and expeditiously.  That request was refused because if they had done that, they would have been depriving themselves of a good opportunity for breaking our necks by sheer dint of physical exhaustion.  We spent hour after hour, week after week, four days a week debating these Bills.  In 1975 we sat into the first week of August.  For a number of weeks before that date we sat four days a week until 10.30 p.m. three days a week.  That was a regular occurrence. Those were tough times.</P>
    <P>When I hear people talk about the committee system I tell them the only real experience any Whip living and still <Col N="650" /> a Member of this House ever had when the committee system worked like that. If a Bill was not contentious, and if there was no publicity mileage in it and one could persuade a few simple-minded Deputies to participate, that was fine.  It would go into committee, be discussed in one of the back rooms, and would go through in jigging time.  But with a serious Bill where there was mileage to be got out of it by way of attracting the interest of the press or breaking the necks of the Government front bench, there was no question of sending it to committee, and it did not matter what the consequences were for Dáil business.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy J. Bruton, is optimistic, and he knows I will heartly support anything he does to try to improve Dáil procedure, but there is a limit to what can be done with the committee system, a limit based on my own experience.  I read Deputy Ahern's speech today and was very impressed and heartened by the open-minded and generous tone he used towards the Minister and the Minister of State.  I could not detect any note of partisanship in anything he said.  It may be that we are all growing up under the pressure of events, that we are all becoming more adult and that that will show in our public as well as our private lives. That is to be welcomed.  It may be that Deputy Ahern is the first dove coming back to the ark with an olive stick in his beak, that the flood waters of unreason and obstruction are beginning to recede and that we will get a better way of doing business here and a better atmosphere.</P>
    <P>During the last two or three Dála, short though they were, we did not have time to get into any kind of cantankerous stride or to build up resentment and insanity.  There were fewer divisions and occasions when people took stands, held up the House and generally made themselves disagreeable purely for the sake of doing it.</P>
    <P>The last of the matters Deputy O'Malley mentioned was the Dáil's role in financial matters.  He mentioned the Imposition of Duties Act, 1956, by which the Government were given power, by order, to impose taxation and to raise very <Col N="651" /> large sums of taxation by way of excise, stamp duty or customs duty, but not by means of income tax, VAT or anything of that sort.  Under that Act it is possible for a Government, by order, to raise this taxation and the Dáil does not even have to be told about it, unless it be by the agreement of the Whips before the expiry of the year after the year in which that duty is imposed.  He gave the instance of an order the Government made at the beginning of this month.  He is quite right in saying that the law as it stands will be respected if the Dáil is not asked to confirm the imposition of that duty until as late a date as Christmas 1984.  He said it was all very fine to have such an instrument for very occasional use, as was the purpose in 1956 when in protectionist days it was intended to use it as a device for slowing down the importation of goods which were inflating our adverse trade balance.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley might have gone further. The Constitution does not specifically give the Dáil an exclusive role in raising taxation but it does, by implication, accord the Dáil a primacy in financial matters.  The Minister for Finance is the only Minister, apart from the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, who by the Constitution must be a Member of this House rather than of the Seanad.  It is in this House that the Financial Resolutions are passed on budget day, it is to this House that the budget is presented, and it is to this House that the Government are under constitutional duty under Article 17 to present Estimates.  These things do not happen in the Seanad.  The Constitution all but says that taxation is not to be raised except by consent of the Dáil. There are provisions in Articles 22 and 23 in regard to Money Bills which again underline the primacy of this House. Whatever about the letter of the Constitution, it seems to me that the spirit of it is being by-passed by the use of this Act. I am not making a partisan point one way or the other here because all Governments use this Act.  In my view Deputy O'Malley is correct when he says that a question mark as to its constitutional propriety must hang over it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> Deputy O'Malley might then have referred to Article 17 of the Constitution.</P>

      <P>Article 17 &mdash; which I know is a matter of concern to the Minister because in the excellent discussion document which he sponsored when Minister for Finance he specifically referred to it &mdash; requires the Government to present Estimates to the Dáil for departmental expenditure and Estimates of revenue and expenditure and requires the Dáil to consider these, as soon as possible.  As the Minister pointed out with great vehemence and frequency, the Dáil observed that duty perfunctorily if at all in the case of a large number of Departments. &ldquo;As soon as possible&rdquo; was very often interpreted as being at the very last moment and the consideration which these Estimates got at the very last moment was very often a matter of a couple <i>pro forma</i> questions and answers addressed across the floor in the heat of a July afternoon, under the pressure of the House rising for the Summer Recess at 5 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem that money, the elevation of which the Estimates envisaged might by then have been spent, was got over by another piece of legislation &mdash; the Central Fund (Temporary Provisions) Act of 1965 under which, in respect of any particular Department, the Minister is permitted <Col N="653" /> to issue out of the Central Fund a sum up to 80 per cent of the money which in the previous year that particular Department absorbed.  The disharmony of that Act with Article 17 and with the general spirit of the Constitution which gives this House a primacy in financial matters is absolutely fatal.  I know that I am pushing an open door with the Minister, because I have heard him say so himself.  To make the matter relevant to what we are talking about, what has been happening in these two Acts &mdash; one getting on for 30 years of age, the other nearly 20 &mdash; is that what is sometimes referred to respectfully as the permanent Government of the country, namely the civil service, having observed the inertia of the Dáil and its impotence when faced with any serious matter of getting any business done quickly and usefully, has made its own arrangements in regard to collecting revenue and spending it.  I do not suppose they had to persuade, but they perhaps proposed to the late Deputy Gerard Sweetman when Minister for Finance in 1956 and to Deputy Haughey, or perhaps Deputy Colley, in 1965 that these measures would be expedient and they went through.  That is a reflection on the way the House does its business.  It is the passage of these measures, questionable though they are, which is the most eloquent of all reflections on the way this House does its business.</P>
    <P>If I may go back to the sequence which I had originally intended in regard to my remarks, I would like to say something about the question of Dáil sitting hours. The public tend to have the idea that the Dáil consists of 166 rather overpaid, lazy people because we work only three days a week for roughly 30 weeks of the year, a little more perhaps.  If the public could actually see that on that hypothesis only Deputies Woods, Bruton, Taylor, McCartin, myself and our Chairman are at this moment earning our money, they would be even more horrified.  The truth is that what the public expect from Deputies is not participation in debates &mdash; it has been said that many a man talked himself out of this House &mdash; but a range of services of which neither the Constitution, <Col N="654" /> nor any legislation, nor Standing Order takes note in any shape or form.</P>
    <P>The sitting hours which the Standing Orders provide for are quite long enough if properly used &mdash; indeed, they may be even too long.  I read Deputy Bertie Ahern's speech yesterday saying that there was no sense in keeping the Dáil uselessly spinning out a topic until 7, 8.30, 5 o'clock or whatever the closing time of the day happened to be, just because the time had to be filled up.  If there was no more to say, why not sit down and let the debate finish?  I completely agree with that.  That is the point of view that I apply and the chairman also applies in our private and business lives.  No one goes on needlessly talking to fill in time.  However, we do that in here at the public expense in order to produce a quite false and deceptive impression.  The hours are long enough if properly used and even, as Deputy Ahern said, too long.  I do not see any point in sitting an extra day just to impress the public&mdash;and what public are being impressed?  The public want results from the people they elect and pay for. The results they want they will see in terms of a reasonable education, a reasonable inflation rate, a reasonable unemployment rate, a reasonable balance of payments situation, reasonable value for their currency.  These are the kind of results they want to see.  They are not, apart from the occasional crank who takes an interest in such matters, going to be impressed by any show of laying on lengthy Dáil sittings, which in any case one cannot compel reluctant Deputies to attend.</P>
    <P>The question of late sittings or excessive sittings is one in which I can claim &mdash; although I was deprecating both a while ago &mdash; as modestly as I can, personally to have contributed a major reform to this House during the time when I was Whip.  With only the lukewarm assent of my own side and against bitter opposition on the other side, I succeeded in putting through a temporary amendment of Standing Orders in 1975 which has been repeated in every Dáil since then, whereby the 10.30 rising hour was changed to 8.30 and the missing <Col N="655" /> hours were made up on Wednesday morning.  Formerly the House did not sit on Wednesday until 3 o'clock in the afternoon, just as on Tuesday&mdash;again an idea left over from Victorian England.  The change which that made in the atmosphere of debate here, in the standard &mdash; if I may put it this way &mdash; of the manner in which people dealt with one another, was dramatic.  It would be seized on by a sensation-hungry press and people if I were to say too much about the changes of behaviour outside the Chamber of the House, but there were perceptible changes there, too&mdash;very much for the better.</P>
    <P>The working hours of the Dáil week were no shorter.  Exactly the same number of hours were worked.  However, it was a very much easier working week, less taxing on physical endurance than the former arrangements had represented. It is not only the 166 Members who are at issue.  The very large staff of the House is at issue and particularly those on whom the Dáil session falls with great severity and on which it makes great physical and mental demands&mdash;such as the reporting staff, the staff in charge of the Official Report and so on.  That change was very beneficial and one of the reasons for that was that it relieved the strain during those bitter months and years of debate on Committee Stage over controversial financial legislation, on Ministers who were locked into this House as if into a submarine, day after day after day until 10.30 at night, or after 5, or 8.30 and could not get back to their Departments, or home, or do anything. They could neither work nor play, neither attend to their business nor relax. They were locked in here as though it were a submarine on the bed of the Atlantic.  They were locked in here for only one purpose &mdash; so that when the division bell rang they would be there to register their votes.</P>
    <P>That is no way to do business.  Long sitting hours, anything in the nature of turning this House into a long endurance test for the sake of impressing a few cranks among the public who think it is proper that we should waffle, who think <Col N="656" /> that is what we are there for, rather than to elect, to support and to advise a decent Government, should not be considered &mdash; we should not waste our time considering that sort of thing.</P>
    <P>Perhaps what we might consider is the sort of system they have in Germany, and in other countries, in Government Ministries, both at federal and land levels: we might have what the Germans call the <i>Tag der Offenen Tur</i>, &ldquo;the day of the open door&rdquo;.  Naturally, you cannot have all the public here, but there is a system there where the doors are thrown open for the public to come in, to inspect and to satisfy themselves that what is going on is what they are paying for.  They can see what is going on and form a correct impression of what the Dáil and its Members represent, the work they do and what is expected of them.</P>
    <P>I make that suggestion only half seriously because we could not simply throw open our doors here, if only for security reasons, but it might be no harm if some kind of an informal association were formed such as one for airing such grievances as unreal telephone bills.  If there could be an informal association on the outside which we might call &ldquo;Friends of the Dáil and Seanad&rdquo; or an &ldquo;association for the Irish citizen&rdquo; or something like that, they might be invited to come in on a day when the Dáil is under full steam, or the Seanad, to see for themselves what goes on here, so that they would understand that although the Dáil at this moment contains only half a dozen Deputies, there are dozens, possibly 100, in the building who are not idle, who are not in the bar &mdash; maybe there are three or four in the bar: I have often put my nose in there looking for someone, or to have a drink myself, and there might not be one Deputy in the bar.  That is the kind of a vulgar impression easily seen by the public, and it does not take much for a journalist to convert it into an acceptable tailpiece or a little joke for a Saturday column or something of that kind.</P>
    <P>Deputies sit here whom I can see whistling with exhaustion under the sheer burden of constituency work, much of it unrewarding, much of it possibly even useless &mdash; more than nine-tenths of it <Col N="657" /> useless except they do not know which nine-tenths until the reply comes back. You, Sir, are not here as long as the rest of us, but you know already that you never can tell when a representation of some kind, or an inquiry, will produce an unexpectedly happy result for your constituent, and so you have to go through the motions with all of them even though much more than nine-tenths will not make any difference to what the administration might have done had you not interfered with it at all.</P>
    <P>One of the problems about the way business is transacted in this House has to deal with relations with the press. There is the kind of convention here that you address your remarks to the Chair and not to the Press Gallery, that you do not even notice that there is such a thing as a Press Gallery: it is supposed to be more or less invisible.  It is a convention as venerable and as cynical as the convention that you do not take note of the existence of the other House, that you are supposed to refer to it as some euphemism or paraphrase, that you are not allowed to quote a Senator's speech either from the Seanad or the newspapers. It is good enough for the English for some reason of their own: it is in the history of the seventeenth century and therefore it is good enough for the Irish of the twentieth.  That is a pet theory that I have had difficulty in understanding ever since I came here.</P>
    <P>That kind of theory applies also to the press.  I have no respect for any kind of a theory which does not take note of reality.  The reality is that what happens in this House is radiated to the people by the press, and the colour which they put on it &mdash; and by using the word &ldquo;colour&rdquo; I do not want to imply anything except total honesty and devotion to the high journalistic standards in their transmissions&mdash;the colour and shape they put on it is all important to somebody who is trying to speak to the people, whether it is his constituents or the people at large. Many a hard-working Deputy has been sold short because of not getting favourable treatment from the media.</P>
    <P>I remember thinking in the 1973/77 period that a very conspicuous victim of <Col N="658" /> that was Deputy Colley with whom, like Deputy O'Malley, I have had many a bitter disagreement &mdash; he is not in any sense my favourite politician, though I regard his qualities, and I would have thought his qualities are highly visible. But he simply did not succeed in putting himself across to the media.  That is not the fault of the media, they are perfectly entitled to their own perceptions, and in those years he was persistently belittled, and although he carried on his back, personally, as far as I could see, three-quarters of the hard work then done by the Opposition, particularly in financial matters, he got nothing like the credit which was due to him.</P>
    <P>I have always given Deputy Colley as an instance of someone who failed with the media at that rather crucial time of his politicial career, and therefore it is childish and unreal to pretend that the media do not count or that the way they transmit the Dáil has no influence on how the Dáil does its work.  Of course it has an influence.</P>
    <P>I remember in the years 1973/75, before I succeeded in getting the sitting hours changed to 8.30 p.m., I frequently was here in the evenings at 8.30 or 8.45 and saw an Opposition Deputy get to his feet&mdash;it could have been one of our own, but it was more usually an Opposition Deputy, for obvious reasons.  He would get to his feet at 8.45 knowing that he would get low media coverage.  I saw Deputies at the other side of the House in those years get up at 8.45 and womble through until 10.30 because they knew that if they did that and were able to report progress at 10.30 they would be first in at 10.30 in the morning, when, of course, the press would be in that gallery, brighteyed and bushytailed, ready for anything, and particularly for a bit of fun, and willing to take down whatever the Deputy who had bored the ears of everybody the previous night might have kept up his sleeve for the following morning.</P>
    <P>That is no way to do business.  That way of doing business is directly related to the exigencies not of this House, not of the Irish people, but the mechanics of newspaper production.  It is unreal and pompous to pretend otherwise and that is <Col N="659" /> the plain naked truth of the matter.  When the sittings of the House went back to 8.30 I fondly imagined that everybody would get a fair show, but it seemed to make a difference to the working hours of the press as well: it seemed to shorten their day, too, because until about 8.00 in the evening there was a reasonable attendance in the press gallery up to 1975, when the Dáil sat until 10.30 but when the sittings went back to 8.30 the press gallery tended to empty at around 5 o'clock, and accordingly the time at which it was useful to make one's speech had to go back by a couple of hours.  Now I take it for granted that anything said, unless it is something outrageous or unless there is a major row on and speakers being held, unless there is a special reason for hanging around a speaker around this time of the evening is not going to get much of a showing the following day.  That is in no sense a criticism of the press: they do their business in the way that the nature of the business dictates, but it carries an implication of the way this House might organise itself.  I hope that I will not be thought in breach of privilege or anything like that, that that old ash plant will not come out from behind your Chair to escort me to the dungeons if I say such a thing.</P>
    <P>I do not mean to say that the House is being dictated to in this regard by the press.  The reality of the thing is that, since we meditate our ideas to the people via the press, we should have some regard to the exigencies of newspaper production and perhaps even ask the Committee on Procedures and Privileges to consult the Press Gallery here as to whether they have any suggestions in regard to our sitting hours, in regard to how our business might be organised in such a way as to give everybody &mdash; I do not just mean the Government side&mdash;the same reasonable chance of notice and the same reasonable chance of having his words digested and possibly editorialised on or commented on in whatever way seems appropriate.  That is not the case at present. It is not the case even now although I may have painted the situation in slightly too crude colours a moment ago. <Col N="660" /> Even now, with the sitting hours back to 8.30 in the evening, the situation is still not ideal.  Also the press are flesh and blood like everybody else.  They have a low boredom threshold just as I and you have and they tend to discover perhaps that they have something better to do if there is something very boring going on. That is the reason, on the Order of Business, when they are all here &mdash; when there is traditionally a bit of cut and thrust &mdash; Deputies frequently, even in a disorderly manner, try to cut a profile which will attract attention when everybody's faculties are fresh and which would not be so easy for them at a more orderly time of the day.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned that the press do not cover committees, or cover them adequately.  Again, that is not a criticism of the papers, all of which are in current financial straits of one sort or another; probably they simply have not got the resources.  It would be expensive for them to provide the resources to cover Dáil committees.  However, it is something it might be possible for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to consult the Press Gallery about, to see if the goodwill which ought to exist between these two estates would lead to some useful suggestion.</P>
    <P>The last thing I want to say about the press is that &mdash; perhaps it is not always like this &mdash; I have found in the past that if a Deputy here speaks in Irish, it does not all that often happen and this may be the reason, either his speech is left completely out of the record in the newspapers or, if it is very briefly mentioned, as often as not it is not recorded that Irish was the language in which he spoke. Again I recognise that it is not fair to ask a reporter to be perfectly bilingual, to be able to get the gist of a speech in Irish; very often the speech itself may not be in very good Irish, or very intelligible.  Naturally many of us, if we learn it at all, learned it very much as a second language and do not command it as well as we do English.  Therefore there are difficulties on both sides.  It is a matter it might be possible for the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to raise with the Press Gallery. I seriously mean that, that some <Col N="661" /> kind of formal contact between that committee and that gallery probably is overdue. As Macauley used to say, at the end of a withering review of somebody: let me take leave, with this part of my speech anyway, of the Press on good terms.  They must realise that in this House to some extent we exist, so far as the public is concerned, only through them.  Our mutual relationship reminds me a bit of Bishop Berkeley's&mdash;the Irish 18th century philosopher &mdash; theory that matter did not exist except to the extent that somebody was thinking about it, except to the extent that somebody mentally focussed on it.  And Boswell has a story about how Doctor Johnson was sitting at dinner one evening with somebody who was very absurdly defending Bishop Berkeley's thesis.  This man got up to leave the table and go home when Johnson said to him: Pray, do not leave, Sir for, if you go, we may forget to think about you and then you will cease to exist.  To some extent the Dáil, Seanad and the courts, so far as the public are concerned, are dependent on the press thinking about them.  And if the press do not think about them, or do not think about them in what seems to us an appropriate way, then we have effectively ceased to exist.  Naturally we may be going through the motions of passing legislation but, so far as speaking back to the people is concerned, or giving them the lead we are always hearing about, explaining to them points of view and policies, so far as these things are concerned, we have ceased to exist.  I do not want to labour this point any longer.  But it might be no harm for some formal contact&mdash;it need not be stuffy or solemn, it could be for all I care a formal relationship relieved by some social dimension &mdash; between that committee, as such, and the Press Gallery ought to be considered.</P>
    <P>In regard to Question Time it has often been said that it absorbs huge quantities of public money &mdash; I think the most recent average was somewhere around £70 or £80 &mdash; that enormous quantities of public money go on digging up and presenting replies to Deputies' questions and that huge quantities of the time of the House are spent answering them.  But, <Col N="662" /> more particularly, it has been said that the Order Paper gets so filled up with Deputies' questions that things which are topical now and about which a question has been put down this morning, if addressed to a Minister who only finished answering questions yesterday, will now go to the end of the list and not perhaps be answered in a heavily-filled Order Paper for two to three months by which time the thing may not even be topical. I think there were instances in the last two Dáileanna, which were so short, in which some Ministers were never on their feet at all.  I have a kind of an idea that that was my own experience when I was Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism in the 1981-82 Government.  I did answer questions as Minister for Foreign Affairs when I was acting in that capacity for four or five months but I do not think I ever was reached on the Trade, Commerce and Tourism side.  In other words my entire career as Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism &mdash; although there were burning questions about motor insurance and things like that about which Opposition Deputies wanted to question me&mdash;was spent without ever coming under their fire.  That is wrong.  It is a stupid fate for the Question Time system and obviously a very expensive one if, as is said, it costs so much to process questions.  All these questions have to be ready for answer literally four days after the question is put down.  So even if a question is never reached or taken in here the expense by the State has still been incurred.</P>
    <P>I have a suggestion I should like the Committee on Procedure and Privileges to examine and I put it to the Minister in front of me &mdash; it may indeed be the case that this suggestion would involve the State in even heavier expense but it might be something worth a minute or two's consideration in the committee, that is that we might have a parallel Question Time, along with the Question Time in the Dáil, in which Deputies would put questions, not to the Minister but to the Department, in which the very same sequence would be followed, if you like, Department after Department, in which things which were not primarily of political <Col N="663" /> importance but rather of constituency importance, questions about land division, about provision of telephone facilities, about drainage schemes, about school buildings.  Most Deputies are not megalomaniacs, they do not suppose that a local issue is going to become one of national importance and that it necessarily requires to be raised on the floor of the House.</P>
    <P>At that point questions might be fed into a sort of parallel Question Time and answered, not by the Minister or Minister of State on the floor of the House but by an official or group of officials from the Department in another room of the building, open to the public, for anyone who came to listen and not under the control of the Chair.  In other words, it could be a much more informal proceeding but one in which the Department official would have in front of him the entire relevant file and would submit good humouredly to being quizzed by a Deputy as to why, for instance, a school was taking so long to build, why plans had not been approved, why there was so much vandalism in a specific suburb, or why a squad car had been withdrawn from a certain road.  Those things could be dealt with without pre-occupying the time and the money of the full House. They could be dealt with more informally and, perhaps, more fruitfully in a parallel Question Time without a chairman but serviced by officials alone.  I have often felt that we are too reluctant to make experiments, perhaps because we are afraid of the moment when we might have to say they were a failure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Chair for the opportunity to raise this matter. My main reason for bringing it to the attention of the House is to give the Minister for Justice an opportunity to make a statement on this rather long drawn-out dispute.  For the benefit of Deputies and to put the dispute and its consequences in context, I should like to outline the background to it.  The District Court over the past few years has been the recipient of a great number of new and different responsibilities.  In the area of family law there has been a great deal of legislation giving the District Court new responsibilities. All of that came to a head when we adopted the Courts Bill, 1980, which increased the civil jurisdiction of that court from a maximum of £250 to £2,500. It was also proposed in that Bill to give the District Court responsibility for other family matters such as the guardianship of infants.  In the same year a Malicious Injuries Bill was passed and that gave the District Court jurisdiction to deal with a substantial portion of the malicious injury code.</P>
      <P>With all those developments taking place it was obvious to practitioners and District Court clerks that the additional accommodation and facilities necessary in District Courts were not being provided. When the Bill dealing with the courts was being discussed here and in the Seanad, Members were concerned that proper facilities would be made available.  We were concerned that new facilities in the form of additional physical accommodation and back-up services would be made available to ensure that the new and wide jurisdiction being given to the District Court would be within the capacity of the court and their staff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the matter was discussed in the Seanad I had many exchanges with the Minister for Justice, Deputy Doherty, and he assured us all that plans were in train to improve the physical courthouse accommodation around the country and to increase staff where that was necessary. He assured us that those matters <Col N="665" /> were being examined.  At the time I was doubtful about that statement because there was not much evidence of any plan being implemented.  Subsequently the Minister indicated that he did not propose to bring the law into effect for 12 months after its passage through the Oireachtas to allow sufficient breathing space for that work to be carried out.</P>
    <P>Any member interested in the subject should read carefully the assurances given by the Minister in both Houses.  He spelled out precisely what he was going to do and assured both Houses that that work would be carried out within 12 months.  Of course, time passed and at the end of 12 months &mdash; on 12 May 1982 &mdash; the new jurisdiction was to come into effect.  It transpired at about that time that consultations with District Court clerks had not taken place, although the Minister had assured me in the Seanad that any necessary consultation would take place.  It was obvious to everybody, practitioners, clerks and others, that virtually no changes had taken place in the provision of courthouse accommodation. It was obvious also that plans to increase the staff had not been put into effect.  The result was that after some consultation with the Department of Justice, the District Court clerks fell into dispute about this.  Since 12 May they have been operating a work to rule.</P>
    <P>The effect of the work to rule is that District Court clerks have not operated the increased or any civil jurisdiction in the District Court.  That means that anybody with a claim, whether it arises out of a car accident, a tort, a contractual liability, or whatever, has been unable to bring proceedings in the District Court for more than six months.  One may say that because it is the District Court it is not too bad but, in fact, it must be borne in mind that the increased jurisdiction gave that court the entire civil jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  In effect, we have been without the civil jurisdiction of the Circuit and District Court since May 1982.</P>
    <P>Practitioners will readily say that they have had complaints, understandably, from clients who are enraged by the fact that their car had been crashed into, that <Col N="666" /> somebody had failed to deliver goods or that somebody broke a contract but they are unable in any way to enforce their legal rights by bringing cases against those with whom they are in conflict.  The situation is serious but what is more worrying is that courts have not been operating their family law jurisdiction except in urgent and emergency type cases. Thanks to the consciousness of District Court clerks, and officials, of the necessity in certain family law cases they have been operating the administration of protection orders and barring orders where they see that they are required for emergency reasons or where there is a danger to the physical wellbeing of a spouse. However, as far as maintenance is concerned there has been no operation of jurisdiction.  The same situation exists as far as enforcement of maintenance is concerned. We can all visualise situations that are arising daily, and have been going on for eight months, where spouses being maintained by husbands have no access to the court to enforce their right to maintenance.  It is not too bad if a person is from a wealthy background because one can go to the Circuit Court but those who are badly off have no opportunity to get their maintenance orders.  Worse still, all maintenance orders made before May 1982 giving the District Court clerk, as is the standard practice, the right to enforce such orders to make a recalcitant husband pay a certain sum weekly or monthly for maintenance, cannot be enforced.  One can imagine the horror and difficulty being faced by spouses who at one time had the benefit of an enforcement system. It seems unlikely that they will ever get the arrears.  Obviously such people have had to live off the health boards though the operation of the community welfare system.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to get involved in the issues which are complex.  We frequently speak of the reasons why strikes occur and we are very much into industrial democracy, at least in our speeches, whatever about our acts and our deeds. However, if one investigated how this dispute came about one could only come to the conclusion that the State failed in <Col N="667" /> its duty to consult with people who would have to undertake a completely different type of work.  I am satisfied from the exchanges I had with the Minister for Justice in 1980, and from discussions I had with members of the District Court staffs, that those consultations did not take place.</P>
    <P>It is also quite clear that despite the undertakings given about improvements in the accommodation in the District Courts nothing was done over the 12 months from May 1980 to May 1981 when the new jurisdiction was to come into effect.  If anything was done, it was done only in isolated places.  I can fully understand why the staffs of the District Courts would feel they have been treated most shabbily.  They were being asked to operate a jurisdiction for which they did not have the capacity in terms of office space, court space, basic facilities in the courthouses and, very seriously from their point of view, they did not have the staffs to operate this new system.</P>
    <P>I remember being accused in the Seanad by Members on the Government side of denying people access to what was described by Senator Eoin Ryan as cheap law.  He said I had some objection to cheap law.  What Senator Ryan and the then Minister for Justice described as cheap law has turned out to be no law for anyone.  The sad thing is that the people who are worse off in the community, the deserted wife, the small businessman who has lost a couple of thousand pounds, or has been cheated out of a couple of thousand pounds in a contract, the ordinary man in the street whose car has been damaged and who has been unable to collect his liability from an insurance company, are the sufferers.</P>
    <P>It is incumbent upon the Government to give every consideration possible to going as far as they can to meet the District Court clerks, first because of the inadequacy of the preparation and also because of the failure to do what any employer would have done in changing the workstyle to the extent to which it was planned for in this case; secondly because of the misery caused to so many people because of the non-operation of <Col N="668" /> the District Courts; and finally because of the fact that when this dispute is over there will be one hell of a problem to be dealt with.  There will be thousands if not tens of thousands of cases backed up, and the likelihood is that we will be waiting for years to overtake the backlog.  The problem is extremely serious.  I know the present Minister for Justice was not associated with the problem in any way at any time.  He has been busy since he went into the Department.  I raised this matter because of its urgency and seriousness and because to the public at least little seems to be happening.</P>
    <P>If I am not mistaken this is the Minister's first visit to the Dáil since he was appointed Minister for Justice.  I congratulate him on his new position.  I wish him well in a very difficult and sensitive job as we all know it to be.  I am sure he will acquit himself extremely well.  I hope he will have a long and happy time in the Department of Justice.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank Deputy Molony for his very kind remarks and for the contribution he has made this afternoon.  I have a statement to make on the up-to-date position which I intend to read to the House.</P>
      <P>The dispute has been referred to mediation under the Scheme of Conciliation and Arbitration for the Civil Service.  The mediator was appointed by the Chairman of the Labour Court.  Two meetings have already been held under the chairmanship of the mediator and a further meeting has been fixed for Wednesday next, 2 February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is envisaged that if agreement between the parties cannot be reached the mediator will make a recommendation. The recommendation will not be binding, but it is hoped that both parties will be able to recommend it for acceptance. In any event, any proposals for settlement would be subject to Government approval.  I think it would be best in all the circumstances that I should make no further comment at this stage, except to say I appreciate that the dispute is giving rise to serious problems for litigants as well as disruption and inconvenience <Col N="669" /> for practitioners.  For those reasons it is my earnest wish that the dispute should be resolved at the earliest possible date.</P>

      <P>A house improvement grant in respect of the provision of sewerage facilities was approved in this case on 13 December 1982.</P>
      <P>Grants in respect of a bathroom and extra bedroom cannot be allowed because, contrary to a qualifying condition of the scheme, these works had commenced before an inspection of the house was carried out.  The prior inspection requirement was imposed to ensure that the applicants would know in advance what works would qualify, what the Department's requirements were and the amount of grant, if any, available so as to avoid situations where applicants would be disappointed or financially embarrassed by going ahead with work in anticipation of a grant and finding subsequently that they would not be eligible for one reason or another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was also the position that the Department experienced considerable difficulties in establishing eligibility in the past under various schemes particularly when only works commenced after a certain date qualified for a grant or where certain criteria could not be checked after <Col N="617" /> the commencement of work.  For these reasons a prior inspection condition was provided for in the scheme originally introduced in October 1981 and continued by the previous Government in April, 1982 when they were expanding the scheme and there can be no question of making exceptions in individual cases.</P>

    <P Just="Center">II &mdash; Proceedings in 1982 in relation to evasion, etc.</P>
    <P>Proceedings for failure to lodge statutory returns for income tax, corporation tax, PAYE/PRSI and VAT were ordered in 2,842 cases and penalties amounting to a total of £176,709 were imposed in 705 cases.  The probation Act was applied in a further 118 cases.  The great majority of cases, however, have not yet come to hearing.  Convictions were obtained in two cases involving failure to keep or produce records for VAT purposes and fines (based on continuing <Col N="623" /> failure) totalling £4,900 were imposed.</P>
    <P>Sections 501 and 502 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, provide for the imposition of monetary penalties where a person fraudulently or negligently delivers an incorrect return for income tax purposes. Proceedings under these sections for negligently furnishing incorrect returns of income were initiated in three cases involving penalties totalling £36,000.  Of this amount £1,800 has been paid in one case, without a court hearing, and the other cases have not yet been finalised.</P>
    <P>In proceedings under section 516 of the Income Tax Act, 1967, against a landowner for delivery of a false statement in connection with his tax affairs the defendant was convicted and given a suspended sentence of one month's imprisonment.</P>
    <P>Proceedings against a retired bank official for conspiracy to defraud the Revenue are in abeyance pending the hearing of an appeal by the defendant to the Supreme Court against a decision of the High Court that the hearing should proceed in the District Court.</P>
    <P>Records are not kept in such a way as to indicate the amount of tax recovered as a result of court proceedings for penalties.</P>

This would include the performance of any operation or the giving of any treatment usually performed or given by a dentist. I hope to introduce in the current Dáil session a Bill to replace the Act of 1928, which would propose the setting up of a new Dental Council having the power to recognise and register dental auxiliaries and to specify, within prescribed limits, the dental work which any class of auxiliary dental worker may undertake under the direction of a dentist.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): The Leixlip area is one of a number of areas in and around Dublin where there is a local demand for a new Garda station.  The difficulty about providing extra Garda stations, apart from difficulties associated with getting suitable sites and the high building costs involved, is that manning them absorbs Garda manpower which might possibly be used more effectively on patrol duty in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A study team consisting of representatives <Col N="631" /> of the Garda Síochána and the Department of the Public Service, which carried out a detailed examination of how the most effective Garda service can be provided for all developing areas in Dublin city and county, has recommended changes in the boundaries of a number of the sub-districts in the Dublin metropolitan area, including the Lucan sub-district which serves the Leixlip area. The study team's recommendations, which are aimed at improving the Garda service in the areas concerned, are under consideration at present.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, the strength assigned to Lucan station has been increased by 8 members over the strength serving on 30 September, 1982 and it is considered that this increased manpower will enable a better Garda presence to be provided over the whole area served from the station.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 299 and 300 together.</P>
      <P>According to my Department's records some 49 pupils will be leaving primary school in Knocklyon in 1983.  My Department are satisfied that accommodation will be available for these pupils in existing post-primary schools in the locality. Accordingly the setting up of a new post-primary school in the area for the 1983-1984 school-year is not necessary.</P>
      <P>As the planning of the project is at an early stage I am not in a position at this stage to state when the new building will be completed.</P>
