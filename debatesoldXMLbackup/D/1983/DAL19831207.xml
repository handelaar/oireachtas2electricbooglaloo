    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take business in the following order: Nos. 3, 7,8,9 and 10.  Private Members' Business will be No. 16.  I should like to add that it is proposed to interrupt business at 5 p.m. for a statement on the Athens European Council meeting.</P>

      <P>Now that the Taoiseach is back with us I should like to ask him if he can be of any assistance to the House, particularly to this party, on the question of the Estimates.  We have ordered today item No. 3, Leave to introduce Supplementary Estimates, but we are more concerned about the Book of Estimates for 1984.  Our Whip informs us, as a result of discussions, that the only problem preventing the circulation of the Book of Estimates to the Dáil is one of printing. That being so will it be possible for the Taoiseach to arrange to have photocopies of the principal pages of the Estimates circulated to us immediately?  Otherwise, as the Taoiseach will understand, we will be given the Book of Estimates next Wednesday or Thursday and, without any opportunity to consider them, the House will be expected to debate them almost immediately.  Can the Taoiseach be of any assistance to us on this matter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Book of Estimates should be published next Wednesday or <Col N="1270" /> Thursday and we will, naturally, make provision for time to debate them.  That may involve the Dáil sitting later than would normally be the case.  In so far as the question of any advance photocopies being made available is concerned I do not know if that is feasible because of the complexity of the method of preparation for printing.  I will certainly inquire into that, and if it is possible to give any advance material or advance version before the printed copy I will try to do so, but I do not have any idea of whether it is technically feasible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Taoiseach for that assurance.  The Taoiseach will recall that on previous occasions it has been possible to give us photostats of the principal page of each Department.  As all Members are aware the Book of Estimates consists of a great deal of detail, but if we could have a week or so in advance a photostat of the principal pages of the Book of Estimates it would be of assistance.  The Taoiseach will understand from his own days in Opposition that it is not very practical to expect an Opposition party to debate Estimates produced some hours before. However, I will wait to hear further from the Taoiseach on that matter.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he is aware that in this morning's newspapers, and in the media generally, there is what purports to be a leak of an important Government document, and if he can be of any assistance to the House in this matter?  As the Taoiseach will understand, it is very undesirable for us in Opposition to be confronted with what purport to be reasonably authoritative statements about important Government policy documents in advance of any publication of those documents by the Government.  Allied to that there is a question which I must raise, that there seems to be a deliberate policy from the Department of Education to give exclusive leaks to certain newspapers.  There is a very strong suspicion that it is the Minister who is directly responsible for those leaks.  I regret to have to say that.</P>

      <P>The Chair allowed the Leader of the Opposition to develop his question on something that appeared in this morning's newspapers, but the Chair is now ruling that this does not arise on the Order of Business.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit it is a reasonable question to put to the Taoiseach, to ask him if he is in a position to confirm the statements in the media this morning about what purports to be an official document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is satisfied that if the Chair was to allow that and every rumour or alleged leak that appeared in the newspapers to be discussed on the Order of Business we would not get anywhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I must deplore the ruling of the Chair on that matter.  This is very important.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit that the coverage in this morning's newspapers of what purports to be a significantly important Government document is not a rumour.  It is something that the House should take notice of.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, in the course of raising this matter of concern&mdash;and which is a matter of concern to all of us&mdash;about documents being leaked, an allegation has been made against a Minister.  I feel I am entitled to respond to that allegation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the point of order.  The Chair feels that if a Member of the House, on the Order of Business, raises a matter which would attract such interest as the document in question, <i>impromptu,</i> without notice, without any limit on the amount of time that may be spent on it, makes a statement, another statement comes from this side of the House, another statement comes from there, the Chair would simply find it impossible to control the business of the House.  If it were a debate that was lasting for half an hour, when the half hour was up the Chair would simply bring it to a close.  But once a thing like this gets out of hand, the Chair feels, and feels very strongly that it would be impossible to control the business of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I do not want in any way to impugn your ruling though if you had so allowed I would be prepared to answer.  But I feel I am entitled to respond to a specific allegation about a Minister and to confine myself to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>And I would like to reply to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach give way for a second, please?  I want to put it this way, that if the Leader of the Opposition or any other Member of the House&mdash;he does not have to be the leader of anything&mdash;stands up in the morning, if the Chair interrupts him before he has stated what he wants to say then the Chair is told: &ldquo;Oh, you have not even heard what I wanted to say&rdquo;.  The Chair should get the co-operation of the House.  Deputies should make themselves familiar with Standing Orders and the procedures for running this House and debate them.  They are being abused day after day.</P>

    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 1 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On this section I should like to emphasise a point which I made on Second Stage, a point to which Deputy Kelly addressed himself on occasion, that is, the question of terminology.  In section 1 &ldquo;determination&rdquo; means a decision.  My thesis and Deputy Kelly's thesis is that if it is a decision it should be called a decision. We should stop wrapping legal terminology in archaicisms which tend to confuse the people for whom the legislation is meant.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 states:</P>
      <P>Section 3 of the Act of 1963 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6) of the following subsections:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1285" />&ldquo;(7) Persons employed by the Organisation shall enjoy inviolability for all their official papers and documents.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I must say at this stage that the Minister treated some of my questions on Second Stage in a rather cavalier fashion when we was winding up, and did not take them seriously.  I hope to get an opportunity to mention most of them as we go through Committee Stage now.  I asked whether this Bill covered military matters and I did not get any comment from the Minister. I may be wrong but as far as I remember, he did not face up to that question and give me an answer.  Later I may ask him again.</P>
    <P>Why have we this elaborate inviolability for all official papers and documents? I should like to have that teased out.  For example, is our Minister for Foreign Affairs so honoured when he goes to Brussels?  Are the Commissioners of the EEC so honoured with this inviolability? It seems to me to be breaking a nut with a sledge hammer and to be building up the personnel involved in executive duties in Eurocontrol.</P>
    <P>The Director-General of the Agency has to be specially mentioned and wrapped in some form of inviolability. The section states:</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for his explanation about the general points. On section 2, the Minister simply stated that it was fact that this happened.  He did not give any reason why it should happen, or why it should be incorporated in the Bill.  I should like to know if it is necessary in relation to this organisation. It is applied to people who, by definition, hold far more important posts in the EEC, or in any of the other international agencies which are now operating, and some people would say proliferating?</P>
      <P>Care is taken in section 2 to ensure that everything except a road traffic offence is permissible to the Director-General and that all official papers and documents carried by representatives are especially covered by law.  I cannot understand why the section is here.  What is the necessity for it, if people holding more important posts have not got it?  I know Ambassadors have it.  The Minister simply states that it is done.  I have not got any reason why it should be done.</P>

      <P>It is common practice in organisations of this type.  Facilities granted to the staff of Eurocontrol under <Col N="1287" /> the new subsection (7) and to representatives of member states of Eurocontrol under the new subsection (9) are solely for the purpose of ensuring full independence in the discharge of their duties and not for their personal benefit.

      <P>In section 2 the new subsection (8) provides that the Director-General shall enjoy immunity from jurisdiction in respect of acts excluding road traffic offences and damage caused by a motor vehicle belonging to him or driven by him, but including words spoken or written.  To me the immunity as stated there is much wider than that in section 2, new subsections (7) and (9), which cover official papers and documents.  The sky seems to be the limit of immunity for the Director-General.  The only matters excluded are road traffic offences or damage caused by a motor vehicle driven by him or belonging to him.  I am submitting to the House that the immunity granted is greater than is necessary for the proper functioning of the Director-General of the agency, and for that reason I object to the all-embracing nature of section 2 (8).</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Transport (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This is a relatively short but important Bill.  Its purpose is to extend the limit on CIE's borrowing powers for capital and temporary purposes and to increase the corresponding guarantee powers of the Minister for Finance.  The present statutory limits on CIE's capital borrowing power is £180 million and it is now proposed to increase that limit to £230 million.  The increase proposed in the case of the board's temporary borrowing powers is from £20 million to £40 million. These increases are necessary because CIE will shortly reach the statutory limits of their existing powers.</P>
      <P>CIE's capital expenditure is financed from the board's internal resources, mainly depreciation provisions, borrowings and Exchequer capital advances. These borrowing arrangements require my approval and that of the Minister for Finance who has power to guarantee them.  CIE's total capital borrowings at 31 December 1983, will, it is estimated, amount to £175.5 million.</P>
      <P>We have now entered into an unavoidable, necessary and welcome period of rapid change.  For those involved in CIE and for those of us for the time being assigned to guide its fortunes this should not be a time of combat but a time of cohesion.  The inevitability of change is such that the unwise alone will seek to resist while the wise will seek to fashion it.</P>
      <P>The inevitability of change is indicated by many things, but most of all by the galloping deficit, which simply has now exceeded what the Exchequer, that is, the taxpayer can afford to pay.  Last year it broke new records at £109.2 million &mdash; more than 33 times what it was in 1969 and represented 12 per cent of the current budget deficit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1294" /> We have already put a halt to that gallop and for the year now coming to a close the deficit should be around £104 million, which will be the first reduction achieved in 15 years.  That is just for openers.</P>
    <P>We have also, in a new policy departure for CIE in June, announced <i>inter alia,</i> that</P>
    <P>(i) one-third of what they do is considered social and consequently one-third of their expenditure should be their subvention;</P>
    <P>(ii) their expenditure must be reduced by 12 per cent in real terms over five years, and therefore, their subvention will reduce in real terms over five years by at least 12 per cent.</P>
    <P>(iii) the subvention will be paid above the line so profits become a possibility from 1984 onwards;</P>
    <P>(iv) a capital committee have been established to ensure all future proposals for major capital investment will be properly financially appraised before decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>These changes, although very significant, are only a start and we must now address ourselves to the possibility of advantageous structural changes and be guided in general, if not in detail, by McKinsey.</P>
    <P>The problem with McKinsey is that while the prognosis indicated the different problems in CIE and their relative order of magnitude he is short on cures. For instance he says about the railways, which contribute two thirds of the deficit, that there are four options: (i) keep them; (ii) reduce them; (iii) expand them; (iv) close them.</P>
    <P>He ruled out (ii) and (iii) and says (i) and (iv) will cost the economy more or less the same in over ten or 25 years span. However direct costs to the Exchequer would be considerably less if the railways were closed.</P>
    <P>Two questions, therefore, arise:</P>
    <P>(a)  can we afford to have the railways?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1295" /> (b) can we afford not to have the railways?</P>
    <P>Voluminous bodies of opinion will answer &ldquo;no&rdquo; to both those inherently contradictory questions.  Which of these is right?  That is the £70 million question which no longer can be avoided and must now be faced.</P>
    <P>In addressing themselves to McKinsey, which they will presently do, the Government will be weighing up all economic, social and &mdash; let us face it &mdash; political issues involved.  One of these issues is the Howth-Bray electrification about which much has been said and written &mdash; much of it inaccurate &mdash; in the recent past.</P>
    <P>This scheme has no chance of paying for itself even if passenger numbers reach the most optimistic forecasts.  It would now apperar that electrification will add around a further £20 million per year to CIE's problems, at least in the early years.</P>
    <P>Having said that, I want to emphasise that there have been no significant cost overruns.  The latest estimated cost is £114.3 million.  This is made up as follows:</P>

    </table>
    <P>CIE, when proposing the scheme, did so on the basis that it would be financed entirely by Exchequer grants.  These would not have had to be repaid nor would they have imposed a liability for continuing interest charges on the board. Initially this was the basis on which the Government of the day approved the scheme.  However, within a matter of weeks they decided that the scheme should be financed on the basis of loan capital.  The decision to convert from grant financing to loan financing effectilvely added £28.6 million to the capital cost and by rendering the board liable for the ongoing annual interest charges put <Col N="1296" /> an entirely different complexion on the cost aspects.</P>
    <P>This fundamental change in the financing arrangements pinpoints a weakness in the approach not only to the Howth-Bray scheme but to rapid rail transit in general.  It is simply unrealistic to expect that the Exchequer could finance projects of this nature on a grant basis.  That would be possible only in a situation where conditions of continuing and sustained budgetary surplus existed.  As we all know only too well that is not the case.</P>
    <P>When the Howth-Bray electrification scheme was first proposed in 1977 passenger carryings on the line had been showing a continuing upward trend.  They had increased from 12,600 passengers per day in 1970 to some 32,400 per day in 1979, the last year in which commuter services were not being disrupted by construction works.  By the late seventies the rolling stock and equipment in use on the line had reached the end of its useful life and the question of its replacement had become a matter of some urgency.  CIE proposed the electrification of the line, which was in accordance with the recommendations of the Dublin Rapid Rail Transit Study.</P>
    <P>Subject to certain assumptions it was envisaged that electrified services would meet direct operating costs and that depreciation costs would be more than offset by indirect user benefits.  Electrification had the added advantage that it was part of the recommendations in CIE's Rapid Transit Study which envisaged a city-wide system linking the new western suburbs via an underground network in the city centre with the Howth-Bray line.  While the decision to electrify did not imply a commitment to the full rapid transit system it did prevent it from being automatically ruled out as a posibility if a fully satisfactory case could be made for it in the future.</P>
    <P>The then assessment of the energy situation was also a factor since an electrified system would not be dependent on a single source of energy.  There is little to be gained at this stage in debating whether the project at its original estimated cost of £46.4 million represented good value for money.  That is an issue <Col N="1297" /> that can be decided only on the basis of the perceived value of indirect user benefits and the long-term worth of this substantial addition to infrastructure.</P>
    <P>I can say, however, that I would not today be prepared to seek Government approval for a project of this nature put forward in the same way as the Howth-Bray project.  This must not be taken as criticism of CIE but rather of the lack of suitable appraisal of such proposals by Governments in the past.  Within my own Department I have now a permanent capital committee to monitor and appraise all major capital expenditure proposals in CIE in the future.</P>
    <P>Daunting as the immediate prospects are for the economics of the service, I am hopeful that when introduced next spring it will bring about a substantial improvement in the existing service in terms of frequency, speed and efficiency.  Daylong services are envisaged, serving 25 stations, with trains operating at five-minute intervals during peak periods reducing to 15 minutes off peak.  CIE intend to extend the catchment area of the railway line by the provision of feeder bus services to selected stations.  The board estimate that by 1987 passenger numbers will increase to about 80,000 per day, more than twice the previous best average daily carryings.</P>
    <P>Another major element in CIE's capital programme is the acquisition of 124 carriage units for mainline passenger services.  The new units consist of 94 standard carriages, 15 catering cars and 15 generator vans to be assembled at the Inchicore works in Dublin.  With the new carriages CIE will be able to provide mainline rail facilities of an acceptable standard of comfort and convenience.  It is expected that the first carriages will be available for service early in 1984.  The capital cost of the project at current prices is estimated at about £52 million including VAT of approximately £8 million.</P>
    <P>The renewal of the board's city and provincial bus fleets is also continuing. Deputies will recall that bus deliveries from the factory at Shannon commenced in 1981, and I am sure that all Members of the House will have seen the new buses <Col N="1298" /> on the move throughout the country.  By the end of this year CIE will have taken delivery of 104 single-deck buses and some 366 double-deck buses at a total capital cost of about £68 million.</P>
    <P>Almost since the inception of production at the Shannon plant Government have been concerned about the form of the relationship between CIE and their Shannon supplier.  This concern springs from the fact that the Shannon firm are basically dependent on CIE for orders for buses.  Questions arise as to whether the manufacturing arrangements represent good value as far as CIE are concerned. As an indication of their concern Government commissioned a firm of consultants to carry out a study of the relationship between CIE and their supplier some months ago.  Meantime, the ownership of the Shannon firm changed and as a consequence Bombardier no longer have an interest in the operation.  Manufacture of buses is continuing at the plant, however, under interim arrangements.  I have asked CIE to provide me with their proposals in this respect so that I can submit them to Government in conjunction with the consultant's report.  I hope to have CIE's proposals shortly.</P>
    <P>In addition to the projects I have mentioned, the board's signalling and normal capital programmes are continuing.  The main sources of funding for the latter tend to be Exchequer capital advances and depreciation provisions.  The increased borrowing and guarantee arrangements provided for in the Bill are to enable CIE to continue their capital programme as described.  The new limit of £230 million in respect of capital borrowings, is an increase of £50 million in the existing limit.</P>
    <P>Now to turn to the temporary borrowing question.  Under section 5 of the Transport Act, 1981, CIE may, with my consent and that of the Minister for Finance, incur temporary borrowings of up to £20 million.  This borrowing power is used by CIE to respond to short-term cash shortfalls.  With Government approval, this borrowing facility has also been used to finance the difference between total subvention and deficit, where the total subvention made available <Col N="1299" /> in any one year has been insufficient to meet the board's deficit on subventible activities.</P>
    <P>Over the past couple of years CIE's deficits have exceeded the annual subventions which the Exchequer has been able to make available to the board.  1983 will fall into this category, but in exceptional circumstances.  When the Estimates for 1983 were being prepared in 1982 the then Government put into the Estimates a figure for £86 million compared with an outturn of £109.2 million in 1982.  This was clearly an unrealistic figure from the start which had no basis.</P>
    <P>During the course of the year when deciding their now approach to CIE for the next five years the Government also made realistic provision for the current year.  It was decided that CIE should be asked to live within a deficit of £99 million plus the cost of the public service pay round which, we now know, comes to £5 million.  I am glad to report that CIE can live within £104 million in 1983.  Although this is a reduction of £5 million on last year it is £18 million more than provided for in the Estimates.  Therefore, we provide in this Bill for the temporary borrowing limit necessary to bridge the gap. The deficits in excess of subvention since 1981 are symptomatic of what had become a very substantial problem. Actual State subvention was £85 million in 1981, £96 million in 1982 and £86 million in 1983, a total of £267 million, a sizeable amount of State funding by any standard.</P>
    <P>This year, 1983, marks an important turning point in the affairs of CIE as regards State subvention.  In 1969-1970 CIE's deficit amounted to £3.2 million. Had the increase in deficit been confined to the rate of inflation the board's 1982 deficit would have amounted to some £17.3 million.  The deficit for 1982, however, as I have said, amounted to more than £109 million.  If this rate of increase were to continue I do not see the Exchequer being able to provide the huge sums that would eventually be required for public transport.  Indeed the experience of recent years underlines the dangers of this approach.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1300" /> When I became Minister for Transport late last year the subvention for CIE for 1983 had already been fixed as I have said, at £86 million.  In the review which took place immediately after the Government came into office it was clear that there was no possibility of increasing the subvention beyond that level even though it was recognised that the board's deficit would exceed the subvention.  In the circumstances the only real alternative was to let CIE carry the shortfall by temporary borrowing.  The Government, therefore, decided to promote legislation which would enable CIE to cover the shortfall in that way.  As I mention earlier, that shortfall is expected to work out at about £18 million.</P>
    <P>In reviewing the position for 1983 and future years the Government saw that a new approach was needed for the fixing of the CIE subvention so that the level of State support could be matched by what the Exchequer could afford.  At the same time it was clear that a massive reduction in State subvention could not be achieved overnight without serious adverse repercussions. It was against this background that I tackled the problem.</P>
    <P>With the approval of the Government, I introduced a package of measures in June last to bring about a substantial improvement in CIE's position.  The main features of that package were first, a formula for the settlement of the CIE subvention, which is now determined as 50 per cent of CIE revenue or 33? per cent of expenditure whichever is the lesser; in other words, every £2 earned by the board, in principle, attracts a State subvention of £1, subject to the constraint of the one-in-three on the expenditure side; secondly, subvention moneys will be paid to CIE from 1 January 1984 as revenue, or &ldquo;above the line&rdquo; in accountancy terms; thirdly, CIE are required to achieve a reduction of 12 per cent in expenditure in real terms over five years from 1984, a vital element in getting CIE finances under control; fourthly, and as briefly mentioned earlier, the establishment of a permanent capital committee with representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance and <Col N="1301" /> CIE to appraise and monitor CIE's capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>The subvention formula is a big step forward in the Government's relations with CIE.  It tells CIE quite clearly the type of performance that the Government expect in the years immediately ahead.  In matching the level of subvention to the company's performance we are providing the type of corporate incentive necessary to reverse the deficit trend of recent years.  This, with payment of the subvention &ldquo;above the line&rdquo;, should help to create the conditions where management and staff can be motivated to perform in a more commercial manner.</P>
    <P>The formula is also a discipline on Government.  Subvention will no longer be decided on an arbitrary basis but must be consistent with the formula.  The formula itself is not perfect and may need to be refined but it is a pragmatic basis for measuring Government's contribution to the social aspects of CIE services in the medium term.  Under the new system CIE have the opportunity to operate profitably after bringing the subvention to account.  This incentive is, I believe, a key to motivating substantial improvements in the standard and quality of the board's services.</P>
    <P>It is interesting that in the year of this new approach CIE's deficit will for the first time in 15 years be less than that for the preceding year.  The projected 1983 deficit of some £104 million will be an improvement of £5 million in cash terms on the board's deficit of £109 million for 1982 which, when inflation is taken into account, is an improvement in real terms of approximately 14 per cent.</P>
    <P>A factor that must not be forgotten when considering CIE problems is that governments in the past have often exacerbated such problems.  Examples of this include withholding of increases in fares and rates and the involvement by government in purely commercial or operational aspects of the board's affairs.  I hope that under the formula arrangements this practice will cease, thus allowing CIE to manage their affairs in as commercial a manner as is possible.  It is my intention to discourage all unnecessary political <Col N="1302" /> intervention in the day-to-day affairs of CIE.  If public representatives have problems about services or operations the most efficient way of dealing with them will be to go direct to CIE.  I have, therefore, decided to discontinue the practice of receiving deputations about administrative matters and the like in CIE.  CIE, I am sure, will welcome that development and will be able to demonstrate the responsibility with which they exercise their functions.</P>
    <P>As I said recently to the board, and indeed publicly, there are areas in which there can be substantial improvement in performance by CIE.  One of these is in the industrial relations area.  The numbers employed in CIE, the range of skills, the spread of locations and the variety of conditions under which the staff operate are factors which influence CIE industrial relations.  However, all staff in CIE should realise the damage that is done not just by major strikes but even by relatively small incidents involving very few people over minor issues.</P>
    <P>Absenteeism is another factor to be regretted.  No one should forget that CIE are in the marketplace to sell their transport products.  Time and again the consumer has shown that product reliability is high among his priorities.  In CIE's case, every industrial relations incident damages the board's reliability and credibility, which inevitably increases costs, loses customers and revenue and in the long run defeats the interests of the workers themselves.  With the high cost of private motoring in Ireland, I believe that CIE have a vast potential to win many more customers.  However, this potential can be tapped only if morale improves and the board show in the marketplace that their services are above all else reliable and efficient.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have seen in the media the recent announcement regarding the appointment of a new chairman to take over at the helm in CIE on 1 January next.  I would like to take this opportunity to express the appreciation of the Government and my own thanks to Dr. Liam St. John Devlin for the service to the State which he has given as Chairman of CIE during the last ten years.  Earlier <Col N="1303" /> this year Dr. Devlin had informed me that he would not wish to continue in his post beyond the end of the year.  The chairmanship of CIE is an extremely onerous position which carries an exceptionally heavy burden, and our thanks are due to Dr. Devlin for the dedicated manner in which he has discharged this responsibility during the past decade.  I should also like to welcome Mr. Paul Conlon as the new executive chairman of CIE and, on behalf of this House, to wish him well.</P>
    <P>As it approaches the anniversary of my appointment as Minister for Transport I can say that since my appointment I have had contact, mostly personal contact, with almost every representative interest in the field of inland transport embracing carriers and users as well as outside experts, academics and commentators. During that year, I have taken steps to get some fundamental grasp of the nature and problems of the inland transport industry and especially of the troubled area many of us have, unfortunately, come to associate with CIE.  These contacts have been of immense value to that end but some of them have also been disappointing.  This has been for the very simple reason that some people I have met based their positions on very narrow and subjective views while showing no grasp of the global problems and no potential for an imaginative approach to the problems they identify.  I think there has been a lot of casual thinking on the subject of transport and that the time has come when all who are really concerned will have to review their thinking habits. The magic solutions to transport problems will still remain elusive, but there will never be progress if we all remain entrenched in our views and muddled in our thinking.</P>
    <P>In this debate I should like Deputies to keep uppermost in their minds that the obligation of the Minister for Transport is, first, to the taxpayer so that the liability for CIE is reduced to an acceptable level and, secondly, to transport users so that they will have a service of an acceptable level but at a price which, so far as possible, is acceptable also.  Already in <Col N="1304" /> 1983 considerable progress has been made without substantial cutbacks in services or redundancies.  The four essential improvements may be more difficult, but I am confident that if all minds are applied in the way I suggested in my opening remarks we will achieve results satisfactory to all parties concerned.</P>
    <P>I commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On a philosophic basis I should like to reject the final part of the Minister's statement which was not included in the typescript I got.  I reject it not out of hand but as something to which the House should address itself, namely, whether the taxpayer should be uppermost in the mind of the Minister for Transport or whether the transport users should be first.  The taxpayer must be taken into consideration, but in a Government with collective responsibility I do not think it is the Minister for Transport who should establish such precedence. In fact, his precedence should be for the transport user but, of course, with due care and attention to the taxpayer also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House is one of a long series of Bills to deal with the capital moneys available to CIE.  It is interesting to read the Transport Act, 1974, where £55 million was the borrowing permitted. That replaced section 5 of the 1964 Act. There was also an interesting provision which referred to &ldquo;including money in a currency other than the currency of the State&rdquo;.  It is much more important now to pay attention to that than it was in 1964, nine years before we joined the EEC. The tendency across the board has been to borrow abroad.  When we were dealing with the Bill dealing with telecommunications we mentioned that the tendency to borrow abroad carries risks due to the flux in values of currencies.  This has been a feature of recent years.  I have spoken already in this House about this matter, indicating that while the Bretton Woods agreement has served the western world well for a long time it has now come apart at the seams.  The international financiers should be addressing themselves to the solution of the problems that have arisen because the Bretton Woods agreement is <Col N="1305" /> no longer able to cope with the financial flux in the west.  This is due mainly to the fact that oil has to be paid for in dollars and there is a huge petro-dollar pool.  I think our Minister for Finance could, with profit, push in the EEC for a different system for paying for oil, for the EMS to set up its own currency, pay in its own currency and take the whole problem away from the dollar.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that fuel was a considerable consideration when the decision was taken about the Howth-Bray line.  The figure of £55 million was substituted in 1974 for the figure of £17 million which was covered by the Act immediately preceding it.  The Minister had something to say about the temporary borrowing powers.  The 1974 Act substituted £5 million for £2 million, the latter being from the Act of 1950 as amended by an Act of 1958.  I am emphasising figures to show the changes that has come about in the amount of money, a point made by the Minister at some length.  The aggregate in the 1981 Act was £180 million and he is increasing that by £50 million, chargeable to capital.  The temporary borrowing powers were increased in 1981 to £20 million.  All this indicated that costs have been increasing year by year at an alarming rate.</P>
    <P>I call the attention of the House to the transport statistics contained in the CSO <i>Economic Series 1980-1983</i> published on 13 November 1983.  These figures cover the three years up to April in each case, except in the case of road motor passenger services for 1983 which are covered until May.  The figures are given in thousands. The average weekly figure for railway receipts from passengers, parcels, mails, etc. was £563.1 in 1981 and £612.7 in 1982.  In January 1981 the figure was £437.9; January 1982, £568.4; January 1983, £552.6.  That is a very substantial reduction for January 1983 as compared with January 1982 which must cause some alarm.  There was also a drop in railway receipts in February 1983.  The figures for the month of March show an increase as between 1982 and 1983 from £550.2 to £589.7.  An increase in the figures for April is indicated over the three years.</P>
    <P>The second section gives average <Col N="1306" /> weekly figures of railway receipts from freight trains.  The figure for 1981 was £300.6 and for 1982, £319.4.  The January figures for freight over the three years are as follows: 1981 &mdash; £278.7; 1982 &mdash; £306.7; 1983 &mdash; £378.0.  The figures for February are as follows: 1981 &mdash; £319.9; 1982 &mdash; £319.3; 1983 &mdash; £353.4.  It is interesting to note the trends, and we must take into account the increased charges permitted during the period.  The figures for March are as follows: 1981 &mdash; £247.3; 1982 &mdash; £243.5, a drop; 1983 &mdash; £299.6. The figures for April are as follows: 1981 &mdash;£265.3; 1982 &mdash; £274.7; 1983 &mdash;£310.4.</P>
    <P>One area of considerable worry concerning CIE was related to the continuation of their freight business.  The Department of Transport and the House should give consideration to these trends. It would, however, be more useful if we could consider the figures over a longer period.</P>
    <P>The Minister pointed out that a very substantial percentage of the subvention to CIE was taken up by the railways and we should pay some attention to the statistics. The average weekly figures for passengers carried on the rail services were 294.4 in 1981 and 246.0 in 1982.  We do not have an average for 1983.  We have a basis for comparison for the months January to April.  The January figures are as follows: 1981 &mdash; 282.3; 1982 &mdash; 236.9, a very substantial reduction; 1983 &mdash; 228.7 another reduction.  I would ask the House to reflect on these figures.  For February of 1981 the figure was 280.9; for 1982, 260.6 and &mdash; a slight recovery &mdash; for 1983, 261.5.  Again, it is not encouraging.</P>
    <P>Passengers carried in March 1981, 296.1; March 1982, 235.3 &mdash; a very substantial drop.  There was a little recovery this year to 248.  However, this is still very far from the figure for March 1981.  Passengers carried in April 1981, 285.1; in 1982, 191; 244 &mdash; a recovery, but again 40,000 short of the 1981 figure.</P>
    <P>Rail services, tonnage of goods carried on freight, in thousands of tonnes: 69.3 in April 1981; 74.2 in April 1982; down to 57.3 in April of this year.  In March 1981, it was 67.3; in 1982, 77.5 &mdash; which was an improvement &mdash; but back down <Col N="1307" /> to 61 in March 1983.  In February 1981, 78.2; in February 1982, 80.2; in February 1983, 68.0.  The January figure is the only one which showed a fairly substantial increase &mdash; 62.8 in 1981, 61.3 in 1982 75.3 in 1983.</P>
    <P>Road motor passenger services receipts, again in thousands: for January &mdash; 1981, £1,188.3; for 1982, £1,447.3 and in 1983, £1,887.4.  Looking at the figures given generally, the area in which the greatest increase has taken place seems to be road motor passenger services.  For February 1982, £1,326.0, February 1982, £1,713.4, in 1983, £1,994.4.  For March 1981, £1,317.3; March 1982, £1,655.9; 1983, £1,953.9.</P>
    <P>The April and May figures are also available for all three years: £1,261.5 for April 1981; £1,643.8 for April 1982, £1,881.4 for April 1983, again a substantial increase on that in revenue.  For May 1981, £1,347.4; May 1982, £1,723.1 and May 1983, £1,952.2.  That again shows that road motor passenger services receipts have the right trend and are on the way up.</P>
    <P>All these statistics are important when assessing the general policy to be undertaken by the Minister for Transport and by CIE.  I mentioned this morning, on the Order of Business, a question for the Minister which is relevant to the development of CIE services in Dublin city, namely, what progress has been made with regard to the Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  The Minister said that it would be before the House in due course. I think that we got harder and tighter dates at one stage and perhaps the Minister, in the calmer atmosphere of a Second Stage debate, will be able to tell us when this Bill will be before the House as it is relevant, not merely to the operation of CIE in the provision of buses, but also to the link-in to the Howth-Bray new undertaking.</P>
    <P>The Minister has mentioned, in the announcement of a new policy departure for CIE in June, that one-third of the services are considered social and therefore, that one-third of the expenditure should be in subvention.  This carried implications for the system which he has <Col N="1308" /> worked out for future subventions.  One of the problems which I remember from the Department of Transport was knowing specifically where losses were being incurred.  The thought was that perhaps railways carried the greatest political punch&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I have my own complaint about that.  The thought was that it would be an adroit thing to do to attribute to railways losses which were incurred otherwise, on the basis that this House, or any Government, would find it difficult to do away with the railways and, therefore, that they could be used as a hiding place for losses.  I would not like to interpret the Chair's nod of the head as agreement with what I say.  I am not going to embarrass him, but I know that he is a man of considerable experience in that field.</P>
      <P>The Minister puts the stark options from the McKinsey Report into his speech &mdash; about railways: to keep them; to reduce them; to expand them, or to close them.  He asks two questions: Can we afford to have the railways?  Can we afford not to have the railways?  He complains elsewhere in his speech that McKinsey is short on answers.  I do not find the answers in the Minister's speech, either, and must call the attention of the House to that.  He calls it the £70 million question.  What the House should be told is where specifically money is being lost, on what individual services, in what individual locations, and then this House should fully consider where the subsidy should go and that it be known as subsidy. I agree totally &mdash; I have said this before &mdash; with the Minister's decision to above the line subvention.  This should make it easier for each individual section of the service to be pin-pointed.  It should not be beyond the wit of auditors to indicate exactly where the losses are and decisions can then be made in the light of that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the difficult things with regard, not merely to CIE, but to many semi-State bodies, is to get exact information about the operations of the company. <Col N="1309" /> While I agree with the Minister when he says that political interference with the activities of CIE should be eliminated, nevertheless if this House is called upon year after year to vote a very substantial sum of money to CIE then this House is fully entitled to enquire into the workings of CIE or any other semi-State company. McKinsey point out in their report that one of the areas of difficulty for the Department of Transport is that of securing information.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to hear the Minister say that there were no significant cost overruns in the Howth-Bray electrification scheme.  There is one point I would like to make.  At some stage it was reported to me and the Department of Transport that non-Irish materials, when Irish materials were available, were being used on that particular project.  The Minister should continue to monitor that and see to it that contracts are placed, as far as possible, with Irish producers.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the decision to convert from grant-financing to loan-financing and said that it added £28.6 million to the capital cost.  The Minister did not indicate if he intends to change this situation or if he intends, in the Department of Transport, to deal with the extra charges from the Department's subvention to CIE.  He drew attention to the fact and I would like to know if he has any intention of changing that.</P>
    <P>With regard to extension to Greystones or to Tallaght I would like to know what the Minister's thinking is on that. He said that if he were considering the Howth-Bray proposition now he would not be inclined to favour it.  I have already mentioned that at that particular time the question of availability of fuel was uppermost in the minds of the Government.  I would like to repudiate the Minister's suggestion that the Government did not make a suitable appraisal of the Howth-Bray proposal.  There was no proposal before the Government that I know of during my time in Government in any of three Departments which I served in, which got more consideration, which was subjected to more debate and discussion which indicated strong views on both sides, and the Government decision was <Col N="1310" /> taken only after that long consideration. No argument has been put up that convinces me now that the final decision by the Government was a wrong one.</P>
    <P>I believe that anticipating the results of this venture in the way some people have been doing, and which was quite rightly mentioned by the Minister as being wrong, is a foolish exercise.  It is very important to monitor its success, to see to it that the actual line is properly marketed. It was easy enough to market the commuter traffic.  The Minister said that in the non-rush period of the day there will be a quarter hour service as distinct from a five minute service for the rush periods.  That should provide an excellent service.</P>
    <P>I mentioned several times in the House and in Government the possibility of very serious marketing of that service throughout the summer months.  That particular line will have stations very near many of the best resorts around Dublin. There is there a chance for proper marketing of that line as similar lines are marketed in Spain at the present time. We have a unique opportunity of improving on the most optimistic of the figures. We will wait and see how it will work out, but I believe the potential is great. I would like to reject what the Minister said about lack of suitable appraisal of such proposals by Governments in the past.  As far as that particular project is concerned it was appraised, debated, discussed and a decision was taken after a very long period of discussion.  Every aspect of it was discussed and debated. Everybody with expertise was consulted. I can stand over that statement.  I was not Minister for Transport at the time but I was a member of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about an appraisal of this as something marketable. I am simply saying that full consideration was given to it as a service for the citizens of the area.  The Minister mentioned the permanent capital committee. He spoke about the functions of <Col N="1311" /> the committee to monitor and appraise all major capital expenditure proposed in CIE in the future.  I would like the Minister to tell us how many are on this permanent capital committee.  Are there any outsiders on the committee?  Is it exclusively made up of officers of the Department of Transport or is there any outside expertise on this committee?  Is there any executive from CIE who attends meetings of the capital committee? Is it simply a matter of the committee communicating with CIE, getting their views and getting the views within the Department?  I would like to know what the procedure is, when the committee was established, how many meetings it has held and what exactly it is considering at the moment?  Has the committee been asked to have a look at the rapid rail system?  Is the Tallaght line under debate?  Could we get the views of the committee on the record of the House with regard to such matters as the Tallaght line and the extension from Bray to Greystones.</P>
      <P>The Dublin Transport Authority Task Force have done wonderful work in regard to transport in Dublin City.  When the legislation dealing with that authority was mentioned in the House we were told it was urgent because the task force did not have the necessary statutory teeth to make further progress.  The task force have made great progress and deserve the gratitude of all interested in transport but they had reached the stage where they could not do anything further without statutory powers.  Before I left office I sent the heads of the Bill to the parliamentary draughtsman.  As far as the Howth-Bray line and the movement of passengers by buses through the city are concerned we are expecting great things from the authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The areas of capital expenditure mentioned by the Minister were the electrification of the Howth-Bray suburban rail line, the acquisition of buses, mainline coaches and some other capital works. The Minister's reference to the carriage units was skeletal.  He said it was expected that the first carriages will be available for service early in 1984.  I <Col N="1312" /> gather there was some trouble at the Inchicore works which may have delayed operations.  I should like to know how many standard carriage will be available in 1984.  The Minister mentioned the figure of 124 units, 94 standard carriages, 15 catering carriages and 15 generator vans. I trust the Minister will explain to the House what is happening at the Inchicore works.  That would be useful information for the House.  Are they working on one, three or ten standard carriages, catering cars or generator vans?  I presume the standard carriages will come on service in 1984.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a little vagueness and uncertainty about the position with regard to the delivery of buses.  At the end of 1982 the position was that Bombardier were to produce five buses per fortnight.  They had run heavily ahead of their schedule and that was causing trouble with regard to capital funding.  At that time one of the big difficulties was to get exact information.  My recollection is that CIE owned everything in Bombardier and that the arrangement between Bombardier and CIE was one of supply of buses.  The company had run ahead of schedule and produced more than they had been asked to do, and they were asked to adhere to the production levels originally envisaged.  When the pressure was on to maintain the employment level in Bombardier&mdash;an important consideration&mdash;and for the Government to fund more buses than originally agreed there was talk of export orders.  I was slightly sceptical about the news I got then that the placement of an order was almost imminent.  Iraq and Egypt were mentioned. I am aware that there is a war in progress between Iraq and Iran, but I should like to know if the company at Shannon made any substantial progress with regard to exports.  That important factor was thrown into the argument when we were being asked to keep Bombardier going.</P>
    <P>Will the Minister tell the House the present rate of production and how the new company will relate to CIE?  The Minister should also tell us the progress, if any, that is being made with regard to exports.  I accept that the bus was subjected <Col N="1313" /> to considerable criticism.  I have a habit of talking to as many CIE bus drivers as possible about the bus, and the House will accept that it is not possible to find a better person to give one an idea of the quality of the bus.  During the by-election in Dublin Central I visited Broadstone garage to talk to drivers, and almost without exception they had praise for the Bombardier bus.  I accept that criticisms have been levelled at it from the point of view of pollution, fuel consumption and rattles which developed. However, the drivers felt that the bus was reliable and they were pleased to drive it. I do not think it is possible to have a better test than that.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister about the short-term borrowing facility and the part it is likely to play in the new arrangement with regard to the financing of CIE. With regard to the Minister's statement on the short-term borrowing facility I wonder if we are any further on than we were hitherto as far as the financing of CIE is concerned.  What will happen is that the Government subsidy, even though it will be above the line, will be absorbed and then requests will be made for Government backing for the short-term borrowing.  This would seem to me to defeat the whole purpose of the original exercise.</P>
    <P>The one aspect of the new method of financing CIE which would seem to be desirable is that of giving a percentage of the money earned because, in that, there is an incentive given to earn as much money as possible.  If the board can motivate their workers in all sections, and particularly through its marketing manager on the marketing end, to earn as much money as possible, as a result of which they will be entitled to a percentage of subsidy from the Government, then that should prove to be advantageous.</P>
    <P>There is one point I should like to mention, though with some anger.  That is the Newry bus programme put on by CIE for the Christmas season.  We are in a perilous position from the point of view of employment here now with 200,000 people out of work, a leaked document indicating that it is Government thinking <Col N="1314" /> that this will rise to perhaps 220,000 or 225,000.  While I advocate maximum marketing by a company such as CIE, we should know where we are going, things should be fitted into general policy.  I represent a Border constituency where there is severe trouble being experienced commercially because of the huge gap in prices in certain items, a gap which was established by Government decision, Government policy, by what happened in the last budget through large excise duties having been imposed.</P>
    <P>I might refer in passing to the Minister's interjection about my lack of railways and so on.  Here we have a company heavily subsidised by the taxpayer, including those of my area in a kind of semi-circle between Dundalk and Letter-kenny, providing service to Newry at what appears to me to be an impossibly low price.  Is there anybody monitoring to ascertain whether that service is making money?  I cannot see how it could make money.  Or, if it is making money, the unfortunate citizens of this country paying fares in the normal course of events are being rooked.  The anger felt in areas around the Border over this decision of CIE has reached me.  I have received a number of letters and very angry telephone calls about the matter. Such citizens very rightly point out that, as taxpayers, they are subsidising CIE while CIE are now subsidising people to travel and shop outside the Republic of Ireland, going into the Six Counties to do their shopping.  I do not think that is right.  When I maintain that I advocate maximising the marketing end of CIE, and I do, I am saying also that it should be done only by taking a general look at what we are endeavouring to do in this country.  At present the youth section of the Fianna Fáil organisation in towns around the Border are distributing leaflets asking people to buy goods manufactured and on sale in this country, that jobs are dependent on it, so that shops will not continue to close or lay off one or two staff.  I am afraid it has to be said bluntly that this blight that has come about has been by way of Government imposts and must be negatived in some way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1315" /> I notice that in the course of his remarks the Minister referred to a permanent capital committee.  He gives somewhat more detail near the end of his speech than earlier when he said:</P>
    <P>Fourthly, and as briefly mentioned earlier, the establishment of a Permanent Capital Committee with representatives from my Department, the Department of Finance and CIE to appraise and monitor CIE's capital expenditure.</P>
    <P>He does say there is an input from CIE. I would warn him about the Department of Finance.  The one job of the Department of Finance is to see to it that the Department of Transport get as little money as possible.  Of course, the Minister for Transport must fight his battle, as I am sure he will, for his Department, around the Cabinet table.  I should like an assurance from the Minister that this permanent capital committee was not a dodge thought up by the Department of Finance.  In recent years&mdash;and it is incumbent on Ministers other than the Minister for Finance to fight it&mdash;there has been a strong attempt made by the Department of Finance to grab every other Government Department by the throat.  I know the Minister for Transport will fight that tendency so far as his Department is concerned. The Department of Finance should be told that it is an important Department, but that it is the servant of the Government, that officials in the Department going on permanent committees, semi-permanent committees, <i>ad hoc</i> committees, or just paying a visit when the Book of Estimates is being put together are simply agents of that Department.  Certainly it is the job of the Minister for Finance to see to the nation's finances.  I suppose it is the job of his officials to excercise themselves fully in that regard.  It is also a very dangerous thing to allow them too much of a say and too much strength in the councils of Government.</P>
    <P>The statement of the Minister on what was a written not a typed section, worries me somewhat about the possibility that financial considerations will be placed <Col N="1316" /> first.  I agree with him fully that the taxpayer is providing a large subsidy to CIE. That same taxpayer <i>qua</i> customer of CIE is entitled to a good service <i>a fortiori</i> because of his contribution in tax apart altogether from his having to pay the fares.  As far as CIE are concerned the first consideration must be to provide a good service.</P>
    <P>On occasion Governments in the past have decided that, on account of escalating inflation and the hardships that imposes on workers and citizens, CIE should not be allowed to raise fares.  That has happened and, in circumstances of galloping inflation, can be justified.</P>
    <P>With regard to the hotels section of CIE I have already stated my commitment that the approach to them should be a fully commercial one, should be encouraged and that I am fully in favour of such approach.</P>
    <P>The Minister calculated that one third of the total activities of CIE should be regarded as social.  However, we must not allow what I would call Finance thinking to get into service Departments which are providing a service for the people.  To my mind &ldquo;Finance thinking&rdquo; means balancing the books above all things, and if the customer is to be considered at all he should be away down the list.  Economists always stress book balancing. Trade unionists stress the importance of working conditions, salaries and wages.  The whole thing should be geared to providing a service for the customers. The Finance officials are customers, the trade unionists are customers, but very often sight is lost of that aspect of transport, not merely internal transport.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister about the importance of industrial relations.  It is frustrating for a Minister for Transport, for the Department and the CIE board but above all for citizens, when one person, unofficially, can carry a placard and disrupt major bus services in this city which is where the impact is most felt. We had the 6.30 a.m. news summary announcing that one person with a placard outside a bus station had caused buses Nos. such-and-such to be off the road.  It is unpalatable, and any mechanism that <Col N="1317" /> can be developed in the CIE industrial relations field to eliminate that should be used because the people who are suffering are the fellow workers of the man who is toting his placard, in many instances without union backing, destroying people's day.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to absenteeism. I do not have figures on this in relation to CIE.  We are blamed for its prevalence here but I do not know if we are worse than elsewhere.  I particularly do not have figures in relation to CIE.  As the Minister said, they are in the market place selling a product and the commitment should be not merely at board level but right down to the workers.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by the Minister to morale.  On occasions very serious attempts were made by Ministers for Transport and by the CIE Board to improve morale, to build up pride in the operation, but it must be admitted that these attempts failed.  There is not high morale in the company and the difficulties seems to be increasing.  I hope that the whole industrial relations question, absenteeism and morale will be the first concern of the new executive chairman, Mr. Conlon.  The outgoing chairman, Dr. St. John Devlin has given ten years of dedicated service to CIE.  Anybody who has met him will vouch for his seriousness of purpose and his dedication to hard work while he was in charge of CIE.</P>
    <P>I welcome Mr. Conlon as the new executive chairman. He comes with a fine reputation for efficiency in various other difficult jobs.  Probably this is the most difficult he has tackled. I welcome him especially because he is an Ulsterman. We have had a Munsterman and now we have Mr. Conlon from Ulster.  I hope that in his period as head of CIE he will make progress in CIE, particularly in regard to the Howth-Bray project.</P>
    <P>It becomes necessary to mention McKinsey again in this respect.  The circumstances of the publication of that report were unique in Ireland's political history because in 19 months we had three general elections with consequent changes of Ministers: we had Deputies Reynolds, Mitchell, Wilson and Mitchell again. I do not think it would be fair to <Col N="1318" /> criticise any of them for not having made clear-cut decisions on McKinsey.</P>
    <P>However, the Minister now in the House has had 12 months, more than I had, and we will be expecting some positive proposals from him in the near future on McKinsey.  I hope the Minister will give me an idea of when we might expect some word about a Government decision on McKinsey.  A new executive chairman is coming in and it would be reasonable to wait until he and the Minister can put their heads together with regard to it.  It is not my intention to make a political point, but a new executive chairman will have his own views and ideas.  When he was asked about the McKinsey Report he said he had not read it at the time he was appointed.  Perhaps that is all the better because his mind will be fresher, clearer and untrammelled by the various pressures let loose in a very calculated way when the McKinsey Report was first published.</P>
    <P>We have discussed the electrification of the Howth-Bray railway and the acquisition of buses and we covered the provision of mainline coaches.  When I was leaving the Department provision had been made for other capital works and I would be pleased if the Minister can give us information about capital works.  I welcome the Bill and look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I will begin by saying I believe there is a great case to be made for subsidising public transport.  I hope, as in so many debates on CIE, that we will not get deflected into pure concentration on deficits as the sole measure of performance of a public transport company. Urban transport has the obvious benefit of efficiency in energy and land use as well as environmental gains from a public transport system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the same time we must be very conscious of the fact that the expansion in the subvention to CIE is occurring at a time when the social benefits that the State ought to be encouraging seem to be on the decline.  In other words, what we have seen in the last ten or 15 years has been a big growth in deficits on rail and Dublin city buses at a time when they <Col N="1319" /> were losing passengers and barely maintaining freight. We are not financing a desirable new service on the basis of social needs.  It seems we are being pushed into financing a deficit which is occurring through a drop in the number of passengers.  That is a fundamental issue we must face.</P>
    <P>In 1970 there was no deficit in the Dublin bus service, but in 1983 we have a deficit of £22 million which must be met ultimately by the taxpayer.  In that period we had a decline in the number of passengers using Dublin city buses by about one-third, while at the same time the population in the city was growing by one-third. There has been an increase in the number of buses provided in the city This means we are being forced to subsidise an operation whose losses result from a reduction in the number of passengers rather than losses which can be justified on social grounds.</P>
    <P>When we look at the importance of public transport in the householders' global transport budget, it is worrying to see that it has declined progressively.  It is now about 6 per cent of the householders' budget and the other 94 per cent is for private motoring costs.  I am worried about the way the growth in the public subvention has grown in the last ten years to provide a service which is becoming increasingly marginal to the public.  Not only is the number of passengers using the service falling but the passengers are not getting the benefit of cheaper fares. We might be justified subventing CIE if passengers were enjoying lower fares, but the reality is that over the last ten years bus fares in Dublin have grown by 5 per cent above the inflation rate.  It is against that background that we must ask fundamental questions about the structure of the public transport system and what we are paying for.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made proposals for a new CIE mandate.  He is to be commended for giving CIE a definite target for a number of years ahead.  His strategy is to give a global 33 per cent subsidy on all costs across CIE services &mdash; rail, bus and provincial bus services &mdash; and to require a 2½ per cent cut each year over <Col N="1320" /> the next five years, which will mean a cut in the State subsidy of 2½ per cent each year.  I understand the thinking behind that proposal &mdash; to set up a system where the Government can step back from the details of administration of the transport system and leave it to CIE to decide issues such as fare setting, cost economies and what they mean in reality, route cuts, staff lay offs and so on.</P>
    <P>There is a certain validity in telling CIE that the Government will set them a broad outline and will step back from making administrative decisions, but I must disagree with the Minister on a number of points.  As Deputy Wilson said, CIE have singularly failed in the past to meet the various targets set for them.  Admittedly, they were annual targets and perhaps Governments were tempted to set them unrealistic terms, but the fact is that CIE have not succeeded in staying within any financial target set for them.  I do not see any new sanction in the Minister's suggestion by which he can guarantee that CIE will live within the new formula.  This year CIE, by their own borrowing, will pick up the sum the Government have left them short.  This is very worrying.  I do not think we could ever envisage that the answer to Government deficit financing in CIE was to allow them to raise the loan themselves on the basis of Government guarantees at the end of the day.  I am worried that unless there is some way of sanctioning the meeting of the various targets being set by CIE, this new proposal will fall flat on its face.</P>
    <P>But there are more fundamental questions as well.  We all recognise that there is a social value in public transport worthy of the taxpayers' subsidy, but I suggest it is not uniform for all CIE services.  I do not think it is true to say that the value of carrying freight by rail or road would have the same social desirability as carrying elderly passengers.  It is begging the question if the Government and the Dáil step back and say that in their view a 33 per cent subsidy should apply equally to the commercial transport sector, the private passenger sector, the city versus rural services and so on.  If the taxpayer is to make these subsidies available it is <Col N="1321" /> essential that he knows exactly where the losses are occurring, and he should then decide what subsidies are to be made on the basis of what he deems to be the social values coming from those services. In this proposal to grant a 33 per cent subsidy right across the board, we have stepped back from that decision which, in my view, is the job of the Government. Even if the Government want to step back, the reality is that if politically sensitive decisions are made about cutting particular services or increasing fares, motions will be put down in Private Members' time and the Government will have to make decisions.  I do not think we should be forced into such a position.</P>
    <P>The Government and the Department should consider the social desirability of the services at a very early stage and base their subvention on that analysis.  It is worth while pointing out that both NESC and McKinsey, who reported on public transport, recognised the need for a more active Government role in this sphere. They saw decisions on pricing and major changes in the transport system as the job of the Government.  Here we are, going against what has been recommended.  I submit that there is a need to look again at that system of subventing.  Another aspect that should be borne in mind is that even where there is a social case for subsidising &mdash; and we accept there is a loss which must be subsidised from State funds &mdash; it is not necessarily correct that the loss incurred by CIE should be picked up by the taxpayer.  The subsidy should be based on least cost providers of transport and we should not rule out the possibility of that by using transporters other than CIE.  The door is closed to some extent on that option by this global subsidy.</P>
    <P>I am encouraged to learn that the major decisions on the structure of CIE, as discussed by McKinsey, are under consideration.  Once again, I feel that the global subsidy undermines the possibility of making the sort of decisions McKinsey envisaged.  He was envisaging the division of public transport into different spheres of operation.  For example, Dublin city transport would be a separate organisation.  That possibility would be <Col N="1322" /> undermined by an across the board subsidy. There is a danger, as Deputy Wilson pointed out, that CIE tend to look upon themselves in the light of a railway company primarily and the logic in splitting the company is to try to set separate transports for rail and for bus.  That possibility should not be lost in setting a five-year target which would not allow looking at Dublin city buses separately.</P>
    <P>To enforce that point I would like to quote from a report of 2 July when Dr. Liam St. John Devlin responded to the Minister's new system.  He said, as reported in <i>The Irish Times,</i> that the overall Government subvention of 33 per cent cost would not be applied uniformly. The railway runs at about 50 per cent of this total cost and generally on the buses we work to about a 23 per cent subvention. At the moment the Dublin city bus service runs at 76 per cent of revenue and we would have to lift that to about 82 per cent which would leave us sufficient to maintain the railway.  He went on to say that the gap on the railway between 51 and 52 per cent of revenue and 33 per cent subvention can only be made up by reducing the subvention on the Dublin city bus and the provincial buses. Obviously there is an intention in CIE to use the global guidelines given by the Minister in a way that will victimise Dublin city transport in order to support the railway.  That is worrying.  A decision such as that should be made by the Government rather than by the board of CIE.</P>
    <P>I would like to turn now to some other aspects.  I welcome, in conjunction with the Minister and Deputy Wilson, the appointment of Paul Conlon as the new executive chairman.  I have no doubt there will be a plethora of advice handed out to him.  I would ask him to address himself to one problem in particular in relation to Dublin city bus services.  I refer to the decline in passengers. Although one of the contributing factors to this decline has been the growth in car ownership, that is not the sole reason why passengers are leaving the bus service in such vast numbers.  Inflexibility has contributed in some measure to this decline.  The principal weakness is that <Col N="1323" /> CIE seem to lack a marketing arm in their promotion of Dublin city buses. They do not seem to be conscious of passenger needs and what is required if they are to attract and maintain passengers. The last marketing analysis took place back in 1971.  The sort of thing I am talking about is knowing from where one's passengers are coming, what market share there is of school goers and of women going to work.  It is only on the basis of that information a service can be provided in response to need.  There is a serious lack of that sort of information. There is even a serious lack of interest in such information.  The new chairman must look at that aspect because without proper marketing and the provision of the sort of services passengers need the decline in passengers will continue.</P>
    <P>I cannot recall, and this extends over a number of years, any advertising of new packages for bus users in Dublin.  CIE should be thinking on the lines of a new deal for Dublin city bus users.  That has to be contrasted with an attitude to the Sunday rail services they run.  McKinsey recommended that these services should be closed down because they had no longer any social value.  He recommended that this service could, without serious disruption, be closed down. Actually CIE are promoting that service while, at the same time, not offering any better deal to the hard pressed city bus traveller.  There is a wrong approach to marketing.  We have not had a route and frequency review in Dublin for many years despite radical changes in population. The same basic services continue.  It is high time that situation was examined.</P>
    <P>Again, if we want to attract passengers the fare structure must be examined.  It is far too rigid.  There should, for instance, be a single fare if one is using a bus from the north side to the south side instead of having to change buses and pay two separate fares.  That pushes up the cost to the traveller especially where minimum fares are operated.  There has been no introduction of off-peak fares designed to attract passengers.  People should be encouraged to use the bus even if they are only travelling to the next stop. <Col N="1324" /> Very often one sees buses travelling with very few passengers.  Short journeys should be encouraged.  There is no need, outside of peak hour traffic, to have minimum fares.</P>
    <P>CIE have been very slow about locations for selling tickets.  Such outlets would attract more people.  The failure to attract people at off peak times is a big problem.  About 40 per cent of the fleet is required for peak time usage.  We have, therefore, a very under-utilised bus fleet at various times in the day.  That is pushing up the cost to the taxpayer eventually. The onus is on CIE to look at how they can attract people to take advantage of their transport.  There have been a number of reports in recent weeks about one-man bus negotiations.  These negotiations appear to be moving towards a conclusion.  If there is agreement on that plus a movement to smaller and more reliable buses, that will give CIE a unique opportunity to start looking at the possibility of greater flexibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have decided to include additional diseases in the list of diseases prescribed under the occupational injuries benefit scheme.  The additional diseases are occupational deafness, occupational asthma, occupational vitiligo, angiosarcoma of the liver, osteolysis of the terminal phalanges of the fingers, infection by streptococcus suis and non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis.</P>
      <P>I also propose to remove certain restrictions which apply at present in the case of some diseases and to broaden the categories of employments in respect of certain other diseases.  I expect to sign regulations to give effect to these decisions within the next few days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the scheme provides that a person who is insured against personal injury caused by an accident arising in the course of his employment is also insured against any prescribed disease.  Naturally there is a list of prescribed diseases.  I have been revising and extending this list fairly considerably. <Col N="1329" /> I expect to sign the revised regulations next week.  This will also give me an opportunity to replace previous regulations with more comprehensive regulations.  I will take the opportunity to change the format of the presentation. The diseases will be grouped into four categories by broad causative agents in line with EEC and ILO practice.  The improvements will be broadly welcomed and the restrictions will be eased.</P>

      <P>Rather than adding new diseases to the prescribed list, should not the Minister ensure that anybody who suffers from a disease as a result of his occupation, or any widow whose husband died from an occupational disease or occupational injury, is catered for in the social welfare code?  If outside medical officers and medical officers in the Department are satisfied that a person suffered from a disease as a result of his work he should receive occupational benefit irrespective of whether the disease is on the prescribed list.  Now that he is reviewing the list, would it not be better for him to do away with it and accept medical opinion outside and inside his own Department?</P>

These illnesses must be verifiable to my Department, otherwise anybody could claim on the basis of a medical certificate that he suffers from an occupational illness.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The annual cost of extending dental benefit in the manner suggested would be of the order of £4.6 million in a year.  Having regard to the current critical state of the public finances I regret that I do not have any resources to meet such an extension.  It is, however, a proposal which I will keep in mind for consideration when financial circumstances improve.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Given the almost constant reiteration of the important part played by mothers staying at home and not being in paid employment, will the Minister not accept that it is a disgrace that they should be discriminated against in this way and that some effort should be made in the coming budget to change the system whereby they are deprived of this type of treatment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I very much regret that in the context of the 1984 Estimates I could not contemplate giving further <Col N="1332" /> benefit to 300,000 persons.  The Deputy is a confirmed advocate of not increasing PRSI rates.  In order to extend this benefit one would have to increase substantially the rates of pay related social insurance, and the Deputy's party are adept at explaining why people should not have to pay PRSI.  We cannot have it both ways.  The cost of extending the scheme to cover an extra 300,000 persons would be a further £4.6 million.  Under the dental benefit scheme operated by the health boards, dental benefit is available to holders of medical cards and their wives and dependants.  Forty per cent of the population are covered by medical cards and they qualify for dental benefit, including their wives and dependants. The scheme has been substantially improved and new dental appointments have been made.  Much as I would wish to extend the scheme, the additional money is not available.</P>

      <P>Any insured persons, and that includes women who are insured, provided they satisfy certain statutory contribution conditions on their own insurance, qualify under the scheme. There are 620 dentists operating the scheme throughout the country and the insured person does not pay any portion of the cost in the case of fillings, extractions and scaling.  In the case of all other treatments the insured person pays a proportion of the cost.  The figure of £4.6 million has been very carefully costed. We monitor the scheme very carefully and we know the average price per treatment. The addition of 300,000 persons would cost £4.6 million.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when he proposes to change the social welfare code to allow disabled couples to qualify for a free telephone rental allowance, even if there is an able-bodied person living in the <Col N="1334" /> house so long as that person is under 16 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme was introduced so that people living alone would be enabled to have access to assistance, medical or otherwise, when the need arose.  The scheme, when introduced, was confined to persons receiving old age type pensions but was subsequently extended to other categories who were considered to be equally deserving of consideration.</P>
      <P>An exception to the living alone condition was made in the case of persons otherwise qualified but who are living only with persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon aid in an emergency.  I am, however, having the qualifying conditions of the scheme reviewed with a view to seeing whether the present arrangements concerning children in the household under 16 years of age might impose hardship in individual cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is obviously aware that when two disabled persons living together have a child who is not disabled, once that child is even one year old the disabled couple are not entitled to free telephone rental.  Will he agree that that is inequitable and that the child being in the house in no way relieves the hardship endured by the two disabled people?  I ask the Minister to review the regulations to allow a free telephone rental to apply to people in this category until such time as the child concerned is at the age of earning his or her own living.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the large number of people unemployed for a lengthy continuous period of time and of the differences between rates for long-and short-term social welfare payments, he will consider categorising unemployment assistance as a long term benefit when people have been in receipt of it for a certain minimum time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no formal system of categorising payments into short-term and long-term payments, and the question as to which payments are to be increased is a matter which is normally considered in the context of the budget. I am, however very conscious of the situation of the long-term unemployed and this year, for the first time, an additional 5 per cent increase in payments specifically for persons unemployed for over 15 months was provided with effect from October.  In this way, unemployment assistance recipients who have been unemployed for 15 months or more will in future have this built-in increase in their rates of payment as a permanent feature.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to clarify his statement that there is no formal categorising into short-term and long-term payments.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no statutory categorisation of benefits as such.  A person could be on disability benefit for three or four weeks and, traditionally, that is regarded as short-term benefit.  On the other hand, a person could be on disability benefit for 12 months and one might argue that that should be long-term benefit.  Likewise, the prisioner's wife's allowance is generally regarded as long-term, although a person might be in receipt of that allowance for a very short or a very long period&mdash;eight to ten years or 12 months.  The classification of payments has been purely on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis, budget by budget, and there is no method by which one could categorise such benefits as long-term or short-term.</P>

      <P>To the extent that, for example, this year the Government decided that unemployment assistance recipients who have been out of work for at least a year and three months would be categorised as long-term recipients because they would be on the very basic rate of unemployment assistance.  They were categorised as long-term and a 5 per cent increase was given to 43,000 recipients. One could argue that if a period of a year were decided on, a larger number of persons would be involved.  This is an <i>ad hoc</i> definition under the Act.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he accepts that under the Social Welfare (Variation of Rates of Unemployment Assistance) Regulations, 1983, anomalies have arisen affecting certain categories of unemployment benefit recipients; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Variation of Rates of Unemployment Assistance) Regulations, 1983 gave effect to the Government's decision to increase by 5 per cent the payments to people who have been continuously unemployed for 15 months or more.  Since the maximum period for which unemployment benefit is continuously payable is 15 months, it was not, therefore, intended that the increase would apply to that category. They can qualify for the 5 per cent increase only when they go on to unemployment assistance having exhausted their entitlement to unemployment benefit. I am aware that the new rate of unemployment assistance payable to the long-term unemployed is higher than the reduced rate of unemployment benefit payable in certain cases after the first six months of unemployment, but as the measure was intended for the benefit of persons who have been unemployed for <Col N="1338" /> at least 15 months I do not regard this as an anomaly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for wishing to help the long-term unemployed, those having been unemployed for more than 15 months.  I ask him to accept that in granting that commendable and necessary increase, which sets the rate of one category higher than another, he has given an example of that higher category as a husband, wife and three children&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I am illustrating the point of the question.  A husband and wife on unemployment benefit with three children receive £74.24.  On unemployment assistance under the new regulation they will receive £75.10.  In addition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not accept that the fuel allowance scheme, butter scheme, electricity allowance and so forth should also be covered for the lower category which is now those on unemployment benefit?  Whether he accepts it or not, there is a definite anomaly arising out of this decision.  I commend his decision, but it did not go far enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of the 5 per cent order was a deliberate intention to make a special provision for the long-term unemployed over and above that being paid to those who could not be described as having finally exhausted their unemployment benefits. I see the point which the Deputy is making. Towards the end of the 15 months to which a person normally has entitlement to unemployment benefit, in certain instances if they have a reduced unemployment contribution then they get a reduced rate of benefit towards the end of 15 months.  That would be lower than the maximum in unemployment assistance. <Col N="1339" /> It was the intention to give particular assistance to those who were out of work for more than 15 months.  There has to be a starting point, and if the anomaly is in favour of UA I do not regard it as an anomaly but a discrimination to the extent of a pound or two in favour of long-term unemployment assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the point the Minister is making about positive discrimination in favour, but I ask him to accept that the degree to which that has been made here is too great.  I feel the scheme available to those on unemployment assistance should apply to the category of unemployment benefit recipients.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that, because it must be pointed out that in addition to unemployment benefit the vast majority of people claiming unemployment benefit also get pay-related benefit and, for a substantial period during which they were on unemployment benefit, they would also have pay-related benefit and their position, relative to the long-term unemployed, would be that bit more favourable.  They would be more favourably placed, so that the total amount of money paid to them would be substantially higher than that paid to those on unemployment assistance.</P>

      <P>As already announced, a double payment will be made in the week ending 9 December 1983 to recipients of the following Social Welfare payments:&mdash; old age, retirement, blind, invalidity and occupational injury pensions and payments for widows and orphans, deserted wives, unmarried mothers, single women and prisoners' wives.  The double payment will also be made to recipients of the following health allowances &mdash; disabled person's maintenance allowance, infectious diseases maintenance allowance, blind welfare allowance and domiciliary care allowance for handicapped children.  It is not proposed to go beyond these categories.</P>
      <P>These are the same categories who benefited from a double payment in 1980, 1981 and 1982.  They do not include persons receiving unemployment assistance, supplementary welfare allowance, disability benefit or the dependants of persons recieving short term benefits.</P>
      <P>This year for the first time, with effect from the beginning of October, a special increase was made in the rates of unemployment assistance for the long term unemployed.  This permanent increase, which also applies to adult and child dependents, is payable to those who have been continuously unemployed for 15 months or more.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who have been receiving disability benefit for 12 months or more and <Col N="1346" /> who are likely to remain permanently incapable of work may apply to be transferred to invalidity pension, which qualifies for the Christmas double payment.</P>
    <P>Supplementary welfare allowance is, in many cases, payable as a supplement to the social welfare and health benefits which will qualify for the double payment.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the long term social welfare terminology arose from the national understanding of 1980 and that it was the intention then that &ldquo;long term&rdquo; would mean particularly those on unemployment assistance?  Will the Minister define what is meant by &ldquo;long term&rdquo;?  Will the Minister accept that it will have to be the same as the movement from disability to invalidity benefit, which is normally one year?  Will the Minister accept that many of those who were on unemployment assistance in 1980 are still in receipt of the same type of benefit?  That is the position in my constitutency.  Will the Minister accept that those in that category should be dealt with on the basis of being in receipt of a long term benefit?</P>

      <P>I made the point trenchantly in reply to these five questions that what is being paid out to more than half a million people this year, 404,000 recipients and their 330,000 dependents, is precisely the same, no more and no less, as was paid out last year, the previous year and the year before that in accordance with the national understanding.  I found it hypocritical in the extreme of Deputy Woods yesterday to lead people to Leinster House and say that they should get more than he paid on the same date in 1982. That is the type of nonsense we are faced with.  I should like to remind the Deputy that the long term unemployed received a special 5 per cent increase in the first week in October and have been receiving it since.  The type of propaganda being worked out by two parties in relation to this for narrow political gain and indicating that I have introduced some type of cut-back &mdash; I am not accusing Deputy Bell of this &mdash; is wrong, hypocritical and <Col N="1347" /> creating expectations of an entitlement which was not there since 1980 and is not there this year.</P>

This Christmas, as last year, we are paying 228,000 old age pensioners and 15,000 dependants, 14,000 widows and orphans and 6,000 dependants.

In all the categories mentioned, down to the health allowances and occupational injury benefits, all the dependants are paid, a total of 130,000 dependants or 400,000 payments.

But I make the point to the House that we are now paying approximately £12 million a week of taxpayers' money to <Col N="1350" /> cater for the needs of the 200,000 people out of work.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Question Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>Statistics are not kept of the length of time taken to process appeals.  Appeals are currently being received at a rate of some 16,500 annally and this figure is increasing.  The length of time involved in each case can vary considerably depending on each matter at issue and many cases require further investigation or inquiry before a decision can be given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no specific proposals at the present time to change the system of social welfare appeals.  The system is kept under continuous review in the light of its performance and every effort is made by reviewing administrative arrangements <Col N="1352" /> to improve the Department's ability to cope with an increasing workload.</P>
    <P>While the system may have drawbacks, generally speaking I am satisfied that it performs well in providing a relatively quick, inexpensive and equitable service to claimants in accordance with the requirements of the Social Welfare legislation on which it is based.</P>
    <P>It must be borne in mind that many of the more radical proposals which are sometimes made in relation to the appeals system, such, for example, as the setting up of a tribunal or tribunals would involve considerable extra resources and would undoubtedly lengthen considerably the period taken to process appeals.</P>
    <P>It is also relevant to mention that the office of Ombudsman, which will commence to function in January next, will provide an additional point of recourse to claimants who may be dissatisfied with the handling of their cases on appeal.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the last part of the Minister's reply, to the effect that people will have reference to the Ombudsman in January next, is realistic. We are talking about people who are dependent for their livelihood on unemployment assistance.  Surely the Minister will accept that the present system was introduced way back in the thirties at a time when a very small number of people were unemployed compared with today? Will the Minister accept that, in view of the number of young people who are unemployed, and the numbers unemployed over a long number of months, there is a lot of frustration felt as a result of it taking four to five months to have a claim processed?  The Minister must realise that the system&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that in the processing of a claim for unemployment assistance the documentation goes through four or five different sections of his Department, eventually finding its way to Townsend Street in Dublin, has to back down the line and that this is the cause of the delay?  Would <Col N="1353" /> the Minister not consider decentralising the administration of unemployment assistance, allowing the employment exchange managers take the decision without the documentation having to go to Dublin, particulary in regard to claims emanating from rural areas?  Taking your own constituency, a Cheann Comhairle, the documentation goes from the branch manager in Clones to Dundalk, back to the room next door to the branch manager, to the social welfare officer &mdash; it may go to his inspector &mdash; back to Dundalk and then on the Townsend Street, Dublin, where a decision is taken.  Surely in this day and age it should not be necessary to have an application for unemployment assistance travel round the country, it should be possible to have the decision taken locally and have payment effected within two or three weeks.</P>

      <P>In a situation in which there are some 16,500 appeals lodged, in which the 3,500 people working in my Department are subjected to enormous pressure, due to the staff embargo, and have been handling workloads which have increased by 50 to 60 per cent in individual cases, I do not consider that, in such extreme circumstances, a delay of approximately two weeks in Dublin in arranging for an appeal to be heard, or of four weeks outside of Dublin, is abnormal.  I have been bringing considerable pressure to bear on the staff of the Department to deal with all appeals as expeditiously as possible.  I can only say I have received quite exceptional co-operation from the staffs of exchanges and the head office of the Department during the past 12 months, although they are working under the most severe pressure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we could improve some of the information relating to appeals, particularly that being made available to claimants, by trying to get rid of some of the outmoded forms, the terminology used in those forms and explaining entitlements <Col N="1354" /> more directly and simply to claimants, by and large the system at present, despite all its shortcomings, is working as well as possible.  I am currently examining the appeals procedure.  I have met a number of organisations.  I propose to continue my consultations with these to improve the administrative structures.</P>

      <P>The outbreak of poultry disease in County Monaghan was first reported to my Department on 21 November.  Immediate steps were taken to restrict movement into and out of the affected premises, and an infected area of five kilometres radius was declared within which movement of poultry and poultry products was prohibited except under permit.  Examination of specimens disclosed a strain of avian influenza affecting turkeys.  Three premises have been affected by the disease, all situated in close proximity in the Emyvale/Glaslough area.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1356" /> No new outbreak of the disease has been reported since 30 November, and it is accordingly possible that, thanks to prompt action by all concerned, the disease has now been contained.  However it is as yet too early to be certain of this.</P>
    <P>All poultry found on the affected premises were slaughtered and buried under the supervision of my Department's veterinary officers, who are maintaining continuous monitoring of all poultry premises in the area.

Does he agree that the last outbreak was notified to the Department on 30 November?  However, on RTE News on 5 December there was reference to an outbreak, and that caused a lot of concern and did great damage by pinpointing the matter at that time.  I ask the Minister to ensure that there will be adequate compensation for those who lost stock.</P>

      <P>There were three outbreaks, all in close proximity in a confined area.  The first two were detected on 21 November and the third on 30 November.  There have not been any further outbreaks.  The total number of birds slaughtered are 6,300 turkeys and 28,000 broilers.  The broilers were not affected by the disease but they could have been potential carriers and we found it necessary to slaughter them.  We hope to pay compensation before Christmas.  It will amount to about £150,000.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister accede to a request from the producers to have the Border closed to one designated outlet which would ensure proper supervision?  Would the Minister consult through the Department of Foreign Affairs with Departments of Agriculture <Col N="1357" /> in other countries to ensure that the embargo on the exports of ducks will be lifted?  We have the only duck processing plant in the country, all the produce of which is for export.  We are now faced with the situation that the ducks that have been processed and in cold storage 20 miles from the outbreak are affected by a 65-day embargo from the date of the last outbreak.  I ask the Minister, through the Department of Foreign Affairs, to ensure that those producers will be allowed to export.  That is a major industry in the area.  Most of the birds put on the market are frozen and had been in cold storage months prior to the outbreak.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I expressed concern that the growth in the subvention to CIE had emerged not so much as an explicit social subsidy decided by the Government for worthy transport services but rather due to a decline in passenger numbers of the various modes of transport provided by the company.  This is a worrying feature particularly at a time when the public have to face fare increases five per cent higher than the inflation rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also questioned the Minister's response to the problem of the CIE deficit in establishing a global subsidy that would not take account of the different <Col N="1393" /> types of service, not all of which deserved equal treatment in terms of taxpayers' subsidies.  I was concerned about this global subsidy because I believe it is the Government, not CIE, who should decide which parts of the transport organisation should attract subsidies.  If social needs are identified by Government it is only right that the Government make sure that the subsidies go to that social need.  I felt that ultimately decisions about fares and major changes in services would be forced into the political arena and we could not hope to leave them to be decided non-politically by CIE.  There is a role for Government in deciding such issues of policy as McKinsey and the NESC pointed out.  The essence of the McKinsey or any other proposal for structural reform within CIE involves not a single global approach to the various types of transport service provided, but rather a separate approach setting different targets for each and deciding subventions should they be necessary separately. While the global approach adopted by the Minister is admirable in that it is providing a framework within which CIE should work, I would be anxious if this were envisaged as a permanent structure for CIE's financing.  The Minister must take on himself much more refined instruments for setting policy for public transport.</P>
    <P>I was asking the new executive chairman of CIE, Mr. Paul Conlon, when he takes up office, to look in particular at the service levels provided for patrons of the Dublin city bus service.  The lack of any market analysis as to which passengers are using the service, what market penetration he would have with school-goers, working wives or working women, has prevented CIE coming up with the proper response to the needs of passengers and it is urgent that he address himself to getting that type of knowledge.</P>
    <P>A review of routes and the frequency of Dublin city buses is long overdue considering the changes in population and the car owning patterns in the city.  There has been a lack of attention to Dublin city buses within CIE.  There is a lack of promotion effort to encourage travellers to use the city buses while a well known <Col N="1394" /> loss-maker for CIE, namely, the rail service, has been substantially advertised by CIE.  Following a review of the service being provided, the frequencies and the type of people who are using the buses, the real task for CIE will be to provide a more flexible service to attract passengers. The fare structure is one area where very definite changes could be made. With the one-man buses coming on stream and the likelihood that CIE will have smaller and more reliable buses, it is important that this opportunity be taken to provide for greater flexibility in the service.  The idea of expressway limited stop services from major centres to the suburbs and greater feeder services into either such expressways or the suburban rail should be pursued and CIE should look for greater flexibility in providing for the occasional market.  To date, CIE have not been able to change schedules to expand in a certain area where there might be a sudden pressure of demand, such as people wishing to go to the beaches on a sunny summer's day. That flexibility should be sought within work practices in CIE.</P>
    <P>Having said what CIE could do themselves, I believe the time has come for a totally new approach to Dublin city transport. If we are to provide a decent bus service in the city, it is essential that it be sensitive to passenger needs, but we must go even further.  We must bring the public into the picture to a greater extent.  That means detailing exactly what services and routes are losing money.  We need closer public involvement both through their elected representatives and at community level on the disbursement of the taxpayers' subvention to various services and in looking at other options that could be pursued in order to cut losses without seriously damaging the passenger service.  That dimension of bringing the public into the picture has been sadly lacking.</P>
    <P>If we are to put Dublin city transport on the right road the Government must give a clear direction in regard to what they will pay for and what they will expect in return.  Action should be taken on traffic management improvements, which have not yet been taken up by the <Col N="1395" /> task force.  I am convinced that the way to do this is to bring about devolution in the running of the Dublin city bus service. There has been a widely expressed commitment from all sides of this House to devolving government towards the community, local groups and locally elected representatives.  The Dublin city bus services provide us with a unique opportunity to do just that.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for Dublin city bus services and the suburban rail should be handed over to the local authorities. They should be given a block grant from Government funds and given a clear mandate to do two things: to improve passenger services and usage and to use the grant to top-up socially worthy services that would be losing money if they were decided purely on commercial grounds.  There are enormous advantages in using Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council to do this.  For a start, it would force attention on public needs in a way that has not been the case with a semi-State board responsible and reporting to the Department of Transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be, but let us wait and see.  It has advantages not <Col N="1396" /> only because it directs attention to public needs but it gives the Government an opportunity to set clear operational targets for Dublin city buses, demanding that passenger utilisation be maximised subject to the Government's subvention be it £22 million or £25 million.  The figure of £22 million would be the figure for this year.  I presume some increase would be in order there.  It would avoid the Department of Transport embroiling itself in the detailed route by route review.  I am not saying that is unnecessary.  It is very necessary, but under such a scheme that job would devolve down to locally elected representatives and an executive similar to Dublin Corporation.</P>
      <P>Local authorities will be able to take up not only with the users but also with CIE as the provider of the service the various options that are there.  It would be very desirable that it should be an elected group such as the existing local authorities who would undertake frequent route reviews and look at the options, such as the one-man bus, as a way of reducing costs and improving services.  I would not rule out the possibility of using private contractors where CIE find services uneconomic.  There is plenty of scope for mini-bus services in Dublin, supported from public funds, services CIE cannot consider taking on. Such a group would consist of the local authorities if they were given this responsibility since they would be able to look at wider and more flexible services.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Wilson said, the transport consultative commission proposed the Dublin Transport Authority which would integrate the various roles, particularly the local authorities, CIE and the gardaí, as well as the two Departments, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Transport, but I do not see the necessity for going to a new body necessarily to undertake this task.  After all the local authorities have already taken on considerable responsibility in the area of transport since they have responsibility for roads and for traffic management.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not suggesting that is necessarily the best way, but there is the possibility that we do have an existing local government structure where we have an elected group directly answerable to passenger users.  In many other jurisdictions the task of running public transport has been part of the local corporation.  That would be the system in London.  There is nothing revolutionary in that.  I believe the local authority is the logical place for such responsibility to lie. If, in the event of local authority reform, we move towards the two-tier system which recognises there are some tasks within Dublin that have to be approached jointly by all three authorities, and that is brought in local government reform, such a structure would be all the more appropriate for handling transport.  If we have to bring three or four authorities together, as envisaged by the transport consultative commission in the DTA proposal, obviously that would be more unrealistic than if we moved towards a single local authority acting for the whole of the city which would naturally take up a role like transport as one of the natural things of which they would take control.</P>
      <P>There was a reference to the Howth-Bray line.  The Minister set up a permanent committee to look at capital proposals coming forward from CIE and monitor their programme.  That is to be welcomed.  The Minister provided an explanation of the apparent over-run but, whatever about that, there are places where big mistakes have been made in the public sector because of the absence of just such a committee.  I would ask the Minister to go a step further and bring the Oireachtas Semi-State Committee in on any new capital proposals.  The public and Deputies should be given an opportunity of looking at the assumptions underlying such large-scale proposals. There would be a clear responsibility on the proposers to defend publicly their schemes.  That would be a worthwhile step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is then the social side of transport. I refer to the school transport scheme and the free travel scheme which was set up in 1967.  At that time it was confined to the over seventies and social <Col N="1398" /> welfare recipients.  Quite a small number was involved.  It has expanded considerably over the years and now covers about three times what was originally envisaged at about 380,000.  We must ask ourselves whether this is an appropriate scheme in its present form.  It costs about £53 for every passenger carried.  I doubt if we have any real information on utilisation. We do not know as to whether it is the low income groups who are getting the benefit.  The Department of Social Welfare should carry out some research into this.  I doubt if the less well-off are taking a significant number of visits up and down the country whereas the better-off would have greater opportunities for such travel.  I doubt if the greater part of the benefit is going to the most needy, and a question mark must be raised as to whether a direct cash payment restricted to a smaller number, to social welfare recipients and old age pensioners, to the extent of £2 per week extra, would not be a better use of funds.  A sum of £20 million is a very big subvention.</P>
    <P>The school transport system also needs to be examined.  It costs almost £250 per pupil.  There is a very low utilisation of the buses involved; 2,500 buses carry about 116,000 pupils.  Of these buses 900 are State-owned.  Compared with the 900 buses in Dublin city transport that is a frighteningly low utilisation of school transport carrying about 25 million passengers while Dublin city buses carry 160 million. These schemes are now coming up for replacement.  The comprehensive programme on public spending says about 800 buses will have to be replaced before 1990 and 200 in the next year.  That will involve us in very heavy expenditure if we continue the service as it exists. Greater flexibility will have to be introduced into the use of these buses.  Various recommendations have been made by all three of McKinsey witnesses on the Oireachtas Committee of Semi-State bodies to integrate the service with provincial and rural buses.  This is a suggestion that should be pursued vigorously by the Minister and CIE.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's move, for the first time I believe, to take the initiative in giving CIE a clear framework in which <Col N="1399" /> to move.  I should like him to refine it considerably before we can say we have established a proper transport policy for the various public transport services.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>CIE are a much maligned body.  Possibly they come second to TDs.  They are certainly the most maligned of the State companies.  This has arisen from the belief that public transport can make a profit.  It is interesting to note that the Chairman of CIE who is leaving his post at the end of the year went on record a number of years ago as saying it was his belief that CIE should concentrate on providing a social service, a non-profit making service, and that anything which could make a profit should be allowed to go into the private area. In other words, CIE should concentrate solely on the non-profit making services. To my mind and to the minds of most people, that is a recipe for disaster, a recipe for breaking up completely the national transport system.</P>
      <P>Economists from whom we hear a great deal about CIE argue that there is no reason why many of the services should not be run by private enterprise. When you examine what services are being talked about and what services should be handed over to private enterprise, you find they are not proposing that the rail services should be handed over to private enterprise, or that a regular bus service from Dublin to some small town should be handed over.  They argue that services which could make a profit at peak hours in Dublin city should be handed over.  This shows the contradiction between what private enterprise want to do and what a national transport operation should do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Private enterprises are interested in providing services which will make money.  The national transport company should be in the business of providing a service which covers the country as a whole and which moves people and goods as effectively and as efficiently as possible. Many rural areas have a right to a transport service to get people to and from different parts of the country.  Owners <Col N="1400" /> of factories in remote parts of the country have the right to a reasonably priced transport service to get the goods they manufacture to the market for sale. Obviously there is a conflict of interest between a private enterprise transport service and a national transport service.</P>
    <P>Government policy on the national transport company cannot be separated from their policy in other areas.  This comes out clearly in discussions on the question of the rapid rail system which CIE are proposing to provide and part of which they hope to provide in the spring. The national transport company are proposing to provide a fairly comprehensive and sophisticated rapid rail system in the city.  At the same time, Government policy appears to be aimed at developing a detailed and expensive system of roads in and around and through Dublin city. There is a conflict of interest there.  If we are serious about having an effective transport system to move people and goods, public transport is the best system. If it is Government policy to build dual carriageways in and around the city of Dublin, they are encouraging the development of private transport at the same time.  There is a conflict of interest between what the Government are proposing in relation to roads and public transport.</P>
    <P>Given the present financial stringency it is clear that the road proposals for Dublin city are not moving ahead as fast as many engineers and others would like them to move.  There should be a moratorium on the development of further roads and the road plans which are in existence in the Dublin city area until the Government sort out exactly what their priorities are in relation to transport for the Dublin region.</P>
    <P>The social function of public transport must be kept in mind when we are discussing whether private transport or public transport should be developed.  It can be argued that private cars are owned by a large proportion of the population. Even if a family can afford to run a car, only one member of the family can use it to go to work or to go to town.  Normally that leaves the wife &mdash; or perhaps the husband in some cases &mdash; the children, <Col N="1401" /> old people and disabled people without the use of a car and dependent on public transport.  CIE have failed to cater for that market.  I referred already to the policy of the chairman and his philosophy on public transport.  Previous Governments failed to accept the fact that there is a necessity for a rational development of the transport system.  It is not good enough to say to the company every year: &ldquo;Regardless of how much money you need to develop the transport system, this is all you are getting and you will have to make the best of it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>In discussing the question of private versus public transport, the social costs of one as against the other must be considered. I am thinking particularly in terms of the Dublin area and the fact that fairly large areas of Dublin city have been made derelict by a policy of road development planned perhaps for 20, 25 or 30 years ahead.  This has laid to waste large areas of the city.  Here and there we find stretches of wide roadway stuck between narrow thoroughfares.  The buildings along these narrow stretches are usually derelict, and generally the corporation have plans to widen these roads and provide dual carriageways as soon as the money is available.  The social cost in terms of the communities which are destroyed by such policies can be far out-weighed if proper public transport is provided.  Buses and the proposed rapid rail system would reduce the need for private transport.</P>
    <P>This is not confined only to the centre city area.  In recent years a dual carriageway was built in the Finglas area, part of my own constituency, and it was driven right through the centre of Finglas village, effectively cutting the area in half and creating two communities in Finglas East and Finglas West, joined by a footbridge across the dual carriageway.  Practically all the facilities are on one side of the dual carriageway and there are virtually none on the other.  Road development has a social cost, and this should be weighed against calls for greater privatisation of transportation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson mentioned the provision by CIE of buses across the Border for people who wish to benefit from the <Col N="1402" /> cheaper prices.  He criticised CIE for providing this service because they are a subsidised State company.  I am somewhat dubious about such criticism, because we are told that CIE must respond to the market demand, yet when they do so they are told they should not spend money in this way because they are subsidising people who wish to spend their money outside the State.  If we were to extend this logic, we would criticise Aer Lingus for ferrying people to Spain to spend money on their holidays.  We could also criticise B &amp; I for ferrying people across the water to Great Britain. We should consider that until CIE responded the demand was being met by private bus owners.  I have yet to hear anybody call on the private bus owners to refuse to accept the contracts to ferry people across the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Many different matters would have to be examined in order to compare one with the other.  There is also the question of whether CIE have a responsibility to provide a transport service to people who require the transport, for whatever reason.  The revenue might be used to meet the cost of their overheads and they would be using more fully the assets available to them rather than leaving them idle.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am convinced that the <Col N="1403" /> low morale among CIE staff results from constant attacks made on CIE by people who, in many cases, have a vested interest in ensuring that the more profitable parts of CIE are hived off.  There is also the matter of the pensions payable to staff who have been in receipt of wages. I understand that some men who spent up to 30 years working for CIE are receiving pensions in the region of £16 per week.  That is deplorable.</P>
      <P>There is a grave need for an adequate insurance scheme to cover bus crews in Dublin who may be injured during the course of their work.  Bus services in a number of Dublin suburbs are restricted because of fears by crews that they may be injured after certain times at night. One of their strongest arguments is that if they are injured, perhaps permanently, there is no adequate compensation for them or their families.</P>
      <P>The question of bus fares should be examined, particularly in the Dublin area and during off-peak periods when buses run from terminus to terminus with very few passengers on board.  They could be collecting some money from people who walk or take the car when it might be more convenient to them to take the bus.</P>
      <P>The route structure in Dublin must also be examined.  Huge working-class suburbs have developed during the past ten years and family connections can range from Kilbarrack to Blanchardstown and Tallaght and right around the city.  In order to travel from, say, Ballymun to Tallaght people must get two buses.  Even to get to Blanchardstown they must go into the city centre and get another bus. Some serious thought should be given to the creation of circular routes.  There is a 17A bus travelling from Kilbarrack to Finglas, and I know there are physical problems in relation to the roads from Finglas to Blanchardstown.  Proposals to extend that service and make it more frequent should be examined.  I regularly meet people who are thumbing lifts while waiting for the 17A bus because there is such a long gap between buses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Dublin Transport Authority is essential, and the sooner it is introduced the more likely we are to have an efficient <Col N="1404" /> service in the Dublin area.  I do not agree that Dublin Corporation could cope with the problem of providing an adequate transport service.  The city boundary is far too confined.  Half of my constituency is inside the city boundary and half is outside.  The corporation have experienced untold problems in attempting to run a bus service outside their own jurisdiction.  Other problems have been experienced by local authorities in this regard, which I have not time to mention now.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to indicate if progress is being made on the Heuston to Tallaght rapid rail link.  Is he planning to go ahead with that?  Because of the large population in the Tallaght area, at present 90,000 but a planned 100,000, I urge the Minister to give serious consideration to those people who need this service and are not getting it at present.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That CIE are now deemed to be providing a social service to the order of one-third of their expenditure should be recognised by everybody.  The Minister makes us aware that a 12 per cent reduction must take place within the next five years and the consequences of that reduction will be very serious for some <Col N="1405" /> areas.  I wonder what the actions of the newly appointed chief executive officer will be, when he comes to grapple with that problem.</P>
    <P>Much criticism has been levelled against the Howth-Bray electrification scheme, much of which has come from the deputies from the west.  Coming to understand the reason for the decisions arrived at makes one aware of how flimsy the operation of Government is in determining decisions which account for vast sums of money.  The Minister indicates that the original decision was to grant assist by the method of non-repayable grants.  A few short weeks later, the Government decision was changed to put it on a capital loan basis.  Having gone through the motions, CIE were faced with an enormous financial problem, the consequences of which are now very obvious.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to complain about the Howth-Bray electrification scheme we should learn a lesson, as a Parliament, from this type of decision.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Other facilities are provided throughout the country by the same method.  There is no point in complaining about them because they are in existence and we must use the talents and expertise available to us to make the best possible financial use of these services.  I am glad that the Minister has seen fit to set up a committee which will review expenditure in this area.  There is no point in continuing along the old road of hypothetical, Utopian dreams of a wonderful transport service employing everybody and providing every possible facility, without taking cognisance of the cost and who has to pay in the final analysis.</P>
      <P>There is no point in making decisions like that of the Howth-Bray line and similar operations in the future.  We should learn our lesson and get our priorities right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>It was an excellent decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness, if electricity is <Col N="1406" /> to be one of our cheaper sources of energy within the next 30 to 40 years, and if the carriages and equipment to be used on that Howth-Bray line are long lasting, it might turn out to be a cheaper investment over a longer term.  From that point of view, it might have been a wise decision, but we are not in a position to judge that as yet.</P>
      <P>The Minister refers to the appointment of the new chief executive officer for CIE. He has given due credit to the outgoing officer, Mr. Devlin, while welcoming the appointment of the new CEO.  When this officer &mdash; who is an accountant, I understand &mdash; comes to grapple with a 12 per cent reduction over the next five years, I trust that he will understand the social nature of the service provided by CIE. CIE at present are strangled by administration. Many of their problems have arisen from the regionalisation of management back in the early sixties.  The growth in the number of their administration offices leaves a lot to be desired. The work which was being done efficiently by a small number of skilled people at that time is now being carried out by an enormous number with a much smaller workload.  This has added to the bureaucracy within CIE and to the strangulation of the efficient service which CIE should be providing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the competition for CIE which has arisen in recent times from private firms, the numbers of young people who travel to the west and south every weekend from this city are phenomenal. For various reasons, social and otherwise, people travel the length and breadth of the country every weekend. On certain days from my own town at least four fully laden buses leave for Dublin, with a return same day fare of £7.50 or £8.  CIE charge for the same return journey £21 by train.  In a time of recession when young people might not have the finance available, they will certainly use a cheaper form of transport when it is available.  While in no way running down the system, CIE naturally enough regard these people as being the equivalent of the pirate radio stations. They question the legality of the fares charged, the low cost of labour, the lack <Col N="1407" /> of maintenance and many other things. They question whether these services are within the terms and realm of the law.  It is fair to say that CIE have recently begun to advertise reduced fares on particular days for travel to Dublin.  It is also fair to say that, from statistics compiled by the various station masters throughout the country, the numbers who travel by train when fares are reduced have trebled.  If that is any indication of the direction in which CIE should be going, it should be examined very seriously.</P>
    <P>Recently, on a Tuesday, I travelled by train to Dublin.  At one of the smaller stations on the western line there were 92 people on the train.  Two of those were CIE employees, four were schoolboys, 36 were pensioners, and 50 were fare-paying passengers.  On that morning, at least three buses had left my town fully laden with passengers, not to mention the numbers who would leave from other towns and cities in the west by buses which would take returning working people and shoppers coming from Dublin.  If CIE are to attract back people to their mainline services, they must do something about the quality of the services and, naturally, about the level of the fare.  The stark fact is that when they have advertised reduced fares the public have availed of these.  That is a lesson in itself.</P>
    <P>CIE have been maligned in many cases, as other Deputies have already said, by those who might have a narrow, subjective, or vested interest from a particular point of view and much of the criticism is neither relevant nor fair.  If Mr. Conlon in his new role is to effectively bring about a 12 per cent reduction over five years does that mean a high level of cut-backs in staff?  There have not been any great recruitment campaigns in CIE in the last six years.  As time goes on the existing staff get older. If there are not any further recruitment campaigns Mr. Conlon will be left with a structure within his employment which will be in the upper bracket.  I assume that when he takes up his very onerous task he will grapple with this problem in an open fashion which will allow us to <Col N="1408" /> understand where his trend of thought lies.  As an accountant he will probably bring a change of emphasis to the running of CIE, as the company up to this were run by engineers and people of that qualification.</P>
    <P>I am a little bit anxious about the Minister saying that he does not want to receive any further deputations about CIE.  It is quite in order for a Minister to say that, but if there are to be cut-backs in staff and in the service, railway stations and so forth there will have to be political considerations.  I trust the Minister will bear in mind that the voice of the people has to be projected through the public representatives in this forum, from whatever side of the House we come from.</P>
    <P>When I was elected to this House approximately eight years ago I raised questions about the quality of the service to the west.  The answers to those questions were inevitably that CIE would provide new carriages, they would pack the line, they would have a monorail all the way down and the carriages to be provided would be air conditioned.  The carriages at the moment are air conditioned to an extreme degeee.  It would be in Mr. Conlon's interest, before he takes up his new position, if he took a trip on a Friday evening on the western train incognito and saw for himself the efficient method of the air conditioning.  I know of people who have travelled to Dublin for orthopaedic operations who were meant to go to a particular hospital in Dublin but on arrival at Heuston Station had to go into Dr. Stevens Hospital because of the damage to the pins and plaster caused by the shaking of the line.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>To drink even a cup of tea demands skill from an old age pensioner or very young person because it continues to wave in front of one.  If Sally O'Brien were to walk the length of a carriage you would not have time to notice the way she might look at you.  As Senator Lyons used to recite in his own inimitable fashion, the train that left tomorrow or the hell train would be an apt description at times for the western train line.  When my <Col N="1409" /> colleague Deputy Flynn was Minister he introduced shortly before a general election the supertrain.  That train still travels on a Sunday morning and comes back on a Sunday evening.  While it does not provide the service on a general basis the people who avail of the service on Sunday deserve that level of comfort and it might attract them to travel by train in future.</P>
      <P>The quality of the service to the west leaves a lot to be desired.  The level of fares must be looked at if CIE are to get back passengers on their trains.  The Minister referred to the development of the new carriages and their quality.  I would like him to indicate when he expects they will come into service.  He says they will come into operation early in 1984.  Would he let us know on what lines those carriages will be used?  Will they be used on the southern line or the northern line, because the quality of service on those lines is quite high?  The worst carriages and the worst facilities are left to the boys on the Atlantic.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said that we are now approaching the anniversary of his appointment.  May I congratulate him and wish him many years in a ministry, either this one or some other ministry. He says he spoke to the inland transport people, users, outside experts, academics and commentators.  He did not say if he spoke to the plate layers, the people who walk the line every day checking to see if the nuts and bolts are held in position for the trains to pass over, the store keepers or the people who walk about the different railway stations throughout the country. I believe if the Minister or any of his officials went down the country to any station and spoke to any of the ordinary CIE workers they might get much more commonsense suggestions than they would get in many cases from commentators, academics or experts.  Experts are ten a penny and they float in and float out by the dozen.  Many of their suggestions are simply not worth hearing at all.  It would also be in the interest of the new chief executive officer to at least hear the voice of the ordinary worker in CIE, the man down on the line, because such a person hears on the grapevine what should be done.  An expert might put nice <Col N="1410" /> phraseology on it, but direct talk in a time of recession, when CIE are in the state they are in, is very necessary and the viewpoint of everybody should be taken into account.  Probably the Minister has done that.</P>
    <P>School transport and the old age pensioners' scheme have been mentioned. We had debates on the school transport problem in this House and the Minister of State indicated that it will take a vast sum of money to replace the existing school bus fleet owned by CIE.  That problem will take a lot of sorting out.  It must be said, in fairness to CIE, that they are one of the few administrative bodies who have the capacity to implement, however inefficiently, a school transport scheme taking into account the complexity of school catchment areas, school boundary areas and all that type of thing. They have acquitted themselves reasonably well in that area.  The suggestion made about private bus owners taking on pilot schemes is very worthy.  If they can provide a service up to the same standards and with proper insurance they should be given a chance.</P>
    <P>The question of old age pensioners using the facility in the proper manner has been raised.  Many retired people, who in many cases have a high income, use CIE transport for business or social contacts.  I am anxious that many of the pensioners who have not the facility to travel to a pick-up point or a public service point never have the opportunity to avail of the free transport they are entitled to.  Some old age pensioners have to travel very long distances to hospitals for medical check-ups and they have to get taxis at very high cost when they are not near any public transport pick-up point.  I am not suggesting that the scheme be terminated, but many pensioners who use the free transport scheme could afford to pay for this transport, and I am making the point that some of the pensioners who qualify for the free transport scheme never have the opportunity to avail of it.  That should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I believe the Minister has faced up to his position realistically.  The section of the McKinsey Report on railway stations, <Col N="1411" /> whether to keep them, reduce them, expand them or close them, will have to be grappled with by the new executive chairman.  Many railway stations are a distance from local towns and if they are to be closed an alternative efficient service will have to be provided.  We all know that people will not avail of water schemes until the pipes are laid in front of their homes and the same applies to alternative bus services.  It is not enough to say that an alternative service will be provided by express buses because it may not work out.  The only time a congratulatory programme was done about CIE was during the petrol strike when the bus service was run efficiently.  The moral of that story is that if an efficient public transport service was provided it would be used by the public.  Dublin City traffic is strangled with cars and it is impossible for CIE to operate an efficient service even with the advantage of bus lanes. Cars are parked at angles in those lanes at all times.</P>

      <P>In many cases the express bus service would not provide as good a service as that provided by mainline rail if it was operated efficiently.  One can carry more passengers and freight per hour by rail than on any other transport system.  Private transport companies are cutting each other's throats and going into business and closing down daily to the detriment of CIE and our roads are in a dangerous condition due to the increase in the number of articulated trucks using them.  Those factors should help to make rail transport more popular with passengers and those moving freight.  The new executive chairman of the company should bear that in mind when he takes up office.  In fact he might consider putting the title Córas Iompair Éireann in abeyance for some time and call it Consider Improving Efficiency or Conlon Investigates Everything.</P>

      <P>In congratulating the new executive chairman on his appointment I should like to add that I do not envy him his task.  It appears that the Government are intent on cutting back but I would like to see the public transport service strengthened.  Our people will endure a lot more hardship if the Government continue with their policy of cutbacks.  The major problem with CIE is that there is too much bureaucracy and red tape.  That must be eliminated and the new executive chairman should educate his executives to get rid of that. We are all aware of the inconvenience that is caused to passengers and those using the rail freight system because of red tape.  That will have to be eliminated if the company is to win the goodwill of the public.</P>
      <P>Our transport system is the most heavily subsidised aspect of our economy. One matter that causes me great concern is the deplorable state of some of our railway stations and derelict lines.  Many of them have been unused for years and are shabby.  CIE should embark on a programme to improve those unsightly scenes.  Many unsightly stations and derelict lines can be seen on the Cork-Dublin line.  I suggest that the youth employment scheme be considered when a programme of improvement is being prepared. The Minister, the overall boss of CIE, should insist on improvements being carried out in that area.  The CIE rail service is excellent but much of the rolling stock is in a bad state of repair.  It is ramshackle, it cracks and creaks and the carriages do not join properly.  That is a source of danger to the many people who use the trains.  We are fortunate that we have not had more accidents as a result of that.  We must correct that speedily.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a serious cutback in the service from Cobh to Cork.  The shortage of rolling stock has caused grave inconvenience <Col N="1413" /> to those who commute between Cork and Cobh, one of the country's busiest commuter services.  The Cork area has been allowed to deteriorate. Many of the workers at Cork dockyard use the Cobh line and so also do Army personnel and school children who attend at the Cork colleges.  The Minister should request CIE to restore the service to what is was some years ago.  Many people have to wait for a long time in wind and rain because there is a bad return service to Cobh.  I accept that a bus leaves Cork at 9.45 p.m. but that is not satisfactory.  The problem would be solved if more rolling stock was made available.  It is the Minister's duty to insist on the public being treated properly.  Fota Island is a major amenity in the Cork region with about 100,000 people visiting it annually.  There must be a proper transport service to that area.</P>
    <P>Children from Cobh travel to Cork for post-primary and third level education but they suffer a lot of inconvenience because of the lack of a proper public transport service.  This is a source of great embarrassment to all public representatives. I appeal to the Minister to do everything possible to improve this.  Extra stock should be provided because of the importance of the area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  I congratulate the new executive chairman.  I do not envy him his job.  It will be a difficult task.  But I should not like to see him use the same guillotine methods he did in Nítrigin Eireann Teoranta bringing hardship on many of the people employed and the public.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear from what the Minister said outlining the present financial position of CIE that there is need for a radical change in the whole of their operations.  Obviously one's viewpoint will vary as to how such change will be effected.  For example, one's viewpoint will be coloured by one's job, profession or otherwise.  There will be one point of view from an accountant who would probably feel that some services should or must be eliminated. One will have another viewpoint if speaking as a Deputy with experience of the <Col N="1414" /> urban bus or rail service, and another looking at it from the rural point of view, taking into account how our mainline rail services operate at present and the bus services between our towns and cities and their cost.  Obviously any such decisions will, of necessity be difficult ones.</P>
      <P>As the Minister aptly said, we must ask ourselves if we can afford a given service. It must be remembered that there is a duty on the part of the State and on any public transport authority to provide certain areas with transport so that the public can get from one place to another in the fastest possible time at the most competitive price.  But the fact of the matter is that a certain amount of the expense involved will necessarily lead to a loss-making situation, particularly when one considers that, say, a rural bus service vying between two towns, perhaps with a driver and a few passengers, will involve certain expense a couple of times a day. In such circumstances one will readily see that a taxi would have been a lot cheaper on the same individuals.</P>
      <P>In 1969 there was a deficit in CIE of approximately £3.2 million which has increased at an enormous rate until 1982 when it was approximately then £109 million. At the end of each of those years inevitably the Government were asked for more money by way of subsidy.  Inevitably also it transpired that in the long run it was the taxpayer who virtually wrote the cheque for such subsidy.  In many areas this led to a certain attitude to the various services.  I do not intend to criticise any one aspect or any particular individual because everybody is involved in the fact that the services have not been satisfactory.  Certain aspects overall must be applied to any type of service but, above all, it must be and be seen to be a reliable service.  It must be the type of service the public know exists, can be used and at a reasonable cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For far too long it has been a haphazard type of service not operated on any basic commercial lines.  For example, at present weekenders going home to, say, Cork city pay a return fare of £18.50 while, at the same time, a commercial bus company can offer a £10 return fare.  We must ask why this is so, why it takes nearly <Col N="1415" /> double the amount to return by train. Another aspect of that matter is that if by any chance one gets a lift down on a Friday afternoon, with a view to coming back to Dublin by train after the weekend that single fare will cost one no less than £24.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that these radical changes may be announced at the time of takeover by the new chairman.  But we must ask ourselves what exactly do the public want and what can we afford.  There is no doubt but that some savings can be effected and that some services could be improved enormously, provided the public know such service can be availed of.</P>
    <P>The electrification of the Howth-Bray line has been mentioned.  It would appear this will cost a great deal more than was envisaged, rising from something like £46 million to the latest estimate of approximately £114 million.  But the decision should be welcomed in principle.  If it proves to be a reliable commuter network service within the city and its environs it will have unlimited possibilities but only if properly operated.  Most of us who have visited other cities are aware that commuters from outlying areas leave their vehicles on the fringes of those cities and use the public transport services provided where there is a reliable service.  But here, with buses so unreliable, anybody who has to be in a certain place at a certain time will suffer enormous frustration; they may get into Dublin some time in the morning but do not know when they will get home again.  If the hoped-for passenger usage of a possible 80,000 by 1987 transpires it will bring enormous benefits to Dublin city, in regard to car owners avoiding the bumper to bumper rush hour traffic, five days a week, and the fact that parking within the city will be confined to the commercial type vehicle or to people who travel at awkward hours and must use their cars at all times. It will be vital that, when this service is initiated it is seen to be reliable, and receives the necessary public response, with increased parking charges on the fringes.  With the constant increases in the price of petrol and the general running costs of motor cars I think people <Col N="1416" /> will respond to such rail service knowing they will have a comfortable journey in and out of the city with the added advantage of many stations sited along the route.</P>
    <P>It will be important also that the new chairman examines the various aspects of our mainline rail services and ascertains why they are failing.  Another matter which must be examined is that of the whole area of industrial relations.  Much too often we have seen the public affected by individuals who take the law into their hands, placing pickets on a bus or railway station, thereby ensuring that no transport can operate in the city.  This results in many people being caused inconvenience, discomfort, people either not getting to work or getting there late with resultant work losses.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to make a statement on the European Council which I attended in Athens on 4, 5 and 6 December, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Barry.  The Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Austin Deasy, also attended in Athens to assist in the deliberations at the meeting. Deputies know by now the outcome of the meeting.  There are no Presidency conclusions.  I propose to deal only in outline with the subjects we covered.</P>
      <P>At the outset these were summarised by the Presidency under the headings:</P>
      <P>(1)  rationalisation of agriculture, including milk, cereals, MCAs and other problems;</P>
      <P>(2)  structural funds, including questions of efficiency, increasing resources, enlargement of the Community with special reference to Mediterranean problems; and</P>
      <P>(3)  new actions including action in relation to research, technological innovation, <i>esprit</i>, fiscal discipline and other questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1417" /> Political questions were also mentioned, but again, no conclusions were adopted by the Council.</P>
    <P>The issues the Heads of State and Government faced in Athens were without precedent in their range, complexity and the depth of concern &mdash; even passion &mdash; which one aspect or another evoked among the different member states. Many of these problems were also closely inter-linked, with the result that a solution in one area automatically required a balancing solution or change in another area.  For example, an increase in resources for the Community as a whole is of paramount importance, but this increase was held by some to be contingent on enlargement to include Spain and Portugal by an early date which was to be agreed, and by others on significant savings being achieved in the agriculture sector.</P>
    <P>The present balance between Community expenditure and receipts was a matter of concern for many countries, including in particular, the United Kingdom. There was widespread consensus on the need to achieve a better degree of budgetary discipline.  This in turn involved attitudes to budgetary procedure and to agriculture on which a great part of the Community budget is spent. In fact, in view of the budgetary constraints, Commission proposals before the Community were designed to achieve savings on agriculture of some £1,800 million in 1984-85.  These are all issues which obviously are of great importance to Ireland as to the other member states.</P>
    <P>The Community consumption of milk and milk products is estimated at the equivalent of something over 80 million tonnes and production at about 103 million tonnes.  Management and disposal of this surplus will cost the Community over £3,000 million this year and if trends of recent years continue, the surplus and cost will continue to grow.  We have always recognised the stresses and distortions which this imbalance is causing &mdash; in fact Ireland agreed two years ago to the concept of production thresholds &mdash; but equally we have emphasised the <Col N="1418" /> importance of a solution which takes into account the legitimate interests of the various member states.</P>
    <P>Milk in Ireland is responsible uniquely for some nine per cent of GNP.  The direct importance of milk output to our economy is three times greater than in any other member state.  For historical reasons &mdash; the effective limitation of access for Irish milk to the British market in which prices were at a level half or less than those in other European markets &mdash; our milk sector was prevented in the years before 1973 from realising its potential and achieving levels of development comparable to those attained in other regions of the Community with similar climate and soil conditions.</P>
    <P>The opportunity to get away from these deadening constraints was one of the strongest reasons that the Irish people opted so overwhelmingly to join the Community.  To deal with the obvious and growing problems of surpluses, we suggested in the current negotiations action in areas which contribute to milk surpluses in an artificial way, such as the use of cereal substitutes by large-scale intensive units, MCAs, competition from oils and fats, national measures distorting competition and concessionary imports, as well as an approach that would achieve a better balance in the market and finance the disposal of remaining surpluses.</P>
    <P>What Ireland did not want, indeed would find unacceptable, was and is the proposal for a super-levy on production above a fixed quota, which as enunciated and developed, would have taxed punitively here and in other countries increases in production over 1981 levels. In our view, this proposal contradicts a basic Community principle of free trade within a common market.  It would institutionalise a form of protectionism as between member states and would have placed an unjust and totally disproportionate burden on Ireland in a way that would have prejudiced a most vital national interest.  The proposal was, therefore, clearly unacceptable to the Irish Government.</P>
    <P>The scale of the challenge was such that it was imperative that special measures <Col N="1419" /> be taken to apprise the other member states of the crisis being created for us.  I, therefore, undertook, accompanied on many occasions by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a programme of meetings and visits, unparalleled in their range and intensity since Ireland joined the Community over ten years ago.</P>
    <P>First, at the beginning of November, I met Mr. Papandreou in Athens, in his capacity both as President in office of the Council and as Greek Prime Minister. On 6 November, I met the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, at Chequers for discussions not only on Anglo-Irish relations but also on the Athens Council and on Irish views on the agricultural proposals. Last Saturday week, in Brussels, I had meetings with the Dutch Prime Minister, Mr. Lubbers, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Mr. Werner, six of the Commissioners who are members of the Christian Democratic Party and the Commission President, M. Thorn.</P>
    <P>On the following Monday, in Copenhagen, I met the Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Schluter.  The following Thursday I had a prolonged discussion in Bonn with Chancellor Kohl, following which I travelled to Paris for a meeting with President Mitterand.  After this, the Minister and I went to Rome where we had discussions with Mr. Craxi who is President of the Italian Council of Ministers.</P>
    <P>During these meetings, each of us had the opportunity to discuss our major concerns and preoccupations.  I explained the disastrous effects the super-levy would have not only on Irish agriculture but on the whole Irish economy, and I made no secret of the depth and intensity of Irish feelings about the proposal.</P>
    <P>In the event it was found impossible at Athens to reach agreement on a whole range of important issues which involved many conflicting interests among the different countries.</P>
    <P>In so far as the super-levy was concerned, various proposals were made at different stages that would have provided for exemption in Ireland's case up to levels of production which eventually attained a figure of 10 per cent above the current year's output.  We made clear our <Col N="1420" /> opposition to the limitations contained in each of those proposals.  I have to add that against the background of the large surpluses overhanging the market even these limited, and for us unacceptable, proposals were vigorously opposed by a number of countries as not being capable of being explained to their farmers, whose output would be cut.  This and the exhaustion of the Community's revenues, to which I will be turning shortly, emphasises just how critical are the problems for Ireland created by the present milk surplus situation and the current paralysis in the Community arising from both financial and institutional constraints.</P>
    <P>At the Council, I expressed recognition of the effort made by the Presidency to meet our position and my gratitude for the understanding shown by a number of member states for our special difficulties. But I pointed out that even the final proposal put forward in Athens, assuming it was intended to be cumulative, would have done no more than reduce the impact of the proposed market distortion on our national economy at the end of the period from five times the impact of the budgetary imbalance on the British economy to two-and-a-half times that impact.</P>
    <P>I said that I hoped my colleagues would understand why this remained unacceptable to us, though some seemed still to have difficulty in understanding the reality of the impact on our economy.  I also emphasised at the Council that we have no intention of abusing the exemption and would not seek to increase milk output by more than the normal increase that would move us gradually towards the share of the total market which under normal competitive conditions we would have attained long since but for the external constraints imposed on us until 1973.</P>
    <P>A problem at least equal in importance to the proposals for changes in the Common Agricultural Policy arises from the exhaustion of the revenues of the Community. Expenditure from the budget is financed by contributions collected in member countries under the &ldquo;own resources system&rdquo;.  This provides that <Col N="1421" /> member states should pay over to the Community the proceeds of:</P>
    <P>(1)  customs duties on imports subject to the common external tariff,</P>
    <P>(2)  agricultural import levies, and</P>
    <P>(3)  up to 1 per cent of VAT on a standardised tax base.</P>
    <P>Community policies and expenditures have developed to a point where these sources of revenue no longer suffice.  This has given rise to concern on the part of many member states with the linked problems of ensuring that the Community is so financed that it can survive and develop; ensuring that this financing is provided in a way which is disciplined and controlled; and ensuring also that the burdens are shared fairly by the different member states.</P>
    <P>We discussed various proposals for increasing the VAT limit but no agreement was reached.  The earliest year on which the new limit could have come into effect is 1986.</P>
    <P>On budgetary discipline, the Presidency put forward a proposal whereby the Council would set out at the start of each budget exercise its position on the maximum amount of expenditure which it would intend to adopt.  It was made clear, however, and this was a point which I stressed, that the budgetary powers of the European Parliament should not be diminished or interfered with and that the Commission's right of initiative in budgetary matters should be respected.  There was also greater emphasis on the multi-annual programming of budgetary expenditure and on closer monitoring of the execution of the budget.</P>
    <P>However, all of these individual issues pale into insignificance in comparison with the implications of a continuing failure to reach accord on the whole range of issues which came before the Athens Council.  This failure can only damage the place of the Community in the world. Its impact on the ordinary working of the Community, in its planning, and its sense of purpose and confidence and even in its ordinary day-to-day working must be extremely serious.  It is evident, however, <Col N="1422" /> from the difficulties which virtually every member state had with the several proposals before us &mdash; difficulties expressed formally at the Council &mdash; that the problems now facing us are numerous and are likely to be very hard to resolve.</P>
    <P>I want to stress now my deep regret at the failure of this European Council.  So far as our own problem is concerned, no one could have been under any illusion about the inherent unacceptability for Ireland of a proposal which, within the relatively short period envisaged for the new milk régime, would have hit Ireland five times as hard as the UK would be affected by the budgetary imbalance.  I cannot help feeling that the fundamental error has been in failing to tackle a market problem by market mechanisms in good time &mdash; and then attempting, belatedly, to stop the resultant rot by an essentially arbitrary mechanism, incompatible with the most fundamental market principles of the Community, namely, quantitative restrictions under the guise of a super-levy.  Losses which all &mdash; ourselves included &mdash; have been willing to accept in different areas of their national markets for goods and services as a result of the operation of the competitive system within the Community become much more difficult when countries are asked to decide upon them by edict.</P>
    <P>We seek no more &mdash; but will certainly accept no less &mdash; than the share of the Community market for milk that would be produced by normal market processes through the operation of comparative advantage, within a total volume of production that is contained within reasonable limits by the operation of the price mechanism.  We have accepted all the industrial losses that membership of the Community by a small newly-industrialised economy has imposed &mdash; and the other member states have already secured the benefits of this process, with a large increase in their share of our domestic market for industrial goods.  It is now proposed to deprive us, by an arbitrary anti-market mechanism, of the benefits upon which virtually the entire economic balance of Community membership for Ireland was based.  Nothing could be more profoundly alien to the <Col N="1423" /> basic concept of a market-based European Community, to which we wholeheartedly adhered in 1973.</P>
    <P>As someone who demonstrated his profound commitment to the Community as far back as the fifties, long before we joined, and who gave full expression to this commitment in the campaign for membership in our 1972 referendum, I could not defend, nor would I attempt to do so, a deformation of the Community. Such a deformation would be involved if there were to be an arbitrary distortion of the market system which would prevent Ireland from securing its natural share of the market for milk which it could today enjoy but for the artificially distorting effects on us of policies followed in other countries in the years before 1973.</P>
    <P>The contrast with the Stuttgart Council could not have been sharper.  In the declaration on that Council the Heads of State and of Government spoke of taking &mdash; and I quote &mdash;&ldquo;broad action to ensure the relaunch of the European Community&rdquo;. We decided, in pursuit of this relaunching, to put in train a major negotiation designed &mdash; and again I quote &mdash;&ldquo;to provide a solid basis for the further dynamic development of the Community over the remainder of the present decade&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Given these hopes and intentions the lack of success in Athens was a major disappointment; but the futility of retrospection is only too obvious.  We could spend hours here in talking about what was or what might have been: that would do neither the country nor anyone else any good.  The best that can be said is that Athens has clarified the issues the Community must solve if it is to survive.</P>
    <P>While in Athens the British Prime Minister and I had the opportunity for a brief exchange of views on matters of mutual concern.  In accordance with the practice which has developed in relation to these meetings &mdash; which are short and informal &mdash; I do not propose to go into the detail of what was discussed.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I would like to pay tribute to the preparations for the Council by the Greek Presidency and in <Col N="1424" /> particular Mr. Varfis who chaired both the Special Council and the special preparatory group.  I would also like to commend the handling of the European Council in Athens by the Greek Prime Minister, Mr. Papandreou, to whose graciousness and hospitality I would like to pay a particular tribute.</P>
    <P>Finally, let me wish the French Presidency every goodwill and every hope for success in the most difficult task which lies ahead of them.  It is in the interests of not just Ireland and France &mdash; but also of every member state &mdash; that they should succeed, so that the Community can emerge from this most debilitating crisis.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the best I can do at the outset is to reiterate the wish with which the Taoiseach concluded his remarks, namely, that the French Presidency will be a successful one and that the great skill in political science which we traditionally associate with the French will be brought to bear during the course of that Presidency for solving the serious problems that confront Europe today.</P>
      <P>The failure of the Athens meeting while it has given a short breathing space so far as the imposition of a super-levy on milk is concerned, has the most serious implications both for this country and for the Commuinity as a whole.  The European Community in general, and Ireland in particular, will be subjected to severe pressures in the months immediately ahead as we bump up against the ceiling of the resources.  In fact, there may well be practical day-to-day difficulties in meeting the existing level of commitments leaving aside any question of improvements, certainly in the agricultural area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our country was united against the imposition of a super-levy which would prevent us from exploiting our natural advantages as a milk producer and which would effectively block the development of a vital area of our national economy. It has been heartening to see farmers and trade unionists forget their differences on this occasion and unite in the national interest.  Fianna Fáil in Opposition have given full support to the Government in their rejection of the super-levy while <Col N="1425" /> having some reservations about the conduct of the national campaign.</P>
    <P>There is not much point at this stage in going into detail about the Government's handling of the issue, but Deputies will recall that I drew the attention of the House to the dangers inherent in the outcome of the Stuttgart Summit and the wording of the communiqué which was issued after that summit, despite the Taoiseach's enthusiastic report to the House at that time.  I note that in his statement today he recalls with some regret the position that arose following the Stuttgart Council.  I would have thought it would have been obvious to us all at that time that while the communiqué did contain the words the Taoiseach mentioned about action to relaunch the European Community, it also contained very ominous wording so far as the future of the common agricultural policy and its financing was concerned. We in this country were slow to react to the danger signals which emerged from that summit.  Whatever about the effectiveness of our negotiating stand and its application in recent months, I believe we should now consider putting forward constructive alternative proposals to the super-levy because the super-levy is, as we can all see, a very blunt instrument.</P>
    <P>Surely it is not beyond the capacity of the experts to come up with a more refined and sophisticated system of dealing with the milk surplus which would take account of the gradations there are, almost infinite gradations, in milk production throughout the Community.  We must all constantly reiterate the difference there is between us and the milk producer and the number of our mainland partners.  We rely entirely on our natural resources to produce our milk while many of these countries achieve much higher levels of production by resorting to imports into the Community. The super-levy as a blunt instrument takes no account of that particular factor, no more than it does of other factors involved.</P>
    <P>It will become increasingly difficult to maintain a position of sale, that the super-levy is the right solution to the EEC dairy surplus problem as long as we <Col N="1426" /> are exempted from it.  In other words, it is the right solution for everybody else but not for us.  That is going to become a difficult position to defend even though it is fairly and validly placed on our totally different economic situation from that of all our partners.  However, it is up to the Government to decide what strategy is best and the Opposition will continue to support the Government and the public will have to judge both us and the Government on the results achieved.</P>
    <P>I am sure all Members of this House resent the attitude shown prior to the Athens Council by one or two members of the European Commission who appeared to have neither understanding nor sympathy for the Irish position.  I would refer in particular, though normally I do not like doing so, to the Agricultural Commissioner who comes from a country which has perhaps the most prosperous and highly developed agriculture in Europe and one cannot but recall, listening to his strictures on us in regard to milk production, the attitude which Denmark adopted on the occasion of the discussion on fishery policy when Denmark held up the situation in a way that to many seemed indefensible.  On the other hand, we must all be grateful for the constructive intervention of Commissioner Richard Burke and some of his wise and experienced colleagues who helped to highlight the problem the super-levy would create for Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Athens Summit was a complete failure, with no progress on any issue. There were, perhaps, too many important decisions which were interlinked, all of which were dependent upon each other.  Many European Councils have not been outstanding successes but I think there are few examples of such total breakdown as there has been in Athens. We should all of us consider the situation carefully now and try to decide for ourselves why Athens was such a failure. Apart from the complexity and the difficulty of the problems which confronted that Council it is difficult to comprehend that the assembled wisdom of the political leadership of Europe could not make any progress on any issue.  That is something <Col N="1427" /> to which we should give anxious consideration.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that a consistently disruptive element in the recent business of the Community has been Britain's preoccupation with her own demands.  It remains to be seen if this ultimately will have been in her own best interests and it must be remembered that the European Parliament has threatened to reject the EEC 1984 budget, including the British budgetary rebate, if the Athens meeting failed to take decisions.</P>
    <P>British attempts to hold the Community to ransom have served seriously to impede progress in the Community in recent years.  Rebates have been given on ad <i>ad hoc</i> basis to Britain.  But that apparently is not enough.  They seem to wish to institutionalise a system of <i>juste retour</i> contrary to the whole spirit of the Community. In addition to reducing her own financial contributions Britain seeks a curtailment of agricultural spending as a precondition to agreeing a modest increase in Community resources. Ireland must join with other EEC states and with the incoming French Presidency in resisting these attempts to dictate terms to the rest of the European Community.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out last night on RTE, too much is made of the problem of agricultural surpluses.  The United States of America grow vast quantities of subsidised grain on the prairies, 70 per cent of which it then disposes of as best it can on world markets.  The United States has the sense to exclude grain exports from any sanctions against the Soviet Union, regardless of political circumstances. Why does the United States act in this manner?  It does so because it feels a responsibility to secure the livelihood of its farmers across the United States.  If there is a demand for its grain, albeit at a subsidised rate, then it makes sense for the United States to produce it.</P>
    <P>I would boldly assert that it is better for the Community to produce agricultural surpluses which an enlightened policy could surely be able to make available to the Third World than to add tens of thousands to the dole queues right across <Col N="1428" /> Europe.  There is an appalling amount of hunger and malnutrition in the world and subsidised food exports and food aid can help to feed the world's population.</P>
    <P>I am continually surprised at the refusal by Britain to take account of the national interests of one of her best customers. It does not say much for efforts to improve Anglo-Irish relations, that we can consistently expect British opposition and obstruction to our attempts in Europe to gain recognition of our deep national interests.  I would remind this House, what I have said on a number of occasions, that we are Britain's fourth largest trading partner, and that last year we had a trade deficit of 1 billion pounds with Britain, where our trade with most other countries is either in surplus or in balance.</P>
    <P>As negotiations continue, I would like to see the Government adopt a more clear-cut opposition to the super-levy in principle.  Certain compromise principles were put forward by the Greek Presidency, which would have permitted first a 2 per cent then a 10 per cent rise in milk production over four years.  The Government rightly rejected these proposals. However, at the same time there seemed to be a suggestion that an offer in the region of 20 per cent might be negotiable. I would have to point out that in 1982 milk production was up by 7.8 per cent and this year up to mid-October butter production was up by 19 per cent and skimmed milk production by about 16 per cent.  Even a 20 per cent quota could, under favourable circumstances, be used up in a couple of years.  On this basis, therefore, we will continue to support the Government on an outright opposition to anything less than a complete exemption. The fight will also have to be extended into the whole CAP arena and the attempts constantly being made to undermine the principles of the Common Agricultural Policy and, thereby, to change the very nature of the Community.</P>
    <P>I turn briefly to the Taoiseach's short meeting with the British Prime Minister. I note that the reference in his statement to this meeting is exceptionally short. These meetings are generally availed of <Col N="1429" /> to discuss matters relating to Northern Ireland.  The escalating war of words between the RUC chief constable and what are euphemistically described as &ldquo;sources close to the Garda Commissioner&rdquo; represents an extraordinary and unprecedented state of affairs.  It throws a very curious light on claims by the Taoiseach, that the recent summit in London represented a full normalisation of Anglo-Irish relations.  The House would like to know exactly what is going on in this area.</P>
    <P>I am sure that in the informal discussions, the European Heads of Government discussed current international tensions and the dangers inherent in them.  I hope they did and, in particular, the dangerous escalation in the Middle East situation, and the state of East-West relations following the breakdown of the arms talks in Geneva.</P>
    <P>I hope the Taoiseach emphasised that the Lebanon situation is a matter of deep concern to us, since we have our own troops stationed there, and it is at present a most dangerous international flashpoint. The position of UNIFIL and its mandate should be re-examined urgently and its continued usefulness assessed.</P>
    <P>As 1983 draws to a close, it is difficult to be optimistic about the Community and its prospects.  That feeling is reflected right through the Taoiseach's statement. It is difficult to see where we are going with so many questions left unresolved and so many time constraints to be met.</P>
    <P>It is a depressing truth that Europe today is far more a group of national member states than it was, say, five years ago.  That was very obvious in the run up to the Athens Summit.  There did not appear to be any attempt to develop a Community approach.  Right up to the last few days it was simply a question of each individual member state as a national member state stating its position and its demands.</P>
    <P>The Community ideal and spirit have been diminishing rather than strengthening in recent years.  We must wonder why this is so.  Is it a reflection of the appallingly difficult times in which we live or is it a reflection of a failure of European leadership?  One wonders if Adenauer <Col N="1430" /> and Gaspari and Schumann were here today, would the Heads of Governments in Athens spend that amount of time arguing about agricultural surpluses and ending up in complete disagreement? In Europe do we lack the stature and the quality of leadership which is needed and which was once available to us?  I do not know.  It seems to me that Heads of Governments go to European Councils more as ambassadors and spokesmen for their own national interests than as European leaders committed to an ideal of European integration.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, we must not be alarmists despite the results of the Athens Summit.  Alarmist talk only encourages those who are hostile to the purposes of the European Community.</P>
    <P>Over the years the Community has shown an ability to get round the immediate practical problems created by deadlock. I believe the commitment of most member countries, Ireland included, to the Community is such that it will carry us through, and that brinkmanship tactics will not succeed in their objectives.  We must co-operate closely with our partners to see indeed that that does not happen.</P>
    <P>The super-levy does not exist.  It is in the interests of our farmers to proceed and plan on that basis and not to be deterred or frozen into immobility by the threats to their interests that are made from time to time in various European quarters.  Such threats can be defeated if we maintain our national unity and if the Government maintain their resolution.  If they do, the Taoiseach and his Ministers can be assured of our support in the months immediately ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be quite brief because I do not believe there is much to be said.  The Athens Summit has collapsed and we want to know what we are going to do now, and where do we go from now on.  That is what we have not been told.  There is a marked difference between the optimism shown by the Taoiseach in his statement in June following the Stuttgart Summit and the pessimism which goes right through the statement he made here today.  It is unfortunate that the Taoiseach has not given us any <Col N="1431" /> projections of what will happen.  Where does he see us going? Where does he see the EEC going?  He has not given us the benefit of his knowledge on this subject or any projection about it, possibly because he sees the future as being so bad that he does not wish to burden us.</P>
      <P>The EEC has changed radically in concept. Everyone is anxious to know exactly what happened and what effect the summit collapse had on the EEC, on the members of the EEC, on us, on the farming community and the urban community in general.  Has the original concept collapsed?  Where is the Schumann ideal?  Is it forgotten?  Have Kohl and Thatcher a new concept of the Common Market, a new concept of a free market economy in the EEC?  Do they see a gradual wiping out of the social policy and the regional policy of the EEC?</P>
      <P>West Germany and the UK now dominate the EEC.  We want to know is it the same EEC we joined in 1973.  The most important part of the Taoiseach's statement was on page 10 where he said:</P>
      <P>We have accepted all the industrial losses that membership of the Community by a small newly-industrialised economy has imposed &mdash; and the other member states have already secured the benefits of this process, with a large increase in their share of our domestic market for industrial goods.  It is now proposed to deprive us, by an arbitrary anti-market mechanism, of the benefits upon which virtually the entire economic balance of Community membership for Ireland was based.</P>
      <P>That is a very fundamental statement.  It means that the very concept on which we entered the EEC seems to have changed. We have taken all the losses.  We have made all the sacrifices.  We have lost jobs. We have huge unemployment as a result of factory closures.  Now we are not to get the benefits we thought we would get.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the Taoiseach thought out any new policies to deal with the new situation? Is he prepared to drop the good European image which apparently he felt would help in negotiations while others were not such good Europeans?  Is he prepared <Col N="1432" /> to protect our industry and jobs as other EEC countries have been doing?  The Government must now take a more independent line and adopt measures to restrict imports of foodstuffs.  I am quite sure our customs people can work out many new forms to be filled in, as the French and the British customs people are now doing, to assist us in restricting imports.  They may have other new ideas to prevent the import of goods which are causing job losses and losses to the economy in the interests of being good Europeans.</P>
    <P>Workers in urban areas have made these sacrifices.  They will now be less willing to make the sacrifices of high food prices and job losses, especially if they are getting no benefit from them.  I referred to this last June after the Taoiseach's statement on the Stuttgart Summit. The EEC has very little relevance to the urban workers.  They know nothing about it.  They have no interest in it.  It does not relate to them.  To the farming community it is the most important thing in their lives.  They know every detail of everything that happens and all that is said here today is being lapped up by the farmers.  It is not really relevant to urban workers.  They were prepared to put up with the sacrifices because they felt that the benefits to agriculture would bring benefits to the food processing industry and would spread through the country. They will be less willing to do so now.</P>
    <P>Every party and every Member should take a new look at the EEC and the effect on our country of our participation in it. It is up to every party to look at it again. Certainly we in The Workers' Party will be re-examining the whole position because we believe a fundamental change has taken place in the concept of the EEC and that it is not to Ireland's benefit.</P>

    <Title>European Council Meeting. - Transport Bill, 1983: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I have referred to difficulties which have existed from time to time concerning industrial relations <Col N="1433" /> within CIE.  Commuters have found on certain days that no buses have been running and they have been left with the prospect of walking to work, hitching a lift or using their cars if they have them, with the resultant loss to the country in many hours and absenteeism as well as the frustration caused to the would-be commuters.  A situation where one man carrying a placard outside a bus or railway station can bring public transport to a halt should be very much a last resort, a last ditch procedure.  Any future restructuring within CIE should seek to prevent such an occurrence.  For far too long the public have had to put up with this type of action and many people, young and old, have been put to great inconvenience either by having to walk or through being unable to make a journey.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that the taxpayer will not continue to have to write large cheques at the end of each year to cover CIE's deficit.  Every individual worker in CIE has a part to play.  Those who may have soft jobs must be told that they are not performing to the required standard or that their departments are not operating at the level which the public demand and at a viable cost.  While some losses will have to be borne in running services in some parts of the country, many improvements and savings can be made and greater efficiency can be achieved if each individual performs to the best of his ability in providing the service which the public want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There must be a greater effort to win back passengers and ensure that the services are used.  When people are deciding whether to travel by car, train or bus they must see a certain attractiveness in using public transport which will depart and arrive on time and provide the comforts and services which any modern transport system should have.  It is important that we sell the service and that the public are proud of it and will use it.  I believe many people will use these services if they can travel in comfort at a reasonable cost and can depend on the service.  In too many areas services are of a haphazard nature.  In the present difficult financial circumstances the <Col N="1434" /> people paying the bill deserve a good service.  If a commercial enterprise can run a return service to Cork for £10, we must ask why CIE can only do so for £18.50.  These are the questions the public are asking and they must be answered if confidence is to be restored to the service so that CIE will not become the but of further jokes.  When the Government bring forward their proposals there will be further discussions on this question.</P>
    <P>Some aspects of the Dublin city bus service can be improved, especially in relation to cross-city routes.  In order to travel from Castleknock to Donnybrook one must cross the city centre.  There is a converging of every type of vehicle in this area and we must try to cut out some of this over-centralisation of traffic in O'Connell Street, Dame Street and along the quays.  Our main objective must be to provide a service on which passengers can rely and which they can use as conveniently as their own car.  We must eliminate the hitches which have existed heretofore.</P>
    <P>I wish the new chairman of CIE every success.  It is going to be a difficult operation. Decisions will have to be made which will affect various aspects of society, whether looked at from the urban or rural point of view.  There will be people adversely affected.  I trust that a general consensus will be arrived at finally so that, as far as possible the loss to the State will be minimised and the country will have a dependable transport system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose in the time available to me not to travel the whole transport system, as one might be inclined to do in a debate such as this, but rather to appear parochial.  That is not an attitude which I adopt too often in this House and I am hoping that in the course of my short contribution I will be able to get the understanding of the Chair and the sympathy of the Minister to an extraordinary and appalling situation which exists in the matter of our transport system.  For years, my late father was an employee of the old GSR.  I have had an attachment to and an interest in our transport system.  I have defended CIE in <Col N="1435" /> the past and will continue to defend them where appropriate, in the matter of the service which is required of them.</P>
      <P>Successive Ministers have indicated that the difficulty with CIE is that it is required not solely to act from economic considerations but also to bear in mind social considerations.  I accept that.  I am not going to develop the point beyond giving that background and asking the House: does what I shall have to say not tend to make a mockery of what we are discussing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the area which I represent and on behalf of whose people I speak in this House, I am, for the second time, stating the position obtaining for the last year and a half.  It would not be my style to attack any Minister and I accept that the total responsibility is not the present Minister's. What I am referring to obtained also under our Government and I was as critical of it then as I am now.  In that part of Dublin, not away on the top of a mountain or living in isolation, hundreds of people, all potential and anxious CIE customers, until last May from 7 p.m. onwards were denied public transport.  It was not a question of their not being in a position to pay or be happy to pay for the service &mdash; the service was taken from them.  Since last May there has been an alleged improvement in so far as the service was continued until 9 p.m. I do not have to remind the Chair that the normal service in Dublin, as elsewhere, continues until 11.30 p.m. In that part of Dublin &mdash; and I know that the same obtains elsewhere &mdash; there are young and old, workers and non-workers, people returning from their employment and from their social life, whatever that might have been, who are unable to avail of CIE's services.  I heard Deputy Cosgrave say a few moments ago that CIE must go looking for customers.  The customers are there and CIE will not provide for them. I accept that there might be some foundation for this, but the alleged reason is that in respect of the services which had existed, some of the drivers or conductors of the buses were subjected to a certain harassment by people, some living in the area and some living outside it, but certainly <Col N="1436" /> people unrepresentative of the normal person living in that area.</P>
    <P>Public meetings were held with a view to having this corrected and I remember addressing such a public meeting in the presence of some CIE staff, of union representatives of CIE and members of the Garda.  I told them that, as far as I was concerned, the buses did not belong to the CIE staff or workers or to the Garda but to the people whose taxes paid for them initially and whose taxes, direct and indirect, maintained that service. Even at this moment, when the service is being denied to them, they are required, in taxation direct and indirect, to pay for the service which is being provided for others.  We all know that the people to whom I refer are not blessed with the most of this world's goods; they are people who are solely dependent upon the transport system.  It is not being given.  Even though I have, with representatives of that area, talked with CIE and with the Ministers for Transport and for Justice, the situation still obtains that after 9 p.m. there is no service for these people.  That is not a fairytale; that is the situation which exists in that area.</P>
    <P>I am a person elected by those people to come and speak here on their behalf and I am being asked to agree to the provision of additional moneys for that alleged transport company &mdash; that company which, as far as I am concerned, are defaulting in the legal requirements on them to provide the service.  I am not going to do that.  I have spoken with our spokesman on Transport earlier in the normal conversation which occurs here. I asked if we were accepting this and he said we were.  I said to him, &ldquo;You will not mind if I do not&rdquo;.  I could not live with my conscience.  I could not appear so hypocritical that I could now return to the great people of Finglas and tell them that I had agreed to CIE having more money.&rdquo;  This is perhaps to buy more buses, perhaps to construct more garages which will house buses which will provide a service for people who are much less dependent on it than are the people of Finglas.</P>
    <P>I now propose to be more direct and more cynical towards the situation than <Col N="1437" /> would be my wish or my custom.  In my understandable pursuit of obtaining fair play for these people, I wrote to the two Ministers who it is said have the responsibility in the matter of the services not being provided&mdash;first, the Minister for Transport and, secondly, the Minister for Justice who was alleged not to have cooperated in the matter of assisting CIE in the provision of the services.  A fortnight ago I addressed a question to both Ministers asking them for the present position regarding the withholding and denial of their rightful service to the people of Finglas.  Lo and behold, what happened in respect of the question addressed to the Minister for Transport who is now looking for this money to invest in all the necessary CIE provisions?  I got a reply from the Ceann Comhairle's office dated 18 November 1983.  I did not know then that this Bill would be coming before the House at this stage and that I would have the opportunity of referring to it in this manner.  The letter went:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy Tunney,</P>
    <P>I regret that I have had to disallow the question addressed by you to the Minister for Transport regarding the denial of the bus service to the people of Finglas and asking if he will restore the service without any further delay.</P>
    <P>I ask the Chair to pay particular heed to this, especially in view of what we are discussing here.  The final sentence states:</P>
    <P>This is a matter for CIE itself and the Minister has no responsibility in respect of it.</P>
    <P>As a Member of this House, who can now address myself to the funding of CIE, who are required to provide a service, which is being catered for in the scheme we have here by the Minister for Transport, I was told last week in a letter on his behalf that he is not responsible for it.  I did not ask that the service be changed from 3.15 to 3.30.  I did not refer to the day-to-day running of CIE.  I was reminding the Minister for the umpteenth time of the fact that there were customers in this city who for the past one and a half years did not have the <Col N="1438" /> service which the Minister had obliged CIE to give them and I am politely told that he has no responsibility.  If he has not why is he here representing CIE looking for this money?  Is this money going to some airy fairy capital expenditure that I have not been advised about?  Has something new happened in relation to the responsibilities of CIE since we last debated this matter in the House? How is it that I can be told that the Minister for Transport has no responsibility?  They prefix this with a rather doubtful adjective and say no official responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an unfair denial to the people of Finglas.  The Minister or his officers must have known that this letter was being issued.  That is the reason I am accepting that the Minister has shelved that responsibility and that I am dissenting from any co-operation in providing the money he seeks.  I would not want our spokesman or my party to come out in sympathy with me but at least I have the opportunity to say in the House, as it is my responsibility to do, to the Minister for Transport that he is walking away from his responsibility to those people.  He might ask if I know that on occasions a, b or c, a CIE conductor reported that somebody had attacked him.  I can tell him that CIE bus conductors have been attacked on every route in Dublin and arrangements have been made for CIE, in co-operation with the Minister for Justice and the local gardaí to continue providing the service.  What is special about this area that this co-operation is not being provided?  I do not want to be flippant about such a serious matter but surely if it is not safe for a double decker bus to move through a particular area the logical development of that is that it is much less safe for people who have to walk that distance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know of anybody who has been attacked, mugged or beaten in that area to any greater extent than happens in any other part of the city of Dublin, Cork, Limerick or anywhere else.  Will we give more money to CIE without an assurance being given to me that the <Col N="1439" /> service, which the people are entitled to and which CIE are required to provide under law, will be denied to those people any longer?  At times like this of goodwill towards all men we have to think of the poor widow, the old age pensioner and the unfortunate woman with the two children travelling here and there.  I am referring to this because it is fact rather than to add anything special to my point.</P>
    <P>We have often heard reference to the person described as the ordinary worker. I never use the word &ldquo;ordinary&rdquo; because we are all very ordinary workers.  We know in this time of mass unemployment how difficult it is for people to obtain normal nine to five employment and how we should be prepared to assist them to obtain employment at any time during the day and from five or six o'clock in the evening up to 11 a.m. at night.  Is the gratitude we are prepared to give to any industrious person, who is prepared to go out to work during those hours, that we tell that person that in relation to the transport system such a person cannot have public transport after 9 o'clock if he or she lives in a particular area.  We are telling such a person to move elsewhere and public transport will be provided up to 11.30 p.m. although many people in other areas are not contributing to the same extent to the State as are the PAYE workers in that area.</P>
    <P>I feel I am understating my case.  I cannot understand, when I hear people at parliamentary party meetings in other areas trying to justify why buses should run up the side of a mountain to bring down two or three people because it is a social service, why a service is not being provided for the people in the area I am talking about.  How can CIE justify sending out an articulated lorry to deliver a child's pram or something of that nature because they are obliged under the Act to do that?  I accept they have that social obligation and we can never hold up the mirror of precise enonomics to an organisation who have such an obligation but that is some distance from the situation where there is a ready market available to them and they will not serve it.  I often <Col N="1440" /> wonder if that is the reason they do not supply it.</P>
    <P>I would not make a case under circumstances in which CIE can be accused of being more interested in avoiding customers than in picking them up.  This is a specific case where CIE are not providing a service.  We must be conscious of the fact that anything said here can always be used in evidence against them. I am never afraid to say what I think. Will the Minister tell me if those CIE workers are paid to work until 9 o'clock only?  In the past were they paid to work until 7 o'clock only?  What happens about the ghost bus that delivers CIE employees to the area and appears there at midnight? Is there something special or unusual about that bus that the occupants do not fear any of the attacks that excuses them from giving the service earlier?  I hope the Minister comments on that when replying.</P>
    <P>I have other thoughts on CIE and our transport system but I am leaving them aside so that I can major in what is most vital to me and the people I represent.  I now have an opportunity to expand on this.  I am not inviting strictures from the Chair but I notice that although I have been referring in my contribution to the absence of a service in my constituency the Chair did not see fit to regard that as not relevant to the Bill under discussion. I am not inviting a reprimand from the Chair but I know the Chair must accept the appropriateness of those comments in circumstances where money is being sought from taxpayers.  I welcome the opportunity to state that I am opposed to granting any further moneys on the basis I refer to.</P>
    <P>I shall move from Finglas to the centre of the city now.  While travelling from Doyle's Corner to Dame Street I notice a big number of buses carrying a very few passengers and they could be conveyed on 10 per cent of the number of buses being used.  I may be told that that occurs in valley periods and that I drive through that area at a time when there is no demand for buses, but that happens so often that I am inclined to think the organisation of the service is not such as to attract the same number of passengers <Col N="1441" /> that use the public transport service in the capitals of the countries I have visited.</P>
    <P>CIE who are losing a lot of money employ a team of two people to drive a double decker at considerable cost and that cost is not justified.  They could be accused of contributing to the appalling pollution that exists in the city and for no good reason.  I am sure the Minister, his advisers and CIE, who examine ways to economise, are aware of this.  At any time in Dublin city, excluding between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m., one can see up to 20 double decker buses that will not be carrying 50 passengers between them.  That cannot be counted an economic proposition and as long as it continues so long will successive Ministers have to come here seeking additional money.  I am happy at any time to pay for a service but I am not happy to pay where value is not given.</P>
    <P>Over the years I have tried to discover a formula that might improve CIE services in Dublin but, unfortunately, I have not been any more original in my ideas than others who have given some thought to this problem.  CIE should consider farming out buses to people who would be prepared to operate them.  If we had that system there would be better employment of the buses.  Drivers and conductors would be enthusiastic in their pursuit of passengers.  Instead of speeding away from bus stops and trying to justify their actions by saying that they have to meet a schedule, drivers and conductors under such a system would make adjustments to allow them to carry more passengers.  People would get as good a service under such a system as they get at present.  I am critical of CIE employees who man the buses.  I might add that it is not a job I would relish but if I had it I would satisfy the spirit and requirements of it.  I would look upon every person using the service, as I do in my present vocation, as a person in whom I would be interested and feel under an obligation to do my best for.  That is not being done at present.  I do not know what it is that agitates the minds of those people.  It is possible that the nature of the work is such that there is not the consolation in it that those in other occupations get.  It <Col N="1442" /> is well known, and there is no point in hiding this, that generally speaking the manpower do not reflect any great happiness in their work.  It may be that they are not being paid enough.  Whatever the reason, everybody knows that they are not happy in their work.</P>
    <P>I will not refer to the rumours I have heard of how that manifests itself.  I make it a point of travelling by bus on at least two occasion in the year.  On one occasion as I was boarding a bus I noticed an elderly lady making for the same bus and I drew the attention of the driver to this. I said to him, &ldquo;There is another passenger anxious to travel on this bus&rdquo; and the retort I got was, &ldquo;There are more buses coming&rdquo;.  What can one do in such circumstances? That is not the type of attitude that gives any satisfaction to those who use the service.  It may be that the staff hold the view that because the wages are low it is not worth their while working any harder.</P>
    <P>The scheme I have suggested has incentives in it.  CIE could lease a bus for a year and tell the person hiring it that a specific number will operate on that route.  It could be made clear that under the system the work would be heavier but those involved would be in a position to earn more money.  &ldquo;If that happens there will be more money in it for you; you will be in a position to earn much more money than you are now, the work will be heavier.&rdquo; Perhaps they would respond to such a challenge.  It is obvious that they are not responding to that challenge at present and they have not the job satisfaction we should like them to have.</P>
    <P>I should say I am not talking about the totality of people who work for CIE. Some are excellent workers, friends of mine and, because of that, they would wish me to refer to members of staff found in every organisation who are not as good as the rest.  It would appear that the latter set standards for others.  Situations arise &mdash; thank God not so frequently now &mdash; in which some domestic bother in a certain garage leads to a member of the staff of CIE placing a picket there, resulting in countless numbers of people being denied service to and from their respective places of employment, a service on <Col N="1443" /> which they depend to earn the money out of which the moneys I am being asked to agree here are obtained.  It will not continue indefinitely.</P>
    <P>I have spoken at greater length than I had anticipated.  I referred to the Minister &mdash; repeat the Minister &mdash; and I do not mean only the Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, who happens to be the holder of the office at present.  I referred in similar terms to his predecessor in respect of service.  If any change occurs, if there is any new Minister early next year &mdash; and if the people of Finglas have not been given the service to which they are entitled, which it is the responsibility of CIE and the Minister for Transport to provide for them, just as is provided for every other citizen of this State, then I shall avail of the earliest opportunity to address myself to this House in similar terms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been requested to be brief and intend to be so.  However, I should like to make a few salient points. In welcoming this Bill I congratulate the Minister on his feat in encouraging CIE to live, or practically live, within their subvention.  That is a most desirable objective.  The Minister has done remarkably well in this respect, in encouraging this company beset by continuous financial problems.  I think that is the shape of things to come.  By the end of the present Minister's term in office I believe he will have travelled a considerable distance in helping CIE achieve, as near as can be, a desirable financial situation.</P>
      <P>Having made those few remarks I must agree with many speakers who have expressed the belief that CIE are rather maligned.  Indeed one contributor suggested that they were not nearly as maligned as were TDs.  I think it would take a photo-finish to establish which of us is the more maligned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The outgoing chairman, Mr. St. John Devlin, in a recent Sunday newspaper said that the Government must decide the priority for CIE: for example, was it to provide a social service or a commercially viable entity?  With the number of people travelling buckshee on CIE I cannot <Col N="1444" /> see how it could ever be made commercially viable.  Many people travel free, my own parents to name just two, who could pay.  The Government should examine that aspect at some stage in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but much of the bad image that CIE have in the country emanates from the very bad industrial relations that appear to exist between their ordinary workers and management. This is most regrettable and undesirable. Both parties continuously point the finger at one another.  It is my belief that CIE workers can be criticised fairly and should accept such criticism for their deplorable record of strikes which in turn reflects very badly not alone on CIE but also on our industrial image abroad.  The number of strikes there have been in CIE in recent years cannot have gone unnoticed beyond our shores and must be seen as a deterrent by many would-be investors here.  CIE workers should recognise this fact and endeavour to reduce the number of petty strikes that occur continually within the company.</P>
    <P>Management can also be faulted for their heavy level throughout the different strata of the company.  Indeed over the years CIE provided lucrative, fertile ground for jobs for the boys, particularly on the part of previous Fianna Fáil Governments, which levels have remained and been filled over the years. The Minister should address himself to weeding out some of these because there is no doubt but that the company is top-heavy at management level.  I believe also there are cars provided for these people, many in minor managerial posts, that they can take these cars home, use them throughout the week, take them home at the weekend and, it is said, they can obtain petrol very freely.  I do not know about that but I do know that staff cars are freely available within CIE and they constitute a bigger scandal than was the provision of cars for Ministers of State.</P>
    <P>There are other matters I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  One such is the amount of ground that CIE are sitting on all around the country.  In my town of Dundalk, the largest in the country, there are acres upon acres <Col N="1445" /> under-utilised which could be sold gainfully. This must be repeated all over the country with regard to old railway stations, sidings, extensive ground acquired in the early years of this century which, if sold, would yield millions of pounds to CIE which money could be used for more productive purposes.  I shall give just one small example in my town where in recent years CIE closed their bar and cafeteria. They have also closed the agency that was available to a national newspaper concern, both of which premises remain idle despite repeated requests by many commercial interests in Dundalk, to my certain knowledge, which have not been met.  Surely that constitutes a ridiculous situation?  Such requests have not been met when the sale of such premises could garner £5,000 or £6,000 a year, which situation probably is repeated throughout the country.  I would ask the Minister to examine the possibility of selling those assets which have been clearly designated for non-usage in the years to come.</P>
    <P>I would bring to the Minister's notice the strange fact that CIE, a semi-State body, are currently engaged in transporting thousands of people from the South across the Border to spend their money in the North.  Appeals to patriotism are falling on deaf ears and in the battle of the half crown against the crown, the crown is winning.  In Dundalk we have had to witness the daily spectacle of hundreds of cars being driven north through the town to the distress of local shopkeepers.  Apart from the economic damage they are doing to Dundalk, these cars are causing traffic chaos in the town every day.</P>
    <P>From this traffic Newry is benefiting to the tune of £2 million per week.  It used to be a ghost town because of IRA activities but it is now a boom town, an EI Dorado, and it has made a ghost town of Dundalk where in the main street one can see &ldquo;for sale&rdquo; signs all over the place. Deputy Leonard will know of this because it is the same in Castleblaney and Monaghan.  We can see CIE competing for the business of bringing those people to the North from every town and city in the South.  It should be brought to the notice of those people that every time <Col N="1446" /> they leave their money in Northern Ireland they threaten the livelihood of their own people in the South.  We can read all about it in local newspapers.</P>
    <P>Various Deputies have spoken about public transport in their constituency. Deputies R. Bruton and Tunney referred to Dublin traffic and buses in the city, and Deputy Kenny spoke about train services in his constituency.  I want to speak about trains to the North and to voice support for the continuation of general rail traffic.  The McKinsey Report recommended that Governments in future years may have to consider rail closures.  I deplore this.  One has only to look at the isolation of many parts of the country in the past 40 years because of rail link closures.  I am aghast at the threat of further closures of mainline services.</P>
    <P>I travel frequently on the Dublin-Belfast train and on occasions I have been unable to get on the train because the demand is so great.  Sometimes when I manage to board I have to stand for part of the journey.  The demand has increased in recent years because more and more people are turning from road to rail travel.  Apart from anything else, rail travel is more reasonable from the fare point of view: one can get a return excursion ticket from Dundalk to Dublin for £3 at weekends.  Such a fare seems ridiculously low by comparison with road travel.  What CIE should be doing is launching an advertising campaign boosting the attraction of rail travel in winter because rail travel needs a vote of confidence.</P>
    <P>I welcome the news that we have placed an order for more rolling stock. CIE's rolling stock has been run down in recent years without replacement.  Much of that rolling stock used to be imported and I am happy to see that the rolling stock on order is being made at Inchicore. I understand that rolling stock was being imported because of bad labour relations. I hope the unions have seen the light and that they will encourage their members to adopt a more responsible attitude so that all our rolling stock can be manufactured here.</P>
    <P>I have misgivings about the introduction of rail electrification particularly <Col N="1447" /> because even before the Howth-Bray electrified train services come into operation there are prospects of horrific losses.  I wonder who recommended this transition at such great cost.  The quicker we drop rail electrification the better.</P>
    <P>They are just a few of the thoughts I wished to express to the Minister.  He has a serious problem but he has made a very good start in his first year.  It was a great achievement to try to encourage CIE to reduce the need for subvention.  I hope that at the end of his period of office he will have helped to whip CIE into shape.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Reading the Minister's speech one is struck by the hearty sentiments in it, but are they only words of sound and fury which will have very little effect?  Up to 31 March 1983, CIE's total capital borrowing amounted to £175.5 million.  Written in those two lines are the history of the disaster which is CIE.  That company have been bedevilled by strikes and all the things that should not happen in a well-managed organisation. People all over the country must be aware of which buses travel to Donnycarney, Rathgar and so on because morning after morning they hear on the radio that &ldquo;the following routes are affected by bus strikes&rdquo;.  This is a disgraceful situation. When one looks at the figure of £175.5 million, one relates that to the subvention per head of the taxpaying population, which is fairly substantial, and a person in a constituency like mine will relate that to the service which is provided.  This service is dwindling day by day, and it was never very good even at the best of times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that in a new policy departure for CIE the Government announced that &ldquo;one-third of what it does is considered social and consequently one-third of its expenditure should be its subvention&rdquo;.  Will that social service be related to the whole country or will it be confined to the cities?  In my area over the last few years the service has been declining and very few buses are operating there at present.  Last week I had a letter from the CIE transport manager in Dundalk.  I asked if he would <Col N="1448" /> consider continuing the service from the Tyrone border into Monaghan, a distance of about ten miles.  This service was availed of almost entirely by people with free travel passes but it was their only way of getting into Monaghan town every week.  In his letter he said that following representations made 12 months ago CIE had agreed to continue this service although the income they had secured had been approximately £159.  It would be very hard for any public representative at any time, and especially in times of financial constraints, to argue against this philosophy, but when we look at the social aspect we realise that these people are as entitled to a subsidised bus service as the people in the cities.</P>
    <P>The social aspect in every area will have to be examined.  CIE will have to decide if they are going to continue to provide a service in areas like Cavan and Monaghan because at present the service provided in those areas is minimal.  It could not be reduced further because the next step must be elimination.  The one-third subvention should be supplied across the board and every area should be encouraged to provide a service for their population.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon mentioned the train north, but he did not say that that train stopped at Dundalk and that there was no service for the next 40 miles.  That service was withdrawn, regrettably, in 1958 when the lines were lifted and the property disposed of.  We got a commitment, maybe not as strong as we would like, that there would be an additional allocation for the improvement of roads. In the following few years extra money was provided but soon we got an allocation on a par with areas where a railway service was provided.  At that time CIE were very remiss because they disposed of large sheds &mdash; they did not sell them &mdash; and sold land with buildings for something like £1,500 to £2,000.  In the sixties when accommodation was required for school buses, CIE had small yards but no sheds.  If CIE had kept up with the times they would have provided smaller buses and they would have investigated those routes more closely rather than engage in a book-keeping exercise.  CIE may talk <Col N="1449" /> about the one-third subvention but they showed very little social conscience when they reduced those routes.  I agree it is very hard to justify the retention of such services from a financial point of view, but when one looks at the social aspect one realises that it is very hard to justify what CIE did when they did away with the railways.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Tunney when he said that CIE should have moved into the area of leasing buses.  At present many industries are leasing buses or getting operatives to provide a service in their name, but an organisation like CIE which is in desperate straits should have shown some initiative and should not have been so conservative especially when they were getting such a high subvention.  One sees many buses at the side of the road &mdash; school buses or ordinary CIE passenger buses &mdash; with seats or red signs at the back telling all that they have broken down.  When one sees the appalling deterioration that has taken place in these vehicles one wonders how they will be renewed.  One wonders why greater care was not taken of them.  One wonders why they were not better maintained.  There is massive unemployment in the car repair industry.  Surely CIE could have devised a scheme under the temporary employment scheme for the repair of these buses.  In that way employment could have been provided in different areas throughout the country and the buses would have been kept in better repair.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to CIE introducing excursions by bus to Northern Ireland.  I was at a meeting on Monday night and I found it very hard to answer questions when people asked what was CIE about, our national bus service, when they made it easy for shoppers from the Republic to go and spend their money in Northern Ireland.  Several Deputies referred to this.  It is easy to blame CIE but one has to remember they are doing this in competition with the private coach services.  We must put the blame where it rightly belongs and that is on the Minister for Finance and his 1983 budget which imposed all kinds of taxes.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an important Bill.  It deals with borrowing for CIE for capital purposes and capital expenditure.  Some of the capital expenditure over the past few years has not been very fruitful.  There was a large garage built in Thurles.  While there was a certain incentive to build that garage, the result has been the closure of a number of smaller garages within a radius of about 30 miles.  All the servicing of the school buses was carried out in a large yard in Birr.  That yard has been in <Col N="1451" /> existence for roughly 40 years and during that time not so much as one hour was lost by any worker in that yard because of a strike.  Industrial relations were excellent.  There was never any trouble. I was on a number of deputations about the threatened closure of this yard in Birr and I was hoping that some of the representations I made would bear fruit and that commonsense would prevail.  Unfortunately that was not the evolution.  The workers were moved from Birr to Thurles.</P>
    <P>There was a road freight operation which was profit-making.  There seemed to be a good case for the retention of this facility and this particular service in Birr. CIE unfortunately decided they would not continue with the road haulage from this particular yard.  The servicing of school buses was carried out in this yard. Then it was decided to service buses in Thurles.  The smallest repair now has to be done in Thurles and the bus needing repair has to travel 30 to 40 miles for the smallest of repairs which heretofore were made by very skilled people at one of the top garages in the country according to an internal work study carried out by CIE.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Closure of Scarriff (Clare) Chipboard Factory: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Daly on Tuesday 6 December 1983:</P>
    <P>That, in view of its importance to the national forestry programme and to the saw-mill industry and its employment implications for the nation, Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to implement the development plan for Chipboard Products Ltd., Scarriff, already prepared by the company and meanwhile, to ensure that the commercial operation of the company is no longer prevented.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> To delete the words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann urges the Government to support the development of a viable Chipboard Industry.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>Will I start?  I will not get any value if the Minister is not over there.  It is very strange.  He got a rough ride last night and perhaps he does not want to come back for any more.</P>
      <P>I made it clear last night and I want to reiterate now that sections 286 and 288 of the Companies Act, 1963, which deal with the question of fraudulent preference apply to the giving of a debenture in favour of the Minister for Finance on 11 November last.  The dubious and deceitful circumstances in which this debenture was obtained were intended to have the effect of making the Government a secured creditor to the detriment of the unsecured creditors and private shareholders in Chipboard.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that the debenture is invalid because no meeting of the board was called and the company's seal was authenticated by two (A) (Private) directors in contravention of article 14 of the memorandum and articles of the company. In any event, the unsecured creditors against whom this attempt at fraudulent preference was carried out by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry, Deputy O'Toole, and his officials, can have the effect of the debenture set aside by applying to the court to appoint a liquidator.  In fact, I understand some of them are contemplating doing this quickly.</P>
      <P>This legal action is forced on them by the unethical efforts of a member of the Irish Government fraudulently to prefer his own claim before those of ordinary traders who understandably believed that an Irish State company would not renege on its commercial obligations.</P>

The consequences of this commercial immorality by the Government will have far-reaching repercussions both here and abroad.  If the Government have reneged in the case of a viable trading company like this, what are they likely to do with the debts of a company that clearly is not solvent like CIE?</P>
      <P>In this connection it is worth quoting two brief messages sent to the Government by two of the foreign creditors to show the extent of their amazement.  The first is dated today's date and is a telex addressed to the Minister of Economical Affairs of the Government of Ireland, Dublin and reads:</P>
      <P>Re: Chipboard Scarriff</P>
      <P>We are regular suppliers of material for the manufacturing of veneered chipboard for many years.</P>
      <P>As the Irish Government is the main share-holder of Chipboard Scarriff we understand that payments are and have been guaranteed by the Irish Government for our deliveries.</P>
      <P>Therefore we trust that our outstanding invoices are going to be paid.</P>
      <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
      <P Just="Right">Van Hout B.V.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other is addressed to the receiver of <Col N="1454" /> Chipboard Products Limited, Scarriff, from Karl Danzer of Reutlingen, Germany, and reads:</P>
    <P>Dear Sir,</P>
    <P>We are extremely concerned with regard to the situation which has now arisen with Chipboard Products Ltd.</P>
    <P>We have supplied a considerable quantity of veneer which was done in good faith on our understanding that the Irish Government had a substantial majority stake in the company and as such, would have a credit viability.</P>
    <P>It would seem that our faith in your government's commercial integrity has been misplaced and perhaps you would be good enough to give us some explanation as how this situation has possibly occurred.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours faithfully,</P>
    <P Just="Right">Karl Danzer.</P>
    <P>I understand that a meeting of creditors of this company was held in Dublin this afternoon at which the foreign creditors said they dealt with State companies where the State had a majority of the shareholding in all the countries of Africa and all the banana republics of South America and never had a State company defaulted.  They were amazed to find that this was happening in respect of a State company in supposedly civilised western Europe.</P>
    <P>To put it in concrete terms as to what this means as a consequence of the Minister's action, at the meeting this afternoon a major oil company in this country which was a supplier to Chipboard Scarriff, stated that from now on they will not supply Irish State companies except on a cash and delivery basis.  This has enormous consequences for companies like Aer Lingus, CIE and many others.  It demonstrates the results of the kind of situation which has been brought about by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in a very vivid way.</P>
    <P>In the shareholders' agreement between the parties the Minister undertook to observe normal commercial practices and standards and, <i>inter alia,</i> to provide a guarantee for the bank.  He commissioned a technical report on the company but will not show it to the directors. <Col N="1455" /> That report and details of the company were hawked around to potential competitors further damaging the interests of minority shareholders.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was saying similar things last night the Minister did not open his mouth.  This and the completely unexpected sudden withdrawal of the guarantee by the majority shareholder are among several clear examples of what section 205 of the Companies Act, 1963, describes as oppression of the minority, and for which it provides a remedy which it is open to the minority shareholders to apply for and which I expect they will do shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actions of the Bank of Ireland in this matter are mystifying.  Although under the shareholders agreement, section 4.03, the business of the company should be controlled by the board and it alone, the Bank of Ireland have apparently accepted the direction of the majority shareholder to put in a receiver, although all seven directors refused to ask them to do so as it was both unnecessary and inappropriate.  The Bank of Ireland have done this act which has enormously and perhaps fatally damaged this company, although they are in no danger whatever of losing any money as the Government guarantee and their own charges and mortgages far exceed the amount they have advanced.  In fact the amount borrowed by the company is more than £80,000 less than the amount sanctioned by the Bank of Ireland.  They have refused to give the directors any reason for their action.  They have ignored the board, as has the Minister, and have acted in such a high-handed fashion that this House will have to give full consideration to whatever legislative <Col N="1456" /> changes are needed to prevent banks in this country acting in this fashion again.</P>
    <P>If the Bank of Ireland had required some specific and reasonable amount of money in the normal course of business, they could have requested it and the company could have paid it at short notice by coming to a discounting arrangement with some of their debtors who amount to £2.2 million.  Do the Bank of Ireland propose to impose similar treatment on their other corporate customers?  I ask this question because I am assured by an experienced accountant that 80 per cent of Irish companies would have receivers appointed to them within the next few weeks if the Minister's and the Bank of Ireland's criteria for Chipboard were applied generally.</P>
    <P>The Minister has consistently said, as did the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, that no embargo on expenditure was enforced by the State on this company. The untruth of these statement is proven by a letter dated 22 December 1982 from the Department of Forestry signed by M. A. Hackett stating that no capital expenditure was to be incurred without the consent of the Department. This letter was reiterated by an oral directive to the State directors to the same effect.</P>
    <P>Is it any surprise that a Minister who has acted in an illegal and commercially unethical fashion such as I have described last night and tonight would equally have no concern for the work force and for the area in which the factory is situated?  We are hearing only the start of this Scarriff saga.  This will disclose as many scandals as the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry has been involved in under his other hat as Minister for the Gaeltacht.</P>

      <P>This is a specific debate dealing with a specific problem, the closure of CPL in Scarriff.  The scope of the debate has widened considerably.  In the time at my disposal I had intended to deal with most of the questions raised but I now find that it would be physically impossible to do so.  I must, however, deal with the irresponsible statements made by Deputy O'Malley.  They are simply incredible.  A man of his standing should know better than to make such statements.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D'Arcy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must put the record straight and correct the mischievous and grossly untrue accusation that the new medite mill in Clonmel has contributed in any way to the closure of CPL.  This modern company is a market leader and this enterprise is a very welcome development here.  Long before CPL's agreements were drawn up an arrangement was made with the medite company regarding the supply of timber.  In no way has the setting up of this company affected the closure of CPL.</P>
      <P>Deputy Daly raised the effects of the closure on the State forests.  He stated that the closure would seriously affect the entire industry as far as waste disposal and thinnings were concerned.  The mill in Scarriff used approximately 10 per cent of the total thinnings from State forests and there is no problem in dealing with that 10 per cent by other means.  The Forestry Department can sell every ounce, the demand being so great.  I want to allay any fears in this regard.  We are meeting the timber council tomorrow in relation to waste but it seems that the mill in Scarriff used very little of the waste.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I turn now to the speech made by Deputy O'Malley.  Rather than questioning the rights of the Government to protect the Irish taxpayer, Deputy O'Malley would be better occupied in examining his own conscience in relation to his personal <Col N="1458" /> involvement in advising people to invest in the Scarriff project.  His advice was totally contrary to the recommendations of the IDA, an agency for which he was responsible, and the expert advice of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. Deputy O'Malley, then a senior Minister in Government, deliberately misled local investors regarding the prospects for the future of the chipboard factory in Scarriff.</P>

Following consultations and having looked closely at the figures, we find that restructuring of the factory would require approximately £3.5 million this year and a further £2.5 million next year.  That is approximately £6 million of taxpayers' money.  That every worker in CPL at present could get £8,000 a year for five years of taxpayers' money, produce nothing at Scarriff and save money for the taxpayer is what Deputy O'Malley is trying to prop up in this House, that every man working there could get £8,000 a year for five years on that borrowing.</P>

      <P>I want to deal now with the question of the debenture raised by <Col N="1462" /> Deputy O'Malley in the House.  The original bank loan guarantee provided by the State in 1981 in respect of bank borrowings of £400,000 was the subject of a debenture executed in May 1981 as part of the arrangement then concluded for the establishment of CPL.  The purpose of this was simply to protect any contingent liabilities for the taxpayer and was undertaken in accordance with the procedures envisaged by the State Guarantees Act of 1954.  Thereafter, when the company required further working capital it was agreed that an additional amount of £700,000 would be made available by the bank to CPL on foot of a guarantee trust debenture, as had been done in the initial financial package for CPL.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the process of effecting a guarantee under the State Guarantees Act of 1954 is, indeed, a very lengthy one.  In May 1983, the draft order facilitating the guarantee was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The order itself was made by the Government on 6 September 1983.  The company formally sought a guarantee on 13 September 1983 and was informed in writing on 23 September 1983, when the required guarantee had been issued, of the security by means of a debenture which would be required.  This was at the stage when negotiations with the foreign parties were under way and before CPL's own proposals had been fully finalised and analysed. It is, therefore, a gross misrepresentation to view this sequence of events as something sinister.  It was simply the working through of the procedures envisaged in the State Guarantees Act of 1954 and followed in the path of the initial guarantees of 1981.  So much for Deputy O'Malley's lengthy address to this House.</P>

      <P>I would like to question the Opposition who made the case in relation to the amount of money being put in by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry as compared with the moneys required to make Scarriff viable, as they claim.  As far as any money in relation to manufacturing development is concerned, the IDA are the State agents who always take up this type of grant.  The simple question must be <Col N="1464" /> asked: Why did not the IDA interest themselves in Scarriff in the initial stage of 1981?  Why had the Department of Fisheries and Forestry to be brought in to guarantee funds at that time?  Simply because the IDA, who were at that time under the control of Deputy O'Malley were unable to be persuaded by him, as his own State Agency, to carry out this restructuring.  They advised him, and rightly so, that this was a lame duck which could not be made viable under any circumstances.</P>

      <P>I would like to deal with the general developments of the forestry industry.  When we took up office here on 8 December of last year, the general development of the industry was in a very bad state.  The Minister and I have applied ourselves to three different areas of afforestation &mdash; acquisition, grading and the milling side.  On the acquisition side I am glad to say that we have a policy before the present Government and am hopeful that within the next month we can get approval for that policy.  Acquisition of land for afforestation is the basis of all afforestation.</P>
      <P>I was more than disappointed to find that the land pool was approximately 22,000 acres when we took office, which was completely inadequate.  There should be at least four to five years' land available for afforestation.  It is our intention to try to rectify that situation and I can assure the House that within the next month or two we intend to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Questions were raised by Deputy <Col N="1466" /> Daly, who was certainly more reasonable in his attitude, on the grading of timber. This is something which has been neglected down through the years.</P>

If the Deputy's party during their term of office had applied themselves to the development of afforestation here, there would be an ample supply of timber today.  Not alone would it be a help to Scarriff, but to the industry as a whole. That is what is important, instead of building sand castles&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The grading of timber is a very important aspect of afforestation. I have found that the industry in general has not graded its timber, even at the level of clear felling.  That, at least, should be the start of the grading.  It is our intention over the next two months, in particular, to attempt to have research done on the grading of timber at the clear felling stage in the forest on the one hand, and in the milling side on the other.  This is very important and should be taken up.</P>

      <P>We have had agreements on numerous occasions in this House as far as five minutes are concerned.  During the last debate here I gave Deputy Wilson five minutes to allow him to make his points in relation to an item of importance in his constituency.  We will see if the Opposition are big enough to do the same.  I would like to point out that in relation to Scarriff of Clare, during the past two years in particular, arrangements were made to supply the raw material free and also a subsidy of £7 per tonne was given to extract that timber.  A point was made last night that a favour was being done to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry by extracting this timber.  This is absolutely incorrect.  We have a demand for every ounce of timber in the forests.  If this arrangement was not worked out there was absolutely no problem in disposing of this timber standing <Col N="1469" /> and having it paid for.  I would like to make that point absolutely clear.</P>
      <P>The Government recognise that there is a definite market for chipboard products in the country, but in a modern world chipboard must be produced efficiently, economically and profitably in a mill capable of generating its own resources for further investment and keeping pace with ever-changing technology. The Government are committed to finding such outlets as quickly as possible. My earnest hope is that the efforts of the receiver, with the co-operation of the Department and my Department, should only be concerned with the supply of timber.  My Department should not be concerned with other items in relation to the development of this industry.  That is a job for the IDA and that is where the last Government fell down.  It is the IDA's role to work out the plans for development.  I hope this will result in a mill that we can all be proud of.  I would like to ask the Opposition to get away from the hypocrisy and pretence they operated as a Government and now they are operating as an Opposition.  I deplore the conduct of Deputy O'Malley in this debate.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have the opportunity to lend my voice to the motion before the House tonight but I regret that once again we have to come into the House and speak on a motion like this, because we have done so on many occasions during this Dáil session. It shows the callous, cold attitude of the Government particularly to industry and to the west.  Scarriff Chipboard Products Limited closed down with the loss of 200 jobs on 25 November 1983 and a further loss of 150 jobs in the forests of the local area.  In my constituency there is a loss of 30 jobs directly in relation to people from the Gort, Ballinakill, Woodford, Derry-brine and south Galway area in this factory and a further loss of 60 jobs in the south Galway forests, so we regret this closure.</P>
      <P>I have to take issue with the Minister of State who has just spoken because he has launched a personal attack on Deputy O'Malley.  It is obvious that the inefficient management of the country's affairs by the Government is being brushed aside by their Ministers and Ministers of State on to third parties.  They must realise they are now in Government and have a duty to give leadership.  There is no point in blaming people who held office, who have a proven record in office and who will have a proven record in office, long after the Coalition Government have gone out of office, in relation to what has happened in Scarriff.</P>

I was a member of that deputation, and after some persistence by members of that deputation that a meeting be held between the receiver and officials from his Department the Minister <Col N="1471" /> conceded.  He informed the meeting he had received a request for a meeting with the receiver.</P>
    <P>As far as I am concerned the interests of the two main parties who had financial investment, the Government who had a 64 per cent investment in the company and the Bank of Ireland who supplied some of the capital to the company, were being protected by the meeting of those people.  A decision was taken in the aftermath of this meeting by the Minister and the Government to close down the company without due consultation with the board of directors, the chairman of the company, who was out of the country, and the people in the area who made an investment of £250,000 to ensure that this factory was set up.  That was a very cold, callous decision without due consultation with all parties involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>That is totally inaccurate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not inaccurate. Those are the facts.  I also want to refer to other statements made by the Minister. He said that an agreement was made for a three year period from May 1981 with the company and the Department of Forestry.  It is obvious that an agreement was made for a three year period and he as Minister had a duty to ensure that at least the three year period would terminate before any decision was made about this company.  That three year period will not terminate until May 1984.  With almost six months still to run the Minister and the Government made a decision to close down this company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effects of the closure of this company will be disastrous for the whole economy and for the whole western region and will ultimately lead to the loss of in the region of 700 jobs in our timber industry at a cost of approximately £50 million to the economy.  The cost of job losses to the State through unemployment benefits and the payment of PRSI will be in the region of £3 million per annum and yet the Minister has complained about making an investment of £3.3 million available to keep this company <Col N="1472" /> viable.  With regard to viable, every motion put down by Fianna Fáil in this session about any company has had an amendment for the Government about viability.</P>
    <P>One way to make the company viable is for the Government to invest in it.  The Government have a 64 per cent stake in the company and it is only fitting that they should do everything possible to protect the country's last chipboard factory. The Government should invest the necessary finance to ensure the company remains solvent for the good of the Irish economy.  Major efforts have been made by the IDA, the county development team and the Department of Industry and Energy in the last two years to attract new industry here, particularly to the west, but they failed mainly because of the industrial recession here and throughout the world.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State is passing the buck again.  The Government have added to the numbers out of work by closing another semi-State concern. There is a skilled workforce available in Scarriff and many of them have more than 20 years technical experience in the timber industry.  As a small nation can we afford to forget about such skilled people who live in Scarriff and the Clare-south Galway area?  The Scarriff company have been trading for two years and, like all new concerns, have had their teething problems.  In the midst of a recession and facing fierce foreign competition it was not surprising that the company would have losses, but in the latter half of 1983 they were making a marked improvement.  That improvement came about because of good and astute management aided by a loyal workforce.  There was increased productivity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a major saving in overheads and an effort by the workforce to preserve the factory by accepting minimal wage increases of the order of 3 per cent.  Those people are here for the debate tonight and we should acknowledge that contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government failed to negotiate a comparable wage increase in any other sector of the economy.  The acceptance of that increase is an indication of the commitment of that workforce to the Scarriff factory.  They are committed to their county and are being victimised as a result.</P>
      <P>Closures like Scarriff will damage local and national confidence.  The people of that town and surrounding areas invested £250,000 in the company, and it is not hard to realise their feelings when the Government pulled the plug.  What other concern will invest in an Irish company after this heartless decision?  How can we invite our people to invest in Irish industries? What economic progress can we hope to make if we turn our own people down?  I have no doubt that the closure of the Scarriff factory will result in huge job losses in other ancillary timber industries. Many jobs in our forests will be lost.  We must remember that many of the people concerned are young married men with big house mortgages.  Some of them are small farmers who, due to the type of land they own, cannot make a living from the land.  They will suffer as a result of the closure of the Scarriff factory.  There is only one alternative for those people, the dole queue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The only logical thing to do is to keep the factory going rather than paying the workforce social welfare benefits.  The road haulage business will suffer also and there will be less work for drivers and helpers.  The saw-mills, the main suppliers of the waste to Scarriff, will suffer also.  The sale of waste to the Scarriff factory has helped keep down the overheads of many sawmills.  I have no doubt that many sawmills will have to close. <Col N="1474" /> Have the Government considered the loss to local unsecured creditors, the shopkeepers, merchants and traders who supplied goods in good faith to a company in which the Government had a 64 per cent stake?  Who will look after those people?  What will happen if the Bank of Ireland decides to move in again?  They will not be able to apply to have a receiver appointed and, consequently, will close it down because of lack of finance.  The action of the Government was disgraceful, and it is an indication of their attitude to small concerns, particularly in the west.</P>
    <P>Failures like Scarriff damage foreign investment confidence in Ireland.  We heard last night that Spanish and German companies were interested in Scarriff.</P>

      <P>If the Government were prepared to give the necessary guarantees the Scarriff factory would be in operation today.  The Bank of Ireland would not have any need to worry if the Government were prepared to give the necessary guarantees.  The Scarriff factory experienced great difficulty in getting timber from our forests.  The Department <Col N="1475" /> notified the factory of five forests in the area where timber was available, but representatives of the company discovered that there were no roads or bridges through those forests to enable them to extract the timber.</P>
      <P>In more difficult times a lot of money was invested in our afforestation programme, and there must be something wrong if our own renewable resources which are maturing rapidly are not utilised to the maximum at home.  Clondalkin Pulp and Munster Chipboard closed down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

What confidence can we expect those people who invested their money in that factory to have in the future of the country? There has been a major turnabout in the progress of this company in the last five months due to the efforts of staff and management.  At a time when progress was being made, when the company clearly was showing profits of £1,000 per day over the last two months, it was ludicrous to terminate business and put in a receiver.</P>

Indeed several Irish companies are in a worse trading position and survive but they will not survive if present Government policy prevails much longer.

      <P>In County Galway I know there are approximately 75,000 acres of timber, with 11,190 acres of land on reserve.  I know also that in County Mayo there are approximately 55,000 acres; in County Clare approximately 41,000 acres; in County Roscommon approximately 17,000 acres; in County Offaly approximately 9,500 acres; in County Tipperary approximately 62,000; in Limerick approximately 20,000 and in Kerry approximately 38,000 acres of timber. Surely, with that amount of timber available, it is ludicrous to close down this factory?</P>
      <P>If a realistic financial package was prepared, if the company were given time to restructure themselves, there is no reason they could not survive.  The Minister spoke about the technical agency, Zurich, who assessed the Scarriff company. Would he tell us the background to this company and their present position? Would he also tell us if this company were in competition with Scarriff on similar markets?  Perhaps it suited that company to recommend the closure of Scarriff.</P>

      <P>I am delighted the Opposition have seen the folly of their ways and have decided to allow us time to speak on this very important issue here this evening.  I consider the approach adopted by the Opposition extremely irresponsible.  I did not come here this evening to hear from any Opposition Deputy a lecture on the 1963 Companies Act.  I came here this evening to speak for the people of Scarriff, to ensure that Scarriff will have a chipboard industry in the future and that the work force who were operative a few weeks ago will be back at work in Scarriff in the near future. That is what all of us Deputies for the constituency of Clare have a responsibility to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was amazed at the attitude adopted by Deputy O'Malley.  He used the words &ldquo;phoney&rdquo; and &ldquo;irresponsible&rdquo;. I would suggest to him that the phoney and irresponsible acts were taken early in 1981 when the take-over agreement was drafted.  When that agreement was being drafted the accounts clearly showed that the Scarriff factory would not be in a position to avail of the 40 per cent capital grant they should have taken up and which would have amounted to £500,000. It was evident that the Scarriff plant would not be able to avail of that grant because they did not have the money. Therefore, it was unfair of the Opposition <Col N="1481" /> to suggest to the people in Scarriff that they were giving them something when in fact they were giving them something they could not avail of.  The Opposition were only hood-winking the people of Scarriff.  A proper injection of money should have been put into Scarriff then to ensure that it would be made viable. Fianna Fáil did not do that.</P>
    <P>We had the assurance of the Minister that the agreement with Medite does not affect Scarriff.  I can assure the House that that agreement affects Scarriff.  The agreement was drafted to ensure that Medite in Clonmel would get timber within a 50-mile radius of Clonmel, but now timber is being taken from Broadford in Clare, from around the Scarriff area right down to Clonmel.  That has happened because of an agreement entered into by the Opposition when in Government in 1981.  As a result, Scarriff has suffered.  If the company in Scarriff had not to travel for their timber to south-west Kerry and north-west Mayo they would be in a far healthier financial position.  The Opposition must accept responsibility for that.  I suggest to the Minister and the Department that they immediately enter into negotiations with Medite to reconsider the radius and to operate on a block release basis which would put all timber firms into a proper competitive position.</P>
    <P>There are many reasons for the continuation of the Scarriff industry.  I believe it will be continued because north-east Clare has no other industry and it would be disastrous for the area if this industry was not continued.  I have an assurance from the Minister and the Minister of State that any parties interested in taking over CPL or showing any interest in developing chipboard will be directed to Scarriff.  The people of Scarriff deserve every assistance.  We have got a talented, skilled work force in Scarriff who have worked in the chipboard industry for the past 25 years.  We have the raw material there.  If the raw material in the area is used in the area and not transferred to Clonmel as at present the Scarriff plant can be made viable.  The forests in Clare are of such a structure that the thinnings are becoming available more and more. <Col N="1482" /> We have a market here for chipboard instead of importing it.  Scarriff had about 40 per cent of the market.  That market could be developed and increased substantially.</P>
    <P>That industry was traditional in Scarriff and I hope the tradition will be continued. I have no doubt that the Government, particularly the Ministers for Forestry and Industry and Energy, will do everything possible to ensure that the factory will be reopened.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot of talk from the Opposition about their various decisions to do several things.  They never paid anything to CPL in Scarriff.  Payments to Scarriff were first made by the former Minister, now the Ceann Comhairle.  In May of last year the present Minister for Forestry stressed those facts.  This situation should not be distorted.  We all have a responsibility to present the case fairly and not to be making a political ploy out of it.</P>

      <P>I have a particular interest in the timber processing industry and I am glad to be able to speak on the motion.  Scarriff had the last chipboard plant in the country.  It has been closed down at a time when a very rapidly increasing volume of timber is becoming available from our forests.  In 1979 we had 696,000 cubic metres of timber coming from our forests.  It is hoped that in 1987 that will have doubled and that by the year 2000 it will have increased by five times to 3 million cubic metres.  With that volume of timber coming on stream it is vital that plants such as that in Scarriff should be maintained in production. Otherwise we will be left with nothing but Medite, a multinational company <Col N="1483" /> with a monopoly of the supply of timber from our forests.  That would be a national disgrace and highly dangerous to the national interest.</P>
      <P>We have had experience of many multinational companies leaving us high and dry when we needed them most.  Therefore, the questions being asked about Medite are relevant.  We must ask whether they put a gun to the head of the Government, because in some way they negotiated an agreement which nobody else got from the Department of Forestry. A contract like that had not been negotiated with an Irish Government in 60 years.  Small sawmills or big processors were unable to get such contracts from any Government.  This contract pushed Scarriff to the limits, away up to Mayo, for instance, for supplies of timber.  That obviously was the result of Medite's presence.</P>
      <P>We must ask the IDA how much taxpayers' money was supplied to Medite for a matter of approximately 60 jobs at a time when Scarriff were left short of funds and timber with consequent loss of 250 jobs.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State hit the nub of the matter when he said it is the responsibility of the Minister to supply timber but he had no responsibility for finance which is a responsibility of the IDA and the receiver.  However, when speaking yesterday the Minister said he could not go on looking for £6 million or £8 million for Scarriff.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that the nub of the question is the supply of timber.  It was the nub of the matter in regard to Medite. That is why Home Grown Timber closed down in Fermoy a couple of months ago with the loss of 80 or 90 jobs &mdash; they did not get the timber they wanted.  This will be the main issue in regard to Scarriff.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are aware of the efforts to keep Scarriff open.  This must be on the basis of negotiations between the management, the banks, the receiver and the IDA.  I hope the Minister will enter these negotiations and guarantee that if a package is arrived at the Department will supply the required amount of timber, in the region of 120,000 cubic <Col N="1484" /> metres.  The Department must give a guaranteed contract of supply.  I am quite sure the management will be able to prove their viability to both the receiver and the IDA on that one condition, that they will be supplied with the right amount of timber.  Surely that is the only responsibility of the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>As the second Fine Gael Deputy from the constituency of Clare I am very disappointed that the Opposition Party chose to put down this motion at this time.  I appreciate that it is the job of the Opposition to take advantage of all the apparent weaknesses of the Government, but in this case political advantage is being sought by trying to embarrass the Government, the receiver and the banks so that Fianna Fáil will reap the benefit at some future date.</P>
      <P>At one time I belonged to a company which lost 300 jobs.  The most traumatic time for workers is when they are made redundant.  The Opposition side do not seem to have any solution to the present problem except for whinging and crying and telling the Minister what he should and should not do.  When I first met the directors of Scarriff &mdash; and they were appointed by the previous Government &mdash; they told me the company was insolvent and that the agreement drawn up in March 1981 was of such a drip-feed nature that it could not work.  Evidence of that is seen in the transactions of that company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley was boasting that he saved Chipboard in March 1981 and that he was glad to agree with the agreement brought in by the then Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  He was also glad to agree to appoint two directors, although <Col N="1485" /> he was Minister for Industry and Commerce and Deputy Power was Minister for Fisheries and Forestry.  Deputy Power claimed, at column 462, of the debate on the State Guarantees Act, 1954, that he was responsible for appointing two directors and Deputy O'Malley appointed two others.  The Deputy came in here and created a smoke screen but did not have any suggestions for saving the jobs in Scarriff, which is what every one has tried to do.  Even Deputy Daly understands the difficulty.  He knew from the beginning that the company were in difficulties. It was not until high noon that the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, gave four minutes to the chairman of the company to discuss the future of Scarriff.</P>
    <P>Prior to the election Deputy Haughey guranteed that he would see Scarriff secure.  However, the then Minister, Deputy Daly, wrote in a letter on 14 December that they had only put aside a certain amount of money, they did not provide enough money to save the company. The directors came to this Government to see what solutions they had.  I was shocked when I heard the Government had decided not to continue helping this company because I knew the workers had made a very good effort, they had increased productivity and the new management had made a very definite effort.</P>
    <P>I do not like this rancour, this hatred, which is being built up over this case. Some of the things that have been said about the 50 people who invested in the company were deplorable, and all that was said for political ends.  In my view Deputy Barrett and Deputy Daly, Deputy Taylor-Quinn and I could manage this job and provide work in Scarriff if we were left to ourselves instead of Deputy O'Malley&mdash;&mdash;</P>

        <i>(Clare):</i> The most noticeable thing about this Government amendment is that it says there will be the development of a chipboard industry but it does not say where.  The word &ldquo;Scarriff&rdquo; is not mentioned, despite what Deputy Taylor-Quinn said this evening. Why is Scarriff not mentioned in the Government amendment?  The reasons for shutting down this factory have not been explained.  The reason put forward was that the Government were saving taxpayers' money.  The amount of money sought was £3.5 million, not £6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government now are talking about saving taxpayers' money and Government responsibility, but 12 or 18 <Col N="1487" /> months ago I put a Bill through this House for £25 million for Irish Steel Limited, who employ approximately 600 people, to pay their current debats for one year.  We got complete agreement from the Opposition for that sum.  It could not be said that that industry was viable, nor was Scarriff viable up to six months ago, but there was not a murmur from the then Opposition.  Suddenly the cost of a dust burner, £3.5 million, has become a matter of conscience for the Government of the day.  Let nobody be under any illusions: the Minister and his Government closed down Scarriff.  I repeat that: the Government closed down Scarriff. There is no point in trying to hoodwink the people or mislead them, which was the word used by the Minister of State, into believing that the Bank of Ireland are responsible because they are not.</P>

What can they now expect from the Minister and his Government when he pulled the plug? He pulled the guarantee from under them.  Having closed the factory the Minister now tries to blame Deputy O'Malley &mdash; I was also involved &mdash; for opening the factory and providing 350 jobs nearly three years ago in Scarriff.

      <P>Deputy Tunney has sought and has been granted permission to raise on the Adjournment the <Col N="1496" /> reasons a lady imprisoned in Mountjoy was not allowed to speak to a visitor in the Irish language.  He has nine minutes and the Minister has four.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an Irish proverb which says: Dá fhad an lá, tagann an óiche.  It is applicable to the circumstances which obtain in the matter of having a question raised on the Adjournment.  I suppose it is also applicable in respect of any person so unfortunate as to have to spend some time in prison.  In the minutes available to me, I hope to get the Chair's understanding and the Minister's sympathy in respect of a situation which existed in Mountjoy Prison after a lady, a Mrs. Cáit Coyne, had been sent there because she had refused to pay a television licence based on the objection that RTE at the moment do not satisfy the requirements of the Act or, indeed, the normal requirements of any native Irish speaker in the matter of programmes in the Irish language, programmes relating to Irish life generally.  This lady, who has never come under notice up to that point for even the most minor misdemeanour, having, in pursuit of that principle, refused to pay the licence fee, was consigned to Mountjoy Prison &mdash; a prison which we understand is very overtaxed and cannot accommodate people who have been convicted of very serious crimes.</P>
      <P>I do not have to remind the House that our Constitution regards the Irish language as the first language and the English language as being second.  I do not have to remind the House that all political parties &mdash; Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour and the Workers' Party &mdash; have, as an objective, the restoration of the Irish language, indeed for very good reasons.  We all know, too, that in deference to that policy there are certain areas in the country where Irish is the spoken language and because of that and the contribution which they are making to the preservation and restoration of the language they are accredited certain preferential treatment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This lady was born in the Gaeltacht. From the time that she married into a <Col N="1497" /> family carrying that illustrious name of Coyne &mdash; she is the sister-in-law of the late Mairtin Coyne, the greatest Irish writer of all time &mdash; she has continued to speak Irish.  After she was sent to Mountjoy Prison, I went up to see her with a friend of mine and I must say that in respect of the welcome which I got I would have no objection.  I was greeted there by the Deputy Governor, who spoke to me in the Irish language.  I met subsequently a wardress who spoke to me in the Irish language and I was allowed have with Mrs. Coyne a conversation lasting a quarter of an hour or so. That was on the Monday night.  On the Wednesday, Mrs. Coyne was visited by a relation of hers, again a man who carries that proud name.  When her visitor had arrived, the wardress who notified her of his arrival, while bringing her to meet him, said that she was sorry but that she had to remind her that she would not be allowed to speak to her visitor in the Irish language.  That is not hearsay, it is fact.  I believe absolutely what Mrs. Coyne has told me.  She is not a lady who, in my acquaintance with her, has ever told a lie.  She would not tell a lie.  She now finds herself in a position where in deference to her pursuit of the implementation of the policy that every political party here claims to honour and in deference to the requirement of the Constitution, and in deference to what appears in the Standing Orders of this House she is obliged to change into what is regarded as the second language and has been told she may not converse with her visitor in the Irish language.</P>
    <P>I do not know the reason why this was done.  I could, in helping the Minister towards justification of it, say that in the times we live in, maybe there are occasion when it is felt that a prisoner and a visitor might use language to circumvent the prison regulations.  It would have been known to the prison authorities and the Department of Justice that there would not be any such fears regarding this lady.  One would have expected that, bearing in mind the work force that are there, it would have been possible to find a warder or wardress who would be able to sit in on whatever conversation was <Col N="1498" /> taking place and know what was said from his or her knowledge of the Irish language.  If it is not it should be a requirement of people entering that service that they have a knowledge of it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to say that this was a plot and somebody did that to thwart Mrs. Coyne but one could, on the evidence, ask if it was not.  I am disturbed that in the minds of the public, in the mind of that lady and all of the people on whom we rely to promote this great treasure we have which, in times of depression and difficulty, is a jewel, which does not get its full recognition, the institutions should make so little of themselves as to say to any Irish citizen, in times when we are so concerned about the fundamental rights of other people who have murdered and killed, to remain silent and not say anything about it, in times when there are rights of this, that and the other in relation to people who break the law in every unwelcome fashion, that she cannot converse in the Irish language.  The only thing this lady was guilty of was that in the opinion of a certain judge she should be sent to Mountjoy for a specified period because she believed RTE programmes do not do what is required of them under the Act.  That is the only fault anybody could attribute to this lady.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister or the prison authorities will send an apology to this lady for what happened.  We should make sure that such a thing will not happen in this or any other institution ever again. We had a great ceremony last Saturday for the inauguration of the President. While we could say that the example we give is not the best, many of us claim to treasure out great language, which is the only key we have to our forebears.  This language contains all the accumulated wisdom on an ethnic group that is Irish, as no other language does for us.  Why should we so belittle it that we would say to two people, whose native language it is &mdash; I am not saying the acquired language in the way some have it &mdash; that they may not speak that language.  That to me is a sign of things that have happened in this country which not alone saddens but frightens me about what our future will be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> Ar an gcéad dul síos, ní mór dom a rá go gcreidim gur chlaoi na hoifigigh phríosúin a bhí i láthair ar an ocáid i gceist lena ndualgais mar a cheapadar iad a bheith.  Creidim leis, áfach, gur ró-chúng i dtuiscint des na rialacha cuí agus gurbh fhearra dóibh gan chur isteach ar an gcomhrá a bhí ar siúl idir Bhean Uí Chadhain agus a nia, fiú má bhí an t-oifigeach a bhí i bhfeidhil na cuairte ar bheagán Gaeilge.  Tá mé ag féachaint chuige go n-eiseófar treoir speisialta ina míneófar nach bhfuil sé de dhualgas ar oifigeach deireadh a chur le comhrá, fiú más do-thuighte dó é, nuair nach bhfuil aon chontúirt ann do shabháltacht an phríosúin nó dá dhea-threoir.</P>
      <P>Tá ráfla amuigh nach bhfuil polasaí ag mo Roinn-se maidir le húsáid na Gaeilge le linn chuairteanna sna príosúin.  Ní fíor san.  Tá sé leagtha síos sna rialacha nach mór féachaint chuige, sa mhéid is féidir é, go mbeidh oifigeach le Gaeilge i láthair ar ocáid chuairte nuair is i nGaeilge atá an comhrá idir an príosúnach agus an cuairteoir.  Agus bhí socrú dá réir déanta an lá roimh-ré nuair a bhí cuairteoir eile ag Bean Uí Chadhain.  Tá fáilte roimh aon phríosúnach labhairt i nGaeilge lena chuairteoirí agus deintear gach is féidir chun oifigeach le Gaeilge a roghnú chun freastal orthu.  Ach ní féidir bheith deimhin de go mbeidh a leithéid d'oifigeach ar fáil i gcónaí agus nuair a thagann sabháltacht i gceist ní foláir géilleadh do shochruithe eile.  Ach ní raibh cúrsaí shlándála ná sábháltachta i gceist ar an ócáid seo.</P>

Cuairt amháin a bhí ag dul chuici d'réir na rialacha.  Chuala mé an Teachta ag rá go raibh sé féin ann le cuairt freisin.  Is dóigh liom gurb é sin an tríú cuairt a bhí aici.  Mar fhocal scoir: Cé nach n-aontaím le daoine nach nglacann le horduithe na gCuirteanna agus a thógann príosúntacht orthu féin mar chomhartha bollscaireachta, creidim gurbh fhearr ar an ocáid seo dá ligfí don chúairt dul ar aghaidh agus an scéal mar a bhí, agus, mar a dúirt mé cheana, tá socrú á dhéanamh agam chun a tharla ar an ocáid seo a sheachaint san todhchaí. Ag deireadh ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis na Teachta gur thug sé an deis seo dom chun é seo a mhíniú don Teach.</P>

      <P>The unions/associations representing postal and non-technical telecommunications staffs throughout the country accepted the terms of the 1983 public service pay agreement in November 1983.  The agreement provides for phased pay increases of 4.75 per cent from 1 September 1983 and 3.25 per cent from 1 February 1984.  The increases and arrears arising under the first phase will, it is expected, be paid to all the staff concerned, including those in Drogheda, within the next fortnight.  Negotiations on a general pay increase for staff in the technical grades of the telecommunications service are still in progress at the Departmental Council of the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme.</P>
      <P>The previous agreement, which covered all groups mentioned, provided for general pay increases of 2 per cent (or £4.00 per week, whichever was the greater) from 1 December 1981, 6 per cent from 1 March 1982 and 5 per cent from 1 January 1983 and was fully implemented.</P>
      <P>Agreement was reached in July 1982 for a special pay increase for technical grades in the telecommunications service of the order of 2 per cent from 1 January 1982 which was duly paid and for a further increase of the order of 11 per cent which became payable in accordance with the terms of the 1981 public service pay agreement as amended &mdash; viz. 40 per cent of the increase from 1 October 1983 and the remainder at a later date or dates to be granted.  The 1 October 1983 increase was duly paid and the question of the payment of the outstanding balance is under discussion at the Departmental Council of the Civil Service Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme in the context of the claim for a general increase in pay for technical grades.</P>

      <P>Telephone subscribers are asked to pay their telephone account within three weeks of receipt of the account.  If payment is not received before the due date, a final notice is issued giving due warning that if the Bill is not paid within a further seven days, service will be disconnected.</P>
      <P>I am advised that there is no case on record in my Department in which service was disconnected for non-payment of the account within the periods mentioned.</P>
      <P>In cases in which payment has not been received within these periods, arrangements to have service disconnected are put in train.  It is not always practicable to cancel these where a late payment is made because of the large volume of cases involved but instructions to disconnect are checked against a computer print-out of payments received and against payments on hands which have not yet been fed into the computer to avoid disconnection where practicable in such cases.</P>

      <P>Difficulties in contacting Rosslare Harbour including the lifeboat secretary on 7 September 1983 were due to intermittent failure of Waterford-Wexford trunk route over which Wexford-Shannon traffic is routed.</P>
      <P>When the difficulty arose, technical staff were called out at Waterford and Wexford, and operators at Waterford checked with the Garda at Wexford and were able to put through all calls requested of them during the day.  They also continued to check emergency numbers in Wexford and Rosslare in case they had difficulty getting Waterford.</P>
      <P>Service in the south-east has been improved following the bringing into service of a new digital exchange in Wexford last October.  Further improvements should follow the provision of a digital trunk exchange at Waterford in the first quarter of 1984.</P>
      <P>Regular maintenance of the existing link is undertaken to ensure the best possible standard of service.</P>

While I am sympathetic to the difficulties being experienced by particular manufacturers, such as the company mentioned, any easing of their VAT position can only be considered in the context of a general review of VAT rates in the course of budget preparations.  It must be appreciated, however, that the same rate of VAT must apply to imported and home-produced goods of the same kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">

      <P>It is estimated that there are 880,000 persons effectively liable to income tax under PAYE for the current tax year.  In about 120,000 of these cases couples have opted to have the income of both spouses assessed on the husband, giving a total of 760,000 taxpaying units.</P>
      <P>The number of tax-free allowance certificates, including amended certificates, issued to employees for the current tax year was 1,779,997 as at 25 November 1983.  It is to be borne in mind that separate tax-free allowance certificates are issued to husbands and wives in employment. In addition, separate certificates are issued in respect of each employment so that some employees may receive two or three certificates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The overall cost of the administration of Inland Revenue duties is estimated at £52 million for 1982 or 1.9 per cent of the net receipt.  It is not possible to state with any reasonable degree of accuracy the cost of individual procedures within that <Col N="1376" /> administration.  As regards the issue of tax-free allowance certificates it is possible to give a figure relating to the cost of computer processing, paper, postage and associated heating and lighting costs in so far as these costs are separately quantified as arising from the issue of tax-free allowance certificates.  On this basis, the average cost would be less than 50p per certificate but this figure does not include the cost of work carried out in tax offices in relation to the certificates.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following is the information requested in so far as it is available:</P>
      <P>(a)  Tax-based lending is estimated to have cost £155 million in corporation tax foregone in 1982.  The cost of the relief was inflated in that year by the effects of bringing forward the due dates for payment of corporation tax. Effectively, this meant that the companies responsible for the bulk of the tax-based lending were required to pay two years tax in 1982.  In the absence of the changes in the due dates the cost of the relief would have been in the region of £70 million.  This figure includes the cost of tax relief on leased plant and machinery, &ldquo;section 84&rdquo; loans and preference share financing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  The latest available data on export sales relief is in respect of relief allowed in the period 1 February 1982 <Col N="1377" /> to 31 January 1983 which resulted in an estimated £96 million in tax foregone.</P>
    <P>(c)  The cost of accelerated capital allowances is by reference to the income tax year 1982-83.  For this period, the cost is estimated at £97 million.  This figure includes a cost of £40 million for accelerated capital allowances which is also part of the £70 million figure shown at (a) above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>When this matter was last raised by way of Dáil question on 28 April 1983, the Deputy was informed that the level of fishing on the island could justify no more than a fraction of what harbour works at Inisturk would cost.  At that time it was estimated that harbour works would cost £225,000.  The up-to-date estimate of cost by the Office of Public Works is £242,000.</P>
      <P>Since the level of fishing alone is not sufficient to justify expenditure of this order the issue of harbour works must be considered in the light of the overall transport needs of the islanders, transport policy generally and the availability of public funds.</P>
      <P>The Central Development Committee, a body located in my Department with overall responsibility for the affairs of inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands, has been asked to consider whether expenditure on the harbour at Inisturk would be justified.  It must be said, however, that the present state of the public finances will not allow funds to be made available for work at Inisturk in the immediate future.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed maternity benefit on 18 June 1983.  She was entitled to payment under the general scheme for the 12 week period 23 May 1983 to 13 August 1983. She had, however, been paid disability benefit up to 20 June 1983 and, as maternity and disability benefits are not payable concurrently, she was only due full weekly payment from 21 June 1983 onwards together with an adjustment for the overlap period.  All benefit due on her claim has been issued and a detailed statement of the individual payments is being sent to her.</P>
