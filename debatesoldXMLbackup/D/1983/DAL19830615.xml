      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to make a personal explanation to the House in relation to information which I supplied yesterday and which I have since discovered was in one respect incorrect.  On the basis of information supplied by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who was speaking from his recollection of events that occurred about six months ago, I told the House that changes had been made in one, not two, medical certificates.  In fact a change was made at the top of two medical certificates in respect of the same case which were attached together with other papers relating to that case.  I regret this inaccuracy of detail in respect of this matter.  The Minister's statement with respect to the circumstances in which this event occurred is otherwise unaffected.</P>

      <P>Would the Taoiseach make time available to discuss the very serious implications of the matter on which he has made a personal statement this morning?  They relate to a reply by the Taoiseach yesterday which he hinged on the basis that there was only one medical certificate that was tampered with.  In fact a second medical certificate was falsified <i>in toto</i>, as the Taoiseach is aware.</P>

      <P>I will not have a <i>post mortem</i> on what happened yesterday. The Chair's recollection is that Deputy Lenihan asked that the matter be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions for action.  This morning Deputy Lenihan has specifically stated that the Minister is guilty of a criminal offence and the Chair simply cannot allow that.</P>

      <P>First of all, Deputy Lenihan abused the tolerance of the Chair when the Chair allowed him to ask a question.  The Chair specifically heard Deputy Lenihan accuse the Minister of being guilty of a criminal offence. The Chair must have that withdrawn. Otherwise I will have to take action.</P>

At that stage there was <Col N="1515" /> a debate on the Bill.  For the sake of the 30,000 employees in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs I thought the Minister might give a rough outline of his philosophy aand give us a theme to work to for the next few days.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the standard practice in Bills to indicate their Long and Short Titles.  Essentially this is a drafting matter.  The Titles are determined by the content of the Bill.  A Short Title such as that in section 1 of this Bill is the one more commonly used in references to the Bill.  The Long Title which is contained <Col N="1516" /> in the preamble to the Bill indicates the broad scope of the Bill's provisions.  It is unamended and there is no proposal to amend it, as was originally proposed on Second Stage by the previous Government. Any changes to be made in the Bill will come up in the amendments and are mainly, but not exclusively, intended to meet points raised by trade unions and representatives of the employees of the Post Office.  We tried to meet them as much as we could because we realise they have a major stake in this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very pleased to see this Bill before the House.  I welcome its reintroduction on Committee Stage on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I will be supporting its speedy passage through the House within the next two days.  The Short Title is the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1982.  In the tradition of this party I will continue to be consistent.  In that spirit I am supporting this Bill as amended and I will be speaking on the amendments as we reach them.  I have tabled some amendments and I would appreciate it if the Clerk of the House could circulate to Deputies a copy of the full list of amendments which I have not got as yet.  My amendments have been circulated and I would appreciate it if Members of the House could be given a copy for their assistance.</P>
      <P>We are transferring 30,000 people from the State to the semi-State side of Government.  This will have a major impact on their future.  Every effort must be made to protect the future of all those people and their families.  I am very much aware of the strong representations which were made to me by all the unions involved in supporting and representing the 30,000 members of the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>

I am not sure what the approach of The Workers' Party is.  The Committee Stage of the Bill is going through the House in two days. Deputy Leyden said he supports its speedy passage through the House.  This Bill would have been best dealt with in a separate committee of the House which could give it a long, detailed and thorough examination.  The Bill implements the White Paper <i>Reorganisation of Postal and Telecommunications Services.</i></P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), to delete lines 23 and 24, and substitute the following definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;board&rsquo; means An Bord Poist or An Bord Telecom established by this Act, as the case may require;&rdquo; .bqe</P>
      <P>I would like to indicate that our approach to this Bill has two main objectives, to provide for a comprehensive and efficient national postal and telecommunications service and to ensure that the employees under the present structure in the Post Office retain their present conditions of employment relating to pay, pensions, security of employment, promotion and so forth.  The biggest danger we see in the proposals is loss of security of employment to employees.  This is the reason we proposed this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other danger we see in this is the possibility that unless the Bill provides safeguards in either the short term or the long term the Post Office or sections of it will be handed over to private enterprise and it will end up in a position similar to that of CIE where most of their <Col N="1520" /> profitable areas, where they could develop, are taken over by private enterprise. We seek to substitute in the amendment a statutory corporation for that of a company structure.  It would provide more protection for employees and it would make it more difficult for the Post Office under the new structure to hand over its functions to private enterprise.</P>
    <P>When a company are incorporated by registration for the purposes of State enterprise or, alternatively, when a State enterprise company are registered under the Act such a registered company will differ from private enterprise companies in two important ways.  The relevant Minister has the ultimate sanction of removing the board and the memorandum and articles of association cannot be altered without the approval of the Minister.  The danger to which I referred of the Post Office being handed over to a private company is referred to in passing by the report of the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group, 1978-79, where it says that a company rather than a corporation approach is possible should the body be constituted as a public company to permit private equity participation.  A statutory corporation derives its powers directly from the parent company establishing it whereas the registered company looks to the memorandum and articles of association. It may well be argued that the company type organisation is more flexible because it may be less awkward to amend the memorandum and articles of association than to put an amendment Bill through the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>In the case of a State enterprise taking the form of a registered company the normal procedure would be that the company would have to obtain the permission of the relevant Minister to alter their memorandum or articles.  Once the permission was obtained they could then be so altered.  In the case of a statutory corporation there is the requirement of amending legislation.  I believe the balance lies in favour of the corporation because I feel the security of the employees of the Post Office and the necessity to ensure that the Post Office services are not fragmented and hived off to private enterprise is more important than the <Col N="1521" /> possible flexibility that could be acquired under the company system.</P>
    <P>The essential legal difference is that the State company would derive its authority from a memorandum and articles which would probably be altered only with the consent of the relevant Minister whereas the State corporation would derive its authority from the Oireachtas. I feel the weight of argument must be in favour of providing security of employment for the staff.  For that reason, I urge that the Minister accept this amendment. It is of interest to note the position in the UK where the British Post Office is a State enterprise in the form of a public corporation.  It has managed very effectively to develop the services there and to finance its development through its own self-generated funds.  Despite the fact that at the moment the British Government are proposing to sell off sections of this Post Office service I feel the better protection for staff and for the Post Office is in the form of a corporation rather than a company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make the Labour Party position clear on this Bill and the amendments now put before the House by The Workers' Party.  In order to put it into perspective it is necessary to go back to Second Stage and to determine how we got on to Committee Stage.  Fianna Fáil and The Workers' Party voted for the passage of the Bill on Second Stage.  That is why I was amazed when I heard Deputy Leyden today ask about the philosophy of the Bill.  There is a difference in detail but the basic philosophy is no different from what went through the House on Second Stage, voted through by Fianna Fáil and supported by The Workers' Party.  While I welcome the support of Deputy De Rossa at this stage I feel it is a little late in the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Workers' Party are expressing the fears of members of the staff but there is little we can do.  The avalanche is on its way.  It happened when the vote was taken on Second Stage.  There is nothing anybody can do because the two major parties and The Workers' Party voted for and Deputies Tony Gregory-Independent, <Col N="1522" /> Jim Kemmy and the Labour Party voted against the passage of the Bill on Second Stage.  I want to make clear the position of the Labour Party regarding this proposed company structure outlined in the Bill.  We opposed the Bill on Second Stage as we do not believe the company structure is the best one which would achieve a balance between providing a service to the public while maintaining a public monopoly in postal and telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the British experience.  I regret to say that even under corporation status in Britain the British Government are now attempting to hive off 51 per cent of these corporations. My colleagues and I in the Labour Party accept, despite our opposition, that Fianna Fáil with the support of The Workers' Party and the abstention of Fine Gael endorsed the Bill on Second Stage.  Accordingly, all my representations to the Minister have concentrated on improving the proposed legislation for basically two reasons, ensuring that the public monopoly is maintained and ensuring the high quality of service to members of the public and, simultaneously, the protection of staff, and their rights regarding security of tenure and conditions of service.  I still hope that the Minister, before this debate concludes, or on Report Stage, will give greater assurance for the workers in the postal service who now feel threatened as a result of this legislation.  These are people who over the years have given loyal service.  They feel that, as a result of what we are doing now, people who for many years enjoyed civil service status will no longer be members of that organisation. Having worked so long in the service they feel they are now entering an area with which they are not familiar.  Some of these people have in excess of 30 years service and this will be a traumatic experience for them.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will assure them in the course of the debate that they need have no fears about this Bill.  There are some areas in need of amendment and I shall be so pressing in the course of the debate.  But I cannot support the amendments of Deputy De Rossa because, with <Col N="1523" /> all due respects, I feel it is a little too late in the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill has been introduced at this time by the present Government, consisting of the Fine Gael and Labour Parties.  Deputy O'Sullivan cannot get away from that fact.  We are offering Deputy O'Sullivan and his colleagues in the Labour Party the opportunity to support amendments which will protect the interests of the workers in the Post Office and the interests of the Post Office services.  That is the plain fact of the matter.  If Deputy O'Sullivan does not find it possible to support those amendments, then he must face his conscience in the matter.</P>

      <P>With regard to Deputy De Rossa's remarks, I repeat that it is too little, too late by virtue of the fact that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael agree with the philosophy behind the Bill and that the numbers do not stand up.  I would suggest that Deputy De Rossa is now indulging in a little flag-waving a little late in the day when the horse has bolted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the ideological debate here between The Workers' Party and the Labour Party fascinating.  Whatever about the situation to The Workers' Party in relation to this matter, the fact is that the Labour Party are partners in Government.  Last year the Labour Party voted down the Bill on Second Stage. Indeed, the present Tánaiste, on 22 June 1982, at columns 1196 onwards of the Official Report said:</P>
      <P>As my fellow members of the Labour Party have already outlined our objections and position regarding this legislation, I would like to lend my voice in support of them.  For many reasons we are opposed to the changes outlined in this Bill.  What we are seeing is the result of an inquiry which has not been sufficiently gone into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He then went on to outline his objections to the Bill at that stage.  Now we are seeing a major U-turn on the part of the Labour Party.  They have sold out their <Col N="1524" /> philosophy and beliefs in order to participate in Government.  I am referring in particular to Ministers who were opposed to and spoke in this House last year in total opposition to this Bill.  It is worthwhile to place on the record their opposition voiced in 1982 when we were putting forward this Bill at Second Stage. The present Minister for Health and Social Welfare spoke against and voted against the Bill, as did the present Minister for Labour.  So also did the present Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy J. Bermingham; the present Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Deputy Quinn; the Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Moynihan; the present Leas-Cheann Comhairle; the Labour Party Chief Whip, Deputy Taylor and Deputies Toddy O'Sullivan, Séamus Pattison&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall address my remarks to the amendment tabled by The Workers' Party in relation to whether we should have a semi-State company or a corporation.  I have gone into this in consultation with my party, with the front bench and former Ministers of Fianna Fáil.  After long discussion and a detailed inquiry into the whole matter we are satisfied that under the Bill as it stands, with the amendments tabled by the Minister and supported by us, a limited liability company will give the requisite protection to the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  The argument for a corporation has not been gone into in the greatest detail.  Certainly in the Report of the Posts and Telegraphs Review Group, 1978-1979, they opted for the limited liability company which forms part of this Bill.  Therefore it would constitute a complete change of attitude by us in Fianna Fáil were we to move away from that approach to one in favour of a corporation.  That is also why we cannot support the amendment by The Workers' Party.  We shall support amendments of the Bill which will safeguard the future of the staff concerned, affording them every possible security they would have under corporation status.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept the amendments tabled by Deputies De Rossa and Mac Giolla.  I shall say a few brief words of explanation as to why that is so.  In relation to this subject, and to many of the other amendments that will come up later, there are in excess of something like 120 amendments, a great number of which were tabled to meet the <Col N="1526" /> legitimate and very understandable fears of workers.  Indeed, Deputy O'Sullivan played a major part in having those amendments tabled, in improving this Bill in relation to the protection of the workers.  We have not been able to do all that he asked but we have gone as far as we could.  I want to thank him for his help.  I do not know whether I should thank him for all the pressure he brought to bear but certainly it was helpful.</P>
      <P>In relation to the argument about corporation versus company, for some reason the idea has got about that a corporation is safer for workers than a company.  For the life of me I cannot see any difference between them, except perhaps one, that is, that in the case of a company the shares could be sold to private enterprise at some future date, whereas in the case of a corporation that could not be done without amending legislation. In order to meet that situation one amendment I shall be introducing, No. 42 on section 22, is tabled specifically to prohibit the sale of any shares.  That is the only perceptible difference, as far as I can see, between a company and a corporation.  That amendment will place them on equal footing.  In my view the company format carries major advantages.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the flexibility of being able to amend the articles of association of the company whereas the aims and objectives of a corporation would have to be established by amending legislation.  Deputy De Rossa seems to think that that constitutes a threat to the workers.  I take a completely different view.  I see this as an opportunity for workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there is a potential for a very bright future.  There are all sorts of areas of expansion, such as financial services, express mail delivery, unaddressed mail in bulk, collecting money for different agencies.  These are all possibilities.  Various people at the moment exploit the assets of the Post Office.  For instance, the 2,200 outlets represent a major asset. There may be new business opportunities that we do not see and if we omit these from the aims and objectives of the corporation there could be delays created <Col N="1527" /> because of having to await the passage of legislation.  The bright future I see as a major potential in both these businesses is in the area of maintaining the volume of present business and going into new business.  That is why I think the company form, with the safeguard of the prohibition on the sale of shares, is the best form.  It is the best guarantee for the workers.  That is a fundamental principle.</P>
    <P>Here are two major businesses operated by the civil service.  This is no longer appropriate and what we are trying to do is to place the business in a really commercial environment.  I shall be making another change in the articles of association. Trade unions will have to be informed when changes are proposed and on the board of each company there will be one-third worker directors.  That will be more than a safeguard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the main danger lies in the sale of shares. Experience internationally has been that governments tend to try and offload an interest in these companies.  We have examples of that in Britain and Australia. In the latter, Quantas is a public company, but the shares are wholly owned by the Australian Government.  Now in the field of communications multi-national companies are seeking to do away with national and publicly owned telecommunication services and postal services. I understand IBM are seeking to establish a network system in EEC countries probably with the object of destroying international communications.  There is great concern, and the strongest possible protection must be given to safeguard the security of employees while at the same time ensuring that the postal and telecommunication services are retained as a national service and are given the opportunity to develop as comprehensive a service as possible.  I do not agree with the Minister.  The 30,000 employees of the Post Office enjoy certain conditions of employment and they are entitled to assurances that these conditions will remain.  The likelihood that they may change will be far greater under a company structure rather than a corporation <Col N="1528" /> structure.  The Minister referred to an amendment he intends to introduce restricting the sale of shares.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be very brief.  It would be far more salutary if we looked at the scene here rather than looking over our shoulders at certain developments that may come about in a neighbouring island as a result of a very strong right wing philosophy which will obtain for another few years.  I do not see any danger, and did not when I was on that side of the House, in the company status as distinct from corporation status except, as the Minister said, there is nothing you can do with a company that you cannot also do with a corporation.  One point I would make is that there is a certain Luddite approach to this idea that change will necessarily be bad for the workers. My experience in talking to members of the unions representing the workers in the Department was that they were very anxious to meet the challenge and very anxious to get going on this.  There has <Col N="1529" /> been strong criticism of the Department, some of it unjustified, and there are dedicated workers with very important skills anxious to get under this new régime and have the opportunity to prove they can provide a service as good as is being provided in Europe.  I deliberately leave out the United States because I suppose it is the acme, particularly in the telecommunications field, of service.</P>
      <P>In my contribution on Second Stage I was more than careful to stress that the rights and privileges of workers should be preserved.  That having been said, we must remember that what we are trying to do here is to provide a service for the customers who, in the past, probably had very good reasons for complaining.  All the warts have not been excised yet. While the workers and their conditions of work are very important and should be the object of care and consideration in this House, nevertheless what we are doing is trying to provide two boards that will give a first-rate service.  I do not think any doubts people may have with regard to the status of these companies necessarily affect the conditions of workers in the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the idea of privatisation of these services will never surface in this country. If that is the real reason for the fears being expressed by some workers &mdash; I think they are exaggerated and have got a hobgoblin kind of status &mdash; those fears should be allayed.  I do not think there is any danger of privatisation of these two companies at any time.  Looking at what is happening elsewhere.  I can see that doubts might arise that we were going on a mad privatisation jag and that as soon as one of these industries began to pay it would be siphoned off.  Up to comparatively recently we have had a pride in the achievements of what we call semi-State bodies.  It is getting a little tarnished now. Anyone in charge of a Department who has had to look at the scene in many of the semi-State companies in the past few years would have to be downhearted to a certain extent.  Admittedly the economic conditions obtaining in the world have affected the performance of many of these companies and doubts may transfer to companies not established yet.  I <Col N="1530" /> should like the House to think on that aspect when considering this Bill.</P>
    <P>The right and privileges of the workers will not be affected by this Bill.  Above all, there will be no inhibitions placed on their opportunity to give of their skills and expertise to produce two superb services for the community.  The ideas An Post have with regard to development are bright.  They are providing a good service as it is and that is not said often enough.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a belief that the existing postal and telecommunications systems must be taken out of the hands of the civil service.  Apparently people believe that the structure of the civil service is not sufficiently adaptable to change and progress.  I do not necessarily accept that point of view.</P>
      <P>This Bill proposes the setting up of two boards with the aim of improving the existing systems.  As the Minister said, they will have to cope with major changes in their present business and in their business in the future.  It is the belief of the Minister and the spokesmen on the other side that the new boards will be better able to adapt to change and improved technology.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have received considerable correspondence from staff of post offices throughout my constituency.  I am as anxious as every other Member to ensure that the rights of workers are fully protected as far as is humanly possible. Everyone is anxious to ensure that the status, incomes and conditions of employment of the workers be maintained. One of the main objectives of the Bill must be to ensure that the customers of our postal and telecommunications systems get an improved service from the point of view of efficiency and economy. For a number of years there have not been any improvements carried out to these systems.  There has been considerable delay in the installation of telephones, that installation has been costly and there have been delays in the delivery of mail.  Consequently, people have become very critical of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the staff.  A number of people sought a <Col N="1531" /> change and that change has been brought about by the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>I do not think any of the changes are necessary.  Major improvements could have been made in the existing system with full co-operation from the staff of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Section 2 deals with interpretation.  When I read the explanatory memorandum an alarm bell rang in my head.  We are going to set up two State-sponsored bodies. The functions and powers of the Minister are laid down.  The Bill provides for the establishment of an additional and separate statutory users' council for the postal and telecommunications services. Then we will have directors for each company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>In regard to the appointment of these two bodies I want to ask the Minister if he believes the public will get a better service from An Bord Poist agus An Bord Telecom.  Does he believe that they will get a more efficient and economical service?  In other words, does he believe that costs will be maintained at existing levels or perhaps reduced by the setting up of these boards?  Does he believe that overall the public will be better satisfied and happier with these two boards?  If he can convince me of that he will be going a long way with this. Deputy Wilson made reference to the approach of a number of people to semi-State bodies and the problems which some of them have caused.  In regard to these two boards I see a danger of having a hierarchy of a bureaucracy following on.  If that happens the danger is that instead of improving existing services and making them more economical, more expense could be cause.  I can quote many examples but I do not intend to outline them in detail now.</P>
      <P>Regarding the amendments, I would prefer that of the Minister to the setting up of a corporation, but I have reservations about the whole section.</P>

      <P>Deputy Wilson as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, like his predecessor &mdash; and the present Minister no doubt will do so &mdash; gave an assurance to the workers that their jobs were safe.  However, I regret that that has not been written into the legislation in terms that would allay the fears of the workers. Any of the three Ministers concerned, Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Wilson and even the present Minister, Deputy Mitchell, <Col N="1533" /> have not succeeded in convincing the Department that it must be in writing. Postal workers are in the habit of getting things in writing.  They believe in the written word, which is a long tradition in that Department and I am fairly familiar with that aspect.  To date this has not been done and I ask the Minister to ensure that there will be a re-think and that he will do something that will once and for all give to the workers what has been expressed time and time again by three successive Ministers and even by Deputy Leyden as Minister of State in that Department, with whom we broke bread at the annual conference of the Post Office Workers' Union and he said that their future was not in doubt.</P>

      <P>As yet no Minister has written that into the legislation.  I appreciate the concern expressed by Deputy De Rossa, but the mechanics of the thing do not permit that at this stage, unless the Minister will take it on himself to write it into this Bill.  The public monopoly is under threat.  The desired quality of service can be achieved.  Already in parts of the country phones can be got on demand due to the injection of capital down the years but equally important is the protection of the staff members and their rights regarding security of tenure and conditions of service.</P>

      <P>The difference between corporation and limited company is a basic fundamental issue of this Bill. Deputy O'Sullivan has this difficulty. Will he vote against the Bill at the end of the day?  If he does not, that will be in contradiction of his statements today.  He talks about the written word.  I am a great believer in the written word also and, as he stated, so are the workers in the Post Office.  Can they also comprehend the written word of the General Secretary of the Fine Gael Party on 8 June 1981 when he wrote to Andrew Coleman, 28 Gracepark <Col N="1534" /> Heights, Dublin 9?  I mention his name because he is a union official&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is because in that letter of 8 June 1981 from Peter Prendergast, General Secretary of the Fine Gael Party, he said:</P>
      <P>I would like to assure you that in the event of Fine Gael being elected to Government that all Post Office employees will be consulted through their Unions before being moved into any proposed semi-State company.  In addition such moves will not involve loss of Civil Service status.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It relates to section 2, because we are debating companies.  In relation to the amendment by The Workers' Party regarding commitments or promises made, it is relevant to point out that the Fine Gael Party in Opposition gave a clear commitment, which I hope they will honour, to the maintenance of civil service status in the Bill, which I tell the Minister is difficult to achieve.  I sympathise with Deputy O'Sullivan.  He is concerned that civil service status can be retained under either a corporation or a limited liability company.  There is no difference as far as status of the staff under either a corporation or semi-State body is concerned.  It is either civil service or semi-State.  One can have the privileges and rights of being a member of the civil service but you cannot have it both ways.  Let us be honest about it.  You cannot be a member of the civil service and also of a limited liability company.  We are trying to ensure that they will retain all the privileges and rights of civil service status and I hope we will preserve and maintain that <Col N="1535" /> situation and give them every possible security.  In relation to those commitments, I will quote from a letter sent by Senator O'Mahony, National Director of Elections, to Mr. Andrew Coleman, 28 Grace Park Heights, Dublin 9.  He stated:</P>
      <P>Just a note to confirm the assurance given to you this morning on the question of the reorganisation of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. The Labour Party is committed to full and proper consultation with workers in the Department, through their unions, before any reorganisation takes place.  We have always supported this process of consultation.  We also confirm that any reorganisation must take into account the present status of workers within the civil service.  That status will not be undermined.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan will have to reconcile himself to either supporting The Workers' Party amendment or that of the Government.</P>

      <P>The point in this section is in relation to a corporation or limited company.  I am entitled to speak on this section.  I have studied it in great detail and I am very concerned that this is the whole philosophy behind the Bill.  The Minister made some comment about an amendment.  Is he putting forward another amendment to strengthen the status of employees&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, there is no major difference between corporations and limited liability companies because the Minister has given clear assurances which we gave when we were in Government, that a limited liability company would not be sold off.  I want to make sure that it is written into this Bill, as <Col N="1537" /> clearly as possible, that a future Government could not sell off any part of that company without coming back here for permission to do so.  In relation to Deputy Enright's point, anyone who has had the honour to serve in that Department will agree that it will be a sad day when this Department is hived off to a semi-State company.  However, we cannot turn back the clock and you could not allow a situation to continue where a Minister or a Minister of State would have the day-to-day management of an organisation of 30,000 people.  The interim boards have been set up and chief executives have been appointed for some years&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The semi-State organisations have been set up already and are functioning under two chief executives. This is as it should be and, in the modern business world, we cannot have every decision made in the GPO.  With regard to that, it is ludicrous to think that a Minister for Posts and Telegraphs would be personally responsible for the appointment of cleaners in his Department.  The public would wonder why a Minister is engaged in ensuring that a certain number would come from his constituency or that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The Minister referred to the fact that he would be introducing the amendment which would preclude him from selling shares.  We were arguing that part of the reason for a corporation was the danger that the companies could be sold off to private interests.  The Minister indicated that he was introducing the amendment to preclude his selling off the shares in the company.  While that is good in itself, it does not prevent the Minister, without the need to refer back to the Dáil, from allowing the companies to change their articles of association or memorandum. The danger is still there.  Given the economic climate here, in Britain and elsewhere in the EEC and also in the US, there is a general movement towards privatisation of State companies.  The purpose in the amendment put down by The Workers' Party was to ensure that, as far as humanly possible, the interests of the people in general and of the employees in particular be protected and at the same <Col N="1539" /> time ensure a comprehensive and efficient service.</P>
      <P>I remind the Minister and the Labour Party that they have committed themselves to providing for statutory corporations in their joint Programme for Government.  This is point one under the heading of Telecommunications.</P>

      <P>That states:</P>
      <P>An Bord Telecom and An Bord Poist, after full consultation with the trade unions and staff associations before vesting day, will be established as statutory corporations.</P>
      <P>That is a clear commitment made between the Fine Gael and Labour Parties in coming together to form a Government. If they felt then that this was an important assurance to give to the workers in Posts and Telegraphs, it is equally important now.

      <P>Deputy Wilson is a shrewder man than that.  Regarding the question of the semi-State bodies already set up, examples were cited in some papers in regard to offices being made available and their very sizeable cost.  The figure is somewhere around £900,000, but I have not the exact amount.  No normal commercial company could afford that but the taxpayer is being asked to pay it. I know it is because of the progression in the setting up of these two bodies over a long period.  I accept that there have been difficulties but &mdash; let us be frank &mdash; that should not happen.  Someone has to put a knuckle on semi-State bodies that are allowing such waste.  It should not be allowed to continue.</P>

      <P>I regret having to return to this point.  When I spoke last, I made the point that the present Government in their joint programme in December of 1982, the end of last year, agreed to introduce a statutory corporation.  There is no way in which The Workers' Party, Fianna Fáil or anybody else could prevent the Labour Party and Fine Gael from introducing a statutory corporation if they chose now to do so.  The Workers' Party are offering this amendment in support of those in the House who are introducing a statutory corporation.  I cannot see how we have prevented the introduction of a statutory corporation, when we now have an amendment down to seek to do that very thing.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall try to answer some of the points put by the Deputies. Deputy De Rossa's point about the Government programme is quite correct. When I came into office I examined the situation and discovered that if we were to have a statutory corporation it would be a matter not of amending the Bill but of introducing a completely new Bill. That would have taken at least six or eight months, which would have delayed proceedings.  Even that delay might have been acceptable if something could be achieved in that manner which could not be achieved in the manner of the present <Col N="1543" /> legislation.  The one major difference between the two was that the corporation have no shares and therefore they cannot be disposed of without further legislation. That is why I am introducing the amendment to which I have referred.  All the other provisions in the Bill are as if it were a statutory corporation.  There is no difference whatsoever.  We have met the point in principle.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson earlier on in the debate mentioned the privatisation question. The Government and I have no intention of privatising anything.  W have no plans for privatisation.  In fact, I would be very much opposed to that.  That is why I am delighted to move the amendment prohibiting the sale of shares and delighted to hear Deputy Wilson make that clear. I am opposed to the amendment.</P>
      <P>Question put: &ldquo;That the words proposed to be deleted stand part of the Bill&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 6a:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (1), after line 36, to insert the following definition:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;&lsquo;staff&rsquo; will be taken to incorporate postmasters in sub post offices, and all provisions for protection of employees will include postmasters in sub post offices;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I am moving this amendment because I believe that the postmasters in sub-post offices should be given equal protection under the Bill with the staff of the Department.  In a sense these postmasters are sub-contractors to the Department but they have provided distinguished service to the Department since the foundation of the State.  They are located in every village in the country.  At the beginning of January of this year the total number of these sub-post office postmasters was 2,068.  They are providing a tremendous service at a very low cost.  The small income provided for many of them is amazing &mdash; less than £2,000 per year.  Very often the postmaster is regarded as a man of substance in his area, but the reality is that he would not need to be relying on the Department for any wealth he might have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to accept the amendment in the spirit in which it is being proposed and thereby to ensure that this group of people will be given <Col N="1545" /> equal protection with the staffs who are represented by other unions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment is not acceptable.  Postmasters are not employees. They are contractors and their position will be protected by section 39 of the Bill.  That section provides for a continuation of their existing contracts after the operation of the postal and telecommunications services is taken over by the State-sponsored board.  A later amendment in the name of Deputy Leyden relates to this also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We all appreciate that sub-postmasters are contractors and, while there is protection for them in another section of the Bill, would the Minister not envisage a situation in which after the new boards take over the whole position will change dramatically?  Therefore, would he not consider it important to think in terms of what the situation may be in five or ten years' time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>What I consider to be a very wise principle was adopted in drafting the Bill.  That was the principle of no more and no less.  The Bill seeks to transfer into the semi-State situation precisely what exists in the civil service situation. In other words, neither more nor less in terms of the monopoly situation or of the security of employment situation that exists is being proposed.  The same applies to the status of postmasters. Under the new arrangement it will be neither more nor less that what is their present situation.  Whatever changes may be proposed later &mdash; and any such changes would have to be considered at such time &mdash; there is no change envisaged in the status or contractual arrangements concerning postmasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>From discussions I have had with the chief executive and with the board I am aware that a much wider and more extensive role is envisaged under the board for sub-post offices than has been the case up to now.  Consequently, I am glad that this matter is being aired here as a result of Deputy <Col N="1546" /> Leyden's amendment.  With the aid of the small computer and so on, the chief executive of the board intends to increase the business of sub-post offices in a marketing sense.  Therefore, it is important that the House should at least take cognisance of the necessity to protect the position of postmasters in these sub-post offices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's commitment is welcome.  The change from State to semi-State is historic and over 2,000 postmasters require extra protection in relation to their status and security of tenure.  That is why I feel that &ldquo;staff&rdquo; should incorporate &ldquo;postmasters&rdquo; and I will be pressing my amendment to a vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that it is clear that the role and status of postmasters will change in time. It is part of the strategy of this new board that they will develop new wide-ranging services.  Is this not where the whole future of the network will be strengthened and improved?  Does the Minister not envisage a situation where the board may consider that sub-contracting may not be in the best interests of the board? Does the Minister not envisage a situation where postmasters will be taken in as staff at a later stage and, if they are, where will they stand at that stage?  This proposal should be seriously considered now as there will be great developments in the network which will lead on to the development of other services which will complement and supplement the postal services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that the potential is there but it would be wrong to make changes now.  It is up to the companies set up to propose changes as they become necessary.  However, there is provision in the Bill to elect a postmaster director to the company.  The postmasters' contracts will not be affected.  They are protected in the Bill.  In relation to the point about employees, it would be open to the board to decide whether post offices will be run by employees rather than contractors.  There is no change in <Col N="1547" /> status so I am opposed to the amendment.</P>

      <P>In page 10, to delete lines 30 to 32, and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;3.&mdash;Every order (other than an order under paragraph 2 of the Second Schedule) and every regulation made by the Minister, the Minister for Finance or the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism under this Act or made by the postal company under section 81 * or by the telecommunications company under section 94 * shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This amendment has two purposes. First, it provides that orders made by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs under the Second Schedule to the Bill, to enable either Bord Telecom Éireann or An Post to acquire land compulsorily, will not require to be laid before the Dáil and Seanad.  Such orders are of an administrative nature and not subordinate legislation for which section 3 was designed. Similar ministerial orders made under the Gas Act, 1976, in favour of Bord Gáis Éireann are excluded from such a requirement whereas ministerial regulations made under that Act are required to be presented to both the Dáil and Seanad.  Second, it extends the requirement to any regulations which An Post may make under the new section 81, being inserted by amendment No. 105, to regulate their staff in the matter of opening etc., postal packets in the course <Col N="1551" /> of their duties, and which Bord Telecom Éireann may make under the new section 94, being inserted by amendment No. 114, to regulate their staff in the matter of interception of telecommunication messages in the course of their duties.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 10, before section 4, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>4.&mdash;(1)  A person guilty of an offence under&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  section 45 of the Telegraph Act, 1863,</P>
      <P>(b)  section 6 of the Telegraph Act, 1869,</P>
      <P>(c)  section 11 of the Post Office (Protection) Act, 1884,</P>
      <P>(d)  section 53A (inserted by the Fourth Schedule) or 62 of the Post Office Act, 1908,</P>
      <P>(e)  section 13 of the Post Office (Amendment) Act, 1951, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1552" /> (f)  section 35*, 60, 81*, 83, 94* or 95** of this Act,</P>
    <P>shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding £800 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both the fine and the imprisonment, or</P>
    <P>(ii)  on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding £50,000 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years or to both the fine and the imprisonment.</P>
    <P>(2)  On conviction of a person on indictment for an offence to which subsection (1) relates the court may, in addition to any other penalty, order any apparatus, equipment or other thing used to commit the offence to be forfeited.</P>
    <P>(3)  Section 13 of the Criminal Procedure Act, 1967, shall apply in relation to an offence to which subsection (1) relates as if, in lieu of the penalties provided for in subsection (3) of the said section, there were specified therein the penalties provided for in subsection (1) (i) of this section, and the reference in subsection (2) (a) of the said section 13 to the penalties provided for in the said subsection (3) shall be construed and have effect accordingly.</P>
    <P>(4)  Where an offence to which subsection (1) relates is committed by a body corporate and is proved to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any person (or any person acting on his behalf) being a director, manager, or secretary of such body, that person or the person so acting, as the case may be, shall also be guilty of that offence.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to <Col N="1553" /> substitute a comprehensive new penalties section for section 4 of the Bill in order to provide up-to-date penalties for a number of serious offences affecting the national postal and telecommunications services.  The existing section 4 deals only with telecommunications fraud for which it provides a fine of £500 and/or imprisonment for six months.</P>
    <P>The proposed new section provides for each category of offence separate penalties for persons convicted after summary proceedings, and much higher penalties for persons who are convicted on indictment.</P>
    <P>Subsection (1) lists the statutory provisions which create the offences to which the proposed penalties are to apply.  The penalties to be imposed in any case are at the discretion of the court and may involve a fine or imprisonment or both, subject to the maxima set down in the subsection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not propose to move amendment No. 12 in view of the Minister's amendment which goes even further than our amendment.  We felt there was a need to differentiate between the various offences and for that reason we sought to introduce different penalties for the various offences.  In particular we were anxious to ensure that offences that breached the monopoly of Posts and Telegraphs would carry severe penalties.  That has been met by the Minister's amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with this new provision. It is merely updating the fines and other penalties in the context of this day and age.  As time goes on we will probably find that the provisions may not be adequate and I wonder if the Minister can make provision for amending the penalties or the bringing in of amending legislation. In ten years this may be out of date in view of the inflationary spiral.  At <Col N="1554" /> this time it is only right that the penalties should be increased.  If the need arises later the Government of the day will have to bring in amended legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment, which is to copperfasten the monopoly position of the company. Recently we have had a growth in private courier companies for postal services.  We had a recent happening in Dublin when quite a substantial amount of mail was found undelivered.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  I have reservations in regard to the penalties in respect of disclosure of the information but I will raise it on the appropriate section.  The fines proposed by the Minister are a welcome development.  The prison sentences on indictment are welcomed but I agree with Deputy Leyden that these penalties should not remain static.  If it is not possible to build in some sort of escalator clause, the position should be reviewed at intervals according to the rate of inflation, because in ten years these penalties may not be such a deterrent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>We all welcome the updating of the penalties so that they will match the offences but I do not think we should rely altogether on fines as a deterrent or to put courier services out of business.  What should be done is to make the postal services as efficient as the others.  When I was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I said that the quicker we could have a task force to match the courier services, the better.  We should not be waiting to give them the opportunity to develop their services and then come too late in the day to take them on. That is basically what happened.  I looked for an arrangement which I did not get at that time.  I had hoped that a task force would be sent out immediately to take on the courier services, and who better to do it than the Department through their very wide network, with vans and all the other facilities to provide good services, a more efficient one and a cheaper one? That would have matched any courier who wanted to start from scratch.  I welcome the penalties because I always felt that the law should be strengthened and <Col N="1555" /> brought up to date.  However, efficiency should be the name of the game.</P>

The Deputy will be aware of his own party's position, although some of the comments might seem not to make that clear.  His party's position has been set out in a speech by his leader in which he said that they were neither ideologically neutral nor politically indifferent.  He said that in the event of the European States being organised into a full political union, they would accept the obligations, even if they included defence, and that they could not and would not wish to opt out of the obligations and aims inherent in the achievement of the ideal of European unity.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to point out the very big difference in the way the scheme has been administered this year compared with last year.  Last year a farmer had to have a certain amount borrowed and this caused considerable difficulties.  This year there is a £70 straight grant.  That will be good news for many farmers.  So far as the numbers are concerned, the total cow number in June 1981 was just short of seven million; in June 1982, it was 6.69 million; and in December 1982, it was 5.78 million.</P>

      <P>Deputies will be aware that farmers have experienced considerable difficulties with our breeding herd for the past number of years and that many factors contributed to that situation. I have no doubt the payment of this straight cash grant will ensure that many more maiden heifers will be put in calf in 1983 and therefore will bring us the types of numbers that will be good not alone for farmers but for the economy generally.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that that figure related to the total number of farmers in a scheme where it is necessary to keep records, that the average yield per lactation is about 680 gallons and that this is disgracefully low? Something will have to be done.  At present farmers have problems with individual weighings, pipeline milkers and so on, and it is very important that there be an examination and a monitoring of the yields.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, it appears that the effectiveness of this scheme will be greatly increased this year.  An in-depth study group began a report in 1977 and a number of factors were taken into account, one of which was that the milk recordings should be the responsibility of an independent co-operative. As a result, an Irish Dairy Records Co-operative has come into existence.  In addition it was important that there should be headquarters services and laboratory analysis and that on-farm recording should be financed by the State as well as by the dairy industry and participating farmers and that this on-farm recording should be carried out by part-time contract recorders who are paid on the basis of a fee related to the herd size.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In answer to Deputy Leonard, there is no doubt that the indications are at the moment that this will be much more <Col N="1560" /> widespread.  I would accept what Deputy Leonard said: it is important in the national interest that milk recording should be widespread and that as many farmers as possible should be given the chance of participating, and this is exactly what is happening.</P>

In fact they have been told, so far as the future is concerned, that after mid-1984 the services they provided will be discontinued by the State.  ACOT are having discussions with the colleges at the moment to find out what future role they might have in whatever area of agricultural education is decided.</P>

      <P>I do not know exactly how many have applied for scholarships or for entry to the colleges this year.  I will make that information available to the Deputy as soon as it comes to hand.  What is to happen afterwards is not at stake because it has been a Government decision, as indeed, it has been a Fianna Fáil Government decision, that rural home economy schools will be phased out.

Is he further aware of the large amount of agricultural land either unused or underused and what methods therefore has he in mind for gaining the information which is essential to the Minister for Agriculture in regard to land values and grading of these farms which are under-utilised?

      <P>I think the Deputy has got various agencies mixed up. ACOT is primarily an advisory service and because of that it has to be on the basis that farmers invite the advisers in. There is a great bond of friendship, trust and confidentiality between an agricultural adviser and an individual farmer and I would not like to see that upset in any way.  What the Deputy is speaking about is another area of activity and would have nothing to do with the agricultural advisory services.</P>

If he is unwilling to do this job through the ACOT personnel, has he any alternative method in mind to gain the type of information which is absolutely essential to his Department if they are to make any progress in this regard?

      <P>ACOT advisory personnel visit farms at the request of the owners and the great majority of farmers avail themselves of the advisers' services according as the needs of their holding require.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is hard to argue with the tenor of Deputy Leonard's contribution. According to a report compiled some time ago by the General Council of County Committees of Agriculture, as they were at the time, about 20 per cent of farmers had a high interest in getting advice from agricultural advisers. Another 50 had some interest in it, and 30 per cent had no interest.  In other words, they did not want to know.  Over the years a certain category of farmers did not have the benefit of this service through no fault of any Government.</P>

They must concentrate on the weaker sections to get rid of the imbalance which we cannot afford to have.</P>

For example, the total imports in 1982 amounted to about £15 million, of which £11 million came from Northern Ireland.  The value of fully processed pigmeat products was about £3.3 million.  However, that import figure must be set against the value of exports which amounted to £73 million in 1982.</P>

      <P>The question asks if the Minister intends to encourage projects such as that at Lanesboro.  I am delighted that the Lanesboro project is a success.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>First, my Department are very interested in ensuring that as far as possible this type of project will be extended to other areas.  I would point out, however, that the Lanesboro project was not completely successful at the beginning and ran into difficulties, having many teething troubles.  However, it seems to be getting off the ground all right now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose taking Questions Nos. 14 to 16, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The horticultural industry already enjoys a concession in the rate of excise duty payable on the fuel oil it uses. Developments in the distribution of natural gas could provide an alternative and cheaper source of energy for the industry, and the possibilities in this connection are being looked into.</P>
      <P>In the tomato sector, efforts are also being made to improve the marketing of the crop and I have agreed to give financial assistance to an initiative involving the employment of a market co-ordinator for glasshouse crops.</P>
      <P>To meet the competition from imports during our own supply season, better organisation of the industry is needed. Producer groups can make a major contribution to achieving this, and aid is available from my Department towards the establishment of such groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should add that an inter-departmental group is currently monitoring imports <Col N="1582" /> of all food products and horticultural products are one of the more important sectors being examined.  Also I have recently re-appointed the Horticultural Development Group for a further three-year term.  All of these various measures are designed to assist the various sectors of the horticultural industry and to help it to expand production and secure a greater share of the market.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that we are importing 6,000 tonnes of tomatoes at a value of approximately £5 million?  The measures he has outlined in his reply are not adequate to meet that situation.  This is a matter of urgency. Would the Minister deal with the situation facing the tomato growers, especially as many tomato houses are not in use?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The import of potatoes from non-EEC countries is prohibited except under licence.  In view, however, of our obligations under the EEC-Cyprus agreement and as only minimal quantities of Irish earlies are yet available, licences have been granted recently for the import of 250 tonnes of potatoes from Cyprus, a country which purchases many times that quantity of seed potatoes from us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem is that because of the various trade agreements we have with countries associated with, but not members of, the EEC and having regard to the fact that in this instance the <Col N="1583" /> trade balance is very much in our favour from the point of view of seed potatoes, we have to be seen to give a certain trade to the country in question.

      <P>In relation to the transfer of property or assets, how far advanced is the Minister in dividing the assets between An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom?  When I was in the Department they were measuring the General Post Office in O'Connell Street so as to allocate areas to the different companies. Will the Minister say if our State has title to the General Post Office?  There was a ground rents situation in the Post Office and I would like the Minister to ensure that the property is freehold on transfer to An Bord Poist and An Bord Telecom. It disturbs many people that although we have had our freedom since 1922, still the title to the GPO has not yet been finalised. During my period many efforts were made and I had looked forward to finalising the title to the GPO in 1982, which was the anniversary of the birth of Eamon de Valera.  Unfortunately this <Col N="1665" /> was not finalised and I would like the Minister to tell me if we as a State own the ground rent of the GPO or is it still owned by some British landlord?</P>

      <P>The Deputy is right that Eamon de Valera should be commemorated but he was one of the few people who did not claim to be in the GPO at that time.  It might be particularly inappropriate since he was elsewhere in Dublin.  The matter of title is still with the Attorney General but effectively the State has the title.</P>

      <P>The question of title to the GPO is relevant.  Will the Minister ensure that the GPO is the headquarters for An Bord Poist?  Before the vesting date the Department should ensure that the ground rents are purchased.  It is unfortunate that since 1922 we have not acquired title to the most historic building in Ireland.  We should also ensure the continuity of use of this building by making it the headquarters for the new board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 25:</P>
      <P>In page 12, subsection (3) (b), lines 33 to 44, to delete subparagraph (i) and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;(i)  the value of the property to be transferred to the company on <Col N="1667" /> the vesting day under sections 37 and 38, less the amount by which sums issued by the Minister for Finance under the Telecommunications Capital Acts, 1924 to 1981, which have not been repaid before that day exceed the sum of £355,000,000 plus the amount of the outstanding liability of the Minister to Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited immediately before the vesting day, and&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This amendment has two purposes.  It deletes all references to loans <i>et cetera</i> involving Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited which were included in reserve, that is, in case any loans arose.  These are not appropriate now since no such loans have arisen and none are envisaged.  Secondly, it corrects the reference to £355 million of the unpaid advances under the Telecommunications Capital Acts, 1924 to 1981, which are to be converted into shares of An Bord Telecom Éireann, and provides for an additional amount of those advances to be converted into shares of BTE corresponding to the liability of the telecommunications service for unpaid leasing charges of that amount which BTE will be required to discharge to Irish Telecommunications Investments Limited under section 39 of the Bill.  The balance of the unpaid advances under those Acts will be a liability of An Bord Telecom Éireann to discharge under the new section 95 being inserted in the Bill by amendment No. 116.  A similar amendment is being made to section 18 (2).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision was that <Col N="1668" /> there would be £355 million in shares. This figure was arrived at during the drafting of the Bill and it equalled about 50 per cent of the borrowing at that stage on the telecommunications side.  On the basis of a debt-equity ratio of 50:50 it would be £355 million.  It was always envisaged that the ratio would become a little out of kilter in the early years while there would be huge investment but would fall back to that level.  We are taking account of the passage of time and making provision for extra equity which will probably be of the order of £80 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the clarification because the Minister has mentioned the matter which was the nub of the problem when I became Minister.  The Department of Finance and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were putting a Bill together.  In August 1981 the Department of Finance backed off and left it to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who worked on it for a long time.  The winter passed and the Department of Finance did not want to know about it.  Deputy Cooney was the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Taoiseach was approached and he forced the Department of Finance to meet the Minister.  In early January 1982 Deputy Bruton, then Minister for Finance, had prepared his budget and would not yield on this Bill.  The financial arrangements, with a 50-50 debt equity ratio, were worked out by me as Minister.  I got it under way to Second Stage.  I am glad to hear that the Minister has backed up the work that was done and that he has succeeded in making an impact on the Department of Finance and that he has got a few quid extra to help the future debt equity balance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Irish Telecommunications Investment Company have played a very important role in the development of the system in this country.  I compliment the former Minister, Deputy <Col N="1669" /> Reynolds, for his initiative in setting up that company.  Has the Minister available the details of the amount of money raised from private enterprise in relation to funding for the accelerated telecommunications programme?  Without the capital raised by the company I do not believe the developments that have taken place would have occurred.  Many people wonder, and I agree with them, whether the amount of capital organised in that way has been enough.  However, without the funds made available through the Irish Telecommunications Investment Company we would not have reached the level we have achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure would be about £400 million.  That is the gross figure raised from all financial sources and it includes money from the EIB which could not be described as private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>What comes from the EIB, I understand, goes into the Department of Finance and then goes to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. There is a little fiddle there because the Department of Finance are making a profit on it.  They are getting it for less than they are charging the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  I see the Minister nods resignedly and that may indicate I am on the right lines.  When the new board has been set up there should be some clarification about the role of the EIB <i>vis-à-vis</i> the new board.  It would be a great advantage to the board if it could borrow at the lower rate of interest from the EIB and then the ogre in the Department of Finance will not be taking some of the advantage from the development for which the money will be made available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>As the position now is the Department of Posts and Telegraphs are a State Department.  They are a Department in their own right and should be in <Col N="1670" /> a position to borrow.  The Minister said that the EIB lends only to Departments who would be in a position to borrow direct and consequently get the benefit, and the new board should get that benefit instead of having to go to the Department of Finance.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson tried to make the point that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or the Department of Transport in relation to CIE, borrow throught the Department of Finance who charge the full rate to each Department though they are getting a reduced rate from the EIB, whether it is by way of EMS subsidies which we got when we entered the European Monetary System or through the application of the Ortoli Facility, or in some other way.  The Department who are borrowing are not getting the benefit.  Here we have a Department who will be expected to operate on commercial lines, particularly when we go into the semi-State area. What will be the position then in relation to borrowing?  Will the board be able to borrow directly and if so can they take advantage of the various subsidies that are available from time to time?  What is the position in relation to EMS subsidies, for instance in relation to the digital contracts? Does that carry on after vesting or will the thing rest with the Department of Finance?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <P>I would hope that the organisation of finance will be on a more satisfactory basis because without the availability of capital this company will not succeed in the next few years.  Much capital will be needed to complete the development programme and I hope the residual Department of Posts and Telegraphs will be able to assist in the raising of loans at the lowest possible rate, particularly in the first years of development. They should be allowed to borrow directly from the EIB at preferential rates of interest.</P>

      <P>I am not hopeful that what I have to say will have much effect on the Minister or his Department, but I dislike very much the nomenclature which appears to have been agreed for these two companies, quite apart from the principle of setting them up.</P>
      <P>I have often complained in this House about the habit of cogging things from the British and I would not wish to weaken anything I said in that regard, but it is just as foolish to fall over backwards to get away from a pattern which has been familiar for a very long time and which is not a recent British invention. The Post Office was set up in England in the time of Cromwell and there has been an Irish Post Office under that name since not long after &mdash; I think in the reign of Queen Anne.  Unless there was some very good reason to change that common expression, which is in use in everybody's mouth between the shoneens at one end of the political spectrum and the Napper Tandys on the other, without any of them feeling they are demeaning the country they both stem from by using it, I cannot quite see why it should have been necessary to call An Post, the Post Company in the English language.</P>

Would it be too much to hope that a similar happy anticipation has occurred in the case of the second authority mentioned.  Bord Telecom Éireann?  I cannot help feeling that some of my friends in the House were letting me ramble on to see to what length I would go to before they told me <Col N="1674" /> the point I was making had been conceded an hour ago.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to call the second board Bord Telecom Éireann, or in the English language,  The Irish Telecommunications Board.  I do not want to be pedantic about this, nor do I want to be a stick-in-the-mud, but it seems that what is happening here is that we are getting the worst of all worlds so far as nomenclature is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I went to school, and when Deputy Wilson and most other Deputies went to school, there was a word for television which was formed from the perfectly sensible Irish word &ldquo;cian&rdquo;, which had the same force as the Greek element &ldquo;tele&rdquo; meaning distance and it was used for &ldquo;television&rdquo; and a couple of other words.  There was also a word for &ldquo;communication&rdquo; which is not to be found in caint na ndaoine, but which is definitely there because the word for &ldquo;communications media&rdquo; which I see being used in print and scripts is &ldquo;meán cumarsáide.&rdquo;  If we are going to have an appalling difficult word like &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; in English, I cannot see why we should not use an Irish compound &ldquo;cian cumarsáide&rdquo; or something of that kind.  Instead, we are having Bord Telecom Éireann and it would be impossible to persuade me that that inelegant, semi-literate, cheapjack reach-me-down abbreviation was not cogged straight from the British who, for reasons of their own &mdash; with which I do not quarrel because they are a different people &mdash; have chosen to call their corresponding authority, from which naturally we are copying ours, British Telecom.  Naturally we have to dress it up in a little green jacket, with silver buttons, a dudean in his mouth and a caubean on his head and call it Bord Telecom Éireann.  Where is the reason for that?  Surely the Minister should apologise to the House &mdash; and so should Deputies Wilson and Reynolds <Col N="1675" /> who are grinning &mdash; at the idea that what is good enough for the British with this broken off, sawn off word &ldquo;telecommunications&rdquo; can be transmuted into the Irish language in the very same form.</P>
    <P>I do not want to waste the time of the House on a small thing, but small things are only a symbol of bigger things.  I would be sorry if I let this pass without comment.  I do not suppose it will affect the Minister, but I object very much to Bord Telecom Éireann, to the idea that it is necessary, and to its name.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister consider the possibility of strengthening this section?  He has very good advice available to him, and the Labour Party are very anxious to have this section strengthened further, but I wonder will this give adequate protection?  If there could be a follow-up to that to ensure that any changes in the memorandum of association of each company shall be in such a form consistent with this Act as may be approved by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for Finance, so that <Col N="1676" /> any changes in this Act should be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas, it would give the workers a sense of protection. We want to ensure that the 30,000 people who are transferring to both companies will totally agree with the philosophy behind the Bill and we want to give them the maximum security of tenure.  This would strengthen this section by ensuring that any changes in the memorandum would be brought before the Oireachtas.  I would like the advice of the Minister's advisers in relation to this. I have met numerous members of the staff both individually and collectively through their unions since I became spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs.  I have endeavoured to table necessary amendments to this Bill and I have welcomed the Minister's amendments but I would like a further strengthening of section 11.  I would like the Oireachtas to have the opportunity to debate any changes that were to be made and I would like to assure the 30,000 people employed by both companies that we in this House are anxious to ensure that their security of tenure is copperfastened.</P>

      <P>Under section 11 will the Minister consider on Report Stage introducing an amendment?  I would ask the Minister to consider this in the interests of the staff if it is consistent with the legal requirements.  I know that any changes would not be brought about by the Minister against the wishes of the staff but I would ask him to indicate to the staff quite clearly that we are ensuring their security of tenure.  They are concerned about this section.  They feel that corporation status gives them more security. They feel the memorandum of association could be changed without recourse to the Dáil.  I am asking the Minister to include at the end of section 11 that any <Col N="1677" /> changes proposed must be brought before the Oireachtas in the form of an amendment or at least laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and require the statutory 21 days to allow for any debate in relation to that.

      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a)  to provide a national postal service within the State and between the State and places outside the State,&rdquo;. .bqe</P>
      <P>Section 12 specifies the principal objects of the proposed State-sponsored postal company An Post.  These are to meet the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State for efficient postal services, to provide a money transmission service, counter services for its own business and Government <i>et cetera</i> business and consultancy, advisory, training and contract services in Ireland and abroad.  The purpose of the amendment is to specify an additional object for the company, namely the provision of a national postal service.  This will become the first in the list of the company's objectives.  A corresponding amendment is proposed to section 16 (2) of the Bill which gives statutory justification for the national postal monopoly being granted to the company under that section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that amendments Nos. 26 and 27 are exclusive of each other.  Amendment No. 27 would be a development of the Minister's amendment.  I have already indicated that our purpose in proposing any amendments to this Bill was to ensure that there was a comprehensive and efficient postal service provided to the highest possible standards and also that the job security of the Post Office employees was protected.  The existing paragraph (a) does not adequately express the type of service which is needed.  The words &ldquo;reasonably practicable&rdquo; are included in paragraph (a).  It refers to such services as the company considers to be reasonably practicable.  In my view that terminology leaves large loopholes in the type of services which could be provided by the company.</P>
      <P>It leaves a loophole to the extent that it may be considered reasonably practicable for them to give away some of the services or to consider that some services they could provide could more reasonably and practicably be provided by a private company.  For that reason we are seeking to have that paragraph deleted and the alternative words inserted &ldquo;a comprehensive and efficient postal service of the highest attainable standard to satisfy as far as possible the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State&rdquo;.  This would be a far more appropriate paragraph.  I do not see that it is in any way exclusive or contradictory to the Minister's amendment No. 26.</P>

      <P>to provide a comprehensive and efficient postal service of the highest attainable standards to satisfy as far as possible the domestic, industrial, commercial and social needs of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> The Minister should consider changing the wording to accommodate our wording, or the wording of Deputy De Rossa. The service provided by the Department at the moment does not need an explanation or any definition.  We have have a postal service and a parcel service.  I am anxious to define exactly what we are proposing to do with the postal services of the company.  I am anxious to maintain the delivery of letters to each home.  We will debate that later.  The Minister should consider the definition we are putting forward and perhaps bring in an amendment on Report Stage.  I want to define as clearly as possible the operations of the Department in relation to An Bord Poist so that we will know exactly what their mandate is, to provide an efficient postal service of the highest attainable standards to satisfy as far as possible the domestic, industrial, commercial and social needs of the State.  That is a very acceptable amendment and the Minister should seriously consider accepting it.</P>
    <P>This is a very long Bill.  We prepared it when we were in Government.  Deputy Wilson launched it last year.  If we were in Government today, we would consider all reasonable amendments.  Our approach to this Bill is consistent with our approach when we were in Government. If we were trying to take political advantage of the Labour Party we could set out to oppose many sections in the Bill.  That is not the Fianna Fáil approach. We stand for continuity.  We could put down amendments to embarrass the Government.  We are not doing that.  We feel strongly about this Bill.  It is our Bill. We are thankful to the Minister for bringing it back.  We accept responsibility for it.  Any amendment we are putting forward is intended to tighten it up and strengthen it.  We could put Deputy O'Sullivan and the Tánaiste in a most embarrassing position.  The Labour Party are under immense pressure from The Workers' Party.  They are taking political advantage of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill goes back to 1979, the time of the unfortunate strike. Deputy Faulkner was Minister and he put the emphasis on the accelerated programme for investment.  This was continued on by Deputy Reynolds.  Then unfortunately we had a Coalition Government and the Department were ignored totally.  This Bill was ignored. Deputy Wilson has outlined why the Bill was ignored from 1981 until February 1982.  I am very proud to have served with Deputy Wilson as Minister of State. As Minister, Deputy Wilson ensured that the Bill was taken up again and brought before the House last May, June and July for the Second Stage debate.  If we had been in office last November this Bill would have been finalised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For a short-term political advantage we could disown the Bill.  We could say <Col N="1682" /> we do not want incorporated status or limited company status because representations were made to us in a particular way.  We want to be consistent.  We feel deeply about the Bill.  The former Ministers discussed our approach to it.  We are proud to be consistent in supporting the Bill.  Deputy Kelly may say we should take political advantage.  We might be able to bring down the Government on this Bill if we really wanted to.  As a member of the Post Office Workers' Union Deputy O'Sullivan must find it very hard to discover that The Workers' Party are advocating the very amendments he supported last year.  The Tánaiste must find it very difficult to support this Bill.</P>
    <P>The Government may find it very hard to go back on an agreement made last year in Limerick.  I am surprised that Deputy De Rossa should be upset about changes in the agreement or the deal made in the Savoy Cinema in Limerick or wherever it was.  I think it was the Savoy in Limerick.

It goes as far as it possibly can to encompass all the services provided at the moment.  It is not unfair to remind the House and the Deputies on the Government side in particular that last July the Fine Gael Party abstained when this Bill was going through.  Fianna Fáil voted for it but it was opposed by all the Members of the Labour Party.  Now, 11 months later, we have the greatest U-turn in Irish politics.  The gymnasts in the Labour Party are prepared to turn head over heels in support of this Bill.  I welcome their support because it is a good Bill.  It is our Bill.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak briefly on all three amendments because they are all germane to the point I want to make. The purpose of all three amendments is to pin on to the new board the responsibility for providing something; whatever words one might find to describe it, it would be a decent postal service.  We can dress that up whatever way we like.  I cannot understand how it came about that Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa on the one hand and Deputy Leyden on the other have put down identical amendments.  I cannot believe they collaborate about such matters.  However it does not matter.  Those two amendments, and that of the Minister, broadly aim at fixing and identifying that duty.</P>
      <P>I do not want to anticipate too much, because we still have a long way to go in regard to this Bill, but it is very important before we pass from these amendments to recall that they have to be read against the background of the position in which the Post Office are going to be put by section 60 which will confirm the monopoly of the Post Office in regard to postal services.  It is important to look at the import of section 60 when we consider these amendments.  I am quite happy with the amendments put down by Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Mac Giolla and the Minister. I see nothing wrong with any of them, but the point is that this is what the public expect from the Post Office.  I know that has not been stated, so far, in legislation, but this is what the public expect.  It is only if the public get the kind of standard that the Minister, Deputy Mac Giolla, Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Leyden want, that they ought to be asked to tolerate a monopoly.  It is terribly important to say that here at a relatively early stage in the debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody would mind a monopoly in the sale of hairpins but when it is a monopoly in a service which is statutorily bound to provide the things which Deputy Leyden, Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Mac Giolla and the Minister want to see, then a very serious dimension enters monopoly, because unless that system works the public are not getting something to which they are entitled.  Not only that, and I am not apologising for mentioning it, but business is being unjustly kept out of an area in which it could operate and not just make money &mdash; contemptible though it is to mention money these days, obsequious though the apologists must be for talking about making a profit &mdash; it is being kept away not only from money and profit but from providing employment. For the benefit of Deputies who are geographically and politically to my left, I emphasise that it is only if that service will provide the decent standards which everybody here wants to see that I would defend their monopoly.  Wherever the fault lies, whether ministerial mismanagement or bad relations in the Department, bad liaison, bad staff relations, bad industrial relations or bloody-mindedness among the unions, when the net result is that the public are not getting a postal service, then the constitutional and legal basis for a monopoly must disappear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a State like ours it is not possible for postal workers to behave as they did in 1979 and threaten people who are trying to carry on courier services.  You cannot with one breath destroy a postal service, whatever your grievances or excuses &mdash; and I am not referring only to unions; I am speaking of the entire service from the Minister down &mdash; and with the next breath prevent others from filling the gap.  That cannot be done legally.  I have no doubt that couriers are creaming off <Col N="1688" /> the profitable routes.  They are there because people can no longer trust the post to do what it once did.  When I entered Leinster House 14 years ago I used to get the Seanad Order Paper and, subsequently, the Dáil Order Paper at 7.30 a.m. by post.  That does not happen now.  It no longer comes by post.  You have to collect it here in the morning because the post can no longer be relied on to make an overnight delivery.  These are the conditions in which courier services rise and flourish.</P>
    <P>I note that the Post Office were talking recently about starting a courier service of their own.  Existing law is defective in this regard, and I do not think it can be relied upon, but the Post Office are talking about using this law to have the existing courier services banned, and I think the law is being invoked for this purpose at present.  If the Post Office would provide the common or garden ordinary overnight or half day post which once upon a time they did in Dublin and Cork there would be no need for a courier service and it is only because they cannot or will not do it any longer that people have to resort to couriers.  I have no axe to grind for couriers.  I do not own shares in any courier company.  I do not know anyone in a courier company at any level of employment.  But the public are caught in the middle and unless they get from the monopoly we are going to create, and to which the standards envisaged by these amendments are going to attach, unless they get those standards, then the legal basis in a free country for a monopoly disappears and I do not care who shouts or pickets to the contrary.  A Minister or post office workers have no business insisting on a monopoly unless they are providing a service of the standard which every Deputy here wants to see.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy Leyden's amendment because it is very suitable for this section.  It relates to the principal objectives of the postal company. Perhaps the Minister might concern himself with the words &ldquo;postal company&rdquo; now having changed the name to &ldquo;Post Office&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is nonsense for Deputy O'Sullivan to <Col N="1689" /> suggest that because Deputy Wilson as Minister mentioned certain amendments he was prepared to bring before the House that meant no other amendments would have been brought in by him if he had continued as Minister.  Anybody who has served as Minister knows that much consideration is given to a Bill between Second Stage and Committee Stage. While certain amendments might come to mind when the Minister is replying to Second Stage, nevertheless it is not unusual for a number of other amendments to be brought before the House on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The purpose of An Post being set up on a statutory basis is to give the best possible service.  If I was not convinced that such a service could be improved under the new system I would never have proposed that the change be made, nor would I have established the interim boards.  Despite the criticism levied by Deputy Kelly and while much more could be done to improve the postal service, the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and their staff have given a reasonably good service considering the problems with which they are faced.  One must remember that there are regulations governing the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and also civil service regulations generally which did not help in operating their business.  The staff in Posts and Telegraphs could give a very much better service, given the opportunity.  The public have the impression that the civil service rules and regulations specifically relate to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs only.  These regulations have inhibited the work of the Post Office and their removal would lead to a much better service.</P>

      <P>The Fianna Fáil Party had the opportunity to introduce that amendment into the Bill and they did not.  I shall read the grounds which the union put forward in support of the amendment:</P>
      <P>It should be the objective of the Corporation and the Government to provide the best possible postal service throughout the State.  As framed, the section&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>This is the section which was produced by Fianna Fáil and subsequently brought in by the Coalition Government.</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;considerably endangers the fundamental concept of the postal service guaranteeing a universal service of the same quality to each and every citizen at a standard national charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is why we introduced the amendment <Col N="1691" /> to the Bill.  We accept that position and agree with it.  I did not at any time attempt to embarrass Deputy O'Sullivan in the House.  I introduced the question of the Joint Programme for Government simply to clarify a misunderstanding which he obviously had in relation to our party opposing the amendment to the Bill.  He did not realise that the Coalition Government had introduced the same Bill as Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kelly says that the monopoly can be justified only if the criteria laid down in the amendment are complied with.  I agree to the extent that a posts and telecommunications service must be comprehensive and efficient.  That has been the approach of my party from the beginning.  For that reason we have supported the establishment of two State companies.  They will be far more effective and efficient in that form.  The danger in the Bill as presented here is that there are openings in it to enable private enterprise companies to come in, at the behest of whichever Minister is in office at the time and take the services which are profitable, leaving the State companies with the unprofitable services.</P>
    <P>I have no hang-ups whatsoever about the word &ldquo;profits&rdquo;.  It is a question of the use of profits.  For any enterprise to succeed, whether private or State, there must be the creation of a surplus of wealth for re-investment and development. In private companies, most of the profit made is used for private purposes, buying yachts or homes in Tenerife and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>They have to re-invest, but the bulk of private profit is not so used.  The state of private industry here at present indicates that private profit is not being used for re-investment.  The companies are depending entirely on State hand-outs to try to maintain jobs and to develop.</P>

      <P>With regard to the pirate courier services being provided the trade union movement in the Post Office have been pressing for years for the Post Office to provide courier services.  It is not that the workers in the Post Office have been reluctant to become involved in this area.  They saw the dangers to their jobs in the mushrooming of illegal courier services.  These courier services employ young children who go around on bicycles which they themselves must own and service and are paid buttons.  We must ensure that the courier services provided give the people working in them a decent standard of living.  The trade union movement, above all else, should not be blamed that the Post Office are not providing these courier services.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept amendment No. 27.  If he does that, he will be also accepting amendment No. 27 (a).</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly's contribution about the springing up of courier organisations right across the country attributed this mainly to the failure of the Post Office to provide the service and also to the industrial situation in the Post Office.  The Post Office is unique in that it had the most stable work force of any section, private or public.  They did not have a strike from 1922 until 1979.  They showed amazing endurance of intolerable conditions for a long time.</P>
      <P>It is most unfair to attribute the lateness of the delivery to the postman who actually delivers it.  Everybody knows that each urban area in the city is expanding. From time to time people who have enjoyed a postal delivery at 7 o'clock in the morning, through re-routing, may find themselves at the end of the delivery and may not receive their post until 12 o'clock mid-day.  There is a very simple explanation and I have no doubt that that is what happened in Deputy Kelly's case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There have been breakdowns, it is true.  At an earlier stage <Col N="1693" /> yesterday we discussed penalties.  Not too long ago in Dublin, items given to a courier service for transmission were found in a derelict building.  If a Post Office official were guilty of such an action he would be dismissed and brought before the courts. At present there is a case before the courts involving the question of whether the courier services are in breach of the monopoly.  This House bestowed on the Post Office a monopoly and the couriers would seem to be in breach of that.  In comparing the conditions of employment and the services provided by the Post Office and by the courier services one is not comparing like with like.  Deputy Kelly is being most unfair to the Post Office people who have served this country loyally down through the years.</P>
      <P>I hope, like everybody else, for a more efficient service.  There is a need for restructuring.  It is not the work force in the Post Office who are responsible for the present situation.  There the buck stops.  People have been charged with that responsibility by this House.  It was up to them down through the years to do something about the situation.  They did nothing and the public are paying now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to leave Deputy O'Sullivan under a misapprehension. I would not mind parting from him on bad terms if I thought he was wrong, but would be sorry to have him feel that I was being unfair when he misunderstands me.  I can quite see that a sudden increase in the work of a postal district will cause disruption and somebody may be at the receiving end of it.  I hope that he does not think me so small-minded as to waste the time of this House complaining that my Order Paper does not arrive at 7.30 in the morning.  I gave a simple example, which could be multiplied one hundred thousandfold, of the kind of way in which the postal service has deteriorated. It is nowhere in the same realm of horror as the telephone service.  The telephone service is in the Hammer Films category compared with the postal service.  I do not wish to exaggerate what is wrong with the postal service, but since 1979 it has never got back to the standard it formerly used to attain and to <Col N="1694" /> which I am very glad to acknowledge it attained.</P>
      <P>One need not go back to the days before the first world war about which one's grandmother would tell one.  In relatively recent times, one could reliably post a letter at any provincial town, or even village, at lunch time and it would be delivered by the first post in Dublin on the following day.  Those times have passed.  There may be good reasons for that but to Deputy O'Sullivan and also to Deputy De Rossa who obviously is attached to the idea of a postal service which delivers for a standard modest fee to the door of everybody's house, even to houses that may be situated at the top of boreens on some remote mountains, I say that we have an amazing service.  It is a great luxury even in a leafy suburb such as the one I live in to have one's mail delivered to the door by a man who must be paid well enough to maintain a wife and family.  He delivers that mail even if it consists only of a couple of awful circulars.  I seldom get what I regard as a real letter these days but it is not for the postman to make such distinctions.  I am not sure that we should be even attempting to afford this de luxe service.  I am interested to hear Deputy De Rossa talk about this without even questioning whether we can afford it.  It is a service that cannot be automated beyond a certain point so we must have a responsible and educated man to perform this menial service for everyone in a collection of perhaps 300 houses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not trying in any sense to belittle our postal service.  I would agree that a charge of 26 pence per letter is a burden from the commercial point of view in that this charge is higher than that levied on some of our competitors but measured against the service one receives, the 26 pence charge is fairly cheap.  I may be saying something else about that in a different context but many parts of our commercial and industrial world and of our private and domestic world also need a faster service than we provide.  The postal service has deteriorated.  People would have been happy if it had been maintained at the 1950, 1960 or 1970 standard.  The courier services with their <Col N="1695" /> little boys and roomfuls of abandoned letters would never have been heard of if the standards that were taken for granted 12 or 13 years ago had been maintained.</P>
    <P>I suspect that what we are at today is putting a political buffer between whatever Minister happens to be in office and the public in the form of a natty little board who can be blamed for everything when the service deteriorates still further and who will have little chance of solving the industrial problems which neither the Minister nor his predecessors succeeded in solving.  That concerns me.  We are setting up a whole structure of expensive quarters, wall-to-wall carpeting and so on but we will get a service which will not be any better than we are getting now and which will leave open the same opportunities economically so far as the couriers are concerned.  Instead of improving, the service will probably become much worse.  If that happens and particularly if it ever grinds to a halt, that monopoly in a country like ours which is governed by a Constitution which contains articles such as 43 and 45 which attribute a certain status to property and enterprise and give the State rather a back seat in these contexts, can no longer be justified.  I say that with whatever little expertise I may be credited with.  It will not be possible nor reasonable to ask the public to accept a monopoly which is not delivering a service as was the case for five months in 1979, when something half-way on the way to lawlessness was involved and when other people in the humble pursuit of profit tried to provide an alternative service.  I support the monopoly situation provided it delivers in the terms sought by these Deputies in their amendment.</P>

      <P>Is that the sort of slave labour that Deputy Kelly would expect from people in the public service?  I will not have anyone criticised when I know the conditions in which they must work and when the people who make the laws have failed to provide proper conditions. I am not pointing the finger in any direction but I am merely referring to the situation as I found it in 1980 after a prolonged strike.  I would not condone much of what happened during the strike. Conditions were created then for a courier service to pick up some of the business. Let us consider the sort of charges that these people impose.  They charge £1.50 for delivering a letter from one side of the city to the other.  If the Post Office were to increase their charge to that extent, we would have Deputies making a lot of noise and asking what had gone wrong.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give us statistics relating to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  We are aware of the hundreds of thousands of items that are handled every day by the Department but we always hear about the one or two letters that did not arrive.  We never hear <Col N="1697" /> about the 700,000 that are delivered on time every day.  We must compare like with like and have regard to the entire situation instead of picking out some small item or writing a little letter to the evening papers about a letter posted in Dublin and which did not arrive in another part of the city for two days. There is no business operation in this country, courier or otherwise, that is providing the sort of service that used to be part and parcel of the Post Office. However, society is changing and we must pay for the services we receive.  If we are not prepared to create the right conditions for people to work in, we are failing in our duty.</P>
    <P>It was precisely for that reason that my predecessor, Deputy Faulkner, made this move.  Somebody had to grasp the nettle and attempt to sort it out before it disintegrated. As a result of the review group's report decisions were taken.  It is sad that it took so many years before this Bill was brought before us to set up these boards. These boards have not been set up to shield politicians from legitimate criticisms. Had the postal service been reorganised and had public service reform taken place 15 years ago as it did in other countries, there would have been no need for this Bill today.  We should now get on with the job and it will not be easy.  We will have to get rid of some of the antiquated regulations in the Department.</P>
    <P>On my first week on the job I went into the Fairview sorting office at 11.45 one night where young fellows were finishing their work and I asked them what I could do for them as a Minister.  A young man told me that I should take a look at the rule book.  I asked him for one and he said he had sold it to a museum for £1,000.  That rule book is 100 years out of date and it does not set down conditions under which one could work today. The Department of Posts and Telegraphs were expected to operate those regulations. It is no wonder that there was a clash between the workers and the management. Those regulations barred them from getting into a commercial area, to charge for the services.  We all want the service.  We should not dwell on small <Col N="1698" /> criticisms without looking at the overall operation of the system.  The conditions under which postal and telecommunications workers have worked need to be changed and we should have a proper management structure.  Within that Department there are the finest workmen available and I know what they are prepared to do when properly motivated and given leadership. For us to come in here and criticise them will not help.  We should get on with the Bill, get the boards set up and get the management structures that will give us the service we want.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Reynolds for his contribution and I agree with him.  Constructive critisism is very necessary but there has been unfair criticism.

      <P>I was delighted with the result of the survey and I wrote both to Gay Byrne and to the Department thanking them and urging the Department to do better if they could.  I agree with Deputy Kelly in that the guarantee of the future of the Post Office is its efficiency.  The vast majority of people in the Post Office accept that.  There have been improvements and hopefully there will be more improvements.  The amendment proposed by Fianna Fáil is not greatly different from what we have put down in the original section (a).  We have added to the subsection:</P>
      <P>(a)  to provide a national postal service within the State and between the State and places outside the State,</P>
      <P>The Bill then goes on to say:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) to meet the industrial, commercial and social needs of the State for efficient postal services and, so far as the company considers reasonably practicable, to satisfy all reasonable <Col N="1699" /> demands for such services throughout the State,</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 27b:</P>
      <P>In page 13, subsection (1), lines 21 to 23, to delete paragraph (c) and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c)  to provide counter services for the company's own and Government business and for others as the company thinks fit provided they are compatible with these and other principal objects set out in this subsection,&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for this amendment is to try to give as much freedom as possible to sub-post offices and post offices to generate as much business as possible and so to expand the service.  I would hope the amendment would bring flexibility to the company to operate for and on behalf of individuals and organisations so that more business would be generated in the Post Office services.  There are over 2,000 sub-offices located in villages <Col N="1704" /> throughout the State as well as the main post offices.  The company, in consultation with the unions involved, should be given as much flexibility as possible.  My amendment reads:</P>
    <P>To provide counter services for the company's own and Government business and for other as the company thinks fit provided they are compatible with these and other principal objects set out in this subsection.</P>
    <P>This is a reasonable amendment and will allow the company to generate extra business. There are plenty of opportunities for these sub-offices in relation to the payment of accounts of other semi-state organisations.  For instance, the ESB could easily reach an arrangement with the Post Office to collect ESB accounts. That worthwhile extension would provide extra employment.  We must generate additional work for all the sub-offices and main offices because over the last few years there has been a removal of some business from those offices, particularly insurance stamps.</P>
    <P>To provide extra work and to develop the company further, greater flexibility should be given.  For instance, they could co-operate with Bord Fáilte by providing information, arranging bookings for tourists and so on.  That could be an efficient part of the service provided by the Post Office, and the postmasters would be more than delighted to co-operate in any way that would generate extra business.</P>
    <P>We should have adopted the Giro system some years ago because it would have generated an amazing amount of extra work for the Post Office.  The company should not be inhibited from making arrangements with other organisations &mdash; semi-State or private companies &mdash; to provide new services.  It would be very useful if a person could obtain his car tax or a driving licence in the post office.  Many people would find this very convenient.  Therefore, I ask the Minister to accept my amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>These three amendments are almost the same and there is broad agreement on them.  My amendment <Col N="1705" /> is to delete &ldquo;, subject to the consent of the Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;, provided that they are compatible with those services and with the other principal objects set out in this subsection,&rdquo;.  These three amendments are effectively the same.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad the Minister accepted this principle of removing inflexibility and day-to-day ministerial control.  If we are taking this out of the hands of the civil service we must give the day-to-day control into the hands of the company.  I am very glad the Minister accepted that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the general thrust of the amendment.  If the board are going to push for an expansion of work and services in this area there is no doubt in my mind that they will come up against vested interests.  Removing the Minister's consent from this section will ease the burden on the Minister in the future because he cannot be got at.  I know from discussions with the board that they have ambitions for development, particularly to use the very small and inexpensive computers available in sub-post office for a whole range of services, some of which have already been mentioned by Deputy Layden; and there are others, such as the payment of social welfare benefits, the withdrawal of money on demand from savings accounts and so on.  When that stage of development is reached it will be well if as few shackles as possible are on the board and if access to the Minister to inhibit development is denied.  That is why I am in full support of the thrust of the suggested amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this development because if there is to be expansion in the Post Office it will have to be at the counter.  Deputy Wilson mentioned that there could be opposition from vested interest and that the Minister could be subject to pressure, but the Post Office is unique in this respect.  They do not have the overheads of many other institutions, financial institutions in particular. The Post Office can provide a <Col N="1706" /> service in the smallest village, and this resource will provide very necessary revenue for the new companies.  The scope is limitless.  The Post Office could act as an agent for other State agencies, Government Departments, the ESB, CIE and so on.  These amendments will go a long way to ensuring that this will happen and I welcome them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 29a:</P>
      <P>In page 13, before section 13, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;13.  &mdash; The postal company shall not have the power to close a sub post office without first giving public <Col N="1707" /> notice two months in advance by means of public advertisement in local newspapers in circulation in the area involved and public notices in the sub post office involved and head post office.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The reason I am proposing this amendment is that I want to ensure as far as possible security of tenure for the over 2,000 sub-offices spread throughout the State.  I want to ensure that no action is taken to close one of those offices. Postmasters in sub-offices are providing a very good service throughout the country and in many areas they are practically subsidising the State.  They provide tremendous assistance for old people applying for and collecting their pensions. They are the pillars of society.  I would not want to see a situation where a sub-office could be closed by any board.  I would be anxious that before any such decision was taken people would have an opportunity to place objections and that those objections would be sustained and that the Minister would then be involved.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to give an assurance to the House now that he does not envisage any such closures.  I am opposed to any office being closed.  In my constituency the service provided by the sub-offices is second to none.  I had the honour as Minister of State to visit sub-offices, particularly in my constituency, and I admired the high standards and efficiency of all the offices I visited.  They provide a fine service and give much-needed employment in rural areas.  They employ one or two assistants and where there is a manual telephone exchange perhaps two, three or more staff are employed.  Before any move would be made to close an office due notice should be given to the public.  There should be provision made for objections to be lodged well in advance and the Minister at that stage should be given the opportunity to intervene.  There is no better safeguard than for the local Member of the Oireachtas or county councillor to have the opportunity to lobby and to ensure that the office would not be closed <Col N="1708" /> without full consideration.  Postmasters have been providing a service over the years at a very nominal rate.  Many of them are practically subsidising the State.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>One must bear in mind that they provide a building, heat and light, they pay rates on that section of the building and they are not eligible for social welfare payments from the State. Many of them work to a great age and they cannot get a pension from the State while they are operating the sub-post offices.  A total number of 132 sub-offices have an income of £1,762 per annum. That is around £35 a week.  Many people on social welfare would be receiving more than that.  There are 2,068 people involved altogether and of those 219 earn between £1,762 and £2,000 per annum. At between £2,000 and £3,000 per annum there are 487 postmasters and postmistresses. That would be about £60 per week.  Therefore, under the figure of £60 a week there are 800 people.  I know the Minister and the officials will recognise the tremendous service rendered to the State since 1922 by the sub-post office system.  It is a courteous and efficient system.  They help to complete forms for old age pensioners and so on and they do not receive the return which they should receive.  I know that at present there is a case before arbitration to increase the remuneration of postmasters.  I want to ensure that there will be no question of an office closing without a full examination and allowing the public representatives to lobby the board and the chief executive and anybody else in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Minister's own constituency I had the pleasure of working in the by-election last year in the Ballyfermot area and I had the honour of opening a sub-office in Ballyfermot.  Many people do not realise that many of the major offices are so-called sub-offices.  Many of those offices carry out more work for the Department than many of the main offices.  When I was in the Department there were additional payments of children's allowances and they were efficiently <Col N="1709" /> given out by the offices.  I hope the Minister will consider the inclusion of this amendment in the Bill.</P>

      <P>I should like to support Deputy Leyden on this amendment. I did not support an earlier amendment of his because I thought that there was a conflict between the terms of employment of a member of the staff and the sub-postmaster who has a contractual arrangement and I felt you could not cover both in the one amendment.  However, I believe there is an opportunity here to give recognition to the people who have carried out this service down through the years.  As it is tabled it will probably present problems because on occasions it may be necessary to close a post office at very short notice due to some irregularity.  I agree in principle with what Deputy Leyden is trying to ensure.  Where everything has been properly done and work carried out according to regulations I do not think an office should be closed on short notice.  If we are really serious about the expansion of the service a lot will depend on the type of service which will be provided at this level.  For that reason in support of Deputy Leyden I ask the Minister to consider bringing in an amendment on Report Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the amendment tabled by Deputy Leyden I should like to say that there has been a problem. The system of payments may have changed but, at one stage, the postmasters in these offices were paid by the number of transactions done.  When there was a change from the purchase of stamps to the collection of PRSI by the Revenue Commissioners, some of these officers lost remuneration on that account.  This should be taken into consideration. A very heavy volume of work in the small telegraph offices falls upon the personnel, very often a family.  Many of these post offices are waiting for the automation of the telephones in the area, and they are worked to distraction as of now while waiting for the day when automation comes.  They have to provide a service on Sunday mornings and Sunday <Col N="1710" /> evenings, bank holiday mornings and bank holiday evenings, as well as the service throughout the week.</P>
      <P>This amendment being in consideration of them and the work they do should be supported.  I mentioned <i>en passant</i> already that when all this development takes place due precautions will have to be taken.  A considerable sum of money will have to be spent by the new board on security in order to aid them.  There is one point I should like to make <i>apropos</i> this and the precautions proposed in the amendment.  In some areas as towns develop a large percentage of the population is placed in new housing estates. Very often that takes business away from a sub-post office in a more ancient part of the town.  Deputy Leyden's amendment would enable consideration to be given for the actual location of the office to be transferred from the old part of the town, where it had been in the middle of a largish population, and placed in the new housing scheme area.  In my constituency, as the House knows, we have very many little hills.  It is drumlin territory. This is often mentioned in agricultural debates and at Question Time when agriculture is under discussion.  It imposes fairly severe hardship on people who live alone when they get old if they have to climb many hills to get to the post office for their pensions.  Deputy Leyden's amendment will actually give due notice so that concerned citizens &mdash; and I am talking particularly about old citizens &mdash; will have an opportunity to make their own views known, if the post office location is to be changed, where it should be sited.</P>

      <P>I like the principle behind this amendment and I am prepared to accept the principle.  I have a couple of worries about it.  For instance, a very valid point was made by Deputy O'Sullivan.  At the moment there have to be speedy close downs because of irregularities. That has been mentioned.  The second point is that I would not want this to be seen as enabling closures of post offices or almost encouraging them. There is a danger that it could be so construed by some.  The third point is <Col N="1711" /> that, as areas are developing, it may be that the centre of gravity of the population changes and the post office should be moved.  If the Post Office is to be successful it should have the flexibility to move taking into account human considerations. I would not want to hamstring it too much.  I accept the principle of the amendment and I will come back with an amendment on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister.  In putting down the amendment I was conscious of the point made by the Minister that it could be drawing attention to the problem.  I tried to foresee the difficulties which may arise in the future.  I did not want to encourage the company to consider that course of action.  I am a realist. I know the situation which will arise in the company and the pressures which will arise in relation to the subvention for so-called economic services.  The Minister may be given certain options in relation to the subvention he may have to make to the postal board.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the emergency closure of offices which we had to do many times in my term of office.  I do not want a temporary closure to come within the ambit of the amendment.  It should be exempt from that provision.  A permanent closure is different.  The company should not have power to permanently close a sub-office without first giving public notice.  That would cover the point made by the Minister and would give great hope to the sub-postmasters and the unions representing them who made submissions to me.  Before that from my own personal experience and my involvement with the sub-postmasters over the years I had already prepared an amendment.</P>
      <P>I appreciate the viewpoint expressed by the Minister.  This is the right spirit. This is what legislation should be about. If an Opposition Deputy puts forward an idea to the Minister on Committee Stage and if it is acceptable, the Minister should consider it and accept it.  I thank the Minister for his approach to this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1712" /> Amendment, by leave, withdrawn.</P>
    <P Just="Center">SECTION 13.</P>
    <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 13 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This section imposes an obligation on the Post Office to ensure that charges for services are kept at the minimum rates consistent with meeting approved financial targets.  One of the objectives of the new board, as expressed by the board already having studied the matter, is that they should be able to go to business people and make deals with business concerns &mdash; in other words, make a price with business concerns.  If my memory serves me correctly 90 per cent of the traffic is commercial.  Ordinary social writing to Aunt Maria takes up only about 10 per cent of the postal traffic.  Under this section I would hope there would be no inhibition stopping the board from going to large business concerns and making a deal.</P>
      <P>I have been examining the wording of the section.  There is a reference in section 13 (1) (a) providing that charges for services are kept at the minimum rates consistent with meeting approved financial targets.  That is a laudable objective. I presume it does not mean the minimum rates must be uniform rates.  I presume the company will not be inhibited from doing deals provided they are profitable and designed to get the business of industrial and other concerns.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the major difficulties and one of the reasons for the formation of the company is the fact that very competent and highly-skilled staff have very few opportunities of discussing arrangements with people like, for instance, <i>Time</i> magazine.  That concern would have been prepared to enter into arrangements here but the Department were inhibited in entering into any arrangement.  <i>&ldquo;Time&rdquo;</i> is a magazine which circulates widely throughout Europe and there they are given preferential rates because of the very high volume of work generated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Wilson was Minister he <Col N="1713" /> and I introduced a special air mail service to the United States.  That was a great advance and the people in the Department deserve to be congratulated because it worked efficiently and effectively and brought in extra revenue.</P>
    <P>In relation to charges generally, our charges are excessive.  They are necessary to cover the cost of wages, maintenance and overheads.  At the same time the cost of the stamp at 26p is definitely prohibitive. The 22p stamp is also prohibitive. The Department have, of course, to pay their way.  The board will face great difficulty in regard to postal charges and there will certainly have to be a delay before any other increase is provided. After every increase there is a drop in the volume of mail with a consequential drop in revenue.  There was a very large drop after the last major increase.  The cost of the stamp is very high compared with the UK and this has encouraged people to post their letters in Northern Ireland. This is actually illegal and it is wrong for companies to use this particular outlet which results in mail which should be posted here but is actually posted in Northern Ireland having subsequently to be delivered by our employees in Posts and Telegraphs.  The company will have to consider the situation very carefully. I have had conversations with the man who will be appointed chief executive and I know he has some very good ideas for making arrangements with major companies in regard to postal charges at a preferential rate.  I believe that is the only way in which the company can become viable.</P>
    <P>According to the section the company must conduct affairs so as to ensure that charges for services are kept at the mimimum rates consistent with meeting approved financial targets and the revenues are not less than sufficient to meet all charges properly chargeable to revenue account &mdash; including depreciation of assets and proper allocation to general reserve &mdash; taking one year with another, generating a reasonable proportion of capital needs and remunerating capital and repaying borrowings.  That is a very big undertaking and everybody will agree that this is one of the major difficulties <Col N="1714" /> facing the board.  If charges are increased for the purpose of complying with all these provisos the law of diminishing returns will enter in and the volume of mail will drop.  In the United States the cost of first-class mail is roughly 20 cents. There they have reached such an advanced state they can actually allow for a three year interim before there is another increase.  Businesses are assured that postal costs will not increase and that means businesses are in a position to negotiate special terms.  Businesses know exactly where they stand and the company has an incentive to provide an economic postal service.</P>
    <P>In our Department of Posts and Telegraphs officials are restricted.  I believe they have been unfairly blamed for the high postal charges because legislation prohibited them making arrangements which would redound to the advantage of the Department.  Parcel post is another area where difficulty arises.  Here the Department are in competition with CIE and with the courier services.  I hold no brief for the courier services.  The Department provide a service door to door throughout the entire country and I approve of that.  That is why I resent the courier service because they operate in large areas of population such as Dublin, Cork, Galway, Limerick, Sligo, Waterford, Wexford and so on.  I have heard that they utilise elderly people who have free transport to bring mail to various locations.  This is undermining the operations of the Department.  I object to the courier service in Dublin coming here to this House and to the GPO delivering mail.  That is neither right nor proper. The Department are not in a position to provide a guaranteed delivery service of a courier type.</P>
    <P>It would be very easy for the Department to provide an express service at special rates in the city to compete with the courier service and I have no doubt that the company, when formed, will investigate the possibilities of competing directly with courier services.  I would encourage that and I know the chief executive and the board members are very conscious of this.  The courier services who are creaming off the lucrative <Col N="1715" /> city market will now have decent competition from the Department.  Up to now the Minister was restricted in allowing the development of a courier service. Under this Bill that will be remedied because we have the facilities, personnel and a guaranteed delivery system: anybody can entrust mail to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  As Deputy Kelly said, there may be slight delays but 95 per cent of letters are delivered within a day.  Furthermore, you would never have a situation where letters were left in a derelict building with those responsible for them absconding leaving the mail to be delivered by the sound workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs who delivered it at a very nominal rate.</P>
    <P>This section will impose certain constraints on the company but the type of management and personnel in An Bord Poist should be able to bring about major changes.  The Department had the will, personnel, brains and intelligence but they were restricted by legislation from developing.  I am sure all the personnel who are being transferred to the new company will have a great opportunity and incentive to compete with the couriers and provide an efficient, effective service.  There should be no increases for some years because of inflation because at present there is not much incentive for businesses to use the postal service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points so well made by Deputy Wilson and Deputy Leyden about the need for flexibility in the rates of charges and methods of operation of An Bord Poist.  I particularly draw the Minister's attention to the difficulties of the printing industry where the Post Office are restricted to specific charges for everyone and cannot make an arrangement or deal with that industry. As a result they have lost a considerable amount of trade in the past year, some of which was quite lucrative and very important for the workers in the printing industry here.  One firm had a contract in California which had previously been supplied by a firm in New York.  The printing company here were able to do it more efficiently until postal <Col N="1716" /> charges got too high.  If this section is used in the manner which has been suggested, giving flexibility in relation to charges and special rates and taking into consideration the volume of work and trade that goes through the Post Office, they could make a special deal for charges to a particular company.  The Minister should look at the printing industry because arrangements can be made whereby the revenue of the Post Office would be increased and the printing industry would be helped enormously, both in the export trade and in employment.</P>
      <P>I fully endorse the remarks in relation to courier services.  There is a great need to give maximum flexibility and authority to use the best possible methods in every area, to be competitive and to do the job without any restrictions.  That is very important and I hope the Bill will operate in the area of rates of charges also.</P>

      <P>The conflict between the couriers and the Post Office has been well discussed and the reasons given for and against them.  However, the Bill has not clarified the position regarding transmission of electronic mail and the teleprinter service.  Traditionally, these have gone to the Post Office and should remain with them.  There is a very minute but important definition absent from the Bill: what constitutes a letter?  It may seem unimportant but there will be legal arguments about what a letter is.  Is it something up to a certain weight?  A figure of 500 grammes has been suggested and discussed at departmental level, but this will have to be clarified before the Bill is passed.</P>
      <P>If these matters are not resolved we will have conflict from the very start between the two bodies and this House should be very clear as to who has responsibility.</P>

      <P>I agree with most of what has been said.  We are placing on An Bord Poist the responsibility of providing an efficient service and they must be given an opportunity of doing this in the best possible way.  Flexibility is a must <Col N="1717" /> if they are to succeed in their objective of providing a top-class service.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Leyden said, the Department have shown the direction in one area of their operations but the possibilities which are now available to this company are exceptional and the board should be given every possible freedom to develop these services.  The survey which was carried out over a number of years in relation to the postal service recommended a considerable number of new operations which the Post Office could take under their aegis and, if they are given the flexibility, there is no doubt that they will be a success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with what Deputy Leyden said.  I insisted that there should be no postal charge increases this year, which is the first time for years that this has happened.  I hope that a policy of price stability in the postal and telecommunications areas will be possible.  It is in that way that one increases volume of business.  Volume and new business are the answer to the Post Office problem. When one compares the volume <i>per capita</i>&mdash; items of post per head of population carried through the year &mdash; our volume <i>per capita</i> is less than half that of the UK and one-third that of places like Sweden. Price is very important and, as Deputy Leyden said, this is a very price sensitive commodity.  When the price goes up there is an immediate drop-off and it takes quite a while to recover.  I am glad to be able to say that our policy this year is working: volume is up and revenue is keeping pace with the projection.  There is still, however, much room for improvement.</P>
      <P>If a postman has to make his way to a house to deliver one letter the revenue on that is 26p and I do not know what the average cost is.  If he delivers ten letters the revenue is £2.60, so volume is extremely important.  If we keep the price down we can get the volume up.  That is essential in order to pay future pay increases.</P>
      <P>An Bord Poist have many new ideas. This year we will introduce new areas, guaranteed delivery services, express services in Dublin and Cork, Faxpost.</P>

In the past few years we have had an increase and in some years two increases.</P>

    <P>I do not think there should be any problem about accepting that.  It should not rule out any amendments on the remaining sections, which were (a) and (b) but in the new version will be (b) and (c). Amendment No. 31 is exactly the same as the one we had down in regard to An Bord Poist, so the arguments for it are exactly the same.  There is no point in going over those arguments again.  The point was made about &ldquo;reasonably practicable <Col N="1721" /> and satisfy all reasonable demands&rdquo;.  We were dissatisfied with that and felt the version we put down was more solid and definite.  In regard to An Bord Poist the Minister agreed that he would have a look at it on Report Stage.

      <P>The wording of the amendment is slightly misleading.  I know the word &ldquo;insert&rdquo; is used but it changes the following section to (b) and (c).  We could argue that the Minister's section may not be comprehensive enough to eliminate the need for an insertion.  My amendment would meet the Minister's amendment (a) and also incorporate the new (b).  The amendment I put forward the last time was comprehensive enough to incorporate the Minister's first principle as far as the postal service is required &ldquo;to provide a national postal service within the State and between the State and places outside the State&rdquo;.  My amendment adequately catered for the Minister's amendment and the amendment I put in at that time.  The same applies to this section.  I have no objection to the Minister's amendment, which is a general insertion of a new section in the Bill and gives a definition of the overall service which the telecommunications service will provide while retaining (a) and (b). Perhaps there was some misunderstanding between us on the last occasion when there was a possibility that (a) would be eliminated and replaced by the Minister's new (a) but I now accept the fact that the Minister's new insertion will be 14 (a) and the following 14 (b) will be retained and 14 (b) will become 14 (c).</P>
      <P>I include the word &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;.  One could argue that the word &ldquo;social&rdquo; would fit the Bill, but I suggested &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;. That is the only difference between the two amendments.  Amendment No. 31 (a) is the same as amendment No. 31 (b) except for the word &ldquo;domestic&rdquo;.</P>

The Minister's amendment states: &ldquo;... within the State and between the State <Col N="1722" /> and places outside the State&rdquo;.  That is a more acceptable form of words.  I am open to correction on this, but if we accept Deputy Leyden's version we will restrict the activities of the telecommunications board to within the State.  We would open the door to privatisation for areas outside the State.  Reference was made earlier to international communications and the IBM company were mentioned. This is an area where such a company could legitimately become involved unless we accept the Minister's amendment. The Deputy's amendment would restrict the activity of the board somewhat.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister's amendment clarifies the overall telecommunications side.  The way it is put in is slightly misleading and could give rise to an error in the approach to the section. I am glad the Minister has confirmed that he will continue to include the other sections in that section.  I used the word &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; so that it would provide a domestic service, that is, a home to home as opposed to a business service.</P>
      <P>The service has given rise to considerable complaint.  Accounts give rise to grave disquiet among subscribers.  As a subscriber I have queried my account many times.  There is little one can do to question the automatic telephone service.  This is an area where there is great dissatisfaction.  It is not only the difficulty one has in getting phone calls but the difficulty with the account.  I have come across some extraordinary cases.</P>
      <P>There is public dissatisfaction with the service.  In many areas there is genuinely a bad service.  In manual exchange areas there is an unacceptable situation.  This Minister and former Ministers were dissatisfied with the service and that is why we had an accelerated investment programme. That programme will end in 1984.  The service is not up to the standard we had planned and hoped for from 1980 onwards.  With all the investment in communications equipment we still do not have a satisfactory telephone service.  An Bord Telecom will be given responsibility to ensure that the service is brought up to the highest possible standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1723" /> In relation to telephone accounts, as the Minister is aware an organisation was set up to protect consumers.  Many people joined that organisation.  The Minister of State mentioned recently that there were about 200 disputed accounts. I would give the number as approximately 20,000 disputed accounts.  The Minister may be able to elaborate on that.  I have come across enormously complicated problems in this area and I am sure the Minister will tell us that he has received numerous representations from frustrated subscribers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Again this evening I am asking the Minister and the Minister of State to realise that unless greater <Col N="1724" /> emphasis is placed on the private enterprise element of his proposed Bill we will have what I would term muzzled television and radio coverage and that would be very undesirable.  The Minister should give serious consideration to conducting an up-dated survey on radio listening and on television viewing together with details of the age groups for each provincial region.  Such a survey is needed urgently to help us put the situation into some perspective.  There has emanated from the Government benches the definite attitude that the commercial input is to be frowned on, that it is to be regarded in some way with derision that anyone would hope to put forward an enterprise that would derive profits or create jobs from initiative of that kind.</P>
      <P>It is important that the Minister consider the safeguarding of the existing jobs in our national radio and television network and that he should do this by way of allowing healthy competition from private enterprise.  First, though, we must conduct a survey that would leave us with some focal point on which to base our arguments.  Deputy Leyden has made a forceful case for a dovetailing of the local radio and television networks coupled with the commercial aspect.  The track record in this area in England has proved the case.  Regardless of whether we agree with the situation, a survey here on programme popularity would probably reveal that &ldquo;Coronation Street&rdquo; is the most viewed programme.  There has developed the hideous situation in which night after night many English programmes are watched in Ireland while at the same time we are not allowing to evolve here a type of new venture.  The pirate radio stations have proved the point that young people are prepared to turn away from television viewing, a development that many parents welcome because at least while listening to radio one has the opportunity of doing some work also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason for the flourishing of the local radio stations is the very good quality of their FM and stereo outlet.  I wonder if the Minister is in the habit of listening to these stations, to Radio Nova, Radio Sunshine or any of these <Col N="1725" /> commercial stations.  I listen to them on my car stereo unit.  They are very good, so perhaps it would be an excellent idea if the Minister would listen to them, too. They provide very restful entertainment on long journeys particularly.</P>
    <P>There is this begrudging attitude that seems to militate against private incentive. English products are promoted flagrantly on many Irish programmes but at a time when our balance of payments situation is under immense pressure as a result of the indiscriminate importation of foodstuffs and of all sorts of goods, a very forcible case can be made to encourage Irish radio and television stations to promote our products.  Why not call on the people involved in radio and television to promote directly the sale of Irish goods?  I am anticipating the age-old answer about infringing regulations and so on but if we have regard to the techniques that are used by some of our continental counterparts in promoting the sale of their nationally produced goods, we will realise the scope we have in this area.  The two pirate stations to which I have referred are engaged in the direct promotion of Irish goods as one will realise if one listens to them for a period of time.</P>
    <P>There is the question also of the employment content.  The more radio and television competition there is, the more jobs will be created not only for those who are fortunate enough to act as commentators on the networks but also for those who work in the background and so on.  The Minister of State has the advantage of having worked in television. He will realise the huge number of people who are involved in the production of a programme.  It is startling to realise that in some of the pirate stations there are from 50 to 75 people or even more employed round the clock.  That is a factor that should be taken into consideration.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some comment about phasing out the pirate stations rather than closing them down.</P>

      <P>It was changed in the script.  If it is the Minister's intention to phase them out I suggest that the Minister create machinery whereby they could apply for licences and not be put into oblivion.  This will cause a tremendous void in the whole area of broadcasting. From the Dublin point of view the vast listenership is weighted towards the pirate stations.  RTE 2 and Radio 2 have pulled up their socks and improved dramatically and this should be recognised. I would point out that newspapers use advertising on radio and television to their advantage to sell newspapers.  That is right because their competition is directed against English newspapers.  We all know the slogans such as &ldquo;the Herald has it&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Changing Times&rdquo; and so on.  Advertising like that encourages people to buy an Irish newspaper but I wonder what effect this Bill will have on provincial newspapers who depend on local advertising just to keep them going. We cannot expect provincial papers to survive just from their circulation.</P>

      <P>Thank you.  A lot of local and provincial newspapers will be under direct threat if the scheme as presented is followed through.  A lot of the stations beam right across the country. Many people have made the point that people living in isolated rural areas are being deprived of local radio.  That argument can be very shortsighted because people living in such areas generally want to be informed of the national situation. We are not being totally honest about this matter when we say that people are being deprived of local radio.  It is a pipe dream that is being foisted on people in the country and there might not be a need or a demand for it.  I would earnestly urge the Minister to conduct a survey.  The Minister with his television background would be expert at that.  It is something that should be published&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise there is a time limit to this debate and I will not detain the House unduly.  I support the amendment in the name of the Minister of State on the grounds that the Bill before us is concerned almost solely with the establishment of local broadcasting stations on a commercial basis.  This commercial basis is totally unsatisfactory and no provision is made for community-orientated services.  I am completely satisfied that the Minister is serious in his intention to bring legislation before the House probably after the Summer Recess, to legislate for the orderly development of local community services.  If Fianna Fáil were really sincere in their desire to grapple effectively with the spiralling of illegal broadcasting stations, they had ample time to do so in recent years.  They failed to take action and their inaction can be said to have condoned to a large extent the continuation of these illegal stations. A feeble effort was made by Fianna Fáil to introduce a Bill which died on the dissolution of this House, but there was no attempt to reintroduce that Bill when the opportunity afforded itself to the Fianna Fáil Government.  This new Bill is very much like the old Bill.  It has not changed its substance, character and principles and still displays a callous disregard for the survival of the small community stations down the country.  It still panders to commercial interest.  In a situation where it has been said that those who control local radio and television were virtually being granted a licence to print their own money, this is a serious problem for this House.  The House must intervene to see to it that local radio stations are given a fair chance of survival in this battle with the speculators.  Real democratic community radio cannot survive unless the Minister comes to their rescue and sees to it that the vested interests in this area do not prevail.  If anyone is in any doubt about the real intentions of the Fianna Fáil Bill then and now, one <Col N="1728" /> need only refer to the editorial in the <i>Irish Press</i> of 4 May 1983 which stated:</P>
      <P>The Fianna Fáil Bill of 1981 which fell with that Government, proposed a system of local broadcasting in which commercial interests would probably have dominated and in which the profit motive would likely have been the prime one.</P>
      <P>That is still the intention behind this Bill and consequently it has to be opposed.  I am voicing the sentiments of a rural Deputy on this issue because local community radio has an important role to play in our community.  It has become widely accepted by the people that there is a universal desire that it should continue to operate, that it serves a wide need and that it can knit the community together and prove most beneficial to community needs, in giving sheer entertainment as well as educational and cultural value.  It is also valuable in the dissemination of news and views appertaining to the lives of the people in the area.  Local community radio properly organised on the basis the Minister has in mind can be objective and impartial in the presentation of news and views. I believe moreover that a monopoly by vested interests cannot be relied upon to give fair play in this rather delicate area. They can and do discriminate and misrepresent and all of us in public life are particularly vulnerable to such treatment and are bound to be conscious of it at times.  We ask no kudos in public life, merely fair play and the presentation of the role we play in a fair manner.  The more we extend this important medium of local radio the better chance there will be of a fair presentation of the views of our people.  This is a very important principle. There is a better chance of our people being fully informed in respect of local current affairs and the news and views affecting their interests without prejudice to party or to personalities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is dangerous in this area.  It proposes the establishment of a broadcasting authority of some eight to 12 members to be appointed by the Government or the Minister of the day.  I would <Col N="1729" /> be fearful of the implications of vesting such power in a Minister of the calibre of Deputy Leyden if his party were in Government and had the power to impose their designs on the people.  I have already adverted to the fact that the Bill is orientated towards commercial interest to the utter detriment of local community interests.  We had a fair indication of the thinking of Deputy Leyden when in presenting his Bill he stated.</P>
    <P>It is only right that the State would exercise a certain control over the stations and that they would do so in consultation with the Minister.  We propose that the programme contracts be for a maximum of five years which would be renewable in most cases if the stations were providing a good service.</P>
    <P>Doubtless Deputy Leyden in his potential capacity as a Minister would decide whether a station was good or bad primarily on the basis of its political content or lack of it, and if those operating it did not behave properly he could and would punish them by refusing to renew the licence at the end of five years.</P>
    <P>The political clout in the Fianna Fáil Bill was further emphasised when Deputy Leyden went on to state:</P>
    <P>We propose that advertisements directed towards religious or political ends or dealing with industrial disputes would have to be gauged carefully and not necessarily be part of the broadcasting material.  I would imagine that the word &ldquo;advertisements&rdquo; would have a very broad meaning in the mind of the Deputy; he may contradict me if I am wrong.  It is difficult to understand why a Minister would conceive of controlling, censoring or prohibiting the broadcasting of religious material but those of us who do not share the political views of such a Minister would have to watch out.  Big Daddy is watching over us and the threat is there for all to see, the threat that if we do not conform we will be punished.  That is a dangerous aspect of this Bill which I totally reject.  I also advise my colleagues to take careful note of what the <Col N="1730" /> Deputy said regarding the reporting of strikes.  All these are ominous signs and those of us who value freedom of speech and the freedom of the press should take careful note.</P>
    <P>I am, therefore, proud and happy that we have in this House a man of the calibre of Deputy Ted Nealon, Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, who has particular responsibility for this vital area of local radio broadcasting. I am completely satisfied that he will bring before us, probably before the end of this year, a measure to deal with this matter.  He will do so fairly and responsibly and I am convinced he will give the Irish people what they want and not what the vested interests are clamouring for.  He has the integrity, courage and determination to stand up to those powerful vested interests.</P>
    <P>I look forward to having legislation enacted which will give us radio services which are genuinely local in character, reflecting local life, achievements and aspirations and uplifting and ennobling the lives of our people.  These services will give us objectivity and impartiality in the dissemination of views and news.  To suggest that these community stations should be run otherwise is wrong.  There must be proper community involvement at all times and commercial considerations and vested interests should not be allowed to dominate or interfere unduly with the operations of these stations.  I believe that the Minister of State will conform with this concept and that he is in tune with the needs of our people and worthy of our support.</P>
    <P>I want to see justice done to the people of rural Ireland in any legislation of this kind.  Listening to this debate one would imagine that the only places that counted were Dublin or the larger cities.  There are two radio stations operating in my constituency, Tipperary Community Radio in Tipperary town and CBC Radio in Clonmel.  The former is under the control of Muintir na Tire and I need hardly say more.  In respect of its operations and conduct and the community effort made by it, it is a model of what a community radio station should be.  I would hold it up to the House and the nation as an <Col N="1731" /> example <i>par excellence</i> of what local community radio can and should be.  It is in conformity with the Minister's intentions and with the spirit of the founder of that great national organisation, the late Canon Hayes.  It reflects all that is good and noble in the lives of the people in Tipperary.  I have no doubt that when the Minister brings in his legislation he will remember the intrinsic worth of Tipperary radio and ensure that its future and development are fully safeguarded.</P>
    <P>Likewise CBC radio in Clonmel has developed over the years and those who operate the station have gained valuable experience.  It provides an excellent mix of programmes which is much appreciated and most popular.  It is now an integral part of the life of our town.  In its present form it might be regarded as a commercial enterprise but the Minister has been told at first hand by the directors that they are prepared to make any necessary changes and take all appropriate steps to conform to the Minister's legislation and the true principles of local community radio.  Therefore, the idealism of these young people who run these stations on a voluntary basis must be appreciated and applauded, acknowledged and supported in any legislation that will come before the House.</P>

      <P>There is a time limit to this debate.  The involvement of our local people in local radio has brought out local talents hitherto unknown and untapped. Without this opportunity to become involved in local radio they would have had no chance ever to become associated with the media.  Their chances in that regard are very restricted.  They love their work and become experts, gaining knowledge and experience.  They do the work voluntarily, unselfishly and proudly on behalf of their community and it would <Col N="1732" /> be a tragedy to impede, stultify or destroy such enthusiasm and idealism, so rare in our time.  None of them wants to be regarded as a law breaker.  These young people want to conform to the law, but most of all they want this sorry mess cleaned up and proper regulations put into operation as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in the proposed legislation I hope the Minister will see to it that the future existence and development of Tipperary Community Radio and Clonmel CBC Radio will be fully safeguarded. They will conform to the rules, they have a right to exist and it is the duty of the State to stimulate, co-ordinate and help their efforts.  I am completely satisfied that they will prove worthy of the confidence of the Minister and the House when the legislation is being enacted.</P>
      <P>In a Bill of this kind there is no room for small-mindedness or petty selfish thinking.  This should not be a device for making money.  We have an obligation to legislate for and on behalf of the people and we must not shut our eyes to what is happening all around us in the world. Radio broadcasting of a local nature has come to stay and TV available locally is on the way and will be a reality long before many people think.  There is little we can do to black out satellites in the sky and therefore television will be available to all of us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree thoroughly with the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, that in the near future there will be major advances in the availability of television services, from satellites and through cable.  It is safe to predict that in five years viewers in Ireland will have about five satellite stations to choose from in addition to those available.  They will be able to receive these communally through cable systems or through a simple antenna dish.  It will not be even necessary to put the dish on a chimney.  The Minister has told us that there will be major developments in cable TV but this may not develop as quickly as satellite television.  Inevitably there will be developments, as in the United States and Canada, where local cable television systems carry as many as 30 or 40 channels.  Therefore, it would be invidious <Col N="1733" /> of any of us to attempt to put the clock back.</P>
    <P>I look forward with confidence to the introduction of the Minister's Bill which, I hope, will meet the needs of our people and give us exactly what we want in respect of community radio, and community television when the time comes. We have here a noble concept in the mind of Deputy Nealon.</P>

      <P>I am pleased at the opportunity to speak against this hastily prepared and ill-conceived Opposition Bill, which purports to provide the framework for local radio and local television services by the end of June.  Being a rural Deputy I feel I can speak for the community groups around the country that look to this House to provide the legislation which will allow them to set up and take part in local broadcasting for the community by the community.</P>
      <P>I would like to put it on the record of the House again that nowhere in the Opposition Bill is there the slightest ray of hope for those community groups.  Let us examine briefly this particular aspect of Deputy Leyden's Bill.  Section 17 (3) of the Bill clearly states that the Authority</P>
      <P>shall not establish a broadcasting station in an area unless the Authority is satisfied that the establishment of a local broadcasting service in such area would be in accordance with good economic principles.</P>
      <P>Let there be no mistake that this piece of legislation would discourage the proposed Authority from setting up stations in areas where the monetary return is not assured.  I would go further and say that it prevents the Authority from so doing. Where, may I ask, is the social aspect to this legislation?  Where are the needs and tastes of small communities in the west of Ireland catered for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill must be seen for what it is: a cynical attempt at political opportunism at the expense of community groups.  It is pandering to the big city commercial &ldquo;fast buck&rdquo;, fly-by-night companies, who are set to grab the profits and run.  Even <Col N="1734" /> Deputy Leyden makes no attempt to hide this.  In his speech introducing the Bill he says, and I quote, &ldquo;If there is no commercial aspect to broadcasting it would be difficult for any station to survive in the long term&rdquo;.  I believe he has not taken account of the initiative and ability of local groups to work hard and co-operate towards making local radio stations work in areas which would not meet the Opposition's criteria of &ldquo;good economic principles&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This Bill is almost identical to that which was prepared in the period between 1979 and 1981.  As Deputy Nealon mentioned in his speech on this debate, a recent <i>Irish Press</i> editorial referred to the Bill as &ldquo;a system of local broadcasting in which commercial interests would probably have dominated, and in which the profit motive would likely have been the prime one&rdquo;.  There have been many other comments also on the Bill which was published in 1981.</P>

      <P>Gael Linn, for example commissioned a report on the Future of Irish Local Radio.  The authors of this report, both of whom have considerable experience of British broadcasting, considered that the 1981 Bill &ldquo;was but a very diluted version of the British Broadcasting Authority Act, 1973, showing virtually no originality or even an appreciation of such progress as was made in British experience and thinking and as expressed in their 1980 amending Act&rdquo;. The same report criticised the 1981 Bill for failing to show a developed sense of the diversity of what was already happening on the ground, or a competent grasp of the British model on which it was loosely based.  While I would not necessarily accept without reservation the views expressed in the Gael Linn <Col N="1735" /> document, I think these comments are of particular interest.</P>
      <P>All of the local radio stations operating under the Independent Broadcasting Authority in Britain are commercial stations. There are now almost 50 of these stations and each one of them exists in order to make a profit from its advertising revenue.  In general these local stations need a minimum population coverage of about 200,000 in order to generate advertising revenue.  In fact, many of the stations are not making profits at present. So the British model to which the Opposition have turned for so much inspiration is purely commercial.</P>
      <P>True local radio must have a major local community involvement.  The possibility of developing a structure in which the compulsion to make profits for shareholders is absent is worth exploring.  An approach on these lines would undoubtedly facilitate programming which would appeal to small audiences and meet the social needs of minorities in the community.</P>
      <P>The financing of local radio is fundamental to any debate on the subject.  The private enterprise lobby argues that independent local radio should not cost the Exchequer or the television licence payer anything; rather would the service be financed from advertising.  This is an over-simplification.  The argument stands up in the British environment, where the BBC are financed solely from television licence fees, and independent local radio solely from advertising.  Here RTE depend on advertising for approximately 50 per cent of their revenue.  The creation of new advertising media would then clearly have implications for RTE and, consequently, for the level of the television licence fee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Opposition have offered no comments at all on the implications for RTE of independent local broadcasting services provided under their Bill.  This is a most serious omission.  How can the national broadcasting service be so completely ignored when legislation proposing a totally new system of broadcasting is proposed?  RTE at present provide three national radio channels, including <Col N="1736" /> Radio na Gaeltachta.  New independent services must clearly have some effect on the existing networks.  It would have been reasonable to expect the promoters of this Bill to offer some comment on that aspect, but they have not done so.</P>
    <P>Another aspect which the Opposition have ignored in putting forward this Bill is the extent to which local radio services could be provided under it in areas throughout the country.  This omission may, of course, have been deliberate because they realise that the commercial principles which are so much a part of this Bill will not allow for widespread local radio services.</P>
    <P>Any legislation which does not allow different areas of the country to have equal access to public services is bad legislation. The Opposition Bill makes a point of describing the local broadcasting services provided under it as public services.  But if the services can only pay their way in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and the Authority cannot provide services anywhere else, what about the public in Galway or in Deputy Leyden's own area of Roscommon?</P>

      <P>I am coming to that later.  Broadcasting legislation should facilitate the provision of services in every area of the country, not set out to limit the availability of those services. The Opposition Bill provides for Exchequer funding of up to £10 million for services.  Why should the people of Donegal or Longford or Kerry have to provide those funds so that Dublin, Cork and Limerick can have more radio services?.</P>
      <P>This Bill does nothing to resolve the problem resulting from the existence of illegal radio stations in practically every county in Ireland.  It ignores the interest which is clearly there for local radio services throughout the country and instead concentrates on commercial local radio, which of its nature can only be viable in large cities.  That is not a satisfactory approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like now to turn my attention to Deputy Liam Fitzgerald's contribution <Col N="1737" /> in support of this Bill in the House last week.  The main thrust of his argument was to &ldquo;knock&rdquo; RTE and by comparison praise the services being provided by the pirate stations.  Deputy Fitzgerald, of course neglected to place on record some facts before he began to compare RTE and the pirate stations.  For instance he neglected to point out that RTE have to pay their staff a proper living wage, they have to pay royalties for music material used on their programmes, pay for their news coverage, and so on.  The pirates, by comparison pay very poor wages to their staff in return for long hours, with no security, while the bosses cream off the profits.</P>
    <P>If the Deputies opposite feel that the semi-State structures of RTE are out of tune with changing circumstances, then perhaps they might be reminded that the level of income on which RTE were compelled to survive was also out of line with changing circumstances.  The livelihood of the national broadcasting service comes from advertising and revenue collected through television licence fees. From December 1980, when they granted an 18 per cent increase in licence fees, until April 1983, when the present Government had a chance to rectify things, RTE were slowly being starved of finance.  Deputy Leyden opposite watches for every opportunity to accuse my colleague, the Minister of State Deputy Nealon, of muzzling RTE.  TO my mind, the gradual strangulation of RTE by refusing them finance to operate services was a much more serious threat to the freedom of the national broadcasting organisation.</P>
    <P>What better way to influence broadcasters than to starve them into submission? In the Opposition's period in Government RTE were being squeezed from two sides.  On the one hand, they were being beggared by refusing them a licence fee increase, and on the other hand, pirate stations were allowed the freedom of the air.  Some of these pirate stations are now being held up as shining examples of all that is good in Irish broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I read with interest Deputy Leyden's reference to the amount of time a Fianna <Col N="1738" /> Fáil committee gave to preparing this legislation.  Indeed, it speaks volumes for Fianna Fáil committees if the result of their considerable efforts produces the erasure of the word &ldquo;sound&rdquo; from the 1981 Local Radio Bill, and one additional sentence consisting of 14 words.  The Opposition's belated haste in producing this Bill and their assertion that local stations will be operational by the end of June are noteworthy.  This latter claim, of course, is not realistic and the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, has given the lie to it in no uncertain terms.  By rushing ahead and not giving the concept of local radio the attention it deserves, by setting over-hasty deadlines, the Bill is giving the advantage to the private interest groups already broadcasting illegally or at work preparing their applications and proposals.  Again community groups and community interests will be sufferers. There is no doubt in my mind that one effect of rushing forward the Bill is to cover illegal broadcasting stations with the cloak of legitimacy.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have skipped very quickly over any reference they have made to the very serious problems which pirate radio stations have caused.  They have concentrated instead on what they see as the good points of pirate radio.  I know that some of the present stations have some good points.  But it is difficult to balance those against the very severe problem which some of them have caused to very important radio frequencies.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of these problems have already been detailed by my colleagues the Minister of State and the Minister in this debate.  I regret to have to say that yet another extremely dangerous problem has come to light.</P>
    <P>Sunshine Radio returned to the air last weekend after losing the High Court case which it took against the Minister.  Within hours of its resuming broadcasting it was causing severe interference to an international distress and calling frequency. This frequency at 500KHz is used internationally by ships to transmit distress calls.  Ships are required to keep a constant watch on this frequency so that an early alarm can be raised in the event of an emergency at sea.  The interference in <Col N="1739" /> this case almost certainly covered the whole of Dublin Bay and possibly far beyond.  Sunshine Radio was positively identified as the source of the interference.</P>
    <P>In view of the use of Dublin Bay by passenger and car ferries and other sea traffic the consequences of an unnoticed distress call take on frightening proportions. When the interference was brought to the attention of Sunshine Radio they were unaware of it.  The station operators were informed that the only way to ensure that this interference ceased was for the station to close down.  They did then close down their medium wave transmitter but they continue to broadcast on VHF.  I need hardly say that problems of this nature cannot be allowed to recur.</P>
    <P>The provisions of section 18 of the Bill would be quite inappropriate for local television services.  This section requires local broadcasting services to maintain high standards in all respects, to offer a broad range of news, information and entertainment consistent with the local character of the service, to require different stations not to broadcast identical or similar material to an extent inconsistent with the local character of services and to utilise to the greatest possible extent Irish produced, recorded, published and performed material.  Such provisions, while being perhaps appropriate for radio services, take no account of the cost of television services.  How could any local television service afford a range of programming on those lines?  Ulster television and BBC Northern Ireland produce significantly less than 10 per cent of their total programming locally; all of the rest of their programming is taken from the UK national networks or is imported. Where would all the local television programming come from here to enable the Authority to fulfil the obligations placed upon it by section 18 of this Bill?  In effect the provisions in the Bill would be unworkable in relation to local television services.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden, in the course of his speech, referred to the problem of the deflector or rebroadcasting systems being <Col N="1740" /> used in certain parts of the country to re-broadcast BBC and ITV television signals and suggested that this Bill will allow the proposed Authority to investigate the situation regarding these broadcasting stations and provide an opportunity for licensing.  Once again the Deputy shows an extraordinary lack of understanding of the provisions in his own Bill, this despite apparently months of work.  The Authority would have no power to license anything.  The Opposition suggest that the problems associated with what are called deflectors can be resolved by their Bill.  I am sure that they are well aware that this is not the case.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson, when he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, made clear the serious problems associated with licensing rebroadcasting stations.  One major problem is that rebroadcasting of British television signals would require, under Irish copyright law, the agreement of the broadcasting Authorities concerned. Those Authorities have repeatedly made clear their interest in reserving that copyright. I am not aware of any country in Europe which has succeeded in reaching agreement for the wholesale rebroadcasting of foreign television signals.  I wonder what magical powers the Authority proposed under this Bill will possess bearing in mind that attempts which have been made at the highest level here and attempts elsewhere to reach such agreements have given rise to enormously complex and difficult problems and have come to nought.</P>
    <P>It has been claimed that various copyright problems will have to be resolved in any event with the development of satellite television services.  Satellite services will undoubtedly be available to viewers throughout this country within a matter of years.  The satellite services will not of themselves solve copyright problems; rather they will avoid them, because viewers will be able to receive foreign signals directly.  The problem at the moment is that they do not receive the signals directly but rather they are rebroadcast.  It is this rebroadcasting which is the main stumbling block in copyright terms.  There is a second constraint on widespread television rebroadcasting. <Col N="1741" /> That is the question of availability of suitable frequencies.  Broadcasting frequencies are allocated under international agreement; the number of frequencies available to this country are not enough for the widespread rebroadcasting of four British television services.  It should also be borne in mind that the continued availability of these signals can never be guaranteed.  It is always open to the British Authorities to alter the technical characteristics of their television transmitter network for domestic reasons.  Any such alteration could effectively wipe out fringe reception of these signals where re-broadcasting systems operate.</P>
    <P>The suggestion by the Opposition that their Bill will allow the licensing of rebroadcasting is therefore entirely misleading. It is in any event ludicrous having regard to the terms of the Bill itself. For example, how could the requirements of objectivity and impartiality in news and current affairs provided for in section 19 of the Bill be met by an Irish Authority in respect of British television services?  How could the Authority ensure that such television services have regard, for example, to Irish cultural traditions or utilise to the greatest possible extent Irish produced, recorded, published and performed material as provided for in section 18.  What would the Broadcasting Complaints Commission do with complaints against British programmes rebroadcast by the Authority. Here again the lack of thought in the hasty introduction of this Bill is self-evident.</P>

      <P>Deputy Reynolds.  The Deputy appreciates that there is a speaker to conclude at 8.15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am glad to get an opportunity to answer some of the outrageous criticisms that I have heard churned out in script after script from the far side of this House.  One would think that they were all saints and scholars on that side and almost forget the great use they made of pirate radio not just in this city but throughout the country at various times when it suited them.  All of a sudden <Col N="1742" /> the finger points in this direction.  Let us be realistic.  As Deputy Nealon said, local radio began to mushroom early in the 1970s.  I am not a man to come in here and start pointing fingers at dates when various Ministers were in Government, but two parties made up a Government from 1973 to 1977 and there was a Fianna Fáil Government in power for the rest of the time.  Divide it any way you like but do not be holier than thou and say that Fianna Fáil did nothing about it.  I am not interested in the past, and young people looking at this House tonight are not interested in hearing us talking about who is responsible for this, that or the other.  They want to see the problems which exist approached rationally and something done about them.  That is what we should be talking about, and not pointing the finger back over the past five or ten years.</P>
      <P>I went into the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in December 1979.  My predecessor, Deputy Faulkner, had a Bill drafted to take care of the various abuses which were beginning to show in the system, and to strengthen the law to deal with them.  There were pirate radios in operation when I went into the Department. I inquired about them.  I asked what we could do about them.  I was advised that the law was defective.  I came back to the Government and we decided that Deputy Faulkner's Bill would be held back until a local radio Bill was produced.  A local radio Bill was put on the stocks in April 1981.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In broad principle that is the same Bill as the one before us here tonight.  Ministers should not talk about political opportunism.  They then took power. They had that Bill and the other Bill in front of them.  From what I could gather from questions in this House to the Minister, Deputy Nealon, their thinking is very little removed from the thinking in this Bill.  It is very easy to change a few sections if the Government do not believe in them.  That is their prerogative as the Government.  They did not do that.  They took the 1979 Bills off the Order Paper and the then Minister said: &ldquo;We will bring in two new Bills&rdquo;.  As the pressure <Col N="1743" /> built up during that period of Coalition Government the 1979 Bill was restored to the Order Paper.  In reply to questions from me the Minister said he was preparing his own Bill.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do why no Bill was proposed.  The then Labour Party in Government would not accept anything but the <i>status quo.</i>  That is why no work was done on the Bill.  That is why nothing was done about it while they were in Government.  Now they come in here and talk about what we did or did not do.  At least I presented the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>That Bill is being misinterpreted to suit their own point of view.  I want to put this on the record of the House.  Somebody asked me what I did while I was in that Department.  I was not there very long, but I had wide-ranging consultations with everybody connected with the business and the people the Bill would affect in local newspapers and others.  Have the Government had any consultations? Have there been consultations with the National Union of Journalists?</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, castigating pirate stations about what they pay or do not pay.  I do not know what they pay.  There are trade unions around this city who will sort out problems like that.  I had discussions with the various interests, community groups, and so on.  There is a clear indication in the Bill that not only does it cater for commercial radio but it caters for community radio as well.  I want to nail that here and now.  The Government side of the House have been trying to put their own interpretation on that, but it is clearly stated for anyone who studies the Bill that community radio and local interests are catered for.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should read the Bill.  &ldquo;Community&rdquo; is spelled c-o-m-m-u-n-i-t-y.  If the Minister cannot recognise the word he should buy a pair of glasses.  If he wants to know what standards are in the Bill perhaps I should <Col N="1744" /> read out a few of them for him to let him know what the Authority would look for before giving out contracts.  Section 18 reads:</P>
      <P>(1)  In performing its functions the Authority shall, as far as possible, ensure that&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  the local broadcasting services provided by it&mdash;</P>
      <P>(i)  maintain high standards in all respects,</P>
      <P>(ii)  are responsive to the varied interests and concerns of the whole community served by each station.</P>
      <P>(iii)  have regard to Irish cultural traditions,</P>
      <P>(iv)  offer a broad range of news, information and entertainment consistent with the local character of the services, and</P>
      <P>(v)  to utilise to the greatest possible extent Irish produced, recorded, published and performed material&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>That is a clear indication to anybody with common sense and logic, any fair-minded person, of what the Authority were supposed to cater for.  Fine Gael and Labour could not get agreement the last time they were in Government to present any Bill to the House.</P>
      <P>The reality tonight is that they will walk up the steps and through the lobby and vote down this Bill.  If this Private Members' Bill achieves nothing more than to make them bring in a Bill to sort out the situation, we will have done a damn good job, and that is what we are here for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I heard various spokesmen on the far side of the House talking about RTE. Have RTE or have they not been catered for in the Bill?  The Minister does not know.  I will tell him.  When the Independent Local Broadcasting Authority are set up they can receive applications from RTE the same as anybody else, if they want to bid for a station.  There is nothing in the Bill to say that there will be only a few radio stations in the country. That is what the Government side <Col N="1745" /> say.  If they carry through that trend of thought in setting up their own independent radio Authority, I will put a big question mark over their independence.  If the Government decide in advance what the independent Authority should decide, the Authority will not be independent. Deputy Leyden and other speakers asked how independent they will be if the Government decide in advance what they will do.  That is not giving them the independence which would be vested in them under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister, Deputy Nealon, talking about 25 to 30 stations.  Perhaps he is right.  Who will pay for them?  I did not miss much of this debate and, to my knowledge, nobody said who will pay for the 25 to 30 stations.  Everybody ignored that.  Deputies on the other side of the House are never slow to ask us who will pay for what we propose.  Under this Bill, RTE will have the same right to apply. The same criteria will be applied by the independent Authority to RTE as to anybody else.  RTE would not be excluded from applying, as the Minister tried to convince everybody they would be.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very good at picking out bits of paper and snippets which suit him.  In April and May 1981 when I published the Bill, I was asked questions about it.  I made it quite clear that RTE could apply if they wished to do so.  There was no question that there would be an all commercial licence printing machine to make money for two or three big people around Dublin.  At the time RTE presented to me&mdash;and I am sure they are on record in the Department&mdash;their ideas about a community radio service.  In many ways they were very good ideas for the production of a satisfactory solution to the local radio demands around the country.  At no time did they put a cost on this.  I referred it back to the RTE Authority to be costed.  Up to the day I left the Department no cost was put on it.  As Minister I would not be responsible for handing out a blank cheque to any semi-State body.  Some of them got blank cheques for far too long.  I do not know whether it was costed afterwards, but there was no way that I would present to <Col N="1746" /> the Government a community radio system which had not a label and cost on it.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a figure in the region of £55 million being spent on radio and television broadcasting.  This is a small country.  This £55 million comes from the taxpayer.  The Government should not try to label us as being anti-RTE. At that time I talked to very good people in RTE.  The best of them would welcome a little competition because it would sharpen their approach.  Competition never killed anybody, and if it did they would have died a lingering death anyway.  This was opening up new opportunities to good people in RTE and giving them the opportunity to move into local radio broadcasting.</P>
    <P>To be quite blunt I do not know what Ministers have in mind over there.  I do not know whether they know themselves. Six weeks ago they were going over to Britain&mdash;and I heard them discuss this tonight&mdash;to see how successful the stations over there are.  Yet we were told last night by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs if we are to believe it&mdash;and in the past few days there was a serious question mark over what you might or might not believe from the lips of that gentleman&mdash;I do not know what he has in mind.  I do not know whether his mind is made up or otherwise but all I do know is&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I let the Minister of State talk for 20 minutes.  I know the truth and I know what happens when the old adrenalin starts to flow.  The Government sit over there now and the focus is on them.  You took peremptory action to close Radio Nova.  I do not know whether the Government decided or who decided to close Radio Nova.  I do not know whether it was the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs who decided but I know that when the odium began to build up the Government began to realise the real feelings of the young and the old who listened to this station and it was then decided the poor old Minister would <Col N="1747" /> carry the blame on his own.  The Government, although collective responsibility is supposed to obtain, passed full responsibility over to the Minister and let him carry the can.</P>
      <P>Now I would be the first who would not tolerate any interference which might endanger life and if the reasons were as valid and as strong as they were alleged to be for the closing of the station, then why let the station go on?  If Radio Nova was the culprit in causing a serious accident a couple of weeks ago what has changed in the interim?  Why is it not closed this evening?  Why was it closed in the first instance?  I will tell the House why.  It was closed in the first instance because, like all the rest of us, I read about a powerful transmitter which was to be built in Butlins and the general impression was they were going to broadcast into the north of England.  I know what happened.  As Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I had experience and I know the BBC complained to the Department, or to the Department of Foreign Affairs, or direct to RTE because they had very close links with them.  I believe that is what stopped Radio Nova.  The same tactics were tried with me when we were putting a transmitter up on the Cooley Mountains. Because the overspill was finding its way into Northern Ireland and into Belfast we had the Home Secretary on here to Foreign Affairs and Dr. Ian Paisley roaring his head off to stop the Fenians getting their message into Northern Ireland.  The same thing happened about Letterkenny. Like the first Coalition Government this Government bowed the knee to London and said they would put them out of business.  They were put out of business for a week and now the Government are prepared to act in a totally contrary direction. If the service is interfering so much why allow them back into business?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The people want a choice.  They are demanding, particularly the young people, that choice and it is up to the Government and to this House to respond to that demand and give them a choice.  Let RTE compete with Radio Nova.  Give Radio Nova a licence so that <Col N="1748" /> they will be part of the total operation. That is what we say.  The Government have not the guts to do that.  There is an old saying&mdash;I am sure it is well known in Galway&mdash;that if you do not know where you are going the nanny road will get you there.  That is the road the Government are travelling.  They do not know where they are going.  I am on the road of the 1981 Act designed to supply community and commercial radio giving everyone a free choice, forgetting about the monopolies if they are not doing the job and giving the taxpayers value for their money.  Let there be competition and let the people decide.  The Government parties used so-called pirate stations to get into office and now they are bending the knee to Maggie once again.  The good boys are trying to get into her good books.  This is a democracy and the people are entitled to choice.  This is a sovereign State.  This is the only country in the EEC that breaks the rules.  At the moment there is absolute chaos.</P>

      <P>Indeed I do and long may their efforts continue.  The alleged complaints are as valid today as they were last week.  Yet Radio Nova is allowed to go on transmitting.  I had the same kind of situation in relation to complaints about CB Radio.  I had a whole list of complaints about interference with the Garda and everyone else.  I investigated them all.  I did all the tests.  The Garda in the areas from which the greatest volume of complaints came were quite happy with CB radio because the operators helped them in finding stolen cars <Col N="1749" /> and catching criminals.  There was a complaint about interference with the air services.  I interviewed the senior civil servant over air traffic control and he said that if some lunatic decided to lie in the grass beside the runway there was nothing I could do about it.  Then I asked about the ambulance services.  I interviewed a good radio engineer in the private sector because that was the only way I could make an honest decision and I put some of the problems to him and as a result of his advice I decided CB Radio should be licensed.  No plane crashed. Nobody died because the ambulance did not come.</P>

      <P>No.  When she wanted to instal her transmitter in Enniskillen and Strabane no official from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs went up there to examine the strength of those transmitters.  If she wanted to know the penetration and the overspill over what she called her national boundary&mdash;something I did not accept and never would&mdash;it was now stretching as far as Banagher.  For the same reason I was entitled to go from the Cooley Mountains up to Belfast and from the Letterkenny transmitter right into the Foyle Valley.  If she decided to put her transmitter up in Enniskillen and Strabane then we would look at it and she had the audacity to ask us to let them come over here and examine the strength of these transmitters.  She was very quickly told we were a sovereign country and we would run our own business and she could run hers.  But the Government did not tell her that when she told them to close down the Nova transmitter.  The Government closed it down and then made a nonsense of the whole thing by letting them open up again.  That is the sort of decision making running through this Government.  They make a decision one week and they rescind it the next week.  It is not decision making.  It is indecision making.  There is one decision today and another decision tomorrow.  I await with interest the publication of the proposed Bill.</P>

If he is serious about solving this problem for all the people who want a choice of listening the Government could have made a few minor amendments, because Governments do not like accepting Bills from the Opposition, and introduce it next week when they would have the full support of the House.

      <P>On Friday, 20 May 1983, the Minister spoke about &ldquo;Nealon's network&rdquo;. I call it &ldquo;Nealon's nonsense&rdquo; because in an interview with Philip Molloy the Minister gave indications of where he stood and what he would do.  He nominated a number of stations involved. Everything in this article is nonsense and the Minister knows that when he brings a Bill before this House it will be roughly in line with our Bill.  The Minister of State criticised this Bill last week.  He was most unhelpful and unfair in his comments in relation to this legislation.  I was accused of carrying on the same tradition as my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, when he introduced a Bill in the House in 1981.  I <Col N="1751" /> am proud of that and also that Fianna Fáil make no U-turns to suit anyone.  We have always been consistent.  We have at least achieved one thing: we have made the Government think about broadcasting and the situation with regard to licensing stations throughout the country.  The action taken some weeks ago was an insensitive approach to this issue.  The Government had the opportunity to bring legislation before this House, yet they decided to close down stations.</P>
      <P>The Minister, Deputy Jim Mitchell, gave an interview in the <i>Evening Herald</i> on Friday, 3 June 1983.  He gave an indication that there will be no further action taken against the pirate stations until the end of the year.  In the Dáil he denied this statement and the NUJ should be very careful when they are interviewing either the Minister or the Minister of State in relation to this issue because last night the Minister denied the contents of this interview.

      <P>It is very difficult to go into the points made by both Ministers. They stated that the Bill would not allow for the licensing of broadcasters who were in a position to provide equipment. Section 17 (a) clearly states &ldquo;to establish, maintain and operate broadcasting stations and for that purpose to acquire, install and operate or to arrange for the acquisition, installation and operation of apparatus for broadcasting&rdquo;.  I should like the officials who drafted the statement for the Minister to check that again because our Bill clearly allows for licensing of an organisation or a broadcasting station who are in a position to provide the equipment.  Furthermore, in relation to section 18 we clearly outlined that we are responsive to the varied interests and concerns of the whole community served by each station.  Our Bill is community orientated, but there must be some viability because otherwise stations will not survive.  Irrespective of how the Minister paints our Bill, it is likely that when it comes to drafting he will come up with something like it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to every Deputy to leave aside party political affiliations and to vote for our Bill.  I assure the Government that I will be very helpful on Committee Stage to allow for any amendments they may wish to make.  We should get together on this and provide for the Bill to be passed tonight, have the Authority set up before the end of June and have legality in broadcasting.  It was fascinating to hear Deputy Seán Treacy making a case for the stations in his area.  Naturally, he got support from the local radios in Tipperary and Clonmel.  It is also fascinating to know that the Minister of State has met the people from that area and I am delighted he has done so.  Has the Minister also met people from Radio Nova, Radio Sunshine and other stations operating in Dublin?  Perhaps the Minister will disclose at some stage if he had <Col N="1753" /> meetings with those people to discuss the question of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have acted in a responsible manner by preparing the first Private Members' Bill to come before this House for many years.  It is a great honour for me, as spokesman for Posts and Telegraphs and Communications, to bring forward this Bill in Opposition.  Irrespective of what Deputy Nealon has said, we put a lot of work into it and studied it very carefully.  We made it more relevant to today and allowed for further provisions to be made.  I commend this Bill to the House.  I ask for the support of the House, especially that of the Labour Party.  Deputies should be allowed to vote in a free manner as they were allowed to do on other legislation some weeks ago.  RTE are the finest broadcasting service in the world.  They are second to none.  The people involved in that station must be commended for their work.</P>

      <P>However, the public want a choice between RTE 1 and 2 and other stations.  There are so many varied interests in entertainment, music and listening habits and surely the way to satisfy that demand is to provide independent local community radio stations right around the country.  That is what our Bill is about.  I ask Fine Gael, Opposition and the Labour Party to support this Bill and we will have this matter sorted out once and for all.</P>
      <P>If we are not successful in having this Bill accepted, I ask the Minister as quickly as possible to bring forward a Bill enabling that legislation to go before the House which will be assured of our support if it is something in line with our Bill.</P>

    <P>In page 14, subsection (1), between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(a)  to provide a national telecommunications service within the State and between the State and places outside the State,&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I was making the point before the adjournment that I accept the Minister's amendment.  My amendment is to emphasise the need for a full and efficient telecommunications service.  To the man in the street telecommunications means a telephone service.  I am not satisfied with the quality of service we have today.  We must make every effort to improve the service.</P>
      <P>It will be the responsibility of An Bord Telecom to complete the four-year programme which we introduced in 1980. Improvements should be evident in the next 12 months.  The board should investigate at the earliest opportunity the reason the service has not been improved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to telephone accounts I made the point that there is major dissatisfaction with the accounts system. When I was in the Department I put forward a proposal to introduce a two-monthly account which would allow a consumer to have a better knowledge of the phone calls he or she made.  The bill would not coincide with the Electricity Supply Board's bill and so ensure that the consumer would not receive two large bills on the same day.  The ESB, who must arrange for the manual reading of metres and for the return of the figures to the offices, are able to provide a two-monthly account system so I see no reason why the Department or the new board when in operation will not be in a position to provide an accurate service. With the new technology, with particular reference to the digital exchanges, facilities <Col N="1758" /> are available for the provision of accounts showing details such as the destination of each call and the cost of it.  In Britain there is in operation for a trial period a pilot scheme involving about 10,000 consumers.  The new board should introduce a similar type scheme as soon as possible after taking over.  As I stated earlier, I receive many representations from my constituents in regard to telephone accounts.  When I was in the Department I was aware of the many complaints from every constituency in this regard.  I am sure the Minister will agree that a detailed account system would make it much easier for consumers to know how their accounts were made up.</P>
    <P>The other day I received an unusual complaint about a telephone account. What was interesting about the complaint was that the person concerned had received a letter from the Department referring to an inquiry he had made on May 2.  My constituent had paid his account by that stage and had not made any complaint in relation to it.  He received from the Department information in respect of reverse charge calls supposed to have been made to him from London or elsewhere in Britain and from other places.  I have followed up this matter and I have made telephone calls to some of the numbers involved only to be informed by the people concerned that they had never heard of the gentleman in question or of his telephone number. Some of those I phoned had never heard of the area that the person was from.  I have asked the fraud squad in the Department to carry out a full investigation of the circumstances surrounding this case. I am not referring to officials of the Department when I say that there has been some major error but I should like to get to the bottom of this complaint because it may be an indicator of the many other complaints that arise in the Department.  The consumer in question is very concerned now in case this situation has been arising for a number of years in relation to his accounts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That was the detailed point I wished to make.  I am sure a survey would reveal that the general consumer is not all that satisfied with the present service.  In some cases there may be justification for this but not in others.  As a consumer in an automatic area, I have no complaint to make regarding the service but many consumers and business people particularly have major difficulties in obtaining lines for the purposes of carrying out their business.  This is one of the most important areas that the new board should investigate.</P>
      <P>On the cost of the installations, I am very concerned that there have been 12,000 refusals for telephone service. This is a major blow to the Department and it will also present difficulties for the new board because if this trend continues they will be in a very difficult situation. Some of the popular radio stations have carried out surveys on installation costs and have found that they are very high. I would refer to a situation in which the Minister had discussions with a certain institution.  I shall not go into this in great detail now but I shall probably follow it up later.  As reported in the <i>Irish Inde-pendent</i> and the <i>Irish Press</i> of June 14, the Minister made a statement regarding the 12,000 rejections in respect of telephone installations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think we will have an opportunity of debating the Estimate for this Department.  The Minister said that the refusals will create major difficulty for the Department and for the board.  The scheme prepared by <Col N="1760" /> the Department and sent to postmasters throughout the country is accurate.  The Minister should have been aware that this scheme was being proposed.  He stated that my information was not correct.  He said that a letter had been circulated to head postmasters and district managers telling them that a scheme had been agreed with Bank of Ireland Finance but not approved by him and that there was no deal.  The Minister should investigate the reason for that document being sent out.  It indicates that he had arranged loans covering about 75 per cent of the advance payments by way of three instalments on the telephone bill and that the scheme would come into operation at the end of May.  Either the Minister is misleading the media or the Department are misleading him, but it is unfair of him to make the allegation that the officials carried out something without ministerial approval.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is in the best interest of An Bord Telecom that an arrangement be made to reduce the installation fee for telephones.  People are finding it extremely difficult to afford the installation fee.  Furthermore the people who have phones installed are finding them difficult to maintain due to high charges for telephone calls and the difficulty experienced in the billing system.  These areas will have to be investigated quickly. The decision making areas should be improved under An Bord Telecom. There will be a new dynamic board with dynamic management and continuity of arrangements.  In the last 18 months there have been three changes of Government and three Ministers and that has played havoc with continuity.  With a chief of the calibre of the man appointed there will be continuity and an opportunity to improve the service as a whole.  If we are going to draw up a scheme it should be drawn up at minimum charge to the consumer, with the best possible interest rate, with fair competition with all the banking institutions and priority should be given to the Irish Telecommunications Investment Company Limited.</P>
      <P>It is unfair of the Minister to say that my information is inaccurate and it is also unfair to deny that this information was circulated and that the scheme was prepared and put forward to the sub-postmasters.</P>

      <P>The letter to which Deputy Leyden referred was issued without my knowledge or authority and the first I heard of it was when I read about it in the paper.  The explanation is that officials in the Department were working in advance to tip off people that a scheme was coming up for early implementation. When the proposals were made I said that they were not good enough and that we would look elsewhere.  That is what we are doing.</P>
      <P>Earlier we referred to the fact that this was the first year in which postal charges were kept down.  This is the case with the telephone system.  Because of the present connection charges there is a growing cancellation rate.  A survey showed that the reason for cancellations was because most people could not afford the high connection charges.  I initiated proposals to make charges less onerous on the public. I hope to bring in a new scheme under which the connection charges can be paid over the first number of quarterly bills rather than on the first quarterly bill. There is not a final agreement yet but I hope arrangements will be made in the immediate future.</P>
      <P>I got the impression from the newspapers that Deputy Leyden was attacking what I was doing but I am glad to hear that he welcomes the efforts we are making to reduce the initial outlay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to Deputy Leyden's comments on the billing system, I share the Deputy's concern at the number of complaints. I have initiated discussions to see how this might be improved.  With digital exchanges coming on stream there will be an improvement in the service to the consumer but we will not have digital services everywhere for a long time.  We are also looking at the possibility of making meters available to customers for a small rental charge to see if it will <Col N="1763" /> improve the situation.  I am conscious of the problems and we are tackling them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>My comments on Deputy Leyden's amendment would be similar to those made on his amendment to section 12 but as the Minister had agreed to have a look at that I am reasonably satisfied.  The provision of a telecommunications service to meet the domestic, industrial commercial and social needs of the State or a comprehensive and efficient telecommunications service to satisfy all reasonable demands for such a service throughout the State was the basic reason for establishment of An Bord Telecom.  If I had believed that the Department could operate more efficiently in respect of this type of business I would not have decided on introducing the new system or establishing the interim Bord Telecom.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Leyden that there is considerable public dissatisfaction with the service.  We ought to ask ourselves why the service was bad over a long period.  The answer is that it was totally underfinanced.  For far too long the finance available for the development of telecommunications was abysmally low. We had a very small staff of technicians and engineers and a considerable amount of time was spent in repairing a system which at its best was unsatisfactory.  I do not blame former Governments, Ministers or the Department.  We must recognise that up to the end of the 1950s, when a very considerable industrial revival began, the demand for telephones for industrial purposes was relatively low and the demand for telephones for social purposes was also low.  In those circumstances if a Minister came to the Government and intimated that by 1980 we would need so many thousands of telephones, he would have been told by his colleagues that this was rubbish and that they had to utilise capital for building houses, schools and hospitals.  Industry developed rapidly throughout the 1960s and the telephone system was caught napping.  It was some time before it was recognised that a better telephone service was needed.  It was because of this that in the late 1970s I <Col N="1764" /> requested the Government to make available £650 million over a five-year period for the development of the telecommunications system.  The Government agreed to this.  That £650 million was more than had been spent on the whole telecommunications system from 1922 to that date.  That gives some idea of the under-financing.  It is very easy in hindsight to say what should have been done but it is quite a different matter when dealing with it at a specific time.</P>
    <P>We needed at that time 500 new buildings and we had to start from scratch.  To speed up the provision of these buildings I decided to set up a joint committee of officials from my own Department and the Office of Public Works in order to cut out red tape.  They were told that the money was there and that they should go ahead and do the job.  One has only to look around the country at the number of buildings now available for telecommunications purposes to see the very considerable progress that has been made.</P>

      <P>I have a right to explain very briefly the background to the problem and why development did not take place until relatively recently.  It was very interesting that one national daily paper criticised me in a leading article for having the temerity to set up this committee and make money available at a time when there was a Post Office strike.  If they look at that article now they might have a different view.</P>
      <P>One of the advantages of having a very antiquated system was that we were able to move from that to one of the most advanced systems, leaping over the British system.  I believe there will be a very worthwhile improvement in the system in a relatively short time.  We are coming towards the end of the five-year period and the installation of telephones has advanced very rapidly.  I read a statement by the Minister that telephones would be available on demand towards the end of the year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Leyden has already raised the question of the cost of installation.  While any new scheme to help with installations would be worthwhile, the Minister might consider subsidising installation costs on the basis that in the future there will be profits from the telephone system.  We are entitled to expect such profits judging by the experience in Britain.</P>
      <P>Deputy Kelly made some comments on the name &ldquo;An Bord Telecom&rdquo;. He mentioned the fact that the usual word for telecommunications was &ldquo;cumarsáide&rdquo;, He also mentioned &ldquo;cian amharc&rdquo; in relation to television.  Having been responsible for the name An Bord Telecom Éireann, I think he would accept that words are introduced from one language to another.  For example, &ldquo;telefís&rdquo; is reasonably close not just to the word &ldquo;television&rdquo; but also to the word of that meaning in other languages besides English.  In respect of An Bord Telecom Éireann we are aiming at a name that would be easily recognisable and freely used.  If we used the name &ldquo;An Bord Cumarsáide&rdquo; people might have greater difficulty in using it.</P>

      <P>I mentioned that there are quite a number of buildings around the country now ready for use but I am somewhat disappointed that two such buildings in my own constituency, one in Drogheda and one in Dundalk, are still not in operation.  The building in Drogheda was to have been in use by the end of 1982 but will not now be in operation until the end of this year and a <Col N="1766" /> similar situation exists in Dundalk.  We could make considerable progress in the area if these facilities were operating and it looks as if sufficient money is not being made available.

The review body took cognisance of this and expressed concern that there were no means by which this money could be recouped from the State. Services for old age pensioners provided by the ESB and CIE are funded by the Department of Social Welfare.  No such facility is being provided in respect of posts and telecommunications and I would ask the Minister to consider this matter before Report Stage.  It is extremely important for the future viability of both bodies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the amendment but I am not sure exactly what effect it will have.  My interest in this legislation, particularly in the context of section 14 and the amendment, is to ensure that what I regard as an outrageously inefficient and appalling telephone service should provide a proper service for the consumer.  I am concerned that the high ideals expressed in section 14 and the added obligation on An Bord Telecom which will arise as a result of this amendment will be only so much window-dressing. The point must be made that the transfer of the whole monolith of the telephone and telecommunications services from the political auspices of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to An Bord Telecom will not by the wave of a magic wand produce an efficient telephone service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1767" /> I am concerned about this.  I should like to see very specific obligations in section 14, the empowering section, which lays down the obligations of the board.  It may well be that both the Minister's proposed amendment &mdash; Deputies opposite seem to be unanimous in relation to the board's functions &mdash; may produce the trick, but I am not convinced. We have to be convinced because at present the telephone service, rather than meeting the industrial and commercial needs of the country, is effectively sabotaging the industrial and commercial needs of the people.  It certainly is not meeting the domestic needs of the country because in the city and county of Dublin the telephone service appears to me to be in a state of chaos.</P>

      <P>Section 14, with the Minister's amendment, must be read in conjunction with section 84 which I do not think we will get an opportunity to debate.  I urge the Minister to ensure that in the context of this legislation there will be some reasonable protection for the consumer.  I am not sure that all these obligations being imposed on An Bord Telecom will be meaningful because it seems to me that if the board do not comply with the obligations, if they do not provide an efficient national telecommunications service, whatever that means, it seems the consumer will not have redress because no matter what the board do, as a result of section 84 the consumer will not have a comeback, no matter how inefficient, negligent or idiotic the board may be.  I do not mean to insult any member of the telephone personnel&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am voicing the frustration of ordinary people not directly involved in the telephone service.  This section, read with section 84, does not <Col N="1768" /> give any real protection to the consumer. That is not assisted by section 45 in the Act which provided a telephone users' council which has as much teeth as an elderly pensioner who goes to a dentist in order to get the final tooth removed to have false teeth inserted.  It seems to me there is a need to top up the consumer protection element.  I know the Minister and Deputies opposite mean well, but without being critical of any individual Minister or Government, the state of chaos in our telephone service will not automatically be solved by what is in this section in conjunction with the Minister's amendment.</P>

      <P>Section 14 will not do anything more than to isolate the telephone service even further from a degree of political responsibility because there is nothing in it that will protect the consumer.  In the context of the difficulties everyone is experiencing because of a lack of accurate information about the telephone service, it seems the effects of this section will merely further isolate the telephone service so that it will be impossible for Deputies even to discover what is happening in relation to individual constituents by way of Dáil question, something we should not have to engage in if we had an efficient information system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even as a result of the Minister's amendment, the section does not give any guarantee that An Bord Telecom will provide any more efficient service than the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. If what I am saying in any way upsets staff in the Department I apologise, but it is a reality.  If we simply transfer the problems that exist in the Department to <Col N="1769" /> the board, if nobody gets down to tackling them, the board will be saying, as Ministers said in the past: &ldquo;We cannot do anything about it; we will transfer it to some form of board.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section places an obligation on An Bord Telecom to provide an efficient telecommunications service, and I assume the Minister agrees that an efficient service would be one in which the billing system would be efficient. I am sure the Minister will also agree that the method of assessing the charges on a quarterly basis is not sufficient. It is not accurate.  It is the cause of much frustration and heartache and many complaints are being made to the Department about it.  I am asking the Minister to give us some information whether it is proposed to introduce an efficient system whereby telephone subscribers will have a means of establishing to their satisfaction that the bill they will receive will be accurate and correct.</P>
      <P>The present system does not allow subscribers to check whether they are getting correct bills.  They are left at the mercy of the Department.  Many people have despaired when they receive their bills because far in excess of the number of calls made are charged for.  It seems they do not have any comeback.  They can make appeals and it has been known that the Department have reduced some bills, but to my knowledge they have never explained the grounds for reducing them. They have never been able to explain the grounds in the first instance for sending excessive bills.  They seem to make a shot in the dark like the Revenue Commissioners when they make assessments: they guess at someone's tax liability and let him prove that he does not owe it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think it is fair that a system of that kind should be operated here.  I do not think the Minister can claim that if that system is to be continued he will be fulfilling the terms of this section, even if amended.  In other words, he cannot claim he will be providing an efficient service.  I hope he will explain to the House whether it is possible for a telephone subscriber to receive a bill for telephone calls which he did not make <Col N="1770" /> and which were not operator-assisted.  It is possible for somebody to give another number when making a call through the operator.</P>

      <P>We are talking about an efficient system.  If the Minister is to introduce a system which will be efficient it will have to include an efficient billing system which will give people accurate accounts.  If the Minister cannot indicate to the House that he will make substantial changes in the accounting system he cannot claim that he is proceeding to provide an efficient system.  Hundreds of my constituents have made complaints during the years.  I am not blaming the Minister, but the complaints system will have to be changed.  We have all suffered from it.  I have a bill in my pocket for the last quarter.  It is for £519.  It includes hundreds of calls that I never made.  What recourse have I?  All I can do is to shrug my shoulders and say that I cannot prove I did not make the calls because there is not a meter on my telephone or in the exchange which I could go in to look at.</P>

      <P>My little contribution will not hold up the House for long.  Until now I have not spoken at all on the Bill and it is not my intention to delay the House.  Everyone wants to see an efficient telephone system.  As Deputy Faulkner said, Fianna Fáil Governments in the past made major commitments to investing capital in the telecommunications system which is at present in the process of being installed and hopefully over a reasonable period this country will have a system which will operate very efficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This system will not be satisfactory to the subscribers unless the accounting is accurate and the subscriber is not held up to ransom, as happens at present.  The Minister is aware of this difficulty, but it <Col N="1771" /> would help if he would explain to the House whether it is possible under the present system to receive a bill for calls which were not made on one's phone and which were not telephone operator-assisted. I would also like him to explain if it is proposed to introduce a more efficient accounting system in the future.  It is incumbent on the Department to install these meters free of charge, as the ESB do when they extend electricity supply to a domestic dwelling.  The householder can look at the meter provided by the ESB and assess the number of units he is using.  He knows his capacity to pay and if the number of units used is high, he can ease off.  With the telephone system one never knows until that dreadful envelope drops into the letter box.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there is a significant perception that there is something wrong with our accounting system, and I have already initiated inquiries in the Department to see if anything can be done about it.  I mentioned earlier the increasing number of digital exchanges which are coming on stream and which will enable us to provide better facilities in many respects.  We are looking at the possibility of providing meters on the same basis as the ESB which, contrary to what Deputy Molloy said, are rented to the subscriber by the ESB.</P>

      <P>There are three of my predecesors present; only my colleague, Deputy Cooney, is not here.  I am the fifth Minister for Posts and Telegraphs since this telecommunications system was inaugurated.  That speaks volumes for the <Col N="1772" /> changes that have taken place and for the lack of continuity.  It takes a while for a new Minister to learn the ropes.  I want to pay a tribute to each of my predecessors, Deputy Faulkner, Deputy Reynolds, Deputy Cooney and Deputy Wilson, who have taken a lot of flak, which I will have to take too until we have an efficient telephone system.  The steps they took when in office will result, hopefully before the end of next year, in an efficient telephone system which we all want and which the country badly needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not but reply to some of the comments made by Deputy Shatter on a subject he obviously knew little about.  He sarcastically criticised some of the officials in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  As the Minister said, the lack of continuity had an impact on the situation but this is a five-year programme and one cannot expect miracles overnight.  The telephone service was neglected for too long.  We should have started this reorganisation 15 years ago.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of the telephone system should have led to the commercial development of the system.  This should have been treated as a commercial service in a business environment, but it was not.  It was tied up by red tape, bureaucracy and outdated regulations which had to be complied with.  It did not lend itself to being treated in a commercial manner.  The previous Fianna Fáil Government set up the two boards to give them freedom to operate in a commercial environment, to devise management and marketing structures and to develop an efficient system, but that will not happen overnight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are talking about overhauling the whole telephone network in Dublin in five years and changing from an outmoded system, parts of which could end up in a museum.  In one sense we were lucky that money was not wasted over the past few years because we had the opportunity of jumping the intermediate stage of development technology into the digital technology.  This should give us the opportunity to have one of the finest telephone services in the EEC.  As I said, <Col N="1773" /> one of the major problems was the restrictions on the Department when they tried to come to grips with this problem.</P>
    <P>One of the problems facing the new board is complicated by the very high cost of telephone installations, which I believe is bad marketing strategy.  We have heard of large numbers of people who are discouraged from applying for a telephone.  I believe in developing the network as fast as possible and having the maximum number of consumers using that network.  The correct marketing strategy should be to connect as many people as possible so that the network will be used to capacity and one will get a return on one's investment.  What has happened is that the cost of installation has put the telephone beyond the reach of many people.  It that trend continues the bright financial future we foresaw for those boards a few years ago will not materialise.  The new board should aim at getting the maximum number of subscribers while recognising that Dublin city has a particular problem.  I do not know what changes have taken place in the structure of the management of Dublin city since I left but the management structure was not geared to deal with this problem.  The whole of Dublin city was one area.  In my view it should be split into various subregions.  This way the management could do their job quickly and efficiently.</P>
    <P>There is another major problem in Dublin city which should be recognised and appreciated.  Most of the old cabling running through the commerical areas in the centre of Dublin is very old, subject to flooding and all the problems associated with major breakdowns.  All that recabling has to be done and that is a major job.  It is easy to do overhead cabling and produce fairly quick results, as happens all around the country.</P>
    <P>Many rural divisions will get phones on demand.  This is the situation in Limerick and Waterford.  Drogheda and Sligo are coming to that stage.  Fire brigade action will have to be taken in Dublin city to remedy these major problems.  Recabling operations will have to take place. Whether overhead cabling, which is <Col N="1774" /> undesirable from an environmental point of view, will have to be resorted to I do not know.  I am not an engineer or a technician.  Those are the problems that give rise to the complaints we hear in Dublin City.  We cannot expect a new system overnight.  It is only when the whole system is overhauled and it all gels that one will see the benefits of the big investment that has taken place.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to look at the cost of the installations.  As Deputy Molloy says, people are being frightened by the size of their bills.  I know the difficulties in the accounts section.  I went into the Department just after the end of the very long strike and there was a huge backlog of accounts to be brought up to date on a manual system.  That whole system needs to be computerised.  I believe the accounts for each region should be done in each region and fed into a central computer.  We should decentralise a lot of the management that is making the service top heavy in Dublin. If we could get it down into the regions it would loosen up the system quite a lot.</P>
    <P>The strategy behind this Bill is to get the proper management structure to give the people the tools to do the job which they are expected to do.  If the management pick up the challenge that is there to finish the job that has been started we will see the results in the not too distant future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite a lot of the debate that went on for the last hour was more relevant to section 15.  It is interesting that the Minister has admitted to the Dáil that it was only as a result of reading the newspapers that he was aware of the circular that went out from his Department regarding the terms of an agreement with a banking institution regarding telephone connections.  It is a disturbing admission. From my experience it was unusual for the Department to go ahead with a circular to the staff of post offices and other sections of the Department.  It is an interesting insight into the activities of the Department at the moment.  The Minister should be concerned about the circular. It looks an authentic document.  It is framed in the standard way and it was sent out in the Minister's name.  Now the Minister denies the existence of the details in this document and says he does not agree with them.  The Minister should carry out a detailed examination in the Department to find out why this document was sent out.  My experience was that the Secretary of the Department and the staff would not send out a document like this without the Minister's approval or the approval of the Ministers of State of which there are two.  The Minister's admission clarifies the issue.  It also exonerates me from the blame the Minister initially placed on me for disclosing this information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Opposition spokesman I was entitled to query the scheme.  I did not attack the whole idea of having a scheme.  I queried the reasoning behind dealing with one particular institution without giving an opportunity for other organisations to compete.  I did not attack the concept of some sort of scheme to assist the consumer in the connection of his <Col N="1776" /> telephone.  I welcome the Minister's statement that he is proposing to bring forward a scheme which would be of benefit to the consumers and to the Department. The idea of assisting subscribers and applicants for telephones is worthwhile. A more worked out scheme and a better interest rate would be more appropriate.  The whole situation should be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Section 15 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>(a)  charges for services are kept at the minimum rates consistent with meeting approved financial targets, and</P>
    <P>(b)  revenues of the company are not less than sufficient to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  meet all charges properly chargeable to revenue account (including depreciation of assets and proper allocation to general reserve) taking one year with another.</P>
    <P>The difficulty in the Department was that the advance payment system is practically statutory at the moment and the arrangement for paying in advance for three and four years, depending on the distance from the work involved, is something that has arisen over the years.  The general philosophy behind that was that if a person paid the advance rental he would not propose to take out the system in a short time.  It was protecting the Department from the high installation costs involved in overhead wiring and erection of poles. In some cases that reached three years, advance rental and the connection charge would be £586.  The actual installation cost would be £540.70.  That is a lot of money to pay in advance for a system. The Minister will have to look at the situation but it will be over to An Bord Telecom in the ultimate to provide a service.</P>
    <P>In Government we encouraged the provision of meters.  I believe they should be provided to the consumer without any charge or at a minimum charge.  What worries me is that the meters will not be taken as evidence by the Department. Even though the Department will approve and arrange for their installation &mdash;they are being produced in Dublin and <Col N="1777" /> their production is providing much needed employment &mdash; the Department will not accept the reading as proof.  The Minister should encourage the idea that the meter be accepted as evidence that the account was accurate.  The thing that annoys most people is that if you make a telephone call from, say, this House through the operator to a manual exchange you will find that after completing the call and if you are trying to ring somebody a few minutes later the operator may say to you: &ldquo;Have you finished this call?&rdquo;  One is presumably being charged for that, even though the call was terminated some minutes earlier.  That is happening.  I have no doubt about it.  It is creating many difficulties.</P>
    <P>I was assured that, when you made a local call from a private telephone, under no circumstances could the meter be activated to record it as a long distance call.  I was never fully satisfied about that. Very senior people in the Department will assure you from the advice given to them by the technical people that the meters are stored and are available in the exchanges, that the meters are photographed and the information is sent to Dublin to be dealt with and to have the accounts send down.  Like any other instrument the meter can go wrong.  A meter may be faulty.  There is very little admission from the Department that they detected a faulty meter.  The general public are concerned that some meters can be faulty.  From my own experience I believe that some local calls could activate the mechanism which would record a longer time or a longer distance.  Those are the two areas where the greatest difficulty arises.</P>
    <P>There are also major abuses of the system.  One abuse is accepting a reverse telephone call at a telephone box in a bar or a public place.  You can arrange for a long distance call to be put through from Britain or elsewhere to a number in a public place.  I realise that when you ring from a telephone kiosk a light comes on in the telephone exchange which indicates to the telephone operator that the call is from a kiosk or a telephone with a coinbox attached.  This has created a certain amount of fraud.  A reverse call <Col N="1778" /> is made to a prearranged destination at a prearranged time in a public bar or lounge or hotel.  The person answers the call and accepts the charges.  It is very difficult to eliminate that type of fraud. Many people who have public telephones have this difficulty.  We will have to try to eliminate the problem.</P>
    <P>When a person rings an operator and asks for a number the operator should ring back.  I am told by the Department that the amount of fraud in this area would not justify the operator ringing back.  I was told that the operator will ring back once in every ten calls coming through.  You can credit a call to another number in your area.  That is happening all the time.  A person will know the number of his public representative or another well known number.  He rings the operator and books a call to Dublin. He gives the number of his neighbour or somebody else and that is what is recorded.  If the operator asked the person to put down the telephone and rang him back that would eliminate that problem. When I was in the Department I suggested that the operator should have the responsibility of ringing back and checking on all calls made.  This has given rise to many complaints in my experience.  Some years ago the operator rang back and checked.  An Bord Telecom will have to give priority treatment to this area.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds said the accounting system should be decentralised.  This is very important.  The Minister should indicate to An Bord Telecom that there should be total decentralisation of the telephone accounts system.  This would give the consumer an opportunity to query his account locally.  When I was Minister of State I queried a telephone account on 14 December 1982, the last day we were in Government.  I asked the Department to investigate this account. I put down a question in the Dáil this week about that account.  I do not know what the reply was, but it took six or seven months before I received a response to a representation I made as an outgoing Minister of State.</P>
    <P>In the GPO the accounts section are absolutely bogged down.  They are overworked <Col N="1779" /> and frustrated.  I compliment the section in the Department who take the calls from consumers in Dublin.  They have a very difficult existence.  Mr. O'Reilly was dealing with that section when I was in the Department and he had a great deal of patience.  I compliment him publicly on the way he handled queries from the public.  On a few occasions I took calls myself from angry consumers and it is a very difficult task to appease a consumer who has a major difficulty.  His telephone may have been out of order for two or three months.  The officials in that section have a great deal to contend with.  They provide a grant service for the consumers who take out their frustrations on these officials.  They really let go at them.  These people are the frontline of the Department work under great strain.</P>
    <P>If Bord Telecom are to work efficiently and effectively they must tackle this area as a matter of priority.  This illustrates the reason behind the setting up of two boards.  With new dynamic leadership and with a dynamic chief executive eager and willing and ready to get going when this legislation is passed Bord Telecom will eliminate these problems.  Former Ministers had to worry about constituency problems and the other problems with which Deputies and Ministers have to concern themselves.</P>

      <P>Dáil Questions, as my colleague said.  The Department of Posts and Telegraphs must be the most demanding of all the Ministries at the moment, Today's work in the Dáil practically from 10.30 a.m. to 10.30 p.m. has been taken up almost exclusively with the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. They are one of the most hard worked Departments.  They have been the butt of many attacks by the public.  In the Department we have a great staff, great people who work very hard.  They will have greater opportunities under a new board of management and a new chief executive.  I know the personnel going in there.  They will have to tackle the problems <Col N="1780" /> we have outlined.  They will read the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Some months ago the Minister opened up the telephone exchanges to allow the consumer to go in and see the telephone system.  I was a step in the right direction to have open days for the consumers to try to satisfy them that everything is working right and that the meters are operating correctly.  The public are quite clear in their minds that the system is not working right, that there is no accountability. There is not an adequate response from the GPO because the GPO are bogged down not only with parliamentary questions but also with the number of queries which have arisen on accounts over the years.  In the next few days the Minister will find there will be even further queries.  Due to the coverage of this debate tonight the general public will be further worried about their accounts.  I regret that, but I must highlight this issue to assist Bord Telecom when they are in operation.  In the meantime the Department will be in charge for six to nine months possibly.  Do not allow the situation to continue.  Consider programmes and policies in keeping with An Bord Telecom.  If possible, decentralise the accounts system, provide more jobs in rural areas, provide a better service and give people a chance to appeal and query the accounts, a full investigation to be carried out.  Ultimately the only way the public will be satisfied is with the provision of meters.  They are vitally essential and I would ask the Minister to have them available on the market.  They were supposed to be on the market last November-December.  Let the Minister put one in his own home and see how it works.  I would be delighted to have one and I shall be booking a meter because I want to know how it operates.  I believe there is not one Deputy who does not want a meter installed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just a few comments to make on this section.  I cannot see that it adds very much to the Bill.  It purports to impose a general duty on the telecommunications company to do certain things.  Now a duty is something a person <Col N="1781" /> or a body is obliged to do.  The whole thrust of that is removed immediately and subsection (2) therefore does not mean what it appears to mean.  In actual fact the company is to have no responsibility in carrying out or being responsible for any of these duties purported to be imposed on it.  Really this is little more than a pious indication of what the Minister, perhaps, would like to see emerge from the company.  Putting pious intentions in without any teeth is a waste of time.  Looking at the wording is it, I wonder, deliberately put in the form in which it is?  It says the charges have to be kept at a minimum rate consistent with meeting approved financial targets.  What targets? Approved by whom?  Will it be the company or the Minister?  Will it be some superviser?  Who will approve of these targets?  That is an expression which almost has the genesis of a definition.</P>
      <P>The whole thrust of the general duty imposed on the company in this section has altogether too much in my view of business orientation: meet all the charges properly chargeable to revenue account, including depreciation of assets and proper allocation to general reserve, taking one year with another, generate a reasonable proportion of capital needs, remunerate capital and repay borrowings. Any semi-skilled accountant would have little difficulty in interpreting that to mean that the company would have <i>carte blanche</i> as to what organisation it would make of the finances and what the trends and objectives of the company would be in the form of charging.  Quite frankly, a company having the duties this company will have would be operating a social service in the same way as the postal service, or electricity, gas, transport and so on.  The idea of such a company operating to make a profit would be and ought to be anathema.  Indeed it can be argued that this should be operated as a social service subsidised to some extent out of central funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not an ordinary run-of-the-mill business and should not be looked at as if it were.  I would not like it to be run in order to make a profit or even to break even.  I would like to see a duty imposed which would provide that the service <Col N="1782" /> would be made available to people in need of the service, particularly old people living alone.  The provision of a telephone service for these is not a luxury. It is a vital necessity.  In many cases it can be a matter of life or death.  I should like to see in this provision an obligation on the company to make special provision for old people and those who have a special need of the service.  Many old people are living alone in fear and television should be readily available for them at a cost they can afford and, if they cannot afford it, at no cost at all.  That should be provided as a general duty in the section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain lack of logic in what Deputy Taylor has said.  He attaches no particular importance to the wording of the section.  He says the section will have no particular effect and he suggests other words.  How he thinks his substitution might have more effect than those already there I just do not know.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (2), had the Deputy read it to the very end, says &ldquo;before any court to which it would not otherwise be subject&rdquo;.  That changes the meaning of what the Deputy read.  I regard section 15 as a very important section in view of what has happened to so many semi-State companies in comparatively recent times.  A company is asked to generate a reasonable proportion of capital needs and remunerate capital and repay borrowings.  Unfortunately in recent years &mdash; this was not always true and it certainly was not true of the total history of semi-State bodies since they became popular under the encouragement of the late Seán Lemass&mdash;what has been happening is that we are getting big headlines about operating profits by this company and operating profits by that company and one is not in fact really reading the true story of the operations at all.  The capital needs are provided by the taxpayer and the taxpayer also has to provide future capital needs.  The account one reads in the press about companies does not even refer to an obligation to <Col N="1783" /> remunerate capital.  It is just written off. There is no question of the company remunerating capital or repaying borrowings for that matter.  Really therefore one is not getting the true account of what is happening in many of these companies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Taylor says he regards television as a social service.  We very positively made certain social provisions in our social legislation and we can on this side of the House take pride in that.  It was our doing.  It was a Fianna Fáil idea and it is far in advance of what is available even in wealthier countries.  But that should not preclude the possibility of making a profit on what is a booming business.  I know there have been drop outs; so to speak, in demand but if the experience in other countries as of now because of the demand for television is that profit can be made I do not see why we should not aim at making a profit. From discussing this with the board and the chief executive who will be the chief executive of An Bord Telecom this is the objective.  That money will of course be used for the development of the service or a reduction of the charges, which is a very desirable objective indeed judging by what we have been hearing during the course of the last couple of hours.</P>
      <P>With regard to financial targets and so on there are other relevant sections which no doubt will come to the attention of those interested in this particular aspect of the Bill.  Before I left office I thought that the meter would be generally available before this.  I also believe that the charge would be very low.  I do not know what charge the Minister is thinking of now; I read in a newspaper it would be about £16.50 per annum.  I thought there would be a nominal charge of £5 or even less.  There is not much point in providing a meter for people who might not make more than three or four calls per week. Charging them £16.50 for a meter would come to more than the 165 telephone calls they would make in a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think in the last few months there has been the occasional callback from the exchange.  Deputy Molloy made the strong point that people are perturbed at the idea that other subscribers are using <Col N="1784" /> their telephone numbers.  The Minister used the phrase &ldquo;the public perception&rdquo; several times today.  I agree with him that that is very important.  If people think something is happening this generates its own lack of confidence in the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Reynolds mentioned decentralisation when he spoke about the break up of the centre.  This has already occurred in some regions throughout the country and the general belief is that it has improved efficiency in various areas. This section will become increasingly important as time goes on.  The kind of vibrant approach to this that I found in discussions with the chairman and chief executive of the board is the right kind of mood for launching An Bord Telecom. The members of the board, specifically the people who are mentioned, have made very widespread studies of systems in various countries, some very far away, and they have considerable experience in using telecommunications all over the world.  They have stories to tell which indicate that many prestigious countries have not such a great system of telecommunications and compare unfavourably with what we have here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to charges for telecommunication services, it is fair to say that the business and commercial community are extremely worried about increasing costs and the strain which that puts on industry and commerce in general. It has neen one of the failings of the system up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Finance decide that the Department of Posts and Telegraphs will be merely a tax collector for the Exchequer.  There is no consultation about what damage those charges will do to the development of the service and the imposition it is putting on industrial and commercial costs.  I spoke about this in a different debate but it is well worth making the point again.  The sooner we get away from that system the better, because we have a very expensive telecommunications system and the customers who pay those very high charges are not getting the service they deserve. I know we are in the development stage but, nevertheless, the customer only <Col N="1785" /> thinks of the money he is paying and the return he gets.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the very expensive cost of installation.  It is very important to treat customers properly because basically we are selling a service. Last week I came across a case which speaks for itself.  A lady had a telephone for 20 years, she moved to a different area but the Department were not in a position to provide her with a telephone because there were no terminals in the exchange.  Subsequently they offered her a connection and sent her a bill for three years' rental in advance.  That lady had paid her bills promptly for 20 years, yet the Department implied that she might not be there in six months' time, which is the reason for the three years' advance rental.  Not enough attention has been paid to good customer relations and good business practice.  This is one of the things we shall be looking forward to when the board are in operation as well as a new management approach, new marketing strategy, corporate strategy, new objectives and targets&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On a point of order, I know the previous holders of the office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs have a lot to say on every aspect of the Bill and it is good that they make contributions. However, I appeal to them to keep their contributions short because we should be at about section 70 by now.  There are sections of the Bill which deal with conditions of employment and so on and we will not reach them if Deputies speak for too long.  It is now 10.15 p.m. and we are still at section 15.</P>

      <P>I limited my contributions on this Bill although I wish to speak on every single line of it.  If the Deputy was in the House all day he would know that I made short contributions to most sections.  This is one of the most important sections of the Bill.  We must have <Col N="1786" /> the proper charges and keep our customers happy.  If you have not got customers there will be no business.  Deputy Mac Giolla need not be talking about workers if we have no business.  You sell a service, get the money in and employ workers to do the job.  That is very important. The other sections are equally important but I did not hold up this Bill. I refrained from contributing on many sections.  It is important that we do not price ourselves out of the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Not necessarily.  You need a profit for re-investment and maintenance.  One of the reasons there are complaints from Deputies is that there has been a cutback in relation to repairs because of shortage of finance. The customer is not getting the service for which he is paying.  He is entitled to the repair service that any other business would give him and he is not getting that for the obvious reason that there is a shortage of money.  There is a fictitious notion that a fairy godmother will produce the money for this.  You can only get the money from two sources &mdash; taxation or borrowing.  Large sums have been borrowed for the development of this service and I look forward to this operation making money and to the development all the ancillary services also and to expanding the whole service. If we do not make a profit we cannot do that.  That is my philosophy and if the Minister has a different one, fine.  One final suggestion is that he study the system which operates in France.  Instead of demanding very heavy installation charges they think in terms of giving the customer a share in the company.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor might bow his head when I say something like that, but that is the way the system can be developed. But when you have a company set up, hand it over to Bank of Ireland Finance or some such company who have the ways and means of doing their own business. I set up the telecommunications company to make sure that this service would not be deprived of the necessary capital for its development.  Having developed it, let it remunerate that capital and, if there are profits, why not have 530,000 shareholders &mdash; if that is possible after the capital is remunerated &mdash; and let them partake in the profits?  There might be less vandalism of the telephone service if they were all getting a share of the dividends at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>I would like to touch on the question of profit.  I want this service to make a profit.  I believe in State enterprise and one of the things which has hamstrung State enterprise is lack of that motive.  As a consequence, State enterprise has got a bad name.</P>

      <P>Deputy Taylor also mentioned making provisions for free telephone for old people and so forth.  That is a very desirable social objective, but it should not be the duty of the telephone system.  That is a matter for the Department of Social Welfare and for social policy.  If you hamstring this company with all sorts of overheads or income losses, the danger is that you would be condemning the company to failure and we have enough failures as it is in the State sector.  State enterprise should be given the proper environment within which to operate successfully and it very often has not been given that.  I hope that the section is carried.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No 32:</P>
      <P>In page 14, subsection (2) (a), line 45, to delete &ldquo;7&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;12&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 16 (2) sets out the provisions which must be included in the articles of association of An Post and An Bord Telecom.  Paragraph (a) requires that the number of directors in each case shall be <Col N="1789" /> at least seven, or such greater number as may be determined from time to time by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to confirm the intention to have at least 12 directors on the board of each company. Twelve is the number of directors in the case of each of the State-sponsored bodies to which the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, applies. Taking account of directors to be appointed following election under this Bill when enacted, An Post will have 15 directors, including five employees and one postmaster director.  Bord Telecom Éireann will have 12 directors, including four employee directors.  It is appropriate to say at this stage that it would be my intention on the interim board to make provision for the number of trade union directors to be equal to one-third of the number.  I want to make that clear.  We are proposing to have 12 on the interim board and will therefore be proposing to increase the number of directors by three &mdash; there are nine at the moment &mdash; to ensure two extra trade union directors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Again, we shall not get hung up on this section.  I would certainly agree to 12 as opposed to nine directors. The Workers' Party have a similar amendment to the Minister's, so we are all very much in agreement.  My reason for putting in a minimum number was to ensure a fair balance of appointed and elected directors.  It is absolutely essential that the maximum number be elected from the unions and all the organisations attached to the board.  Unless you have the direct involvement of the workers on the board, you will not have the incentive produced by direct contact between the employees and the board itself.  It is an essential part of this Bill that the needs of the unions and the workers be satisfied by adequate representation on the boards.  I fully subscribe to the minimum number of 12 directors and believe that <Col N="1790" /> directorship will ultimately be 15 on An Post.  The actual number will be decided by the Minister, in consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>The main point is that there will be a fair balance and with the directors from the Post Office Workers Union and one director from the Subpostmasters' Union there will be good participation.  We must bear in mind that on the interim board we have the secretary of POWU, the secretary of the Subpostmasters' Union and appointed directors also.  Direct contact and direct representation of the workers on the board are absolutely essential if the policies are to be implemented by the board and the employees will be fully represented when decisions are made in regard to major policy areas. This would give protection for the workers and assist the consumers, ensuring that all decisions are made in the best interests of the Department and of the consumer as well.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to share some of my time with Deputies Gallagher and Kenny.  The reason for raising this matter is to highlight the replacement of Mount Pleasant national school in Ballyglass, Claremorris, County Mayo, to complain about the conditions in the school and the slowness of the Department in dealing with the entirely unsatisfactory situation being endured by the pupils, parents and community in general.</P>
      <P>The school was built in 1880.  The community have been looking for a replacement school for the past 30 years.  The health officer in County Mayo has condemned the school as being unfit for school purposes for most of that period. Repairs, including repairs to the outside toilets and heating renovations, were carried out in 1971.  This was a temporary measure in the sure knowledge that a new school would be built.  We are no further on and it is now 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The community have been active in their own way in dealing with this matter. A new site has been purchased since March 1981 at a cost of £15,000.  It was completely paid for by the community and they have also collected a sizeable <Col N="1792" /> sum of money towards the construction of a new school.  The site is two-and-a-half acres.  Planning permission has been granted since August 1982.  There are 114 pupils, 57 boys and 57 girls, with a teaching complement of three female teachers and one male principal teacher.</P>
    <P>The toilet facilities are totally unacceptable and, to put it mildly, they are dangerous.  The boys have one closet and a small urinal which is filthy and malfunctioning for most of the year.  They have no handbasin.  The girls have the use of three closets and one handbasin. There is one tap with running water.  The drinking water for the 114 children and their teachers comes from that one tap located in the girls toilet block which is an outside one.  If water is needed for any purpose that is the only tap on the property.</P>
    <P>The roof is dangerous.  Slates are missing from it.  There is widespread dampness and dry rot throughout the school. The school is rat infested, which gives rise to a continuous bad odour, so much so that air freshners have to be used on a continuous basis.</P>
    <P>The children have to eat their lunches on the property.  Only four of them go home for lunch.  They have no place to eat their lunch only in the school.  There is no staff room, no cloakroom and no general purposes room.  It is an entirely unacceptable educational institution in 1983.</P>
    <P>The windows are in a dangerous condition. Not one window is capable of being opened.  The school is on the main road and what was tolerable long ago is no longer acceptable as far as safety is concerned.  The school is a fire hazard. There is only one opening door leading to the school.  The windows will not open and are located at a very high level.  It is accepted by all concerned that the school is a fire hazard.</P>
    <P>Some of those attending the school receive their education in a prefab.  It was 12 years old when it was installed six years ago.  It is totally unsatisfactory.  I do not have to point out to the Minister of State that experience of prefabs has indicated they are not an acceptable place in which to provide education in this day <Col N="1793" /> and age.  The one located at Mount Pleasant is draughty and totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>Widespread illness is present among the school going population.  It is obvious that the illnesses are related to the sanitary facilities, which are absolutely atrocious. It only requires me to point to a recent health report submitted to the Department which was signed by the Health Inspector and acting Assistant Director of Community Care, Dr. Power and Brian Maguire respectively, to highlight the situation in the school.  They draw attention to many of the matters I have raised but particularly to the rat infestation.  They stated in the report that there was rat infestation particularly in and around the prefabricated structure. They also referred to the &ldquo;inadequate sanitary facilities provided&rdquo;.  They say there is dampness throughout the school, the smell of dead rodents everywhere and that the woodwork throughout the school is rotten.  They state it is draughty and that windows cannot be opened or closed.  The final sentence of their report states &ldquo;I am of the opinion that the school should be entirely replaced with a new structure as a matter of utmost urgency&rdquo;. I agree with that.</P>
    <P>The INTO have been involved and threatened strike action on more than one occasion.  The only reason it was not taken was in the interest of the educational needs of the children.  The INTO are on record as saying that conditions in the school were as bad if not worse as anything they had experienced and which was the cause of many a strike in many a location.</P>
    <P>There is a unique community spirit in Ballyglass.  This is a rural area.  It is a farming environment.  We are talking about a concerned community which is becoming impatient.  The lack of aggression by the community should not be taken as an indication of their lack of interest but simply as a measure of their responsibility and maturity.  They are very conscious of the educational needs of their children.  That is the reason they have not complied with the INTO's request to have the school closed by way of strike action.  However, their patience is running out.  They are seeking no more <Col N="1794" /> than justice and the entitlement of every citizen's child.</P>
    <P>Has the Chief State Solicitor cleared the title documents to enable the Department to approve of a grant for the construction of a new school in Ballyglass? We want a commitment to early action from the Minister.  We want a guarantee that expenditure will be incurred from the current expenditure programme on this project this year.  We are aware that the capital programme has not been exhausted and the moneys have not been completely committed to date.  We want an undertaking from the Minister of State that the final design documents and the other documents which will allow the project to go to tender will not be held up because of bureaucratic action.</P>
    <P>I am appealing to the Minister on behalf of a community who have been patient for three decades.  They have been mature and responsible in their attitude as far as the educational needs of their children are concerned.  They can no longer tolerate a situation that is a hazard to the health and welfare of their children.  I am appealing to the Minister to deal sympathetically with this request and to allow the school to be replaced as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom cur leis an méid atá ráite ag an Teachta Flynn i dtaobh na scoile seo.  I thank the Chair for giving us time to bring this very serious matter to the notice of the Minister for Education.  Deputy Flynn has not exaggerated in any way in putting the problem to the Minister.  Deputy Flynn, Deputy Kenny and myself have had occasion to visit the school.  We have seen at first hand the very serious condition of the building.  It is most unfair in this day and age to have children and teachers work under such awful conditions as those obtaining in Ballyglass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy Flynn has said, the local committee are an active interested group who have purchased a suitable site and who have collected the necessary funds to enable the building of a new school to go ahead.  A committee are actively engaged at the moment in collecting funds to make up the local contribution <Col N="1795" /> that will be necessary when the Department decide to go ahead with the building. In small farming areas today it is difficult to acquire suitable sites for schools but in this instance the committee have got the co-operation of a local person who has given a suitable site.  The only hold-up is with the Department.  It is frustrating for parents to have to wait so long for something positive to happen. The area in question is known as Cnoc Álainn&mdash;Mount Pleasant or the lovely hill.  Everything is pleasant in that area but the school which is an eye sore.  It is a blot on the countryside in a good farming area where there are young families and where new houses are being built.</P>
    <P>The children and the teachers in that school are working in what might be described as Third World conditions.  I appeal to the Minister to do his utmost to ensure that those obstacles that may be holding up progress on the building of a new school be removed and that the school be built as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to Deputy Flynn for giving me some of his time during this debate.  I agree entirely with the sentiments that have been expressed by both my colleagues in relation to the conditions in Mount Pleasant school.  The school was built in 1880 and the conditions there in this day and age are scandalous especially when we expect our primary schools to be an extension of the home.  There is no comparison between the quality of the housing in the area and the conditions that the teachers and the children must contend with in this school.</P>
      <P>Deputy Gallagher, Deputy Flynn and myself attended a meeting recently at the school and we found there a very restrained public and teaching staff together with their parish priest.  They put a reasonable case before us and pointed to the fact that there had been delays on the part of the Department.  As Deputy Flynn has said, people are becoming very concerned that something constructive should be done in the short term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the meeting one could even smell the sweet sickly stench of rotten flesh <Col N="1796" /> beneath the floorboards.  The health board have to be called in occasionally. It is not fair to expect teachers and young children to work in such an environment. We are talking about an 18-year old prefab in which windows cannot be opened. This building should not be used for accommodating human beings.  I should like the Minister to tell us whether the Chief State Solicitor has clarified his position finally in relation to the transfer of title.  We have all been contacting him recently but we were informed courteously by his office that due to the backlog in the office, it would be some time before this matter could be dealt with. We were informed that the situation looked all right at the time.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify also what the next stage is in relation to the school if the title has been cleared.  Is he to instruct the Board of Works to prepare detailed plans and designs and, if so, how long will that stage take?  How long will it be before the plans go back to the Department for sanction?  How long will it be before the Department direct that a bill of quantity be prepared and how long will elapse between the preparation of that document and the building of the school going for final tender?  The Minister might tell us also whether a grant has been sanctioned in this case and, if so, if the money will be made available from the present Public Capital Programme for the Department.</P>
    <P>We should like to know also the proportion in terms of grant that will be allocated for the school.  Will it be ten-elevenths or eleven-twelfths?  As Deputy Flynn has said rightly and has been referred to also by Deputy Gallagher, there is a unique community spirit in this area.  Initially there were difficulties about the transfer of the proposed original site in 1978 but as a result of local initiative a suitable site was found.  Also, what kind of school is to be built?  Is it to be a four-roomed school and will it contain a teachers' room and a general purposes room?  What are the projections of the Department in terms of roll numbers in the school for future years?  That is an important question in the context of the size of school being built.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1797" /> I agree entirely with what has been said by both my colleagues and I urge the Minister to clarify the situation here this evening and to assure us that action has been taken in relation to this school and also that we may expect a positive approach to be taken in the short term to get the work under way.</P>
    <P>If conditions at the school should deteriorate between the time of registration of title and the allocation of money after tender, will it be in order for the Minister to sanction some small grant towards essential repairs without hindering the progress on the school?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed) Donal Creed">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>In case anybody would get the impression that I am not aware of the conditions at Mount Pleasant school, I should like to make the point briefly that I am not satisfied with the rate of progress generally in relation to primary schools.  I am examining ways and means of short-circuiting the preparatory work that must take place before the contract stage.  The second point I wish to make and which also is a general point is that I am not satisfied with prefabricated buildings.  I am not satisfied that as an interim arrangement such buildings are a good idea.  They should be used only in extreme circumstances. There is a waste of money in the erection, salvaging and removal of such buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to note the co-operation between the three Deputies from the area in sharing the time for this debate which relates to a problem in their constituency. All three are at one in blaming the Department for the long delay in the provision of a new school at Mount Pleasant. It is necessary to put the record straight.  I am aware that the existing national school premises at Mountpleasant, Claremorris, are not satisfactory.  It was for that reason that my Department proposed in 1977 that the school should be replaced by a new school on a new site and asked the reverend chairman on that date to offer a site.  It has been a long road since 1977.  Although a suitable site was offered and sketch plans were prepared by the Commissioners of Public <Col N="1798" /> Works, my Department were advised in November 1978 that the site was no longer available.  This resulted in a delay in planning as there was considerable difficulty in securing another suitable site. Deputy Flynn was informed of this position on 27 March 1979.  The Commissioners of Public Works notified my Department in May 1980 that an alternative site had been acquired and they were requested by my Department without delay to prepare plans for a new school.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware from my replies to Parliamentary Questions of 20 April and 24 May last that sketch plans were approved by my Department in January 1982 and that the matter of title was being dealt with by the Chief State Solicitor.  I am happy to tell Deputies that he recently confirmed that the title furnished is satisfactory. Therefore my Department are now in a position to sanction a grant towards the cost of the new school, thereby enabling the Commissioners of Public Works to initiate preparation of working drawings.  The grant sanction will issue immediately and the further planning arrangements leading to the invitation of tenders will be a matter for the Commissioners of Public Works.  I assure Deputies that there will be no avoidable delay in my Department in allowing this project to proceed to the invitation of tenders once the planning process has been completed.</P>
    <P>I have dealt at some length with the question of the new school so as to make it quite clear that I fully appreciate the need to replace the existing premises as soon as possible.  In the meantime such essential improvements as may be necessary to maintain a reasonably comfortable environment for pupils and staff may be carried out to the existing premises. Deputy Kenny mentioned this matter and I assure him that between now and the time when a new school will become available any application to my Department in relation to repairs to the existing school will be favourably considered.</P>
    <P>Various improvements have been grant-aided in recent years.  However, my main concern is to have the new school built as soon as possible and Deputies <Col N="1799" /> will appreciate that preparatory works must be carried out.  Deputy Flynn said that no grants had been made available to the school since 1971.  That is not correct. In 1978 external re-plastering of walls, pointing of windows and the building of a wall around part of the site to replace a fence were grant-aided.  Aid was also given in 1978 towards the cost of transporting and re-erecting a double pre-fabricated classroom on the site and an extension of central heating to the pre-fabricated unit.</P>
    <P>I have been asked about the proposed size of the new school.  The question of determining the future educational needs of the area is being examined.  The cost involved would be approximately £200,000 on the basis of a three-classroom school with a general purposes room.  It is possible that this could be adjusted to a four-classroom school with a general purposes room if the educational needs of the area warrant it.</P>
    <P>Deputies will appreciate that there was a problem regarding the site.  A considerable part of the delay was due to the local people because of the difficulty in providing a site.  Initially a site was provided which was subsequently withdrawn and the Office of Public Works were instructed to examine another site.  It was over two years before approval of the second site was reached.  All the delay was not on the side of the Department.</P>
    <P>I have been asked to state the amount of the grant which will be made by my Department.  I am not in a position to give that sort of information because it is not in accordance with procedure to give the amount of the grant.  The three Deputies who have spoken attended a meeting at the school and the reverend manager is well aware of the amount of the grant that will be available.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works have been instructed to prepare sketch plans.  One of the difficulties in relation to primary schools is that the responsibility for building them is shared by the Department and the Office of Public Works.  It takes approximately three months to produce the sketch plans.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>They are about to be given instructions because it was only recently that the site was approved by the Chief State Solicitor.  My officials will examine the sketch plans and the Office of Public Works will then be asked to prepare a bill of quantities.  That will take another three months, approximately.  I cannot give detailed information as to when the project will be ready to go to tender.  I hope there will not be any undue delay and if any delay arises it will not be the fault of my Department.</P>

      <P>I cannot instruct the Office of Public Works to prepare sketch plans immediately.  I can request them to do so and that will be done immediately.  The preparation of the sketch plans normally takes three months and they must then be examined by my officials.  There are many applications before the Department relating to primary schools.  Likewise there will be no delay in asking the Office of Public Works to prepare a bill of quantities.  Deputies may use their influence to make sure that the Office of Public Works do not delay in this regard.</P>

It would probably be six or seven weeks or so before the tenders would be received and examined and a contractor selected and instructed to go ahead. Because of all those imponderables it would be impossible for me to give exact dates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am well aware of the urgency of this matter.  I have seen the file and discussed it with my officials.  Some official used to say that there are three sides to every <Col N="1801" /> story &mdash; yours, mine and the facts.  I am trying to give the facts.  All the delay is not in my Department and quite an amount of it is due to the local problem. I will give the matter my attention but it is not altogether within my responsibility, <Col N="1802" /> since that responsibility is shared by the Office of Public Works.  There will be no undue delay in my Department.</P>

In accordance with the terms of the European Economic Communities/Spain Agreement and Council Regulation No. 1525/70 the problem of imports of copper tubing from Spain was taken up with the EEC Commission, and they have authorised this country to adopt safeguard measures in respect of those imports.

It is my intention, in consultation with the Minister for Industry and Energy, to exercise the power contained in this order to keep imports of the copper tubes in question within acceptable limits taking into account the interests of Irish industry and the requirements of the market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 616 to 624 together.</P>
      <P>The power to make building regulations is contained in section 86 of the Local Government (Planning and Development) Act, 1963.  The purposes for which regulations may be made under that Act are those set out in the Public Health Acts, 1878 and 1890 and relate only to matters of public health and safety.  However, since the enactment of the 1963 Act, a number of factors such as the need to provide for energy conservation and for a more flexible system of building control, as well as developments in the EEC, have made the power available under section 86 of the Act inadequate.</P>
      <P>The enactment of amending legislation is, therefore, necessary before the regulations can be made.  The preparation of the legislation is at an advanced stage and I expect to be in a position to circulate it before the end of the current Dáil session.  As soon as the legislation is enacted, the regulations will be made. Building regulations, by their nature, do not apply to existing buildings but only to the construction of new buildings, structural alterations and extensions to existing buildings and the installation of new services and fittings to buildings where specified material changes of use take place.  It is envisaged that the control system to administer the regulations when they are made should be based on a system of certification by designers and/or builders rather than on a system requiring individual approvals and inspections by local authorities.  Details of the proposed system have not been finalised.  I expect that the matter will be discussed in the House during the passage of the proposed Bill and there will be detailed consultation on it with appropriate interests in the building industry. For this reason, it is not yet possible to quantify what the additional local staffing requirement, if any, might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> The question of bringing the fire parts of the building regulations into force in advance of the other requirements of the regulations was considered carefully but that approach was found to be impracticable because of the extensive and essential interaction between parts of the regulations dealing with fire aspects and those dealing with other constructional matters such as structural stability and thermal and sound insulation.</P>
    <P>I intend to avail of my powers under section 37 of the Fire Services Act, 1981 to make fire safety regulations relating to places of public assembly and the necessary work is proceeding.  It is intended that the regulations will apply to existing buildings and also to new buildings once occupied and in use.</P>
    <P>While the nature of my role in relation to the fire service falls to be considered in the context of the wider area of central/local relationship the adequacy of the present statutory provisions for enforcement of fire safety regulations is being kept under review.  I have no plans to introduce legislation in the matter; however, I should like to draw attention to the fact that under section 20 of the 1981 Act fire authorities have the power, subject only to appeal to the District Court, to issue a fire safety notice which either permanently prohibits the use of a potentially dangerous building or prohibits its use unless or until certain specified precautions have been taken.  Also where a fire authority considers that the risk to people is so serious that the use of a particular premises should be immediately prohibited or restricted until specified measures have been taken to reduce the risk to a reasonable level, it can apply to the High Court for a suitable order.  In such circumstances the High Court may make an interim or interlocutory order if it considers it appropriate.  It should be noted that there are substantial penalties for the breach of fire safety regulations made under section 37 of the 1981 Act &mdash;a maximum of two years imprisonment and/or a £10,000 fine.  Officers of a body corporate can also be found guilty of such an offence.</P>
    <P>The various recommendations made in relation to staffing in the Dublin Fire <Col N="1602" /> Service to which, I presume, the Deputy is referring, have been under consideration in Dublin Corporation and in my Department and a number of short-term measures have been taken to improve the situation.  Longer term measures of the type specifically referred to by the Deputy are under examination.</P>
    <P>As I indicated to the House on 12 May last when I presented the Estimate for my Department, increasing attention is being paid to the standards of training in the fire service and training will be one of the primary functions of the proposed Fire Services Council.  The Council will no doubt consider the nature of any improved training facilities which may be needed.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the Fire Prevention Council's information programme concentrated to a large extent on the schools and youth sector and this is being continued in the current year, along the projects for hotels and places of public assembly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 19 February 1977 and was awarded an invalidity pension from 7 December 1978.  Invalidity pension was paid to her at the rate appropriate to a married woman who is living with her husband.</P>
      <P>The husband of the insured person died on 5 March 1983 and she was awarded a widow's pension from 22 April 1983 at the weekly rate of £36.25.  Her late husband's old age contributory pension was paid to her for six weeks after his death.</P>
      <P>The Social Welfare (Overlapping Benefit) Regulations preclude concurrent payment of invalidity pension with widow's pension.  However, disability benefit is payable at a reduced rate in addition to widow's pension.  The person concerned was therefore advised that it was to her advantage to revert to disability benefit which would be payable to her at a weekly rate of £15.83 in addition to the widow's pension at a weekly rate of £36.25 &mdash; total £52.08.</P>
      <P>Should invalidity pension only continue in payment it would be at the weekly rate of £35.50 resulting in a cash reduction of £16.58 in her weekly income.</P>

      <Col N="1633" /> However, if she did continue to receive invalidity pension she would remain entitled to a free travel pass.

    <P>Invalidity pension was paid up to 25 May 1983 and the amount of invalidity pension paid after 21 April 1983 was regarded as on account of disability benefit. Disability benefit has been restored from 26 May 1983 and payment has been made up to 18 June 1983.</P>
    <P>The person concerned is being advised of the position and asked to state whether, in the circumstances, she wishes to remain on disability benefit or whether she wishes to have invalidity pension restored to her, in which event she would lose the widow's pension.</P>

Her entitlement to disability benefit was then considered.  However, she failed to qualify for payment of that benefit as she had no income contributions at the appropriate rate paid on her behalf in the relevant governing contribution year.  Neither is she eligible for credited contributions as she has an insufficient insurance record.  She was referred for examination on 27 April 1983 by a medical referee who was of the opinion that she was capable of work.

      <P>Her claim to a widow's contributory pension based on her insurance record prior to her husband's death on 16 August 1953, was examined in 1979 at her request but this was refused as she did not have sufficient contributions.  Her husband was never insurably employed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned who claimed unemployment benefit on 13 December 1982 was requested on a number of occasions to furnish the relevant form P.45 or a statement from his employer of his earnings from 6 April 1982 up to the date of his claim which was necessary in order to calculate the amount of pay-related benefit due to him. The information sought has only recently been received and pay-related benefit has been authorised at the weekly rate of £2.23.  All arrears due will be paid to him this week.  Further weekly payments of £70.28 including £2.23 pay-related benefit will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <P>The claim to unemployment benefit made by the person concerned on 12 November 1982 was treated as a totally new claim and payment was authorised at the weekly rate of £94.45.  This rate was in payment when the Deputy put down her question on 3 February 1983 and was given in the reply.  It was discovered last month, however, that the claim should have been linked with earlier claims and that the correct rate should have been £81.25.

      <P>The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was authorised at the weekly rate of £81.95 which is the maximum rate for a married man with four qualified children.  In addition, pay-related benefit was authorised at the weekly rate of £5.29 giving a combined weekly entitlement of £87.24.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the regulations, the combined weekly payment of unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and any income tax refunds received may not exceed 85 per cent of the claimant's average net weekly earnings in the period from 6 April up to the date of claim.  In the case <Col N="1642" /> of the person concerned the limit was calculated at £87.24.</P>
    <P>However, following further inquiries, it has been established that he had been in receipt of disability benefit amounting to £995.15 during this period and taking this into account, his 85 per cent limit has been recalculated at £106.91 a week.  He is therefore entitled to combined payments totalling this amount with effect from 15 February 1983.
