    <P>That a sum not exceeding £606,009,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for the Environment, including grants in lieu or rates on agricultural land and other grants to Local Authorities, grants and other expenses in connection with housing, and miscellaneous schemes, subsidies and grants including certain grants-in-aid.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>When I was speaking on this Estimate on Thursday last I mentioned the situation pertaining to the allocation of local authority houses and the conditions under which our people are forced to exist in order to qualify for local authority housing.  What I did not say, and should have said, was that the detrimental effects on the health of the people concerned are tremendous and, in particular, on the health of children.  I know numerous instances where three or four children are living with their parents in cramped, overcrowded, unfit and unhealthy conditions, such as mobile homes, with no services.  They have been living there for four or five years.  In almost every case the children have marked respiratory problems with the result that they have to have medical cards.  Other expenses are incurred at a later stage through a fault in the system, the fault being that, in order to qualify, people are forced to live in extremely severe and undesirable conditions.  Perhaps <Col N="1711" /> the Minister would consider introducing some amendment to the Housing Act to enable people to improve their housing conditions and afford them an opportunity of being housed by local authorities.  This would encourage people to improve their conditions instead of, as obtains now, going in the opposite direction.</P>
      <P>I had mentioned roads and it was at that point that the House adjourned.  This is something which has received a lot of attention in the last couple of years.  Since 1977 the condition of our main and county roads &mdash; I know it applies not alone in County Kildare but in every other county as well &mdash; has deteriorated dramatically because the finance for their maintenance comes primarily from local authorities.  Since the ability to raise and expend finance was taken from local authorities, or since their position was eroded, the condition of those roads has deteriorated similarly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of ways that the problem could be tackled.  I would ask the Minister to consider transferring some of the funds now allocated from central funds for the maintenance of national primary and secondary routes to these main and county roads.  If that is not done in the near future a number of main and county roads in many counties will have to be closed because it will not be possible for vehicular traffic to gain access to the people living there or to provide services, some of which the local authorities themselves have endeavoured to provide, such as refuse collection and so on.  There have been numerous instances of roads improved under local improvement schemes up to 20 years ago, which involved the expenditure of taxpayers' money, which have now deteriorated to such an extent that the people on whose behalf they were repaired in the first place are now seeking authority from the local authority to take them back and repair them themselves.  That is a disgraceful situation: that taxpayers' money spent many years ago appears to have been wasted mainly because of the inability of the local authority to carry out routine maintenance over a long <Col N="1712" /> period.  I implore the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider reallocating some of those funds from our national primary routes to main and county roads. The benefits would be tremendous and it would have the advantage of reinforcing the funds spent on these roads some years ago.  Generally, our national primary routes are in reasonably good condition, but a common topic now is the condition of the other roads.</P>
    <P>I might add that while the national primary and secondary routes generally are in reasonably good condition the condition of the roads in some of our towns leaves a lot to be desired, albeit that some of those towns are situated on national primary routes.  I would suggest that some action be taken, because of the concentration of traffic on these roads running through our major towns, to ensure that those towns which have suffered most would receive some kind of face lift by way of road improvement within the current year.  I suppose one always thinks of one's own county but I know that in Naas there is a tremendous amount of heavy traffic passing through each day and that the main street there has suffered considerably in recent years. That is one town only in that county; there are others such as Leixlip, Maynooth, Kilcock in North Kildare and others throughout the southern part of the country, Athy and others.  I know a number of local authorities feel that something along those lines should be done, with perhaps a reallocation of the general national primary funds to minor roads.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fire services in his introductory remarks and I am glad to note that he has given such importance to the activities of the fire services in each county.  The unfortunate Stardust disaster brought to everybody's attention the importance of ensuring that a thorough inspection service was available and enforced.  When such inspections are carried out it will be found that people will be only too willing to cooperate with the authorities to ensure that the highest possible standards are maintained where large groups of people, young and old, gather.  In order to avoid <Col N="1713" /> any repetition of the Stardust disaster and a number of others, it is essential that the fire services be extended and that the authority of the county fire officers be felt in each local authority throughout the country.  If that is not the case, then we might well experience other unfortunate incidents.</P>
    <P>One other matter requiring attention &mdash; and this is something that has been brought up continuously at local authority level and by visitors to this country &mdash; is the litter problem.  Recently I travelled along a scenic route, again in my constituency, along the Grand Canal which is a tourist attraction and which takes quite an amount of traffic by native and foreign users who hire cruisers and travel along that canal.  In one part of County Kildare conditions are disgraceful, with a number of abandoned cars, vans, bicycles and other refuse being dumped along that route in full view of everybody travelling along the banks of the canal or by boat on the canal itself.</P>
    <P>In these difficult times, when we are endeavouring to encourage tourism, it is a disgrace to see such lack of civic spirit manifesting itself.  Despite the fact that many local authorities have not yet employed litter wardens I would recommend that some measures be taken to ensure that every local authority has the finance to employ at least a number of litter wardens, thereby ensuring that provisions of the Litter Act are enforced. The Litter Act was passed in 1982, but its provisions will have no effect whatsoever unless there is effected some kind of policing of its provisions, unless some wardens are appointed by local authorities to ensure that people are not allowed to continue to dump indiscriminately along our main roads and other scenic routes.  I notice that the Minister of State sitting in the House is a colleague of mine from County Kildare.  Perhaps he would take note of this matter and use his influence with the Minister.  Even at this late stage in the current year a special effort should be made to ensure that litter wardens are appointed in every county, because otherwise we might as well forget about the Litter Act.</P>
    <P>Also in need of careful examination <Col N="1714" /> are the questions of planning at local, regional and national level.  All of us, members of local authorities, have had experience of planning at local level. Even though it is very difficult from the point of view of the individual who wishes to extend his or her house or who is anxious to build a house for themselves, it seems that the full rigours of the Planning Act are always invoked, with each detail attended to in regard to other information sought by the local authority. Every &ldquo;t&rdquo; must be crossed and every &ldquo;i&rdquo; must be dotted, otherwise there will be long delays.  I suppose that is as it should be.</P>
    <P>It would appear, however, that the same attention to detail is not given to large-scale applications from developers for, perhaps, 2,000 or 3,000 houses. There are a number of cases of housing estates which have not been built in accordance with planning permission.  In some cases houses have been built without any planning permission due to oversights by some people.  An example would be a block of houses built several feet away from the intended site.  Technically those houses do not have planning permission and if at a later stage the owner of one of these houses decides to dispose of it he or she will have to apply for permission to retain before title can be certified.  I would urge that greater attention be given to large-scale applications or at least that the same scrutiny be given to those applications as is given to the applications of individuals who may have lived for many years in the vicinity and find it hard to believe that they should be asked to comply with such a rigorous interpretation of the regulations while large-scale developers do not seem to have the same problems.</P>
    <P>As a member of a regional development organisation I must refer to the absence of any worth-while regional or national planning.  I remember on one occasion going abroad on the only socalled &ldquo;junket&rdquo; in which I ever participated and seeing how another country, Israel, has grappled with the problem of development.  They have done quite a good job in introducing industry and housing in formerly rural areas and have <Col N="1715" /> succeeded in blending the new developments with the aesthetics of these areas.</P>
    <P>New towns have sprung up almost overnight in this country during the past 20 years and the only criterion was that services were available.  We must consider the vast social and economic implications of allowing that criterion to be used in determining where development will take place.  Tallaght has already been mentioned.  I wonder whether or not it would be wise to allow continuation of developments in certain areas of Kildare and to allow an imbalance of population without considering job requirements now and in the future, as well as the other environmental and social hazards which arise when large-scale development is allowed without planning controls.  The time has come when central authority, if local authorities in co-operation with each other are not prepared to do it, should decide where development is to take place and where services are to be provided.  They should not alow a continuation of the present system whereby whenever a main sewer is provided it is considered all right to build houses <i>ad infinitum</i> on either side of it.  This is the wrong reason for development and future generations will condemn us for allowing that to happen.  In many of these new towns the full impact has not yet been felt in relation to employment and social problems such as drug taking which seem to occur in areas which have been badly planned.</P>
    <P>When development of an existing town is taking place it should proceed at a pace which will enable the new population to identify with the area and become part of the community.  If development takes place too rapidly or in a haphazard way this identification with the locality will not be possible.  Unless we come to grips with planning problems in the near future we will have more serious problems.</P>
    <P>I would also mention environmental works.  During the past couple of years funds have been made available for works of an environmental nature. Unfortunately local authorities have found that most of these works involve mechanical rather than labour-intensive <Col N="1716" /> activities.  Any person travelling through the country and seeing all the open spaces, the rivers and canals and all the possibilities for amenities, will find it hard to believe that there are almost 200,000 unemployed.  I said in the Seanad and I repeat now that some scheme should be introduced whereby those who have been unemployed for some time could be given some kind of gainful employment which would be rewarding to themselves and the community.  People could be involved in an unemployment relief scheme involving works of landscaping, grass cutting and maintenance of open spaces where local authorities have not sufficient funds to undertake such works. Many people who are unemployed would be anxious to obtain some kind of part-time employment.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to give careful consideration to the introduction of some kind of programme along the lines of the youth employment scheme.  The people to whom I am referring are unemployed anyway and I can see no reason why they should not be given an extra amount of money per week to be involved in schemes of the kind I have outlined which would be beneficial to themselves and the community.  It would give them a sense of purpose which they do not now have. I do not think there would be conflict with trade union ethics.  It could be done, as in other countries, with the approval of the trade unions and not in conflict with services already being provided by the institutions of the State.</P>
    <P>I wish to draw attention to the small amount of money allocated to County Kildare under the heading of local improvement schemes.  This could cover drainage or road improvements.  In the current year we will receive between £11,000 and £12,000 but this is miniscule in comparison with the amounts allocated to other counties.  I am not suggesting that other counties should not have their allocation but I am saying that a realistic amount should be allocated to counties such as Kildare that are on the route to Dublin.  As I mentioned before, practically all the commercial and domestic traffic to and from the capital city goes <Col N="1717" /> through Kildare and adjoining counties. The Minister should take note of that and allocate a realistic sum toward road improvements.  Much of the deterioration of our roads is caused by lack of drainage.  Once a road becomes waterlogged it is liable to break up.  Special emphasis should be placed on drainage. I am not concerned about whether this means undertaking drainage work on ground considerably away from the roads.  Once water is allowed to lodge on roads the whole road system begins to break up and this is happening in many areas.  I request that we be given a realistic allocation under the local improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the travelling people.  This has become an emotive issue.  As a Christian people we must be prepared to ensure that travelling people are given at least the same chance as everyone else to obtain their own homes. While it is not possible to do that immediately, they should be provided with halts or interim stopping places where services could be provided for them.  This would allow their children to receive some semblance of education and basic health services.  It would ensure that future generations of travelling people would not be treated in the same way as their parents have been treated.</P>
    <P>There are two types of travelling people.  One is what I would call the family who are indigenous to a particular area, whose parents have lived in the place for many years and who do not cause any problem to the community. These people must receive priority and they must be facilitated and encouraged in every way to improve their position. There is also another type of travelling people whom I shall call business people. They appear to have considerable wealth, they camp on the roadside, they drive high-powered cars towing luxurious caravans or mobile homes.  These people seem to create mess everywhere they go. They set up illegal trading points and cause traffic havoc.  In many cases they create a health hazard in that they stay in one area for quite a long time and do not have the use of any facilities.  Many of those people are in a position to house <Col N="1718" /> themselves if necessary.  They have more cash than many of the settled community. I make the qualification that there are genuine travelling people who need to be facilitated and who must be facilitated. We profess to be a Christian people and we must do everything to help them.  Part of the problem is that while everyone says the travellers should be facilitated, equally everyone says the travellers should be facilitated far away from their homes.  The attitude is that it is all very well to house travellers outside someone else's door as long it is not outside one's door.  I hope that Members of this House will set an example by ensuring that when they have to decide whether those unfortunate people are to be housed in an area they will have the courage to say they are citizens of this State, they they have rights and that we will give those rights to them.</P>
    <P>The matter of malicious injuries needs attention.  Claims to local authorities and to central government have been increasing dramatically over the years but in more recent times they have got ever greater.  A system should be devised in co-operation with the insurance companies to ensure that the taxpayer or the State are not burdened unnecessarily with large claims.  There is a sufficiently sophisticated system of insurance provided by private enterprise that should be used to ensure that taxpayers are not faced with excessive burdens.  The present system should be revised and provision should be made to ensure that the burden is removed from the taxpayer.  I am not certain how this can be done but it can and should be done.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister for the Environment for having the courage to introduce a system that provides for charges by local authorities for services provided.  For the last few years members of local authorities have criticised governments for their inability to provide sufficient funds to the local authorities to enable them to give the services the people demand.  They have cited the reason for the diminution of power in local authorities as the removal from them of responsibility regarding the raising and expenditure of revenue.  The Minister is giving back to local authorities <Col N="1719" /> the powers they had some years ago and I say to members of such authorities that those powers should be used.  If they are not used they may be removed and taken back by central government who will have to provide the services.</P>
    <P>Nobody wants to pay more in taxation but if people see that they will get value for money they will support the people who give them that value.  Despite the present stringent times, the people will give support and encouragement to the Minister and to the Government for reintroducing a system that gives to local authorities the power to raise and spend revenue in their areas.  Any revenue collected by way of farm taxation should be collected by the local authorities and it should be spent in the administrative areas concerned.  Perhaps next year allowance might be given to taxpayers who claim for charges paid to local authorities.  That is the one way we can return power to local areas.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor said that urban councils were the answer to a lot of our problems and that some local council would resolve many of the problems in our new towns. I do not accept that.  I believe the only thing which will resolve a lot of the problems which local authorities have faced over the last few years is local power. That is not about new councils but about money, the power to raise that money and to spend it.  Nobody should criticise the Minister for the Environment or the Government for making it possible for local authorities to raise money themselves. Perhaps the central Exchequer might not like an allowance being made for income tax purposes in relation to fees paid to local authorities but once the people see the money being spent they are satisfied.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy spoke about the possibility of house improvement grants being administered by local authorities. That would be a good idea.  The management of local authorities have told us over the last few years that a number of Bills have been introduced which have put further burdens in relation to administration on local authorities but an increase in funds has not been given to <Col N="1720" /> them in order to help them run the extra services and accept the extra responsibilities. I already mentioned the Litter Bill but there are many others.  We should not hive off further responsibilities to local authorities without providing some way for them to finance those services.</P>
    <P>One of the things which a number of other Deputies and I have mentioned on many occasions is the condition of our roads and the need to provide autonomy. Autonomy as far as local authorities are concerned means money.  This money must come from the taxpayers.  It is not true to say that by removing charges and giving relief to local tax payers you will have the same service.  You will not.  That was found out when the rates were removed.  I am not a supporter of the rating system which did not take account of people's ability to pay and was unfair. Everybody forgot when that system was removed the same amount of taxation was collected by the central Exchequer but it did not seem to get back down to the areas it came from.  I hope, during the term of office of the Minister for the Environment and this Government, that situation will be reversed and the services which local authorities have provided successfully over a long number of years, although they are now under strain in providing them, will continue.</P>
    <P>We often criticise our administrators. The administrative staff of all our local authorities have done tremendous work over the years.  We should not forget the long hours they work, their dedication to their jobs and their local knowledge.  If you do not have local knowledge you have not the ability to address yourself to the problems which arise in a particular area.  When you have financing from the central Exchequer you do not have the benefit of local knowledge.  You have that when you are dealing with your own officials in your own county council.  We must encourage any attempt to improve the powers of local authorities.  If that means raising extra revenue we must support it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>Many of the items I am interested in have already been mentioned in the debate.  Deputy Molloy <Col N="1721" /> spoke about the need to give local authorities more authority in carrying out their work and I fully agree with him.  He also made the point that when local authorities are faced with estimates it is almost a <i>fait accompli.</i> When my local authority were faced with a budget this year of £220 million we only met five times to discuss those estimates.  That is not a very satisfactory way to deal with finances of that magnitude.  More time should be given to dealing with such a large budget.</P>
      <P>Several speakers spoke about An Bord Pleanála.  I urge the Minister, in view of the serious problem in relation to the construction industry, to try to alleviate the backlog which An Bord Pleanála have in order to give more employment in that industry.  I have made representations to the Minister in relation to this and I hope he will give it deep consideration.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to our road construction programme.  I am very disappointed at the slow progress made in the implementation of projects under the Road Development Plan for the Eighties published in May 1979.  There has been a considerable shortfall in the funds allocated to roads in 1980, 1981, 1982 and 1983.  I realise the difficulty in public financing and I know that all items in the capital expenditure programme must be subjected to vigorous cost-benefit analysis.  Independent economists claim that new roads will give an immediate and significant economic return.  I understand that job creation in the road construction industry is high.  I also understand that there is very little import content in new road construction.  This distinguishes it from house building which has a very high import content.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the projects for new roads have been identified in the Road Development plan.  It is now a matter of ensuring that finance is available to complete these projects on time.  If money cannot be raised on the public capital programme, then I suggest we make greater efforts to attract private sector participation in financing, design and construction of roads.  One suggestion is that a national road agency should be established to own, develop and maintain the national primary <Col N="1722" /> routes.  This agency would be funded partly by the State and partly by private enterprise.  That is what happens in Italy and Spain.  I suggest we give serious consideration to this as a joint public-private enterprise under the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>The company which operates a similar agency in Italy has permission under Italian law to own a shareholding in a similar foreign enterprise.  Perhaps we could invite the Italian authorities to take a shareholding in our national road agency and so benefit from their expertise in this matter.</P>
    <P>Another matter which has caused me great problems as a member of a local authority is the question of waste disposal. At present the responsibility for the provision of waste disposal facilities rests with local authorities.  There are legal obligations placed on the shoulders of elected councillors.  They are obliged to make a decision on the selection of sites for the dumping of all kinds of waste. They must also approve private disposal sites.  This must be changed and I ask the Minister to consider it.  It is unfair for councillors to be landed with this responsibility. Members of local authorities are obliged to look after the interests of the people who elect them.  Those interests may be very narrow when set against the requirements of the nation for a network of industrial waste disposal sites.  No-one wants a site located near them but jobs can be lost if such sites are not provided. The only answer is to organise a network of industrial waste disposal sites on a national basis.  What I have in mind is to adopt the same approach to the provision of industrial waste infrastructure as was adopted for the provision of national primary roads and the provision of telecommunications.</P>
    <P>I do not exaggerate when I say that the infrastructure for industrial waste disposal is as important as roads and telecommunications. The Government must take action in the matter through the Department of the Environment.  It is not good enough to insist on placing full legal responsibilities on local authorities.  The Department of the Environment must educate the public about the importance <Col N="1723" /> of industrial waste disposal.  The relationship between jobs and the provision of waste disposal facilities must be made clear.  One specific case where education of the community is essential is the provision of the proposed national centre for hazardous waste.  I have heard this referred to as a dump.  My understanding is that the facilities would be more acceptable. It is the sorting, testing and bulking of waste mainly for export.  The intention is to provide recycling and incineration facilities at a later date if this is justified. The operation would be more along the lines of a laboratory and is not and was never intended to be a dump.  People should be told what the position is.  This requires good, positive public relations if we are to obtain their co-operation.</P>
    <P>I am chairman of one of the largest local authorities.  Dublin Corporation have a proud record as regards house-building. Great credit is due to successive Governments since 1977 for financing this programme. Since 1977 in the inner city the local authority built 960 houses.  These are the delightful red brick houses which are praised by all.  At present 615 houses are under construction in the inner city. What saddens me is that it seems to be only the local authority which is interested in developing the inner city.  There is little input from the private sector.  The establishment of the Housing Finance Agency was of great benefit to the people.  Any politician who attends clinics knows that there are people who are very anxious to buy their own houses.  This kind of initiative should be encouraged.</P>
    <P>I was very pleased when the Housing Finance Agency was set up by the Government during their last term of office to provide people with finance to buy their own home.  There is also the other side of the coin where people are rehoused in local authority houses and do not fully understand the value of their house.  The time has come for us to review the operation of all local authority subsidy schemes including housing subsidies. I know this will be an emotional issue but we should pursue the question of equity right across the board for all public expenditure schemes.  If people see that what we are doing is fair and if we explain <Col N="1724" /> it properly to them I am confident it will be accepted.  We must remember that every subsidy or other transfer of payment represents a redistribution of resources from one citizen to another. Taxation and redistribution are essential so that public services can be provided and so that we can move towards a more socially just society.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we do not clearly establish what we want to do and as a result we end up making indiscriminate transfer payments to those who do not need them. I was rather surprised to learn that the average equivalent weekly subsidy for a local authority house in Dublin is £100 per week.  This represents housing at a level which could not possibly be afforded even by people with reasonably high incomes.  What is involved should be explained clearly to taxpayers.  We should make a start by ensuring that an economic rent is set for a local authority house and see that those in need are given appropriate reductions.  By doing that we will give the people who get local authority houses an appreciation of what the State is doing for them.  They will show great respect for what they have inherited.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister for the Environment has joined us, I would like finally to make a plea to him to consider as soon as possible Dublin Corporation's scheme for the sale of flats which has been prepared by the corporation and passed on to the Minister for his sanction.  We have made tremendous progress in the sale of houses to local authority tenants, and that is good because those people then take a greater interest in their houses. We hope to extend that to the flats complex. We have a certain problem there at present in the inner city.  All areas have that problem.  Nevertheless, if we can get permission from the Minister for the Environment to sell flats to people who live in the inner city we will create a better atmosphere.  People will have a better understanding of the situation in that at least they will own their flats. Thereby a better environment will be created and some of the problems facing the inner city at present will be eliminated. <Col N="1725" /> The Department of the Environment is one which affects very many people.  I congratulate the Minister for increasing the housing subsidy this year by 11 per cent.  I wish him well in his office as Minister for the Environment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of a local authority representing an area which is now part of my constituency, Tallaght, I am concerned about the very high unemployment there.  I have listened with interest to some of the speakers, particularly Deputy Durkan from Kildare, talking about local authorities providing more employment, the question of open spaces and so on.  I hope that local authorities will be encouraged to provide more employment.  We have so many people on the dole and everybody is anxious that something will be done to provide gainful employment.  The local authorities could help here in, for instance, the care and maintenance of open spaces, rural laneways and so on.</P>
      <P>Still in relation to employment, I hope that the Minister for the Environment will encourage the local authorities to take on more apprentices.  Great scope should be given to the local authorities in this.  Here I am speaking not so much about Dublin Corporation but about Dublin County Council, of which I am a member.  The provision of apprenticeships would encourage young people to take an interest in trades and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Speaking as representing a constituency which is part rural and part urban, I ask the Minister to have a look at the situation from the point of view of planning. Part of my constituency is known as the hill area and it is virtually impossible for local people there to get planning permission to provide houses for themselves or their sons and daughters.  This is because of a reservoir in the Dublin mountains which is essential for the supply of water to Dublin.  Because of the nature of the environment, with small rivers and feeder streams, it is virtually impossible to obtain planning permission there.  As a result sons and daughters of the local people are forced to go on the local authority housing list, thus increasing <Col N="1726" /> the burden on the local authority.  At this stage the granting of planning permission, which would allow for the occasional draining of septic tanks, should be possible rather than the application of the usual by-law conditions.  If by any chance a person is lucky enough to get planning permission &mdash; which I have no hesitation in saying may be possible at times by use of section 4 &mdash; Dublin Corporation will then appeal to An Bord Pleanála, the appeal probably will be upheld and in the end the applicant still will not have planning permission.  I ask the Minister to look at this area and see if he can help such people.</P>
    <P>We have still the old problem, the old sore, of the taking in charge of estates. Developers display tremendous enthusiasm and beautiful layouts when seeking planning permission, but when the houses are built the problem of taking the estates in charge arises.  People who have purchased the houses are forced to live there in a very difficult situation with roads unfinished, grass verges and open spaces not properly laid out and the estate not taken in charge.  This is causing tremendous problems in the city and county of Dublin.  I hope that through the initiative of the Minister a greater effort will be made to expedite a remedy to this problem.</P>
    <P>We should consider the question of the provision of materials for the building industry.  It is a pity that so many of our building materials must be imported.  For instance, could our native timber industry be developed to a greater extent? Could we use our natural resources for the production of cement?  Could we thus help to reduce our imports?</P>
    <P>My constituency includes half the new town of Tallaght, which has a population of between 60,000 and 70,000, and the projected population is in the region of 150,000.  Again I ask the Minister to consider the question of the encouragment of greater employment through the local authorities.  I ask him to consider also requesting the local authorities to take on more apprentices, who are now becoming far more difficult to obtain. The Minister mentioned that it was very difficult to find suitable personnel.  I have <Col N="1727" /> a reasonable knowledge of the building trade; I am aware that this situation existed for some time and there is a possibility that it could arise again.  This is one way in which it could be helped and I ask the Minister to consider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine my speech to several proposals which I should like to put to the Minister for his consideration.  (1) Anyone now living in a county council cottage who qualifies for a free telephone would automatically qualify for exemption from payment of water rates.  (2) That local authorities who are now obliged to build expensive modern houses for tenants would be empowered, under amended legislation, to purchase existing county council cottages, refurbish and relet or sell them at current values.  (3) That in city areas, people living in corporation or local authority housing schemes and who have been paying rent for a minimum of a specified number of years, say 50 years, in the same family, would automatically qualify for those houses and would not be expected to pay any more.  We have a ludicrous situation at present where people in Killeely and St. Mary's Park, Limerick, have been paying rent for 40 years and if they want to buy their houses they have to go into another scheme for 25 years.  (4) On the question of local financing of authorities, the Minister should look at the idea of lotteries as a means of generating extra local capital to enable local authorities to meet the demands of their various regions.  Some cities, like Limerick, have been crucified under the present arrangement whereby we are given a specified amount each year from the Department, following the abolition of the domestic rate in 1977.  Other counties do not suffer as badly as Limerick in this respect and some help should be given in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Incineration is one of the greatest resources created by man.  It is as valuable as coal, oil or any other minerals because it will be there as long as people are on earth, because they create litter and waste.  In the city of Aarhus, Denmark, which is twice the size of Cork, <Col N="1728" /> they installed a public incineration plant four years ago.  They heated the whole city and the cost of the installation was paid back within two years.  Last year they made a profit from incineration of 12 million Kroner, which is about £2 million, having heated and cleaned the whole city and guaranteed worth-while employment to local authority workers.</P>
    <P>I have a booklet here issued by the Department of Industry and Energy on the subject of energy conservation but there is no reference to the idea of incineration of public waste as an energy resource.  It is the only one you can ultimately rely on.  When coal and oil are gone we will still have waste and it is a terrible reflection on whoever prepared the document.</P>
    <P>Something should be done with regard to the provision of money for the repair of houses.  A massive con job is being done by local authorities.  People are buying houses under the tenant purchase scheme and they are being told they will be repaired within a number of years. However, there is no money available to do this and people have been waiting ten, 12 or even 15 years to have repairs done. I ask the Minister to do something about this problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I go into my replies in relation to many suggestions made in this debate, I should like to refer to a certain matter which might not strictly be within the Estimates but which has been referred to this week in Dáil Éireann.  It refers to my own resignation from local authorities within the Department.  Certain allegations were made as to conflict of interests etc. but I do not see that any conflict of interest has taken place by virtue of the fact that I remained on as a member of Kerry County Council for a number of months.  When I was not present in the House, the Leader of the Opposition used that topic to fuel the rumour which is rampant, even in my own constituency, that I might be looking for a constituency in the metropolis.  This rumour, which had no bearing on the question, is unfounded.  It was used by Fianna Fáil during the last election campaign <Col N="1729" /> in public and in private.  I heard it on many occasions.  I have been elected by the people of North Kerry.  They were not misled during the election campaign and I trust they will not be misled by this rumour.  I am prepared to put up with the travelling and inconveniences and I have no intention of leaving the people who elected me in North Kerry.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molloy's contribution in relation to the building industry was a grossly inaccurate one and &mdash; what is even more important &mdash; a grossly irresponsible one. He made wild allegations about the Government's policy in regard to the industry which were pathetic in their absurdity and patently unfounded.  I fully accept that the building industry is going through a difficult period but I am also certain that Deputy Molloy's intemperate and destructive contribution to this debate will do absolutely nothing to help the industry and that it could indeed be very damaging to the industry if it were not for the fact that nobody is likely to pay much heed to what the Deputy said or place any credence on the extreme views that he put forward.  One could indeed be forgiven for thinking that these views were, in fact, calculated to talk the industry into a crisis.</P>
      <P>Everyone knows that, by virtue of the nature of the building industry, confidence in the industry is always a delicate thing and that dire and unfounded projections of the future are likely only to compound its problems.  Deputy Molloy knows that as well as anyone else.  Surely then, even he must see that he was doing the industry as a whole, the many thousands who work in it, and indeed the country generally, a grave disservice when he made the totally unjustifiable and extraordinary accusation that the Government are &ldquo;deliberately setting out to destroy the construction industry&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This to me is simply playing cheap politics with the industry.  The industry deserves better than that from this House.  As far as I am concerned, it deserves to have its problems examined in a rational and constructive manner and in a manner free of emotive and unfounded assertions.  That is the basis of my approach to the industry and I would <Col N="1730" /> suggest that Deputy Molloy should think again before making similar unhelpful outbursts in the future.</P>
    <P>Surely too, Deputy Molloy realises that we have gone past the stage at which it is sufficient to talk as though the solution to the industry's problems is simply to throw more and more public money at it.  When he sheds crocodile tears over the level of expenditure devoted to the industry in the public capital programme, surely there is an obligation on him to say where he thinks the additional expenditure should come from.  For the Deputy's information, I should say that I have met both sides of the industry &mdash; together and separately &mdash; and I have found a considerable measure of agreement for the view that there are unavoidable constraints on the amounts that can be allocated from the public purse for construction work and that it is simply not possible for the State to deploy resources on a scale that would completely offset the decline that has taken place in private investment as a result of the recession.</P>
    <P>Surely too, Deputy Molloy is aware of the simple fact that it is just not possible to insulate the building industry from what is happening in the rest of the economy.  But the Deputy nonetheless talks as though the industry existed in a vacuum, completely untouched by all that is happening around it.  Is it necessary to emphasise that for a large part of its output, the industry inevitably has to rely on the level of demand for its services coming from the private sector?  Does the Deputy think that it is within the competence of any Government in this country to dream up this kind of demand, or generate it artificially, whenever it does not exist to the extent desired?  If he does, he is either living in cloud cuckoo-land, which has many residents nowadays, or he has created some marvellous new economic system but he has not told anybody else about it.</P>
    <P>I do not want to dwell too long on Deputy Molloy's remarks since, essentially, they were too simplistic and too obviously destructive in their approach to be taken seriously.  I would, however, like to make a few further points.</P>
    <P>First of all, there is a clear implication <Col N="1731" /> running through his remarks that it is the Government's job to pour money into the building industry regardless of the need for, or the quality of, the investment that would result.  This kind of approach may have served as an investment policy when Fianna Fáil were in office but it is also one of the main reasons that the country is now saddled with the burden of repaying vast borrowings which did not give a proper return in either economic or social terms.  That kind of thoughtless investment policy is also one of the reasons for the industry's present difficulties.  Everyone connected with the building industry knows that its best interests are served if it can maintain an even rate of development and avoid steep fluctuations in output, either upwards or downwards.  In fact, as recently as yesterday I met a deputation from the building industry in my own part of the country and they accepted that the peaks are as dangerous to this industry as the valley periods because the effect on the industry when it is overheated does not provide any solution to their problems.  The events of 1979 are now seen in retrospect as having been an unfortunate development and one from which the industry subsequently suffered.</P>
    <P>The facts of the matter are that the building industry here was grossly overheated, for political reasons, during the period from 1977 to 1979; that the rate of growth then experienced simply could not be maintained without causing disruption in other sectors; and that &mdash; as experience here and in other counties has shown &mdash; periods of undue growth and overheating in the industry almost inevitably culminate in a period of declining output.</P>
    <P>We may never be able to plan a precise level of output for the industry &mdash; because, as I have said, the industry's output inevitably depends in large part on what is happening in other sectors of the economy &mdash; but I have no doubt that the proper course is to maintain constructive liaison and dialogue with the industry and to seek through mutual co-operation to keep it on an even keel and prevent as far as we can the swings in output that <Col N="1732" /> have so bedevilled it in the past.  It is on this basis that I intend to deal with the industry &mdash; accepting, as I do, its central importance in the context of both economic and social development.</P>
    <P>Reference was made by Deputy Molloy to the famous £120 million global contingency fund which, according to the previous Government's public capital programme, was to be allocated &ldquo;in the light of the budgetary outlook&rdquo;.  In retrospect it is impossible to know what exactly those words, &ldquo;in the light of the budgetary outlook&rdquo;, were intended to mean but I can tell the Deputy that when we came into office the budgetary outlook was very stark and, so far as we could see, the £120 million was just a book figure and simply did not exist.</P>
    <P>In so far as the services for which my Department have direct responsibility are concerned, I should just like to make a few final points.  The total amount provided this year comes to £208 million for local authority housing.  Initial allocations to meet commitments on on-going schemes and provide for some new work have already been made and a further £63 million for new schemes will be allocated very soon.  In the meantime, we are not holding up any projected schemes for want of money.  I should also emphasise that the proportion of the total local authority housing allocation that is available this year for new schemes is higher than it has been for some time past.  Incidentally, returns furnished to my Department by local authorities show that the number employed on housing schemes at the end of February was about 1,000 above the number at the corresponding date in 1982.</P>
    <P>In relation to roads, the position is that total investment this year in road works is estimated to amount to £185 million which represents an increase of about £20 over the figure for 1982.  Taken in conjunction with the steps that we have taken to improve the financing of local authorities, the increased investment available should ensure that there will be no need for local authorities to lay off workers or put them on short-time working.</P>
    <P>The capital allocation this year for the sanitary services programme has been <Col N="1733" /> increased by about 17 per cent over the 1982 level and the level of employment on the programme is projected to grow more or less correspondingly.  Recently, I announced the release of a total of 59 new schemes with an estimated total value of £75 million.  This release of schemes is, I understand, unprecedented and it should give a significant boost to the civil engineering sector of the building industry.</P>
    <P>On the private housing side, Deputy Molloy is apparently concerned that the Housing Finance Agency will not have enough money to meet its commitments. Let me assure him that the reduction of the agency's allocation did not represent a cut-back in its activities but resulted simply from a revised estimate of its requirements.  The agency is now in full business and will have sufficient funds to meet the demands arising this year.  I must say that I was surprised at the Deputy's concern for the agency in view of the attitude that his party took when the relevant Bill was going through this House.  I should also say that the agency is accepted now by those involved in industry as providing valuable support for the private housing sector and helping to maintain employment.</P>
    <P>Another bright feature in the industry at present is the effects of the tax incentives for rented housing available under sections 23 and 24 of the Finance Act, 1981.  Deputies will have seen from the Finance Bill that these incentives are being extended for a further three years to 31 March 1987 and that the limit on the size of apartments that may qualify under the section is being increased.  I understand that the continuation of the concession is likely to result in about £25 million worth of new apartment work going ahead in the near future.</P>
    <P>I am sure the remarks made by Deputy Molloy about the fact that the housing grants schemes are administered by the Department rather than by local authorities come as a surprise to many Deputies, even in his own party, who are familiar with Fianna Fáil policy in this matter over the years.  Whether the administration of these grants should be devolved to local authorities is something on which I have <Col N="1734" /> an open mind at this stage &mdash; particularly in the case of house improvement grants.</P>
    <P>In the case of new house grants it must be remembered that the first-time owner-occupier condition requires that check to establish eligibility be made on a national basis.  The Department keep a central index of all grant payments against which new applications are checked.  Any changes in administration would have to guard against any weakening of these controls with consequent risk of payments being made to unqualified persons.  It is also fair to say that the extent to which these grants have been chopped and changed over recent years would not have lent itself to easy devolution. The possibility of increased costs of administration and problems about the deployment of staff will also have to be taken into account in any review of the existing situation.  A complaint has also been made in the debate that the level of housing grants has not kept pace with inflation.  It is difficult to accept this from a Deputy whose party has over the years never had a policy of linking grant levels to inflation and that committed the monumental blunder of abolishing, to all intents and purposes, the whole range of home improvement grants.  The previous Coalition Government had to remedy this situation by restoring a scheme of house improvement grants in October 1981.  This year a total of £9.5 million is being provided for these grants compared with expenditure of £4.4 million last year.</P>
    <P>There has also been a substantial increase in the amounts being made available under the new house grants and mortgage subsidy schemes.  In 1982, expenditure under these was £16.8 million whereas we have allocated £22.8 million this year.  It is encouraging to note that the level of applications for grants and subsidy continues to be very high. The number of approvals in the first three months of this year was over 35 per cent of the total approved last year showing a substantial increase in demand over past year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy raised the general question of the NBA stating in particular that nobody had ever looked at it to see <Col N="1735" /> if there was any need for its continuation. I would remind the Deputy that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Statesponsored Bodies examined the operations of the agency and their findings are given in their January 1981 report.  The committee, who were assisted by independent technical and administrative assessors, commented favourably on the agency's activities.</P>
    <P>Having examined criticisms of the NBA the Committee stated at paragraph 27:</P>
    <P>As the generally favourable comments received by the Committee from local authorities indicate, the balance of opinion is now strongly with the NBA.  Shortcomings of both a technical and organisational nature that may have been encountered in the past appear to the Joint Committee to have been largely eliminated.</P>
    <P>Far from recommending the abolition of the agency, the committee stated that it had &ldquo;no objection to the expansion and diversification of the NBA into a State building agency&rdquo; and it goes on to say that &ldquo;there could be overall savings to the State if the building management expertise of the NBA and its widespread knowledge of building contractors in different parts of the country were availed of by, for example, the Departments of Health, Posts and Telegraphs, Education, the Office of Public Works and the IDA&rdquo;.  This was at paragraph 14 of the report.</P>
    <P>I would also make the point that the services of the NBA are not forced on any local authority.  It offers a comprehensive package deal to local authorities for the construction of houses.  In this it must compete with the cost of the alternatives open to the local authorities and this competitive element goes a long way towards ensuring that its operations are both efficient and economic.  The agency had 1,514 houses under construction at 31 December last.</P>
    <P>Comments were made that the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1983, which contains new charging powers for local authorities, <Col N="1736" /> represents a downgrading of the role of the elected members.  This Bill will be before the House shortly.  I do not see that as being the case.  Indeed, the arrangements which will apply under the Bill are exactly the same as those which apply in relation to charges made under existing legislation and are, in my view, the correct ones.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the amount of money to be raised by a local authority by way of charges is governed by the estimate which is adopted by that authority.  The adoption of the estimate is, of course, a reserved function and through the exercise of that function the elected members can dictate the policy the manager will have to follow in relation to charges.</P>
    <P>In any event, there is a long tradition in our local government system of managers consulting councils, and <i>vice versa</i>, in the exercise of their respective functions. I have no reason to believe this will change.  I have every confidence that the existing good relationship and common sense between managers and councillors will continue to apply to the application of charges for services.</P>
    <P>Certain remarks were made on the level of control which local authority members exercise over expenditure and it was suggested that even the estimates meetings have become less meaningful. One has to accept that, over the past five years, estimates meetings had become less meaningful because of the limiting of increases in rate poundage levels by succesive Ministers since 1977.  The very tight control exercised at central level must have been very frustrating and, in practice, left the local authorities with little or no scope for discretionary spending. This has now been changed.</P>
    <P>As I indicated in my opening speech, this year I departed from the practice of limiting rate poundage increases, and local authorities have been free to strike whatever rate they wished.  They will also be able to raise additional revenue as they deem appropriate from charges under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) (No. 2) Bill, 1983.  This means that they will again be in the position of making positive discretionary <Col N="1737" /> decisions at local level in relation to projects and of deciding on the levels of revenue to be raised.</P>
    <P>The question of local government structures in the Dublin area was raised by Deputy Taylor and Deputy Walsh this morning.  Since 1971 various reports and studies have been published and, particularly in the case of Dublin, dissatisfaction has been expressed in relation to existing structures.  It is my wish to make the local government system stronger, more effective and more democratic.  I am having this whole area of local government structures examined with these aims in mind.  I can assure Deputies that I am approaching this matter with an open mind and with the intention of improving the local government system.</P>
    <P>We can all see for ourselves that the development of the city of Dublin and the surrounding areas has taken place without corresponding development in local government structures.  The whole matter is being examined and I should like to think we will be putting forward proposals within the lifetime of this Government for local government reform.</P>
    <P>Deputy Molloy spoke at length about An Bord Pleanála and the proposal to reconstitute it.  I will not take up too much of the time of the House by dealing with this matter in detail because there will be an opportunity of debating all aspects of it when the legislation which is now at an advanced stage comes before the House in a few weeks.  I feel I must set the record straight in relation to a number of points.</P>
    <P>A Fianna Fáil spokesman on the Environment should be the last person in this House to make allegations about the constitution of the board or to bring up the subject of ulterior political motives, as Deputy Molloy did.  Let me remind the Deputy that on virtually the last day of the Fianna Fáil Government's term of office in June 1981 three new appointments were made to the board, increasing its membership to eight.  In December 1982, just a few days before the last Fianna Fáil Government went out of office, two further additional members <Col N="1738" /> were added, bringing the overall total to ten.</P>
    <P>It was this carry-on that reduced the standing and credibility of the board in the public view to such an extent that new legislation was made imperative.  I have no intention of debating the credentials of the members of the board or of casting any doubts on their integrity but it is incredible against this background, to find myself being lectured by Deputy Molloy about appointing one's friends to be members of the board, and so on.  Any allegations about appointments I might make are unfounded.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to disclose details of the legislation which will be presented shortly, but I can assure the House &mdash; and this is important &mdash; that one of the objectives will be to establish a system of appointment which will ensure that justice is seen to be done and will preclude actions of the kind taken by my predecessors in 1981 and 1982.</P>
    <P>I give credit to Deputy Molloy for recognising the importance of an adequate inspectorate within An Bord Pleanála.  Unfortunately, his Fianna Fáil colleague in Government seemed to think it more important to add to the board membership than to the inspectorate. The former Minister announced in December 1982 that he was arranging to have two additional inspectors appointed, but it was left to me to give effect to this, and I am now attempting to have two additional posts filled in the inspectorate.  As for Deputy Molloy's allegation that I was being unfair to the staff of the planning inspectorate, may I remind him that I made no allegations whatsoever at any time about the staff and, in particular, did not suggest that the present unsatisfactory arrears situation is attributable to them.  In fact, the output of inspectors' reports in recent times has far exceeded the output of decisions by the board.</P>
    <P>Because of his selective use of statistics, I find it difficult to pin down Deputy Molloy's real concern about the arrears situation.  The relevant facts are simple enough.  In the past two years, the number of appeals on hands has virtually doubled and, at 30 April last, was 3,582.  The <Col N="1739" /> average number of decisions made by the board each month has been falling and the time taken to deal with particular appeals has been increasing.  In 1982, only 3,662 appeals were disposed of, as against 4,059 in 1981 and 4,271 in 1980. The number of professional staff available was 15 in each of those years, so the professional staffing position cannot explain the drop in output of over 600 appeal decisions between 1980 and 1982.</P>
    <P>Reconstitution of the board will not bring about an immediate solution of the arrears problem.  Unfortunately, the reality is that the arrears situation deteriorated during the past 18 months and that other action is needed if the backlog is to be reduced to an acceptable level.  My Department have had extensive consultation with the chairman of the board and, as a result, I have arranged for additional administrative and professional staff to be made available, on a temporary basis, by my Department, in an effort to reduce the arrears to a level with which the normal staff complement can cope.  I am hopeful that this action will bring about some improvement in the position in the short term.  Ultimately, however, it is the board who are responsible for securing that the organisation operates efficiently, that staff resources available are used to best advantage, that systems and procedures are revised and refined and, generally, that direction and leadership are provided. I shall continue to press the existing board to improve its performance and shall take whatever steps are open to me to assist them in this regard.</P>
    <P>The question of travelling people was raised in the course of this debate by Deputy Taylor.  The Deputy suggested that I should set up a task force to deal, on a central basis, with the question of traveller settlement.  In the short number of months I have been in office in the Department of the Environment I have come to understand the serious situation, particularly in the Dublin area, which I think prompted the Deputy's suggestion. I am aware also of Dublin County Council's plans for settlement, that two groups of bungalows are being erected, <Col N="1740" /> that five locations have been approved for serviced sites and that sustained consultations are taking place between local officials and residents' groups in connection with further plans for sites which have met with widespread opposition.</P>
    <P>As I said in my opening address on Thursday last, I wrote to managers when I received the result of the count of travellers taken by the local authorities in November 1982 and I emphasised the importance of giving the travellers full assistance and recognition under the housing code as well as providing the necessary sites for those who are not seeking to be housed.  In his reply to me dated 4 May, the Dublin City and County Manager indicated his view that it would not solve all the problems to take the problem away from the local authority as had been suggested from time to time. His view was that the best way to make progress must be to house many more families in individual houses or in group housing.  Personally, I also would like to see the local authority make a conscious drive on this aspect, with full assistance from their social workers, in determining the kind of accommodation suited to each case.</P>
    <P>There will obviously still be a need for sites but a need which would be reduced in extent.  In this regard, I think the local authority must complete suitable consultations with the local interests concerned about proposed locations before making rational decisions, availing of the technical and administrative advice available to them as to suitability and availability of particular sites.</P>
    <P>The Travelling People Review Body also considered the question of responsibility for sites and, on balance, recommended that it should be left with the local authorities.  As I said on Thursday last, a group of Ministers will be identifying those recommendations which can be implemented in the current financial situation.</P>
    <P>The question of lead content in petrol was also raised by Deputies Taylor and Molloy.  The statement of Deputy Molloy that, first, Ireland has a permissible lead level in petrol of 0.64 grammes per litre and, secondly, that we stand alone in <Col N="1741" /> exceeding the maximum limit permitted by the EEC &mdash; 0.40 grammes per litre &mdash; are both incorrect.  Initially Ireland was allowed a five year derogation with effect from 1 January 1981 from the requirements of the relevant EEC Directive because of the technical and economic problems which immediate implementation posed for the Whitegate Refinery.  The derogation enabled petrol with a lead content of 0.64 grammes per litre to continue to be marketed here for 5 years.  Following the acquisition by the Irish National Petroleum Company of the Whitegate Refinery on behalf of the State the Government decided that petrol from the refinery would not have a lead content in excess of 0.40 grammes per litre and the European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) (Amendment) Regulations, 1982 which came into operation on 1 September 1982 gave effect to this decision.  Irish standards are therefore in line with the requirements of the 1978 EEC Directive.</P>
    <P>The British Government recently announced the acceptance of the recommendations of a Royal Commission Report which has recommended total elimination of lead from petrol by 1990. They have undertaken to discuss the matter with other member states at the Council of Ministers meeting next month.  At present the EEC Directive of 1978 sets 0.15 as the lower limit for lead content and the Irish National Petroleum Company has recently engaged consultants (the Finnish State Oil Company) to advise on the capital and operating cost implications for Whitegate of lowering the lead content from 0.40 to 0.15 grammes per litre.</P>
    <P>The question of air pollution in the Dublin area was raised by Deputy Taylor also.  I should say that we are constantly monitoring the smoke and sulphur dioxide levels in the Dublin area.  While there was a general decline in the level of both pollutants through the 1970s it became clear, towards the end of the decade, that this downward trend was coming to an end.  In general the readings obtained have been well within the air quality standards laid down in an EEC Directive of 15 July 1980.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1742" /> The Dublin air quality situation is the subject of continuous review and discussions with various interests are currently taking place with a view to formulating an effective strategy to promote clean fuel usage in both the industrial and domestic sectors.  The recent arrival of piped natural gas in the Dublin area will certainly be a significant factor.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor referred to the possible introduction of smokeless zones.  This would require legislation, as well as considerable investment in suitable types of fuel burners and new kinds of restriction of fuel use in the areas concerned.  It is, however, the intention that legislation relating to environmental protection generally should be improved, strengthened and developed here as the need arises, and the law and regulations are being kept under review in this connection.</P>
    <P>The provision of vehicle insurance by Motor Taxation Offices and questions relating to the Motor Insurers' Bureau in the case of hit-and-run victims was raised by Deputy Taylor.  On the provision by Motor Taxation Officers of information relating to the insurance of a vehicle I would point out that article 23 of the Road Vehicle (Registration and Licensing) Regulations, 1982, which came into effect on 1 February 1983, empowers a licensing authority to supply to any person who satisfies the licensing authority that he has reasonable cause there for such particulars, including insurance, of any vehicle registered with that licensing authority as are available in the vehicle register.  The charge for the supply of such particulars is £3.  Obviously, as this has been in operation for the past two months only, we will be monitoring it in practice to ensure that it has the effect we set out to achieve and, if necessary, we will make any alterations so that this information will be readily available where necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor also mentioned the question of compensation for victims of accidents involving hit-and-run drivers. The present position is that the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland have undertaken to give sympathetic consideration to the making of <i>ex gratia</i> payments in respect of serious and permanent disablement <Col N="1743" /> or death caused by such a driver. The question of compensation for personal injuries caused by untraced drivers is at present under discussion within the framework of a directive regarding motor insurance generally which is being considered by the EEC.  I can only agree with the Deputy's remarks as to the unfortunate consequences of hit-and-run accidents which are not part of the Motor Insurers' Bureau agreement.  Certainly we can examine the possibility of updating this agreement.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Durkan's comments on the whole question of litter, I support what he had to say about the importance of the enforcement of the Litter Act and call on all local authorities to make full use of the wide powers conferred on them by that Act.  These powers include power to deal with abandoned cars and other scrap as well as to operate an on-the-spot fine system and to prosecute in the courts.  I cannot accept that scarcity of funds is a problem as great funds are not needed.  The easing of local authorities' revenue position by additional rates suport provision in the current year, plus the substantial grants for environmental works, means that limited costs are involved in giving proper effect to the provisions of the Act.  They should not present any real difficulty for any authority.  The way has been provided; it is a matter of having the will, if the will is there, to cope with the serious litter problem we have in this country and to raise the level of consciousness not only at local authority level but throughout the community.</P>
    <P>The question of planning problems in his area was raised by Deputy Durkan also.  In my opening remarks I did say that there are special planning problems in the eastern region.  The Eastern Regional Development Organisation have undertaken a major study aimed at identifying the best strategy for the development of this region.  Work of this type is also being undertaken in a number of other regions.  The findings of these investigations will be of importance.</P>
    <P>The question of unfinished estates &mdash; something we all see in our respective <Col N="1744" /> areas &mdash; was referred to by a number of Deputies.  I should say that, apart from the immediate proposals to introduce a Bill to reconstitute An Bord Pleanála, there are proposals to make some amendments also to planning appeals and have a general review carried out of planning law, to include examination of any changes which might improve the existing situation regarding the enforcement of planning control, particularly in the case of housing estates.  Deputy Taylor's suggestion regarding the possibility of making company directors personally liable for the completion of estates will be considered in this connection.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh referred to the possible provision of additional employment through local authorities.  I would point out that £8 million has already been allocated for environmental works in 1983 and a further £2 million is on offer to local authorities for particular schemes to be submitted by them.  A certain number of submissions have been made.  The provision of £10 million essentially for youth employment will have a significant effect on the employment level to be maintained by local authorities in 1983.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies from the Dublin area have referred to the development of Tallaght and the problem of unfinished estates in Tallaght and other expanding areas.  I am aware that Dublin County Council are actively pursuing defaulting developers to ensure that estates are completed to a suitable standard which enables the local authorities to take their maintenance in charge.  In an area such as Tallaght, which is experiencing rapid development, problems will arise in the provision of facilities and amenities to keep pace with the massive housing development.  Delays can be experienced in the provision of shopping and other commercial facilities.  The county council in their development plan have made spatial provision for shopping and commercial activities and at present there are district-type shopping provisions at Tallaght village, Kilnamanagh and Firhouse as well as neighbourhood centres at Dodder, Springfield, Castletymon, Tymon North and Aylesbury.  I would hope that when the county council have <Col N="1745" /> fully implemented their development plan the town of Tallaght and other expanding areas on the periphery of Dublin will provide for their predominantly young population a satisfactory environment in which to live, complete with all the amenities comparable to those of other towns of similar size throughout the country which developed over a longer period and have agreater community structure than is possible in newer areas.  The Department of the Environment will give every assistance to local authorities in this area to cope with the problems of expansion in order to have a controlled growth which will add to the quality of life in developing towns.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated in his opening speech that a review of the roads plan was taking place in the Department. When is it likely that the review will be completed and will any special attention be given to the county roads and the byroads? The Minister will be aware that in the western counties especially there has been a serious deterioration of the structure of the county roads, mainly due to climatic and other conditions during the past year or two.  Local communities are agitated and frustrated about the condition of these roads.  I would ask that special attention be given to the county roads in the review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my opening speech that a review is taking place of the road development plan and I would hope that we could present it to Government in the next session of the Dáil and certainly before the end of the year.  The road development plan is concerned more with major routes and national primaries. Being a rural Deputy myself and having every intention of staying a rural Deputy, I have discussed the matter of county roads with local authorities including, as recently as yesterday, Roscommon County Council.  There is an obvious <Col N="1746" /> deterioration in the quality of county roads and I have during the past few months tried to accumulate and assimilate statistics and facts on the level of deterioration.  It has not been permissible in the past to allow for improvements of county roads from specific allocations but it may be worth while to hold off some developments or improvements on major road structures so that we can at least maintain our county roads at a level which will allow people to travel in some comfort.  Every rural Deputy is aware of the almost total collapse of the county road structure.  A major effort was made in the sixties and early seventies but since then these roads have been neglected and I am examining the matter to see if in 1984 funds can be diverted to county roads so that we can maintain a reasonable level of road surface.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £1,026,926,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Social Welfare, for certain services administered by that Office, for payments to the Social Insurance Fund, and for sundry grants.</P>
      <P>At the outset I would like to make what I regard as a few important general comments relating to the Social Welfare Estimate.  I will return to these points in more detail later in my speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First of all, social welfare expenditure as a whole is now running at around £1,950 million a year.  As such it is the largest public expenditure programme we have.  Social welfare expenditure must be met from one source or another and in the context of the current concern about the rates of PRSI contributions, I make the point that there has been no <Col N="1747" /> increase this year in the rate of social insurance contribution, despite the increases provided in payments from the end of June.</P>
    <P>Despite the levels of contributions, an estimated 21.5 per cent of social insurance expenditure in 1983 must be borne by the Exchequer as well as the total expenditure on social assistance payments. The overall question of financing the social welfare services will be one of the matters to be examined by the Commission on Social Welfare to which I will refer in more detail later.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from an examination of the Estimate that a number of schemes are of major significance in expenditure terms.  The total cost of the unemployment services will be around £473 million this year or around 25 per cent of total estimated expenditure on social welfare services.  While this is a very large item of overall expenditure I am particularly concerned at the levels of payments to the long-term unemployed on unemployment assistance who suffer a severe drop in income at present.  I will be examining this to see what scope there is for improving the situation of these people.</P>
    <P>Another area which is of major importance is of course the provision for children's allowances.  Expenditure on children's allowances is estimated at £164.7 million in 1983.  Provision is also made, however, for expenditure of £5 million on family income supplements as announced in the budget.  I will shortly be bringing forward proposals in this area.</P>
    <P>Another area to which I would like to refer at the outset is administration.  The overall costs of administration on social insurance and assistance services in 1983 will be approximately £75 million which represents just 4 per cent of total expenditure. The efficient delivery of the social welfare services is of primary importance and in this context computerisation will have an increasingly important role.  Provision is made in the Estimate for the resources necessary to continue the computerisation programme in the Department and I see this as a very important <Col N="1748" /> aspect of the Department's efforts to make the system more effective and more responsive to individual needs.</P>
    <P>After these introductory comments I turn now to consider the Estimate in more detail, elaborating on the points already made.  I mentioned that overall expenditure is running at £1,950 million a year.  This takes account of the improvements provided in the budget, the full year cost of which is around £170 million. For 1983 itself, allowing for the fact that the increases in payments come into effect at the end of June, the cost is estimated at £86.6 million, giving overall expenditure this year of around £1,870 million.</P>
    <P>I referred to the growing significance of social welfare expenditure in economic terms.  To illustrate this, it is worth mentioning that social welfare expenditure as a percentage of gross national product has increased from under 7 per cent in 1972-73 to almost 14 per cent this year. Not all of this increase, of course, has occurred as a result of real improvements in social welfare benefits.  Much has come from the policy of successive Governments to protect the value of benefits against the effects of inflation.  A large part of the increase is due to increases in the numbers of recipients of benefits and in this context the increase in the numbers unemployed has been a major factor in recent years.  An increase in expenditure of itself, therefore, does not automatically mean a corresponding increase in welfare in the broad sense.  Even if no improvements are made in social welfare schemes, rising numbers of recipients tend to lead to increases in expenditure. This was graphically illustrated at the beginning of this year when the Government had to provide an additional £31 million merely to meet the cost of additional unemployment payments, without any improvement in benefit levels.  This Government are committed to protecting the living standards of social welfare recipients notwithstanding the extraordinarily difficult circumstances of this year.</P>
    <P>The overall expenditure figure of £1,870 includes total expenditure on social assistance and social insurance <Col N="1749" /> schemes this year.  Part of the expenditure on social insurance schemes is, as I explained earlier, met by income from social insurance contributions and the amount which the House is asked to grant for social insurance services is a residual figure after account is taken of income from contributions and other sources. The cost of social assistance services is for practical purposes, borne entirely by the Exchequer.  The total amount which the House is asked to grant, is £1,026.926 million.  I would point out that, unlike the position in previous years when the costs of the increases in rates of payment provided in the budget were not included in the original Estimate but were provided for separately in a Supplementary Estimate, on this occasion the Estimate now before the House takes account of the social welfare measures provided for in the budget.  These measures were discussed by the House in March in the debate on the Social Welfare Bill giving effect to them.</P>
    <P>The Estimate falls into three parts &mdash; subheads A to D refer to administration costs and represent the total administration expenses of the Department of Social Welfare in respect of the social insurance and assistance schemes.  Social insurance administration costs are recovered from the Social Insurance Fund as an Appropriation-in-Aid under subhead Q(1).  Administration costs in connection with social welfare services are also, of course, incurred by certain other Departments and in so far as these refer to the social assistance services they are, apart from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, borne, without repayment, on the Votes of the Departments concerned.</P>
    <P>I referred already to my Department's continuing efforts to improve the administration of the social welfare services and in particular to the increasing use of computers. Computerisation was introduced initially to deal with records and payments in relation to pay-related benefit and has been extended to handle all records arising under the PRSI system and all disability benefit payments.  Based on the experience to date, there is clearly considerable potential for the use of computerisation <Col N="1750" /> in the paying of other social welfare benefits.  In this connection it is planned to introduce computerisation into employment exchanges on a phased basis.  Preliminary work has also commenced on the computerisation of the children's allowances and pensions area. The overall computer development programme will make a major contribution to more effective and efficient day-to-day administration, including better retrieval and communication of information in individual cases.  Computer terminals have been installed in a number of public offices of the Department, providing instant access for inquiry purposes to information on disability benefit claims and it is proposed to extend this inquiry facility to all the Department's public offices and information centres over the coming years.</P>
    <P>To move on to the second major part of the Estimate, subheads E and F refer to the social insurance services.  Subhead E represents the Exchequer contribution to the Social Insurance Fund in 1983 and, as I referred to earlier, it is a residual figure which represents the difference between total expenditure out of the fund and the income received into the fund mainly by way of contributions from employers and employees.  Details of the expenditure and income of the Social Insurance Fund are given in the appendix to the published Estimate.  The estimated income from social insurance contributions in 1983 is £797.5 million.  The standard rate of social insurance contribution is 16.8 per cent out of a total PRSI contribution of 20.11 per cent.  The remaining elements of the PRSI contribution are &mdash; 1 per cent health contribution, 1 per cent youth employment levy, 1 per cent income levy, 0.3 per cent occupational injuries contribution and 0.01 per cent redundancy fund contribution.  As mentioned already, the social insurance contribution rate has not been increased this year, the only change by comparison with last year being a raising of the earnings ceiling for contribution purposes from £9,500 to £13,000 from April 1983. The increase shown in contribution income from £655 million in 1982 to an estimated £797.5 million in 1983 is due <Col N="1751" /> largely, apart from the raising of the ceiling, to the general increase in earnings levels and to the impact of the 1982 rates of contributions for a full 12 months in 1983 as against three-quarters of 1982.</P>
    <P>It is extremely difficult to estimate with complete accuracy what the income from social insurance contributions will be in any given year and it is only towards the end of the year that the out-turn can be predicted with any degree of certainty. The situation is complicated by the fact that contributions are collected on a tax year basis and must be converted to a financial year basis for Estimates purposes. The operation of the fund depends on a regular flow of income from contributions, such income being almost immediately used to fund the ongoing payment of social insurance benefits and pensions.  Any disruption to the flow of contribution income would have serious consequences and could ultimately affect the ability to pay the benefits.  The question of employers deferring payment of contributions has been the subject of much discussion in recent times and the extent to which this occurs within a year or between one year and the next obviously affects contribution income. Similarly any disruption of PRSI contributions collection by workers themselves would have very serious consequences.</P>
    <P>There are many factors which affect contribution income and which cannot be foreseen and provided for.  Increasing unemployment is obviously a major such factor affecting contribution income.  It is the combination of the eventual income from social insurance contributions and the levels of expenditure on social insurance benefits throughout the year which determines the amount of the Exchequer subvention to the Social Insurance Fund at the end of the year, which ultimately must be borne by the taxpayer in one way or another.  It is estimated that this year the Exchequer will bear some 21.5 per cent of total social insurance expenditure. Employers contributions will bear some 53 per cent of the cost and employee contributions some 25.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>As I mentioned already the expenditure <Col N="1752" /> on social insurance benefits as shown in the Appendix to the Estimate includes the cost of the increases in rates of payment provided in the budget &mdash; 12 per cent in long-term payments and 10 per cent in short-term payments which will come into effect at the end of June.  These increases, which are necessary to maintain to some degree the standard of living of social insurance recipients have the effect of increasing the expenditure of the fund by some £50 million in 1983. The reductions mainly in pay-related benefits which came into effect in April and which were designed to achieve a more equitable relationship between benefits and earnings have curtailed the overall costs of the services this year. However, I appreciate the burden which the financing of the services imposes on contributors and on taxpayers generally and the whole question of the financing of the social welfare services will, as I have said, be examined by the Commission on Social Welfare which I propose to set up.</P>
    <P>The third main part of the Estimate comprises subheads G to P which provide for the cost of the assistance side of the social welfare services totalling some £787 million, which is borne in full by the Exchequer.  A major feature of the development of the Department's services over the years has been the expansion of the social insurance system under which payments are made as of right subject to certain contribution conditions by the addition of schemes of contributory pensions and other benefits.  As a consequence of this the scope of certain corresponding social assistance means-tested payments such as non-contributory old age and widows' pensions has diminished. These schemes however still account for very large expenditures in absolute terms.  The trend towards greater reliance on non-means tested services is in line with developments in other countries.  The eventual introduction of a national income-related pension scheme and of a scheme of social insurance for the self-employed who are not as yet covered by the social insurance system, will further reduce the scope of the social assistance pension schemes.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1753" /> I have already referred to the level of expenditure on children's allowances. While the amount involved, £164.7 million, is a very sizeable sum, it represents only one aspect, though admittedly the most important aspect, of income support for families.  Income support is provided also through the medium of child dependant increases under the various social welfare schemes and of child tax allowances under the income tax system.</P>
    <P>The Family Income Supplement Scheme to which I have referred and for which a provision for this year of £5 million is made in subhead N of the Estimate will provide a further element of support for families.  This scheme will benefit people at work on low incomes who receive little or no benefit from income tax allowances because they are below or just above the tax threshold and who do not qualify for social welfare payments because they are working.  Apart from the disincentive aspect of this it is necessary on the grounds of equity to find some mechanism of channelling financial support to low income families and my proposals will be designed to achieve this within the limits of the resources available to me.  I will be looking also, however, at the need for a more integrated system of family income support to ensure that the best possible use is made of available resources.</P>
    <P>The provision for unemployment assistance in subhead I of the Estimate is over £226 million.  As I stated earlier the total cost of the unemployment services as a whole, including unemployment benefit and pay-related benefit under the social insurance system, will be around £473 million this year.  It is possible that the expenditure may be even higher than this, depending on the unemployment situation.  The need to make provision for an additional £31 million to cater for the increased Live Register when the Government assumed office meant that the scope for improvements in benefits was restricted.  Allowing for the restrictions on pay-related benefit from April the levels of payment under the social insurance system to persons becoming unemployed are quite reasonable.  As I have said, however, I will be looking at <Col N="1754" /> the situation of the long-term unemployed who are dependent on unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>Progress in these areas will depend on the resources available to us to meet our fundamental commitment to maintain the standard of living of social welfare recipients and other commitments such as the full implementation of equality of treatment for men and women in the social welfare system.  In relation to this latter commitment the EEC Directive of December 1978 requires that all discrimination as between men and women in the social security field be removed by the end of 1984.  Despite the progress made in recent years there are a number of areas where discrimination exists in the social welfare code.  Married women qualify for lower rates of certain benefits and unemployment benefit payable to married women is restricted to a maximum of 312 days as against 390 days generally.  In general, unemployment assistance is not payable to married women.  To give full equality of treatment in these areas only would cost in the region of £15 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>The most difficult area in relation to equality of treatment however is that of increases of social welfare payments for dependants.  The social welfare schemes generally were framed on the basis that the husband was the head of the household and the person to whom increases of benefits in respect of adult or child dependants should be payable.</P>
    <P>This approach was undoubtedly relevant at a time when it was most exceptional for a married woman to take up employment outside the home.  This however, is no longer the position and increasingly married women along with men and single women are taking their place in the labour force.  They pay the same taxes, the same contributions and have the same obligations as other members of the work force.  Apart altogether from the EEC Directive it is time therefore that they had the same rights in the matter of benefit entitlements.</P>
    <P>Clearly however, to give dependency increases in all cases on the same basis as at present, so that, for example, a married couple both absent from work due <Col N="1755" /> to illness could each get disability benefit with increases for each other and for any child dependants, would be extremely costly and could not be justified.  The application of equality of treatment in this area must, therefore, involve a reexamination of the criteria for payment of increases for dependants, taking account of the changing situation regarding the employment of married women. This area has been the subject of detailed examination and a number of approaches can be adopted.  There are, however, serious cost implications and regard must be taken of this factor.  No final decisions have yet been taken but I will be putting forward proposals to the Government in the near future.</P>
    <P>The agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to draw up and implement an anti-poverty plan within the context of national economic and social planning and for this purpose I intend to revive the Combat Poverty Organisation.  There is also a commitment on the part of the Government to seek a new and comprehensive EEC poverty programme based on the findings and achievements of the 1975-1981 programme. For these activities a provision of £1.27 million has been provided in 1983 Estimates.</P>
    <P>An anti-poverty programme featured prominently in the activities of the 1973-77 Coalition Government and it was largely due to the efforts of the then Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Frank Cluskey, that the idea was taken up at EEC level.  This programme lapsed in December 1980 but a new programme is now being formulated.  On 10 December last the EEC Council considered a report from the Commission on the first programme of pilot schemes to combat poverty and concluded that in addition to policies at national level to deal with economic, social and employment problems more specific action at Community level is needed.  This activity in the EEC is at the very early stages and preliminary discussions only at official level have taken place.</P>
    <P>I attach the utmost importance to the <Col N="1756" /> need to develop effective approaches for dealing with the problems arising from poverty in our midst.  There must be a coherent programme which will build upon the achievement of the first anti-poverty programme.  A lot of useful experience was gained in the course of that programme and this will be of considerable assistance in what we are now undertaking.</P>
    <P>I also attach the greatest importance to developing effective programmes in this field at EEC level.  I will, therefore, be taking every initiative at my disposal to ensure that a Community Programme to Combat Poverty is given the priority attention that it needs at Community level.  Ireland will hold the EEC Presidency in the six month period from July 1984 and if adequate Community programmes to deal with poverty have not been developed by then I will be doing all in my power to ensure that it is done within the period of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>The breakdown of the Estimate shows the great variety of social welfare services which we now have.  Over the last 15 years or so, many new schemes have been brought into operation to cater for the needs of persons who prior to that were not covered by any of the existing categorical schemes such as deserted wives, unmarried mothers and prisoners' wives, The home assistance service was replaced by the supplementary welfare allowance scheme in 1977 with significant improvements on the old system, including the introduction of a uniform basic scale of payments.  Another feature of the development of the services in recent years has been the growth of additional schemes for particular needs mainly of old people and invalids such as free travel, free electricity, free telephone rental, free bottled gas and the national fuel scheme.  The introduction of these schemes in a piecemeal fashion and the developments in existing schemes over the years has meant that the social welfare system as a whole is now extremely complex.  The Government programme provides for the setting up of a commission to review the social welfare system as a whole and I will be putting my proposals on this matter to the Government next week.  This <Col N="1757" /> will be the first time since the Department was set up that a commission will examine and report on the whole system of social welfare and make recommendations to the Government on the effectiveness of the system as it has developed over the years.  I would emphasise, as the Government programme points out, that the establishment of the commission will not preclude any immediate improvements and reforms which are considered necessary.</P>
    <P>In that regard I would be prepared to have discussions with the Opposition spokesman, Deputy O'Hanlon and his colleagues, outside of the Estimate debate.  We may not discuss social welfare again until early 1984, which is a long time, unless there is a Supplementary Estimate.  This encompasses a Supplementary Estimate because the budgetary figure for 1983 is included in what we are discussing today.  Some 18 per cent of total State expenditure encompasses the social welfare system.  There is urgent need for Government and Opposition Deputies to have regular, detailed consultation with one another about the whole system of social welfare.  It may well be that under the proposed reform of the House my colleague, Deputy Bruton, as Leader of the House together with the Chief Whip of Fianna Fáil, would be able to devise a system where we could have more intensive consultation in whatever form whether within the structures of the House or outside it at committee level.  It is difficult within the context of an Estimate debate to have political discussion on the ramifications of all the issues we are likely to raise today.</P>
    <P>In concluding these general remarks on the Estimate, I should like to refer again to the overall expenditure on social welfare services which I mentioned in the introduction.  In 1983 we will spend approximately £1,870 million on social insurance and social assistance services. The search for more equitable systems of financing expenditure of this size must be pursued, while at the same time recognising that there is an increasing need to improve the effectiveness of social protection provided by social security schemes and to ensure that social welfare <Col N="1758" /> expenditure is directed in the most effective way possible to those who need it. The dilemma posed by the need to contain public expenditure, while at the same time providing an effective modern system of social protection, will present a great challenge to us in the years ahead. I look forward to hearing the comments of Deputies and I will try to deal constructively with any suggestions which are made.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I would like to thank the Minister for his offer to have more dialogue between himself and Deputies in this House.  All Deputies in the House must be concerned and committed to ensure that those less well off in our society are properly looked after.  While one would accept that in a time of recession this is difficult, one should be able to say &mdash; and indeed the Minister in his opening statement said &mdash; that this Government are committed to protecting the living standards of social welfare recipients in the difficult circumstances of this year.  We in the Opposition would have to disagree with that and any reasonable person outside would disagree with it.  One has only to look at the Social Welfare Bill and the level of the increases given to those dependent on social welfare benefits and assistance at a time of rapidly rising costs, again many of those costs brought about by the action of the present Government, to realise that.  The 12 per cent for long-term recipients and 10 per cent for short-term recipients are not to be paid out until the last day of June and the first day of July and they are totally inadequate in this year. For the first time since 1974, significantly enough when a Coalition Government were in office, the payments are not being made until three months later than usual. We believe that they should have been paid in April, that that was particularly necessary in this year because of the recession and escalating costs.  Even if the Minister &mdash; it would have been an honest thing to do &mdash; divided the 12 per cent and 10 per cent over the whole year <Col N="1759" /> and paid these people 9 per cent or 7.5 per cent &mdash; which in effect they are receiving at a time when inflation is expected to rise to 15 per cent or 16 per cent &mdash; that would have been better than what he has done.</P>
      <P>The greatest socio-economic problem facing this country at present is the creating of employment for all our people. One problem is that the Government do not appear to see this as high on their list of priorities.  I will quote from the Taoiseach speaking here on Wednesday, 11 May 1983, as reported at column 841, volume 342, of the Official Report:</P>
      <P>The fourth factor affecting our employment situation has been the deterioration in our public finances. Given the scale of unemployment and the fact that much, but not all, of it is determined by external events, Government should in the face of the resulting crisis, seek to alleviate the problem by reducing taxes, stimulating domestic growth and creating employment opportunities where there is necessary infrastructural work to be done, whether it be road building, housing, the construction of schools, the development of telecommunications and so on.  No Irish Government, whoever they might be, can at this time take such action on an adequate scale because the public finances are in such disorder that the maintenance of public solvency requires action diametrically opposed to that which the employment situation demands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, our Government are prepared to let unemployment escalate rampantly and are not prepared to do anything about it.  With this concern with financial rectitude they are not going to consider people.  I believe that we must, as politicians, always put people first.  In the Estimate &mdash; and the Minister referred to it again here this morning &mdash; £31 million extra was allocated to cater for the needs of those on unemployment assistance. If some study had been given to this it might have been possible to invest that £31 million in a different way, in infrastructural development, to ensure <Col N="1760" /> that these people would be at work.  It is inherent in human nature that people like to be at work, irrespective of what the cynics might say.</P>
    <P>The administration of the unemployment assistance scheme leaves a lot to be desired.  People in receipt of this assistance are long-term unemployed in the main; they have been on unemployment benefit and have gone on to unemployment assistance and certainly they are long-term recipients of social welfare payments, but officially they are regarded as receiving a short-term payment and this leaves them very far down the scale when it comes to income.  A married man with two children living in a rural area on maximum unemployment assistance would receive £63.75.  He could be assessed as having other means and be on less than that, but that is the maximum. If he were to die or desert his wife she would receive £63.45 per week and also many other benefits besides, including fuel under the free fuel scheme.  Here is an area &mdash; which I was glad to hear the Minister mention this morning &mdash; where action should be taken to ensure that these people have a standard of living at which they are able to survive particularly during difficult times such as we are in at present.</P>
    <P>There are very good social and political reasons why the whole means testing system and the whole assessment system for entitlement to unemployment assistance should be looked at as a matter or urgency.  I am not happy that school leavers who are unfortunate enough not to find employment have to congregate at unemployment exchanges many of which were built in the last century and are totally inadequate as buildings at present to cater for the very large number of people now applying for unemployment benefit and unemployment assistance. While I find the height of courtesy from the staff there, I wonder if the exchanges are not understaffed to deal with the numbers they have to cater for at present.</P>
    <P>There are very good political reasons to look at the whole system of assessment schemes because of the frustration of people, particularly the young school leavers, waiting to see whether they will <Col N="1761" /> be awarded any assistance at all and, when awarded assistance, whether it will be sufficient to buy even a packet of cigarettes in some cases.  Such frustration must have political implications and it is important that we here in the Oireachtas should look at that.  Let us take an example of the average person applying for unemployment assistance.  He goes to the branch manager.  In the town of Clones in my constituency the branch manager and the social welfare officer work in the same building.  A person applying in Clones for unemployment assistance goes to the branch manager.  He sends the application to the employment exchange in Dundalk, 50 miles away. They assess the situation and send your application back to the social welfare officer in Clones who is in the room next door to the branch manager.  The social welfare officer may or may not send that application to his supervisor who, in turn, will send it back to the exchange in Dundalk. They will sent the application to the Department in Townsend Street where a decision will be made on your entitlement.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the numbers in receipt of unemployment benefit and assistance, there must be a simpler way of dealing with this.  I suggest that the decision should be made at exchange level, that when you apply for unemployment assistance to the branch manager your application should be handed in immediately to the social welfare officer, especially if he is next door, and then sent to the exchange where a decision would be made.  For the sake of keeping the standards nationally at the same level, the exchange could then refer the documentation on to Townsend Street and they could monitor the situation to ensure that there are equal standards throughout the country.  This would have the effect of short-circuiting much of the red tape and would ensure that claims are processed in a reasonable time.  The biggest complaint I received at my clinics is the length of time that people are waiting to have their claims processed, particularly for unemployment assistance.  It is totally unacceptable that young people <Col N="1762" /> should have to wait three months to have their claims processed.</P>
    <P>Very often the modest means of the people living in the house are taken into account and, as a result, the young person gets a very inadequate allowance.  I had a case in my own constituency where a girl of twenty received £1.40 per week and she saw that sum as the recognition which society put on her worth.  Because her parents had a modest income she was allowed that small amount and the Minister should look at this aspect of the administration of the unemployment assistance schemes.  There should be a minimum of at least a £1 per day for anyone who qualifies.</P>
    <P>The method of assessment for board and lodging needs also to be examined. I have seen a case recently where a person was assessed at £23.50 leaving him entitled to £2.40.  There was also a case brought to my attention in the west where two brothers live together on a small holding of 20 acres of poor land.  One brother was dependent on the other and his board and lodging were assessed at £23.50.  I am assured he was not working for his brother, merely living with him. We must be concerned about this area and especially about the rise in the number of young unemployed people.  In January 1982 25 per cent of unemployed males were under 25 as were 41 per cent of females.  Those figures come from the National Economic and Social Council Report of February 1983.</P>
    <P>While we have a ratio of youth to adult unemployment that is less than other EEC countries, nevertheless it is important that we should look at how the administration of the unemployment assistance scheme affects them.  I am unhappy about the situation, especially in Dublin, where the unemployed have to congregate in large numbers to sign on for assistance.  The Minister should look at some other way of processing their entitlements.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the problems for all the under privileged in society, old age pensioners, disabled and the unemployed who have not received an increase this year sufficient to keep up with the cost of living.  The Minister for Finance <Col N="1763" /> in his budget speech said that he wanted to minimise the effects of recession on the lower paid.  The Minister for Finance is more responsible than the Minister for Social Welfare for the present situation in that the Government are not living up to that commitment.  There is £39 million being witheld from social welfare recipients as a result of their not recieving their payments until the end of June.</P>
    <P>The Government are in office since 14 December.  If one looks at their combined policy documents as distinct from individual policy documents, one item states that the proportion of tax derived from PAYE on wages and salaries will be reduced.  This did not happen.  The Minister stated this morning that there has been no increase this year in the rate of social insurance contributions despite the increases provided in payments from the end of June.  However, one would have to say that to the ordinary worker a 1 per cent levy on his income is an increase as far as he is concerned.  I accept that it is not an increase in PRSI but, nevertheless, 1 per cent more is being taken out of the worker's pay packet and he is not interested in the semantics of whether it goes on PRSI or as a levy.  We must face up to that because the public will not thank us for saying it is another Minister or another Department who are taking this levy; as far as the worker is concerned it is the Government who are taking it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said that in drawing up new tax proposals, account will be taken of the cost of the care of dependent children.  This is the first year in which there has not been an increase in children's allowances.  He also said that as a step towards reducing the effect of taxation on the lower paid, the rate of PRSI will be reduced on gross incomes of up to £120 per week.  The Social Welfare Bill introduced penal measures for many of the workers and because we discussed it in detail already, I do not intend to go into it now.  It is interesting that in the projected Estimate for this year there will be a saving in the social insurance fund. The outturn for 1982 was £252 million, whereas the projected figure for 1983 is £219 million, a much lower figure than in <Col N="1764" /> the previous year.  That is the excess of expenditure over income in the social welfare fund.  It is estimated that pay-related benefit will be down from £77.8 million in 1982 to £61.3 million in this year.  The reduction in pay-related benefit is causing problems for many people. The extension of the waiting time to 18 days is penal particularly for workers who find themselves on disability benefit or indeed on unemployment benefit.  One thinks of Telectron in Tallaght where people who were in well-paid employment suddenly find themselves out of work and have to wait almost four weeks before they receive any pay-related benefit. A married man with two children who would have take home pay of £115 has to live on £68.  The State should recognise the commitments that such people have, the fact that they have so little disposable income at present and should ensure that people have sufficient income to meet their essential commitments.</P>
    <P>The local authorities at present have more and more people defaulting on repayments for house mortgages as a result of unemployment.  This is something new.  In the past there would perhaps be one or two defaulters per year but now the situation has become very serious for the local authorities.  It is important that a man with a wife and family who has worked for 10 or 20 years in a job and finds himself in hospital should not be left lying on his hospital bed worrying about where he is to find money to meet his essential commitments. I believe the House was wrong in allowing that legislation to go through. As a result of that legislation there is also the anomaly where a person on a three-day week who receives no pay-related benefit is less well off than the person who works alternate weeks.  At present there are many industries continuously on a three-day week.  It causes a lot of frustration among the workers to find that a person in another industry who works alternate weeks will receive pay-related benefit while the person on the three-day week will not.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention whether he intends to introduce a double payment <Col N="1765" /> in September and December as in previous years.  This will be very necessary if the situation continues as it has been in the last three or four months.</P>
    <P>The proposal to limit disability benefit and pay-related benefit to 80 per cent of reckonable weekly earnings has not received much attention but it has very important consequences for those on low incomes.  It means that those who do not have sickness schemes at work are worse off than others.  The lowest paid workers are those who suffer from this piece of legislation.</P>
    <P>I suppose every Deputy in the House was in Donegal at some time during the last three weeks and would have spoken to small farmers who are living on land that would be impossible to develop &mdash; much of it bogland and much of it rock. A great tribute is due to these people that they have stayed on the land and have reared very fine families.  In 1966 for a very good reason the smallholders' unemployment assistance scheme was set up.  The object was to enable smallholders in the 12 western counties to increase their production without affecting their entitlement to unemployment assistance as long as their rateable valuation remained the same.  I accept that as a result of a High Court decision the whole question of using the PLV for assessing means is under examination.  Nevertheless I believe there should be some scheme whereby a supplementary income would be available to smallholders particularly along the western seaboard, the sort of countryside we saw around Gweedore, Dungloe, Glenties and right down west Donegal.  I am sure those members of the Government who were there would have to agree that a great tribute is due to the people who have remained on the land there.  It would be very wrong if we, in this House, were to do anything to make it more difficult for them to survive on the land or worse still that they would have to leave the land because socially it is very desirable that we should keep as many of our people on the land as possible and if necessary we should give them some supplementary income based on the size of their holding and some encouragement <Col N="1766" /> to work the holding to the best of their ability.</P>
    <P>Perhaps one of the reasons for the delay in the administration of various schemes, particularly the unemployment assistance scheme, is the control of abuses.  Abuses must be controlled and it would be very wrong to condone in any way an abuse of the social welfare system but the Minister should ensure that the effort to curtail abuses will not impede the delivery of a rapid service to those who need it.  That would defeat the whole purpose of the social welfare system.  I would ask the Minister to look into that matter.  Abuses are serious, but they are a separate issue.  We must ensure the rapid delivery of the services to those who need them.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he will be bringing legislation before the House to implement the family income supplement.  I do not think he mentioned when he intends to do this.  A sum of £5 million has been allocated to 20,000 families.  If administrative costs were eliminated, if no administrative costs were involved, those 20,000 families would receive £4.89 per week, per family.  The administrative costs reduce that sum.  Before the Minister brings the scheme into the House I would ask him to have a look at that aspect.  These people are on the very lowest scale of income.  They are not eligible to pay tax.  Perhaps a little more could be done for them, particularly having regard to the fact that there was no allocation this year for an increase in children's allowances.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to comply with the EEC directive of December 1978 that all discrimination between men and women in the field of social security should be removed by the end of 1984? I want to say a word about the position of Members of the Oireachtas in relation to the administration of the social welfare system.  We have had approximately 300 questions on the Order Paper on the same day dealing with social welfare matters. The vast majority were about delays in payments.  I am aware that the Department make 500,000 payments per week and, in some weeks, as many as 1 million payments.  The vast majority of them are <Col N="1767" /> for the correct amount and arrive in time. During the short time I was Minister of State in the Department, I found nothing but the height of courtesy and dedication from the public servants I met.  There is a problem, and the fact that so many questions appear on the Order Paper highlights the frustration of the people at the receiving end who do not receive their benefits.  There may be a delay in processing them, or people may not receive the correct amount.  Some people are unsure of what they should be receiving and require clarification.</P>
    <P>Our aim should be to ensure that we achieve 100 per cent correct payments delivered on time.  I accept that in any society, for one reason or another, it is not possible to achieve 100 per cent success. Even with the computer I believe it will not be possible to reach 100 per cent success.  We must try to eliminate delays and incorrect payments.</P>
    <P>Public representatives are approached by constituents.  Representations from constituents add considerably to the workload of the Department.  These people are entitled as of right and not out of charity to their assistance or benefit. Some machinery must be found to deal rapidly with these representations.  That would cut down the number of questions on the Order Paper.  One of the problems is that because of the large number of questions on the Order Paper, Ministers have a limited opportunity to answer questions.  For that reason many Deputies put down their questions for written answer and then they have not got an opportunity to ask supplementary questions. This is unfortunate.  The Minister said he would welcome more dialogue. The Parliamentary Question session gives us an opportunity to tease out problems and perhaps come up with answers which would give us the type of system we all desire.  I would like the Minister to look at that aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>Because of the recession and the hardship people are suffering, there are more and more demands on the supplementary allowance scheme.  I am sure the Minister will agree that the financing of that scheme leaves a good deal to be desired. <Col N="1768" /> It involves numerous Departments: the Department of Finance, the Department of Social Welfare, the Department of the Environment and also the direct transfer of payments between the local authorities and the health boards.  There seems to be a problem in collecting that money.  The Government should make a decision to finance that scheme directly through the Department of the Environment.  Whatever merit there was in it when the scheme was introduced in 1977 when rates were payable, there is no merit in the way that scheme is financed at present. I am told the figure is approximately £25 million.  We must find another way to finance the scheme.  There always seem to be problems between the county councils and the health boards in collecting this money.</P>
    <P>The elderly are a very special section of our community.  Over 10 per cent of the population is over 65 years of age. They have very special needs.  It is important that the Minister and the Department should look after those needs. Many of them are relevant not only to the Department of Social Welfare but to the Department of Health and the Department of Environment in relation to housing.  The Department of Social Welfare support various schemes.  The voluntary organisations who do so much for those who are dependent on help in our community are always worthy of support.</P>
    <P>The fuel scheme was introduced in 1942 for 17 cities and towns.  Prior to 1979-80, people received vouchers for turf and timber.  Since then it has encompassed a comprehensive range of heating fuels.  The national fuel scheme was introduced in 1980-81.  There appears to be a problem in that beneficiaries of the cheap fuel scheme do not need the same criteria of means-testing applied to them as to those receiving fuel under the national fuel scheme.  In areas like Dublin, particularly on the north side where the corporation have extended into the heart of the county council area, some people are entitled to fuel vouchers by virtue of where they live irrespective of their type of income.  In other words, this means that people on a lower income living in a <Col N="1769" /> county council area will not receive fuel vouchers while those in receipt of a higher income in areas where the cheap fuel scheme operates, such as cities and towns, will receive them.  This is something the Minister should examine because the system of means-testing for that scheme leaves a lot to be desired. Very often community welfare officers administering the supplementary allowance scheme, processing claims for medical cards and so on have sufficient work to do but are obliged to process claims for fuel vouchers also.</P>
    <P>We experienced a situation the year before last in the blizzard that vouchers had not been sent out in a number of instances and were not until after the blizzard was over in February.  This is the scheme that is supposed to operate from October to March.  Surely some method of means-testing should be devised whereby a health board would know in the month of July who was and was not entitled to fuel vouchers.  The whole question of means-testing warrants review.  There should be one single means test applicable and not various means tests conducted by various Departments of State but rather one to which anybody could submit themselves voluntarily, which test would last them for a year and would entitle them to a range of services dependent on their means, marital status, age and so on.  The health boards should be in a position to issue those fuel vouchers at the beginning of the winter.  People should not have to wait until after Christmas or, in some instances, the end of February before receiving them.  That defeats the whole purpose of the scheme which was to ensure that those people entitled to them would receive them in time for the winter.</P>
    <P>Earlier we talked about the long-term unemployed on unemployment assistance who are recognised by the Department as short-term unemployed only. This is something that needs to be dealt with urgently because they are excluded from the national fuel scheme.  The Government should introduce a uniform scheme to ensure that the elderly in similar circumstances in every area are <Col N="1770" /> treated equally.  The Minister might well consult the National Council for the Aged with regard to this scheme because I am sure they have had a lot of experience of its operation.</P>
    <P>Another area to which the Minister might direct his attention is that of dental services and optical services for dependants of insured workers.  It was part of the Government's plan to work toward the provision of dental and optical services for dependants.  The other question that arises there is whether these services should be encompassed under social welfare at all.  Perhaps the time has come when they should be transferred to the Department of Health because they are both properly health services.  I note that the Minister is setting up a Commission on Social Welfare.  This is desirable, but it is important to ensure that its work would not just go on and on, with glaring anomalies in the system obtaining in the meantime.  I would hope the Minister would put a time limit on their reporting and that they would have maximum consultation with all the interested bodies, statutory and voluntary, who provide social services.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he was introducing a combat poverty programme and continued to say:</P>
    <P>Ireland will hold the EEC Presidency in the six month period from July 1984 and if adequate Community programmes to deal with poverty have not been developed by then I will be doing all in my power to ensure that it is done within the period of the Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister intend to develop his programme in advance of that because by then this Government will have been almost two years in office?  It is unfortunate that he did not have a trial of the National Community Development Agency set up by his predecessor under legislation passed through this House. That would have afforded an opportunity of ascertaining how it would work before disbanding it, particularly bearing in mind that we have had no indication before the House to date to demonstrate that we will have any combat poverty <Col N="1771" /> programme in the near future.  I would ask the Minister to say whether he intends doing something in advance of the EEC Presidency coming to Ireland in the latter half of next year.</P>
    <P>Another comment of the Minister was that over the past 15 years or so many new schemes had been brought into operation to cater for the needs of persons who prior to that were not covered by any of the existing categorical schemes.  I think this is the first year there has been no new scheme initiated.  Everything done this year constitutes a restriction on existing services &mdash; for example, a reduction in the amount of pay-related benefit, an extension of the waiting days, no increase in children's allowances, the abolition of the maternity grant, of the children's allowance for apprentices and so on.  Everything this year was by way of curtailing the services rather than any expansion of them.</P>
    <P>The most important problem facing the Minister and the Department is that of endeavouring to achieve a rational balance between control and service in the administration of the Department.  One accepts that the amount of money is very large and therefore one must ensure that it is spent correctly.  It would be most unfortunate were control to be the dominant feature of the social welfare schemes because service to the community is the sole reason for the Department's existence, to ensure that those people who are unable through their own resources, to cater for their needs are properly looked after.  It is important, therefore, that the service element always be the dominant feature of the Department.  At a time when there is a transfer to computerisation I would hope that the computer would not be programmed to ensure more control and less service.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that there is no more hope for those dependent on social welfare. Indeed, the record of this Government in their first six months has been a major disappointment to those who read their Programme for Government before they came into office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Minister's announcement that he is to establish a Commission on Social Welfare which will review the entire social welfare system. Since I came into this House I have made it my practice to speak during the Estimate debate for the Department of Social Welfare and on all the social welfare Bills coming before the House.</P>
      <P>I have constantly made the point that our social welfare system has developed piecemeal, is unco-ordinated, in places contradictory and in some instances provides clear disincentives to aspects of our national life which we seek generally by way of policy to encourage.  There is no clearly defined social policy coming from our social welfare legislation.  Over the years we have identified specific problems and made provision for them by way of financial payments through a social welfare code without ever dealing with them in an overall comprehensive way and often in tackling one problem we have created another.  The social welfare code is full of anomalies and by its workings it causes considerable injustice to a great many people while providing assistance to many others.  The time is long overdue for a comprehensive examination of the entire social welfare code and the legislative code in the context of the statutory provisions.  That work is rendered easier by the existence of the consolidation Bill passed in 1981.  The statutory instruments which govern the social welfare code go back for decades. Social welfare law is now something of a legislative maze through which very few people can find a way and in which many people are caught, not fully comprehending the manner in which it affects their daily lives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would urge that this commission should deal first with the area of social policy.  It is time we defined the objectives of our social welfare code which have never yet been fully outlined.  The need for a coherent social policy has been spoken and written about by a great many bodies.  One of the most recent reports of the National Economic and Social Council on social planning in Ireland clearly points the direction for the commission on social welfare and the type of <Col N="1773" /> analysis they should undertake.  They should not become bogged down in trying to identify one or two areas of the code which are not properly provided for or one or two anomalies which need to be sorted out.  They should start by defining the goals of our social welfare code, setting out what type of society our social welfare code is supposed to be framing. That is not something which can be plucked out of thin air; it involves to some extent a political or ideological input.  One of the problems of the social welfare code and the way it has developed is that it has tended to be presumed that one can develop a system of social welfare which provides financial payments to people in need without articulating a social policy or a political philosophy.  If the commission begin their work believing there is a politically neutral stand from which they can look into their hearts and define the objectives of the social welfare code, they will produce a very poor report.  It should be accepted that there are certain ideological premises on which the commission should base their work.</P>
    <P>Many of those ideological premises are not ideological in the sense that they divide parties in this House.  They are the obvious ones such as the need to ensure equality between men and women and the need to bring about equality for single parent families who find themselves in identical social circumstances but are entitled to different types of financial payments through the social welfare code.  There is also the need to ensure that the social welfare code is understandable not merely to those who administer it but to those who look to it for assistance.  There is a need to remove the mystique and secrecy which surrounds the decision-making process. People who feel they have suffered some form of injustice should be given the reasons for the decisions made, as well as a right not merely to an appeal but to an open hearing before an appeals tribunal which will give reasons for decisions and will be seen to be fair.</P>
    <P>Whatever report is produced by the commission on social welfare, there is a need to consolidate the vast panoply of <Col N="1774" /> statutory instruments now in force in the same way as we consolidated social welfare legislation in 1981.  Until the statutory instruments are consolidated much that relates to the legislation concerning social welfare will remain within the precincts of the Department of Social Welfare, understood by a few select people but largely misunderstood by the general public.  The commission cannot help but come up with the notion that the statutory instruments should be consolidated and simplified and I would hope that work of that nature could commence even while the commission are sitting.</P>
    <P>I would agree with Deputy O'Hanlon, although I am cynical of his remark, that the commission should be given a time limit within which to operate.  They should be told to deliver a report within a given time scale and there should be no exceptions allowed.  All too often in the Department of Health and other Departments commissions are appointed to report on the need for reform, change or modernisation of legislative codes or departmental procedures but nothing is done for three or four years while the report is awaited.  It should be made quite clear to the commission when established that they must report within a specific time.</P>
    <P>The commission's brief should not be concerned solely with social policy and the nature and benefits of the social assistance we provide. They should also concern themselves with administrative practices within the Department.  I have no doubt that a great many administrative reforms could be made in the manner in which the Department operate which would not only be cost effective but would result in a far more efficient service to people making inquiries about the social welfare code.  One of the nonsenses of this House is the vast number of questions tabled by Deputies, including myself, about simple entitlements to social welfare.  These questions would not be necessary if we had a properly functioning information system within the Department.</P>
    <P>It is the right of people who seek assistance to know the reasons if their applications <Col N="1775" /> are turned down.  They have a right to know why there is a delay in payment of benefit and they also have the right to know that there is the possibility of appealing a decision.  They also have the right to know that even though there is a financial limit with regard to the medical card scheme there is a degree of discretion within which the Department can operate in needy cases.  A lot of these things are not known and, as a result, Deputies constantly have to table parliamentary questions about such matters. Many of these items should never reach the stage where a constituent has to go to the trouble of contacting his local Deputy.  The general public have a right to this information.  There is something seriously wrong with a Department whose operations result in parliamentary questions being placed regularly about simple matters, for example, why a person did not get a benefit.</P>
    <P>In this respect the Department of Social Welfare share the same administrative problems as are evident in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  It may be unfair to put the Department of Social Welfare in the same boat as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  In recent times they have become much more efficient, whereas if the Department of Posts and Telegraphs were the Titanic they would have sunk years ago. Nevertheless there is need for greater efficiency.  The commission on social welfare should have a role in examining the work practices and the divisions within the Department of Social Welfare as they relate to various areas of responsibility, in particular to allowances and benefits. I hope the Minister will ensure that that type of investigation is carried out by the commission and that recommendations are produced.</P>
    <P>I should like to know from the Minister his views on the composition of the commission. How many members does he intend the commission will have?  Who will the commission be representative of, whether trade union members, employers or any other parties?  I should like to see different types of personnel on the commission.  I am sure the Minister <Col N="1776" /> intends to appoint some members of his Department but they should not only be people in the higher levels of the civil service administration.  I should like to see community welfare officers represented and some deciding and appeals officers who are working on the ground and who know about many of the anomalies and problems.  They would have an important role to play on the commission because they would have a deep insight into some of the deficiencies in the legislation and in the Department.  Often the deciding and appeals officers are in the firing line quite unfairly when people do not get the benefits to which they consider they are entitled.  I urge the Minister to have a broad spectrum of representation on the commission.</P>
    <P>A problem that was dealt with at length in a debate in this House last January was that Members of this House seem to play very little part in the legislative process. We had a long debate about Dáil reform. In the two years I have been a Member of this House successive Governments have established various commissions and committees of inquiry and many more such bodies were set up during the years.  All of them were given powers to investigate areas of national life or of governmental or departmental policy. Part of the reason we need to establish these bodies is that we do not have departmental committees of the House on which Deputies of all parties could be represented.  As a result, Deputies generally do not devleop any real expertise in particular areas or in the workings of Government Departments.  When there is a need for reform or examination of policy, this House is seen to be irrelevant. We have to appoint experts from outside to make recommendations to Members of the House as to what they should do. Because of the way this House operates at the moment these commissions are obviously necessary but, by their nature, they undermine the functions of the House.  If this House functioned properly the type of work the Minister envisages this commission will do could be undertaken by a committee of the House with responsibility in the area of social welfare. It could be composed of Members <Col N="1777" /> of the House with powers to hear representations from the various interested groups who would have an input to make in the type of report the commission might produce.  They would have powers to hear representations from people at the receiving end of the services provided by the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>While I welcome the commission I think it is the second best alternative. Until we establish departmental committees of this House with the function of monitoring the performance of Government Departments, to which Ministers would be responsible, the Dáil will become increasingly irrelevant.  In the context of the work of this commission there is no logical reason why we should not establish a committee of the House with responsibility for social policy matters, concerned with monitoring the work not only of the Department of Social Welfare but also of other Departments, such as the Department of the Environment.</P>
    <P>We have talked at great length about Dáil reform but we are still awaiting the establishment of various committees.  I suppose there is no possibility of what I am proposing being implemented.  The alternative would be to utilise Deputies and at least ensure that there is some representation on the commission either from the Dáil or the Seanad.  Presumably the creation of policy will vest in the commission for the next 12 months in the context of social welfare.  I assume the commission will lay down the parameters for reform in that area and the social objectives we are seeking to attain.  I do not understand why we are regularly creating all those commissions outside this House, in relation to which the Members of this House have no function other than to receive a report.  I welcome the establishment of the commission and I accept the Minister's bona fides in the matter.  I hope that some of the comments I have made in this House in the past have pushed him into recognising the need to establish such a commission.  Nevertheless, I believe it is the second best course. We should be establishing committees of this House that would develop expertise <Col N="1778" /> in these areas and would be capable of producing the necessary reports.</P>
    <P>I wish to make some points with regard to unemployment allowances and benefits and general social welfare expenditure. Despite some of the reforms introduced in the recent Social Welfare Act the schemes still operate as a disincentive to employment.  There is need for a new approach in this area.  We have now in excess of 190,000 people unemployed. We have moved away from the idea that overnight someone will provide all the jobs required for the people unfortunate enough to be unemployed.</P>
    <P>It will take many years to come to terms with this problem.  We must move away from the illusion, which politicians in the past to some extent have contributed to, that when people complete their third level education and leave school or when people become unemployed, due to redundancies or firms closing down, somewhere out in the vast world there is somebody who will create jobs for them in the public service or in the private sector.  Our educational system has always been based on the notion that you go looking for employment, that somebody somewhere is creating a job for you.  Our unemployment allowance and benefit system has developed on the premise that you continue to receive unemployment benefit or allowance until somebody somewhere provides a job for you and that as soon as that job is provided for you your entitlement to allowance ceases.</P>
    <P>It is not as simple as that.  In the midst of a serious economic recession there are not people out in the world creating the number of jobs required.  Enough jobs will not be created for many years in order to cut back in a dramatic way on the number unemployed.  We need to encourage our young people and those in the mid-thirties and forties who find themselves unemployed due to redundancies or firms going out of business, to become self-employed, to create jobs for themselves.  Even in the midst of the recession there are great opportunities for people who are willing to try their hands at self-employment in different areas.  There are great opportunities for <Col N="1779" /> those who are willing initially to create jobs for themselves and, ultimately, start businesses in which they might provide employment for others.</P>
    <P>The problem at the moment is that, if somebody who has been rendered unemployed or somebody who has finished his or her education and cannot find employment becomes self employed, uses his or her initiative to establish a small business, practice a particular trade or provide a particular service, that person is immediately cut off from unemployment allowance or benefit.  There is no interim period during which that person can ascertain if the business embarked upon is successful.  People in the mid-thirties or forties, who are married and have young families to cater for, are placed in an impossible situation where there might not be any employment available for them.  They might use their initiative to create employment for themselves.  If they are to comply with the law, they must immediately inform the Department of Social Welfare.  They are immediately cut off from receiving payments of any type whatsoever even if the business they are creating or the service they are providing does not generate income for them for a number of weeks or months. Those people are faced with the alternative course of action in which they start working and do not tell the Department and thus render themselves liable to prosecution and civil proceedings in which repayment of money made to them is sought.</P>
    <P>There is need, particularly in the light of the great problems we are facing, to introduce an interim period for those people who start a small business of their own.  If those people are in receipt of unemployment benefit or allowance they could notify the Department that they are trying to start their own businesses or services or are generating jobs and during a period of three months or six months from the time they notify the Department they should be entitled to continue receiving social welfare payments to enable them to continue supporting themselves and their families.  At the end of the period there should then be the <Col N="1780" /> legal obligation on them to notify the Department that their business is successful and that they no longer need to receive the benefit or allowance or that the business is unsuccessful and they are not continuing with it.</P>
    <P>At the moment there are a number of people showing initiative but who feel they have a responsibility to their families and do not want them to starve.  These people are starting their own businesses and are continuing to receive social welfare allowance or benefit because the Department have not been notified.  We have the black economy in the income tax area, but it is adding to it when people are in receipt of social welfare allowances in understandable circumstances but are breaking the law.  No person in the country should be given the choice of remaining unemployed or starting his or her own business and possibly starving for three or four months while that person is establishing this business.  I believe that if the interim period I am talking about was provided there would be an end to the abuse of the system, because there is no doubt that some people who have commenced a business, find out that they operate very well but continue to receive unemployment benefit or allowance for months and even years after they have commenced this business and try to ensure that the Department of Social Welfare do not know about it.  In the context of the way the social welfare legislation operates it is a disincentive to self-employment.  We must remove that.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the importance of the moneys the social insurance schemes bring into the State and to the levels of different contributions made.  It is worth reiterating what the Minister said about the contributions to the insurance fund.</P>
    <P>He stated:</P>
    <P>It is estimated that this year the Exchequer will bear some 21.5 per cent of total social insurance expenditure. Employers contributions will bear some 53 per cent of the cost and employee contributions some 25.5 per cent.</P>
    <P>We should consider those figures.  In <Col N="1781" /> recent weeks we have had the spectacle of protests and work stoppages, seeking changes in the tax code and the PRSI code, in firms and businesses which are viable and doing well.  Those work stoppages have been for political purposes. They sought to bring about a change through legislation in the situation, but the employer who finds himself faced with strike action or legal demands from employees has no control over this.  I find, in the context of the level of unemployment we have and the number of businesses and industries which are at risk, many of which are just surviving, that it is inexplicable that the people who have jobs are willing to put their jobs and those of colleagues at risk by seeking to make political points through industrial protests, jeopardising businesses and firms who cannot in any way be held responsible for the level of contributions employees make.  We all recognise that the income tax and social welfare contributions which an employee must make in the present economic climate are very hard to bear for the people concerned and their families.  The reason those payments are so large is because of the economic recession we find ourselves in and because of the vast number who are now dependent on the social welfare code for support.  I hope far more responsibility in this area will be shown in future.</P>
    <P>I believe that employees affected in this way have the right to articulate their views, the right to seek reform and change and that their views will be articulated by Members of this House.  But I do not believe they should force employers into either behaving unlawfully by asking them not to deduct the required insurance contributions and not to pass them on to the Department of Social Welfare, or seek to put them under the threat of strike or have one day protests for no good reason and so jeopardise employment.  Street protest on this issue is not necessary.  Every Member of the House understands the burden which has been placed on the average employee by increased taxes.  The difficulty we have is that there are so many people dependent on the social welfare code.  The State has so much expenditure at present that it is <Col N="1782" /> not in a position to reduce that commitment. I wonder what would happen if the situation was reversed?  The Minister gave us some interesting figures.  He said 25 per cent of the State expenditure in this area is contributed by employees. Some 53 per cent is contributed by employers.  What would the attitude of those who have gone out on strike or demonstrated through day or half day work stoppages be if, for example, employers decided to close down their businesses so that they would not have to pay that 53 per cent?  What would the attitude of the workers in the Waterford Glass Company be?  I am not saying this should happen because that would be equally irresponsible.</P>
    <P>I referred to anomalies in the social welfare code.  The Minister referred to an EEC directive which will require us by 1984 to remove many of the discriminations which exist in our social welfare code based on sex.  There are a number of anomalies in this area which clearly indicate our failure to adopt policies regarding social welfare.  They can easily be seen in the context of the social welfare benefits and allowances which are available for single parent families.</P>
    <P>At present we have a scheme for deserted wife's allowance and deserted wife's benefit which provides social welfare assistance for a deserted and unsupported wife.  It applies to both a wife without children who is over the age of 40 and depending on her husband's income and to a wife under the age of 40 with children.  There is no similar benefit or allowance for deserted husbands with young dependent children.  A deserted wife left to support three or four children has exactly the same everyday household expenditure as a deserted husband with the same number of children.  However, our system takes no account of deserted husbands.  If a deserted husband is unemployed or has no income of his own he can seek supplementary welfare allowance payments but the amount of funds he will receive is considerably less than he would receive under deserted wife's benefit or allowance.  This is an example of an idiosyncratic development within the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1783" /> It developed in this way because in the early seventies it was realised that many wives were deserted by husbands and left with dependent children.  They were not properly supported or provided for.  Little attention was given to the plight of the deserted husband.  There is need for legislation to remove the anomaly which exists in this area and have equality for husbands and wives if they are deserted. There is no excuse for not tackling this area.  Until recently it was an anomaly the Department did not fully understand. When I sought by way of parliamentary question statistics about the number of deserted husbands claiming supplementary allowance payments the information was not available.  The Department had not examined the problem to ascertain how great it was or how many people were affected by it.</P>
    <P>The present scheme of deserted wife's allowance should be replaced by a totally different one.  If we want to remove sexual inequalities we could have a deserted spouse's allowance.  The anomalies in the present scheme which are placing a number of husbands in severe financial difficulty should be removed.  I do not believe that the introduction of this kind of reform would put the State to any enormous expense.  No one knows how many husbands would be in this category and entitled to such an allowance.  In the context of deserted spouses left with dependent children the vast majority are wives but there are a number of husbands in that position who are not afforded the same protection as a wife would be in identical circumstances.</P>
    <P>There is another anomaly which indicates how clearly we distinguish between single parents in identical financial circumstances. As regards deserted wives we have an allowance and a benefit scheme.  If a woman's husband has paid a sufficient number of stamps, even if she has her own income, a deserted wife's benefit is paid to her, as it is recognised that she will have additional expenses as a single parent.  Such a person with one child faces the same financial difficulties and problems as an unmarried mother left to care for her child.  Whereas we <Col N="1784" /> have deserted wife's allowance and deserted wife's benefit, we have only unmarried mother's allowance.  We have not extended the benefit system to unmarried mothers.  There is little logic in that.  This indicates there is no clear philosophy behind the manner in which the social welfare code has developed. At present it treats single parent families with identical problems in different ways.</P>
    <P>As regards what the Minister said about introducing legislation to equalise the position of men and women we have at present a system of maternity allowance. We do not have paternity allowance or paternity leave.  To introduce it would put the State to initial expense but it is my understanding that the EEC directive will require us to introduce a system of paternity leave and allowances similar to the maternity allowance.  I have received in recent months representations from a number of constituents who find it quite anomalous that, following a child being born into a family, if the wife is ill after childbirth and needs some assistance for two or three weeks after returning from the maternity hospital and if the husband wishes to take time off he must do so out of his holiday time and is not entitled to anything such as a paternity allowance.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister realise that there is an extreme need for this appointment in South Tipperary and that effectively the people in South Tipperary have been neglected from the point of view of orthopaedic care and have been treated virtually as second class citizens?  The next routine orthopaedic appointment that I could get if I were a doctor referring a patient to Our Lady's Hospital, Cashel, would be in July 1984.  Does the Minister realise this? Does he realise also that there is a delay in hip joint replacements of something like 17 or 18 months in South Tipperary in comparison with Kilkenny 5.2 months, Carlow 6.2 months and Wexford 8.8 months?  We are getting an appalling service.  Since the comhairle have sanctioned it and the Department have recognised the need for it, will they take some action in the near future?</P>

They just cannot afford to drop one junior member of the medical staff to facilitate this appointment.  All these are needed.

      <P>Whilst the Minister is trying to sort out how soon he can make this orthopaedic appointment &mdash; which I know he recognises now as urgent &mdash; can he make any arrangements through the health board that certain types of orthopaedic patients could be seen on a more urgent basis in the interim?  Until July 1984 is a long time if you have a bad pain and need an orthopaedic opinion.  Is there any way that these patients who have acute pain can be seen urgently?</P>

      <P>The proposal submitted by the health board has been fair and reasonable.  We have two pre-occupations: (1) that they can make this appointment within their approved allocation; (2) that there be no consequential cost implication.  It is up to the health board to organise their medical and surgical appointments within that context.  I will examine it, but we have a very stringent budget for that health board and that budget for 1983 and indeed that for 1984 also must be adhered to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the future of Longford County Hospital is a matter in the first instance for the Midland Health Board and I have no firm proposal in the matter from the board. However, the development of the general hospital at Mullingar is a high priority with the health board as it is with me. When fully developed this hospital will be capable of serving the population of counties Longford and Westmeath and has been planned on that basis.  In the circumstances I can see no future for Longford County Hospital as a centre for the treatment of acute surgical inpatients in the long term.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take it that when the construction of the extension to Mullingar hospital is completed Longford hospital will close as a surgical unit? If so, when is the programme likely to get under way in Mullingar, particularly the construction part of it?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am currently finalising the capital programme for 1983-1988 and I am extremely anxious not only to allocate but to divert resources to Mullingar, especially in the paediatric area. However, I stress that if Longford hospital is to be retained on an acute hospital basis for surgery, it will have serious consequences for the development of Mullingar hospital because that hospital is at an advanced stage of planning for a catchment population area of 95,000 people. If Longford is retained, Mullingar will lose 30 per cent to 35 per cent of the catchment area and it would leave the viability of Mullingar in some doubt.  I hope I can reach agreement with the health board for a major development in Mullingar.  The health board and the local public representatives are being very constructive on this issue.</P>

It appears that Longford County Hospital has no future as a surgical unit.  Is the Minister aware of a commitment given by the Fine Gael candidate on behalf of the Fine Gael Party, that if elected to Government, they would not alone maintain Longford County Hospital but would upgrade it as a surgical unit?  In view of the replies the Minister has given, does he now disassociate himself from that commitment?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have Departmental responsibility and I have come to the conclusion, after the most careful examination, that the retention of an isolated unit performing surgery only in Longford hospital is completely against the general concept of the programme for the development and rationalisation of the general hospital services in the midlands.  The precise future of Longford hospital, perhaps not as a hospital but for immediate casualty, out-patients and clinic, could be considered but I cannot support the continuation of acute surgical work in the hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The medical group was probably the most expert group established in any European country. That expert group, as the Deputy knows, was established for the purpose of examining persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination prior to the establishment of the monitoring system.  Originally a total of 54 cases were presented for examination by the group.  The group decided that 14 of the 54 were probably damaged by vaccine.  The Government then decided to make an <i>ex gratia</i> payment on the clear basis that no liability was being accepted by the State.  Of the 36 new claims 26 have already been examined by the expert group and the remainder should be dealt with by the end of June.  The group will then submit their report to me.  At this stage it seems likely that very few will be considered as probable cases of vaccine damage.  As Deputies will appreciate, there is a great deal of subjective analysis and monitoring and assessment done and in such a highly subjective area of analysis by the medical expert group at this stage I do not want to go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has clearly indicated that 14 children at least have been adjudged by the expert medical group as having suffered damage and compensation has been paid to only two sets of parents.  Is the Minister in a position to indicate the reason why 12 sets of parents have not sought this payment and can the Minister confirm that the reason is the restrictive nature of the conditions imposed by his Department on parents who accept such payment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The offer was made to the parents concerned on the clear understanding that my Department could not and would not and indeed will not accept liability in relation to the matter. While I appreciate the enormous distress and disabling effects of what occurred in relation to that vaccine damage, the scheme was announced by my predecessor and I have some reservations as to whether there should have been a scheme of compensation at all and the word <Col N="1796" />&ldquo;compensation&rdquo; being used when, in fact, it was an <i>ex gratia</i> payment.  It is the privilege of the 12 sets of parents concerned to accept or not to accept.  I cannot force them to accept the <i>ex gratia</i> payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the conditions applied by his Department to the making of this payment are a good deal more restrictive than the conditions applied in identical circumstances under legislation passed in the United Kingdon to the making of identical payments and could the Minister explain the reason why his Department insist on these restrictive conditions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not accept it.  One must remember that in the UK there was not, as such, an expert examining group and they did not go through individual case studies with the intensity of examination and care which the Irish group did.  They worked on the basis of a series of submitted reports rather than individual examinations including, as occurred in Ireland, a great deal of clinical examinations and X-ray work and so on on each individual claim.  That did not occur at all in the UK.  The UK scheme was not a compensation scheme either. The basic <i>ex gratia</i> payment is no more than a payment to ease the difficulties of those who are suffering from vaccine damage.  I would certainly hold the view, having examined the matter very carefully, that the Irish system of assessment and the care taken by the Department of Health here is, if anything, superior to that of the UK and to any of the other EEC Member States.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister be prepared to make a statement showing the very low incidence of possible brain damage as a result of vaccine because many people believe that the possibility of this got untoward publicity in the past <Col N="1797" /> and as a consequence many mothers were afraid to get children vaccinated?  Would the Minister be prepared to make a statement emphasising the very low incidence of this condition?  I believe mothers need reassurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I would share the view of the Deputy in this regard.  It must be borne in mind that whatever the tragedy that occurred the person at the time received vaccination for his or her protection against the very distressing and often disabling effects of the infectious disease concerned.  Whooping cough can have the most severe complications such as convulsions and pneumonia and can even result in death, whereas of the 40 cases examined 14 were agreed but the incidence of effect is extraordinarily low and the balance of advantage to mothers of having their children vaccinated is overwhelmingly in favour of vaccination irrespective of the past probability or the current possibility of children being affected.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the secrecy that has surrounded this whole issue and the manner in which it has been dealt with by his Department and himself and his predesessors has given rise to suspicion which has resulted in a large number of parents not agreeing to their children being vaccinated in circumstances where children are not at risk?  This is an ongoing problem and 36 new cases have referred to the medical group since June of this year. Would the Minister not agree that legislation is desirable in the light of the fact that this matter has been dealt with in a more comprehensive way in England, France, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and a number of other countries?</P>

The expert medical group established in 1977 went to enormous trouble and took a great deal of care.  There is legislation in Denmark.  There is the 1961 Act in Germany.  In France a public health code was enacted.  In recent years we have attempted to come to grips with the situation.  Threats and legal action have been referred to.  The officials of the Department, the expert group and my predecessor bent over backwards to weigh the balance of probability or doubt in favour of the persons concerned.</P>

      <P>I hold the view very strongly that no amount of money would compensate for the trauma of the appalling effects visited on the tragic group involved.  It is important to bear in mind that cash compensation does not change the situation.  In some respects &mdash; I do not suggest this in relation to the parents concerned &mdash; in some of the representations I have received it may appear that there is an excessive preoccupation with cash compensation.  My Department endeavoured to give every special facility to the 54, the 14 and the new 36.  We have tried to provide special care, treatment and facilities for all persons who suffered this tragedy.  In that regard the State more than meets the obligation arising from the whooping cough vaccination tragedy.  In our publicity we stress that vaccination is an imperative in the case of infectious diseases and the prevention thereof.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that, even in the context of the parents whose children have been adjudged not to have been affected by the vaccine, the claims made by all of them were bona fide and were not made fallaciously or in an attempt to seek money?  Would the Minister accept that the concern of the parents whose children have been adjudged to be unaffected by the vaccine is that the information upon which the expert medical group made their decision has not been made available to them?  They feel they are entitled to have this information made available to them.  Would the Minister not agree that the information should be made available to the parents to remove suspicions or worries as to the correctness of the decisions made?  In the circumstances would the Minister consider establishing an appeals tribunal such as exists in other member states of the EEC for dealing with this issue?</P>

      <P>There is a major problem involved here.  I have been very circumspect.  I have used the phrase &ldquo;as a lay person&rdquo;.  Sensitive and confidential information is in the possession of the expert medical group.  The case histories concerned, the detailed inquiries they made from family doctors, and which they had to make in order to assess those cases, and the detailed inquiries they made from paediatricians and others with a knowledge of each individual case are confidential to the groups concerned.  If each parent has to be presented with all the assessments and the criteria used in relation to each individual claim, we are entering into a major area of medical ethical assessments.  I have examined the situation very carefully, as did my predecessor. Deputy Woods and I came to the conclusion that it would not be in the best interests of everybody concerned that all of the information on the case histories should be disclosed.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is referring to the selection procedure operated by the Local Appointments Commission in the case of health board consultants.  The selection of consultants for appointment to voluntary hospitals is a matter for the hospitals.</P>

    <P>The question of a common selection procedure for consultants is at present being examined by the Working Party on a Common Contract and a Common <Col N="1802" /> Selection Procedure for Consultants.

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was directed at the health board hospitals. The method of appointment of consultants to hospitals by the Local Appointments Commission is outdated.  It is important that the rules of the Local Appointments Commission be reviewed so that at least one of the four representatives on an interviewing board would come from the hospital to which the applicant will be appointed.  That person would know best what is suited to that hospital and the kind of person it would be necessary to appoint.</P>

The general reaction I get from the medical profession, consultants in particular &mdash; and only this morning I met a number of consultants to discuss general questions when the Local Appointments Commission method of appointment came up and when they all expressed general satisfaction. Personnel or boards may be dissatisfied but the overall system works extremely well.  In some respects I wish to God we had it in Dublin.</P>

    <P>In addition to grant aid to voluntary agencies under section 65 of the Health Act, 1953, shelter and maintenance may be provided &mdash; in emergencies or where no other accommodation is available &mdash; in bed-and-breakfast establishments. This would normally be paid for through supplementary welfare allowance funds. It is not possible for health boards to isolate the percentage of supplementary welfare moneys which go towards providing this accommodation.</P>
    <P>Health boards also assist agencies which provide accommodation for homeless people through subsidies towards meals, provision of laundry facilities and <Col N="1806" /> cleaning materials as well as through grants towards running costs, staff salaries and capitation payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he is aware of the total inadequacy of the existing health centre in Inchicore, Dublin 12; when he intends to build the new centre for which a site was provided seven years ago; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that health centre services are provided from a temporary premises at Inchicore pending the building of a new permanent health centre on a site at Emmet Road.  The new health centre has been approved in principle by my Department and the services to be provided there have been agreed with the Eastern Health Board.</P>
      <P>The inclusion of a particular building project in a public capital programme for any year is dependent on the extent of funds available and while the Eastern Health Board has included the health centre at Inchicore among its building schemes, the Deputy will appreciate that the demand for health centres in the greater Dublin region in general far exceeds available capital resources.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not indicate in his reply when he expects the Eastern Health Board to be in a position to build this particular health centre.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> Could he give us some indication; will it be this year, next year, ten years' time, or 20 years' time?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I am not in a position to say precisely when.  As the Deputy is aware the health boards establish their own priorities in conjunction with the Department.  Given the need, in the greater Dublin area, for many more health centres where there are no facilities laid on they would be an urgent priority and I would not foresee the building of this one in the very immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the reason there are so many projects on the waiting list in the Eastern Health Board area is the rapid growth of that area?  Would he accept further that the reason they cannot make progress with those projects is that they are not receiving sufficient capital to ensure that they can cater for the needs of the growing population?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, capital is a scarce resource today; we are all aware of that.  While it is only a temporary building for the health centre in Inchicore, there are other areas in the greater Dublin area which require immediate attention and they must receive priority from any capital resources available.  But I want to point out that it is included in the Eastern Health Board's plans.  I would be hopeful that they would deal with it fairly quickly but I cannot put a time limit on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that, when the Eastern Health Board are asked when they will provide this health centre, they reply: when they get the money from the Minister or the Department?  Could the Minister indicate when the Department intend to provide money for this health centre?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally the health board will say they are awaiting funds. They have an insatiable appetite for more money; all health boards have.  Naturally, when they are asked a question about a particular area, they say that if they had <Col N="1808" /> the money they would build.  That is the soft option as far as the health boards are concerned.  They get their capital allocation to develop their resources every year.  They have options they can exercise in that area in conjunction with the Department.  Therefore, it is not good enough for the health board to say they are awaiting money.  They know their capital allocation and know what they can do within that capital allocation.  I do not accept that it is just a question of awaiting money, because every health board and every other board in the country would lodge large bills for further development if capital was available.  But capital is at present a scarce resource and must be used where it is most needed.  I believe that is the way it should be.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the capital allocation to the Eastern Health Board is not keeping abreast of the growth of the area and their needs, because there is a very special problem in that area where there is a population growing at a great rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I am quite aware that it is a very large health board area.  That is taken into consideration.  Every year we look at the allocations but I do not think the Deputy would agree to taking money from the allocations to other health boards and giving it to the Eastern Health Board.  There is a given sum of money for the general health board schemes and we allocate as fairly as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have just recently received revised proposals from the western branch of the Irish Society for Autistic Children concerning the provision of a unit for autistic children at Laurel Park, Galway.  My Department will be examining the proposal in consultation with the Western Health Board.  When the proposal has been examined I will consider the possibility of assisting it from the limited capital funds at my disposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it true that the plans to provide the centre for autistic children were discussed with the then Minister for Health, Deputy Eileen Desmond, many months ago and that the plans are well known in the Department?  Is the Minister aware that building has recently commenced and that, unless the Department are prepared to come forward with a capital allocation towards the cost of building the centre, work may have to cease?  The revised plans to which the Minister has referred have brought about a reduction of nearly 50 per cent on the original estimated cost.  The society have done all that could possibly be expected of them and I would ask the Minister for a more positive response.</P>

A matter I wish to refer to, one that was mentioned also by Deputy O'Hanlon, is the free fuel scheme.  This scheme operates in a very odd way depending on where one happens to live.  A person living in a city or urban area will qualify for entitlement on one set of criteria but a person living in a county area qualifies for entitlement on a different set of criteria.  My constituency covers part of the city and the county of Dublin; the city and county boundaries meet along one street.  Pensioners on one side of the street are entitled as of right to free fuel vouchers because they live within the city boundary but pensioners living on the other side of the street in the same financial and social circumstances do not qualify because a different set of criteria apply to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The different criteria developed because when the scheme started during the course of the Second World War the view was taken that people in city areas needed assistance in paying for fuel. It <Col N="1831" /> was thought that people living in the country areas could go out into the countryside and collect bundles of wood and, therefore, did not need similar assistance. What could be called the &ldquo;wood&rdquo; philosophy obviously has prevailed in the operation of the scheme since 1943 and has not changed one jot since.</P>
    <P>The only problem with this theory is that people in my constituency who live in County Dublin can no longer trail out into the forests or go to the local farmyard and pick up pieces of wood.  Most of County Dublin is now an urban built-up area and I should imagine the anomaly that exists in my area with regard to the scheme exists also in other areas throughout the country.  A real injustice is being suffered by people because of what might be called the &ldquo;wood&rdquo; philosophy.  We should have a national scheme applying to all parts of the country.  At the moment two contradictory schemes are in operation and this is causing hardship to many people.  I urge the Minister, as I have done with his predecessors on many occasions in similar debates, to introduce legislation to provide a uniform free fuel scheme that would apply throughout the country.  It is time that we moved away from the philosophy of the Second World War and administer the scheme to meet the needs of the people of Ireland in the 1980s.</P>
    <P>There are a number of problems with regard to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme that should be highlighted. One of them is a problem for those who administer this scheme and those who seek to advise people about their entitlements.  I have raised this matter before but nothing has been done about it.  I am informed by supplementary welfare allowance officers &mdash; because we are in the 1980s we call them community welfare officers but they are still supplementary welfare allowance officers under the legislation &mdash; that they are supplied by the Department of Social Welfare with guidelines that direct them as to the manner in which they are to reach their decisions when people seek allowances.  In particular they provide directions as to the circumstances in which they should <Col N="1832" /> exercise their discretion under the Act. This discretion allows them to make payments to people in particular circumstances but the guidelines curb that discretion. I understand from the officers &mdash; they are servants of the State and cannot make public speeches about this or if they did they would probably be sacked &mdash; that the effect of the guidelines is that the scheme is not being operated in accordance with the legislation.</P>
    <P>By curtailing the discretion of these officers, the guidelines do not allow them to be as flexible as the Act intended them to be in certain circumstances.  As a result they find that when they should make allowances in some instances, in respect of which they have statutory powers, the guidelines curb that discretion.  Because of the guidelines and epistles emanating from the Department, they are not supposed to make payments and if they do they get into some difficulties.  These officers should not be put in that position. If they fulfil their statutory duty they break departmental guidelines but those guidelines should not conflict with the legislation passed by this House.</P>
    <P>There is a problem in connection with the guidelines, in that Members of this House, other than one or two former Ministers, do not know what is in them. Elected members of health boards and committees and Members of this House who have sought copies of the guidelines have been told they will not be made available to them because they are internal departmental documents.  It may be that my information on this matter is not true but I do not believe that.  There is no reason why I should receive representations on this point that are untrue. There should not be any secrecy or mystique about what is in the guidelines. Many members of the public who have sought assistance under this scheme are of the belief that they have not been treated fairly.  Supplementary welfare officers are at the receiving end of the remarks of disgruntled applicants when the officers administer the scheme in the way the guidelines appear to require.  I ask the Minister to end the secrecy that surrounds them.  They should be made available to Members of this House and <Col N="1833" /> to members of health boards and local health committees.  Health boards have the statutory function, through the Department, of administering the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.  It is nonsense that the elected members of those bodies do not know what is in the guidelines.  Once and for all, the Minister should end the secrecy attached to them.</P>
    <P>When the supplementary scheme was set up its great merit was that a number of individuals, as of right, were entitled to receive allowances under the scheme. That moved us away from the home assistance concept where everything was discretionary.  While certain discretionary powers were left to officers to deal with exceptional problems or circumstances, the merit was that certain people had entitlements under the scheme as of right.  The second merit was that, unlike the old home assistance scheme, the legislation envisaged that there would be formal social welfare appeals tribunals so that people who felt their applications for supplementary welfare allowances were wrongly turned down would have an opportunity of a full and proper appeal before an appeals tribunal.  Formal appeals tribunals have never been established under the scheme.  Directors of community care have been put in the position of acting as appeals tribunals.  I believe the manner in which this is operating is unsatisfactory.</P>
    <P>I appreciate that at this stage to establish a whole panoply of appeals tribunals in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance scheme throughout the State would probably result in considerable expenditure which we can ill afford.  I believe there is a way in which this can be done without incurring too much expenditure.  I believe there is a need to formalise the appeal structure.  I urge the Minister to go back and have a look at the legislation and its original intent and provide for a more formal and independent type of appeal structure than exists at the moment.  He should also ensure that applicants for supplementary allowance are aware that if their applications for the allowance are turned down they have the right of appeal.  Very often people are unaware of this and do not pursue their <Col N="1834" /> rights.  In the context of the present economic climate the supplementary welfare allowance scheme provides a safe social welfare scheme to those in very real need and provides a basic form of assistance. It is important that this scheme is seen to be administered properly, that there is no mystique or secrecy attached to it, that people are seen to be dealt with fairly and that people understand that they have the right to appeal.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to another anomaly in the social welfare code.  Around 1974 social insurance contributions became compulsory for many people for whom they had not been previously compulsory. Many of those who, from 1974 onwards, made social insurance payments and retired some years afterwards became entitled to the old age contributory pension.  There are a number of people who have been caught in a rather odd and peculiar anomaly which needs to be sorted out.  I have come across two or three of my own constitutents who are in this situation.  There are a number of people who during the course of the fifties and sixties received salaries in some cases for not more than three or four months which brought them within the old social welfare code and required them to make a social welfare contribution. One particular constituent between January and March 1953 got an increase in salary that was backdated and this resulted in the Department of Social Welfare holding him liable for social insurance contributions.  He paid in all ten insurance contributions.  He then fell outside the social insurance net and was brought back within it in 1974.  He continued paying social welfare insurance from 1974 until April 1981, when he retired.</P>
    <P>If this person had never paid the ten contributions from January to March 1953 he would have automatically been entitled to an old age contributory pension because of the contributions made from 1974 to 1981.  It was through no fault of his that he did not make any contributions from March 1953 until 1974.  The Department, because he made those ten contributions, in determining whether during his years of employment he made <Col N="1835" /> a sufficient number of contributions, instead of looking at the position from 1974 to 1981, backdated his position to 1953.  There is this anomalous and ridiculous situation: if this man had not been fortunate enough to get a back payment which affected him for three months in 1953 and if he had not made the ten contributions to the social insurance code, if he had received the increase in pay and nobody had told the Department of Social Welfare and those ten contributions had not been made, that man as of right would today be entitled to a contributory old age pension.  He is severely prejudiced by an anomalous ruling of the Department of Social Welfare under a statutory provision which affects a number of people who have retired in recent years and who find that because possibly for a year in the fifties they came within the social insurance net, they cannot now get a contributory pension.  Colleagues of theirs who worked throughout all those years and who did not make any contribution whatsoever in the fifties or sixties are entitled to a contributory old age pension.</P>
    <P>The problem here is that it affects a small number of people, is clearly an injustice, but it is a complicated matter to explain.  It is not the stuff of politicians speeches on the hustings.  It will not generate great applause by raising it.  Nevertheless it creates a severe injustice.  I urge the Minister to look at this very seriously. It is a matter, in the context of the cost factor, for the State to put right.  In the context of the number of people it affects it would be little more than a drop in the ocean, but it would right a great injustice. I hope the Minister will take this seriously and will see that, in the interests of equity, it is dealt with by a change in the approach of the Department or, if necessary, by amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I know I have been critical of the Minister and of the social welfare code, but a debate of this nature is only useful if Deputies come into the House and indicate their views of where there are problems or difficulties with the social welfare code, what type of reforms are required and what existing anomalies need to be <Col N="1836" /> tackled.  The criticisms I made were not intended to be critical of the Minister personally, whom I wish well.  I believe he intends to tackle many of the areas I have referred to.  I hope he will heed the remarks made by other Deputies and myself during the course of the debate. I wish him well in the coming year.  I hope that when we have a similar debate next year I will not find myself again raising all the points I have raised today, many of which have been made by me in previous debates on social welfare legislation or in Estimates debates.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Labour Party Deputies are conspicuous by their absence.  I hope this situation does not continue and that they come into the House and make contributions to this Estimate debate. The Labour Party have always maintained that they are the party who are interested in the underprivileged, the deprived, the unemployed and all the other people who need help under the social welfare code.  When it comes to coming into the House and speaking on the Social Welfare Estimate, where are they?  Perhaps they will come in next week, if this debate continues then.  Perhaps they will have the courage of their convictions to come into the House, sit behind the Minister and support him on his Estimate.  I doubt if they will, because they really do not agree with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Labour Party are really finding it very difficult to vote for this Social Welfare Estimate and the Social Welfare Bill, as we saw recently.  The reason for this is that they know the policies being pursued in this regard are wrong, unfair and unjust.  They will find it very hard to support the policies being pursued by the Coalition Government.  We all realise that those policies are causing grave unemployment problems.  The fact that we now have almost as many people unemployed and on social welfare as we have employed is causing untold hardship for the community.  We realise that if we pay out large sums of money to help the unemployed it has to come from somewhere. It is the people who are working who are contributing this money.  They are finding it more difficult to pay because <Col N="1837" /> of the high numbers who are unemployed. It would not be so bad if inflation was dropping.  If we were like Britain who has an inflation rate of 4 per cent we could hope that when the recession passed there would be an upturn in employment.  However, this is not the case.</P>
    <P>We have rapidly rising inflation.  At present it is 17 per cent.  The recent farm price increases will add 3 per cent to inflation.  People will have to pay more for food products.  Last year under Fianna Fáil inflation had dropped from 24 per cent to 12 per cent but this year it is up to almost 20 per cent.  That will not do anything for employment.  Rather more jobs will be lost and more and more people will draw unemployment assistance. The work force is growing smaller while the number of unemployed grows. No country can sustain that.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that we have to put up with that kind of unemployment.  The Government are doing nothing to create new jobs or maintain existing ones.  Factories are closing down every day and more and more people are out of work. Now I know why £31 million was set aside for unemployment benefit.  With the number of unemployed we have we will be looking for another £31 million before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>I wish the Government would look at the problems families have and try to understand how serious they are.  People who have been in employment for up to 25 years are now unemployed.  Among them are many men in their forties who are the sole providers for their families. They find they are going out to dirty, dreary unemployment exchanges.  They are humiliated and embarrassed.  They have to stand in long queues.  They will not tolerate this kind of situation.  They are unable to provide for their families, pay their mortgages, send their children to school properly dressed, pay bus fares, doctors' bills and so on.  The people will become so humiliated and deflated that they will not be able to manage to pull themselves out of it.  The Government must do something quickly to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Many of those in the 16 to 18-year age group cannot find jobs.  There are no <Col N="1838" /> allowances for them.  Parents have to try to feed and clothe them.  They are becoming destructive and going on to the streets.  It is hard to blame them because they have nothing else to do.  It is causing untold harm to society to have so many young people unemployed.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he set aside £5 million to help 20,000 families and I heard Deputy O'Hanlon say this morning that would be less than £5 per family.  If there are administrative costs involved it will be even less.  What will we do with the 20,000 families?  Will we give them £2 or £3 a week?  The £5 million might have been put to better use because giving someone £3 a week will not help very much.  Who will we give it to?  How will they apply for it?  What criteria will be laid down in order to receive this small pittance the Minister will hand out to those practically on the breadline?</P>
    <P>There are many anomalies and inequalities in the social welfare code and I am glad the Minister decided to set up a commission.  An extensive survey was carried out recently and I wonder if the Minister took that into account.  I hope he will appoint some Members of the House to the commission so that they will have an input into it.  Public representatives know a great deal about problems in the social welfare code.  All Deputies hold regular clinics.  Apart from people who come about unemployment and housing problems, the largest category come about social welfare.  Their biggest problem is that they do not know what they are entitled to.  They do not know how or where to apply.  The social welfare code is a mess of inconsistencies and anomalies.  If some Minister could make it an easy system where everybody would get what they are entitled to, I would thank that person and welcome their efforts.</P>
    <P>People on medical benefit find that even though they are legitimately sick, attending their doctor and receiving a medical certificate each week, they are being sent for by an appeals officer so that he can determine whether they are genuinely entitled to the benefit.  This seems to be a complete waste of time. <Col N="1839" /> Either we trust a doctor to give his patient a medical certificate or we do not.  If we do not trust them to say to the Department of Social Welfare that a person is ill and not fit for work, then we should investigate the doctors to see whether they are doing a proper job.  We should not have appeals officers in the Department of Social Welfare disputing the opinion of a medical doctor.  How can we decide who is right and who is wrong?  If a doctor gives a person a medical certificate that should be enough for the Department of Social Welfare.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the increase in the amount of money that people must pay within the month under the drugs scheme.  That amount has been increased from £10 to £23.  A guideline for the medical card is £77&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That would be more relevant to the next Estimate for the Department of Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to explain that the amount of increases that the social welfare recipients are getting will be eroded by this increase in the drug scheme in some cases because thereby the recipients will lose their medical card. Therefore, what is the point of giving them £1 over the guideline if then they will have to pay up to £23?  For goodness sake, give them a sufficient increase in their social welfare benefits and contributory old age pension to pay for the increase in the price of drugs.  The 10 per cent or 12 per cent will not give people even enough money to keep up with what they have to pay out, never mind the increase in the cost of living when inflation is going up to nearly 18 per cent. This means that people are much worse off as a result of this budget and this social welfare Bill which came in recently.  Their incomes have been reduced considerably.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They will get this increase in July.  Of course, the Government state that it comes in at the end of June.  Long ago we would see something for sale in a shop priced at 1s.11½d, never 2s., because the 1.11½d. seemed much less than the 2s.  It <Col N="1840" /> is said that people will get the increase in June when in fact it will be July.  They will have to wait several months for it, although inflation and prices are going up and so are rents.</P>
    <P>That is another area of an increase in the cost of living under this Social Welfare Bill which will cause untold hardship to old people whose rents have been increased considerably.  That has not been taken into account in the increase in the social welfare benefits.  Old people particularly will not be able to afford even a small increase in their rent and the Government have reduced the amount of money to supplement the rent from £15.5 million to £10 million.  Many of those old people will find their rents increased in the courts by vast amounts and the Government will not give them sufficient for them to live and pay the small rent that they had been paying and they will find it extremely difficult to cope.</P>
    <P>The Minister this morning said &mdash; and I agree and accept &mdash; that a vast amount of discrimination against women exists still in the social welfare code.  He has stated that numerous aspects of this will be remedied in 1984.  That, of course, is under an EEC directive.  Did anything at all happen to bring women into line and to eliminate discrimination against them except under EEC regulations?  Only for the EEC we would still be back in the dark ages.  The woman in the home about whom the last Coalition in 1981 were so concerned that they stated that they would give her £9.60 of her husband's tax rebate to ensure that she would be properly maintained was also to get optical and dental treatment free.  What has happened to all this concern about the woman in the home with a family?  She does not get even an increase in the children's allowances this year.</P>
    <P>When we gave a substantial increase in children's allowances the Labour Party particularly were never satisfied with it. They always said we were not giving enough.  They said that the 25 per cent increase in social welfare was not enough. Deputy Cluskey was not happy about a budget which increased social welfare allowances by 25 per cent.  He said that it was not enough, it should be 30 per <Col N="1841" /> cent.  That was a few short years ago, and here he is now in a Government who are giving 10 per cent and 12 per cent, which is not a percentage at all because it is eroded before the people get it, and there is no increase whatsoever in children's allowances.  There is not a word about the promise to give the woman in the home free optical and dental treatment.</P>
    <P>Will we be listening to those promises forever?  Will the people who need this kind of help ever get it?  I know women who cannot even afford to go to the dentist because they have not enough money to do so.  We all know that dental treatment is extremely expensive and no woman in the home in the present economic situation, with increased prices in the shops, can afford to pay £100, £200 or even more to have a large dental job done.  What is she to do?  She must do without it.  That is all, and the same applies to optical treatment.  We all know that a pair of glasses will cost around £70 or £80.  How is a woman at home in the house with four or five children to get that kind of money?  When will we make sure that women in the home are entitled to that and will get it?</P>
    <P>The debate on this Estimate has contained a good deal of repetition.  Do we come in here and waste our time?  Is anybody listening to us?  Will anybody do anything about what we ask or state here? Will anybody try to put into operation the various suggestions made by Deputies in the House?  The free fuel voucher scheme was mentioned by several Deputies this morning.  This scheme was improved when Deputy Haughey was in the Department of Health and Social Welfare but it was not improved sufficiently and I agree with previous speakers that the scheme contains numerous anomalies.  Two people have the same amount of money coming in to them and one will get free fuel under the scheme while the other will not.  That is most unfair.  I ask the Minister as a matter of urgency, before the operation of this scheme begins again in October, to ensure that it will be applied equally.  He should also ensure that no one will be able to go to a Deputy and say that his neighbour can get something which he <Col N="1842" /> cannot get.  It is very difficult to try to explain that the fuel scheme works in different ways in different parts of the country. The Minister should make sure that this scheme is sorted out before October.  I hope the computers he mentioned in his speech will ensure that people will receive equal treatment.  I wonder how much these computers will cost.  I hope they will be of benefit because sometimes when computers take over the work formerly done by people they churn out something over and over again and cannot be stopped.  If it is fed the wrong information, it is impossible to change it. If a social welfare recipient is not getting the correct benefit it might take weeks and months for the computer to change its mind.  Let us hope that it will be an efficient system which will help those in receipt of social welfare benefits.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that the Government are committed to protecting the living standards of social welfare recipients. How can he possibly state that when the money paid to social welfare recipients has been reduced?  Nobody will be any better off and, probably by the end of the year, most of them will be much worse off than they were in April. Increasing unemployment is the major factor in the sad situation that exists today.  The Minister also said that it is affecting contribution income.  It should be the Government's first priority to remedy unemployment because, unless people get jobs, those receiving benefits &mdash; the less well off, the handicapped, widows and deserted wives &mdash; will never be better off because the money is not there.  We must increase employment so that we will have more people making a contribution to the Exchequer so that underprivileged people will get increases in their allowances.</P>
    <P>The general increase in social welfare rates is inadequate.  They do not come into operation until 1 July.  They will reduce pay-related benefits by 15 per cent. People will have to wait from two to three weeks longer to receive their benefits and, instead of the 10 per cent and 12 per cent increases they believe they are getting, in reality they will be getting only 7½ per cent and 9½ per cent <Col N="1843" /> increases.  The less well off people depend on the policies of the Government to ensure that their living standards are maintained.  This Government have let the people know in no uncertain terms that they are not prepared to maintain the standard of living of the less well off section of the community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are all aware of the enormous cost to the Department of Social Welfare in funding the benefits to which people are entitled, especially in such a period of high unemployment. Factories are closing down at the rate of 20 per week, so obviously unemployment is going to get worse.  People who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own are entitled to have a reasonably decent standard of living for their wives and families.  They cannot be allowed to exist under conditions of poverty.  We are all entitled to the essentials of life, including medical care.</P>
      <P>There are certain aspects of the implementation of the distribution of benefits which could be improved, and there can be no disagreement about that.  Every Member of this House recognises that the non-payment of disability benefit is one of the main causes of all the written questions which are put before this House every week.  Deputies from every constituency have to ask why disability benefit has not been paid to people in their constituencies.  This is an extraordinary waste of time, but the Deputies have to do this because of the inefficiency of the Department in not making these payments.  There must be reform in this area, because in general these are very clear-cut cases and it should not take five to eight weeks to assess them before payments are made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister and the Department should recognise that many of these people are subjected to the demeaning process of having to go to the social welfare officer and apply for supplementary benefit.  People hope they will be paid on a Thursday or Friday and when the money does not come perhaps they are not in a position to call on the social welfare officer who may not live in their <Col N="1844" /> immediate area.  They may not have travel facilities to allow them to go to the town where the social welfare officer lives to apply for supplementary welfare benefit. They often have to live over the week-end in very difficult circumstances and may have to borrow money to provide the essentials of life.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that all Members of this House are aware that this happens. I would like to see the Department reforming the methods of payment so that they can be more streamlined and efficient.  There is often too an undue delay in the payment of unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>I am a little concerned about the position with regard to old age pensions. There is a very long delay in deciding a person's eligibility for a non-contributory old age pension.  Many people who have looked after their family well and have disposed of their property to their family wait months and months for a decision to be taken.  I would question the desirability of the local old age pensions committee. Much of the information laid before these committees is very private and personal. I am not suggesting that members of these committees would be there for the lowly reason of finding out the income or assets of any particular person but I believe it is a fairly demeaning process. I do not think old age pension committees solve any problems or get any extra benefits for applicants.  This should be solely a departmental function.</P>
    <P>We must look at the whole system of the social insurance fund and social insurance contributions and see if we have reached a stage where change could be introduced.  We should look first at the contributions and decide if this is a tax or not.  If it is a tax it should be judged by the criterion which should be used on any type of taxation.  It should be evaluated for equity, efficiency and simplicity.  I believe it is a form of tax.  I know the Department are not inclined to concede that and to say that it is a method devised to allow the Department to build up a record over a period of time to determine people's eligibility for benefits.  This was true I am sure until the abolition of the insurance stamp in 1979 but it is probably <Col N="1845" /> no longer the case.  Over 80 per cent of the social insurance services are funded by contributions and the contributions at present are proving a crippling tax on PAYE workers.  I believe it is quite an unfair method of taxation.  It is paid on a flat rate and not related to marital status or dependency but only to pay.  There are 12 different rates of social insurance contribution at present and the benefits are totally dependency-related, so in many cases people who are obtaining these benefits are not getting good value for their money.  Some attempt should be made to introduce some other method to fund social insurance.  It is becoming apparent that it is a tax on labour, it will very likely continue to increase unemployment and it is a disincentive for any employer to employ workers.  It particularly discourages employers from employing people on lower incomes, from employing part-time workers, women, old and unskilled workers. These people are a large section of our community and we should be encouraging their employment.  To impose a tax on potential employers which will inhibit them from providing jobs is a regressive step.</P>
    <P>There are other areas where the payment of benefits can be improved.  We have medical referees for the disability benefit scheme.  We have heard from different people about people obtaining disability benefit to which they are not entitled. That may have happened.  I do not know.  I have had no personal experience of it.  Our medical referees do their job as well as possible, but there are not enough of them.  This check should be available in every area at regular intervals. After a certain period, people obtaining disability benefit, and medical certificates from their doctors, should be brought before a medical referee regularly for an assessment of their condition. With the small number of medical referees we have, people get disability benefit indefinitely, and perhaps in certain cases they may not be entitled to it.</P>
    <P>As I said, I have no personal experience of this, but I can appreciate the problems of an overworked family doctor with many patients coming to see <Col N="1846" /> him.  People who are on certain treatment because of certain conditions come to him once a week for their medical insurance certificates.  In view of the fact that the doctor is overworked he might be inclined to take the easy way out, as it were, and sign the medical certificate. That is all the patient would be looking for on that occasion.  I am not implying in any way that the people looking for certificates or the doctors are dishonest but, as a safeguard, we should have more medical referees available in each area.</P>
    <P>Anyone who is on long-term medical certification for over a year, and who has been accepted as being entitled to disability benefit by the medical referee, and particularly if the type of illness is permanent, automatically should receive an invalidity pension.  Some people have been on disability benefit and long-term certification for two or three years and the Department have not considered providing them with an invalidity pension until this was brought to their notice.  This should be a relatively automatic procedure.</P>
    <P>The guideline suggested is one year. We should have a definite guideline and, when it is reached, the person should be carefully and clinically assessed for possible eligibility for an invalidity pension. This would relieve people of having to go to the trouble of attending at monthly intervals for medical certification.  It would relieve the workload of the doctor and would give people the extra benefits to which they are entitled such as free travel and, hopefully, the double payments in September or before Christmas which were so deeply appreciated by recipients.  I have no doubt that the Minister will continue these double payments to people who are entitled to them.</P>
    <P>There are areas for reform to ensure the utmost efficiency.  Apart from the most efficient type of service which I know the Department would like to provide, the whole structure of the payments should be made more equitable and efficient so that there is no disincentive to work or to the provision of employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should <Col N="1847" /> like to thank most sincerely all the Deputies who contributed to this debate constructively and positively.  That attitude is most important in a debate on social welfare.  I hope that spirit will continue. Because of our economic situation there are great pressures on the Department of Social Welfare.  There is no question about that.  Our budget now is nearly £2 billion which gives a clear indication of the magnitude of the services provided. The cost of administration is only 4 per cent.  I commend my Department on the efficiency of their administration. Obviously in any Department dealing with so many claims and so many demands, from time to time problems arise.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the processing of applications for unemployment assistance.  I agree that because of the demand there are delays.  People on unemployment benefit &mdash; I do not know if they are informed of this, but they should be; I will check it &mdash; can apply for a qualification certificate in advance and have it completed so that they can automatically receive unemployment assistance. If people come in off the street, so to speak, to the exchange or the local office they have to be investigated. Because of the numbers involved, that causes particular problems.  I want to assure the House that in that area we intend to ensure that delays are minimised, because they cause hardship, people suffer, and that is not good enough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon raised another point with regard to the increases in the budget this year of 12 per cent and 10 per cent and felt that possibly it would have been better to have paid the full year at 9 per cent and 7½ per cent, which would mean people receiving the increases earlier. That may look somewhat attractive, but when examined it falls down.  That might be all right in year one, but year on year obviously the 10 per cent and 12 per cent are much better.  I would not agree, therefore, that it is important we revert to that.  Obviously the temptation to do so is great &mdash; and I have no doubt that the Government may have been tempted <Col N="1848" />&mdash; but when one examines the percentage figures it is found they are very low.</P>
    <P>We are endeavouring to create, right across the board, a climate of moderation. We have got to get our whole costs system down.  I am hoping that society will respond to the calls made by the Government to moderate pay increases. If we get this moderation &mdash; and I believe we will &mdash; if we can control prices, then we shall get inflation down to low, single figures, when those increases of 10 per cent and 12 per cent will be found to be meaningful.  Again, that is something that we as a Government must do.  As it is, the economy is not healthy; and if we become inefficient and less competitive, it will cause further unemployment and place pressures on those exchanges we are talking about.  That is something of which we must all be mindful.  Given the situation obtaining, I believe that the increases were reasonable.  Obviously, everybody would like to give more; but we must face the reality of the economic situation in which we find ourselves.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the family income supplement, maintaining that it would look after only about 20,000 families.  First of all, the Minister indicated that this scheme is being reviewed. The principle is right: there are families at risk.  I noted Deputy Lemass making the comment: &ldquo;Only £4 or £5 a week&rdquo;. To a family on a very low income £4 or £5 a week can mean something.  It is important that there be some type of family income supplement to ensure that people can obtain the necessities of life. I believe that principle is important and right.  Obviously, we can only see its effectiveness in operation.  I believe it will be successful and has a role to play in our society.  We would rather it had not such a role to play, that wages and incomes were at such a level that there would be no need for this type of supplement.  But in the present situation it is necessary.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter sought consolidation of the social welfare regulations.  We have the 1981 Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act.  The whole question of consolidation of these regulations is going ahead.  I hope that will also tidy up the whole area, rendering the process much simpler.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1849" /> A number of Deputies spoke about information being available.  I believe people should have ready access to information and to benefits.  Indeed, the Department have published very good booklets in regard to both rates and the benefits to which people are entitled. However, very often the people one is endeavouring to establish contact with at that level are not that accessible and we may fail.  We do make such booklets available at all our centres.  These booklets are very simple and easily understood.</P>
    <P>It is important also that the staff in the various social welfare offices be aware of and always willing to give information. We should always have our best people up front in these public offices.  It should be remembered that the public pay, that they are the customer and deserve the best we can afford.  I would always be interested in ensuring that people are well treated and looked after.  The whole question of having information readily available to people or of getting payments quickly is something about which we must always be vigilant.  On the disability benefit side the situation is good. It is computerised and, if the information inserts come up with the correct information, it operates well.  There are, of course, a percentage of failures; but generally I believe it operates well.</P>
    <P>I think also that the whole area of welfare should be computerised and in this respect there are proposals at present being examined.  That should improve the service to people generally.  However, one must understand that with the large numbers of people becoming eligible for social welfare, in whatever category, we are still basically operating with the same complement of staff.  That is why it is important that we computerise the system generally.</P>
    <P>The appointment of a Commission on Social Welfare is very important.  Of its very nature the system is built up, on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis without proper planning.  I am hopeful that we can examine its whole fabric to ascertain the direction in which it is going and how it should develop.</P>
    <P>Our social welfare system constitutes <Col N="1850" /> a very important aspect of our lives and our society must be judged on how such a system develops.  If I may deviate somewhat for a moment, I noticed a question on the Order Paper today complaining that henceforth medical cards will have to be used for school transport, that it is dreadful that people be asked to display a medical card.  I dispute that.  People have medical cards as of right and it is nothing to be ashamed of or, indeed, to hide.  They are the same as any other benefits.  They are not a form of handout.</P>
    <P>Deputy McCarthy spoke about the employers' and the employees' contributions. He is convinced that this is a form of taxation but I would have to disagree.  We have a social insurance scheme and people who are in need have a right to claim.  That right would not exist under a scheme of taxation.  It is misleading to say it is a form of taxation. Many people who pay tax under the PAYE system feel very strongly about the payment of PRSI but it is wrong to consider withholding these payments. These people are in employment and by taking this action they would deprive people who are less fortunate and out of work.  A social insurance system must be funded.  The State pays 21 per cent, the employer 53 per cent and the employee 25 per cent.  Deputy McCarthy said that this is a tax on employment but benefits must be paid for.  The State is carrying a reasonable share, as is the employee, and it is equitable that the employer should carry the bulk.  I would hate to feel that we were imposing a penal tax on employment but it is part of the obligation when employing people to insure them in the event of redundancy.  We should not look on our social insurance scheme as a form of income tax.  If that attitude develops there will be a hardening of opinion against the whole system and ultimately the people who will suffer will be those with the smaller voice in society, old age pensioners and social welfare recipients in general.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned the free fuel system.  I would accept that it is not a well organised scheme and we will have to look at it again.  It operates fairly well within the cities and towns but not in the <Col N="1851" /> rural areas.  Any scheme should be equitable and should be seen to be so and there have been a number of complaints regarding this scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass also raised the matter of the rent allowance scheme for tenants of dwellings which were formerly rent controlled.  We are aware that court cases are being held very frequently and that some harsh decisions are being made. There is no question of a cut in the allowance for pensioners and social welfare recipients.  The allocation in the Book of Estimates is reduced to £10.5 million because we know this amount is more than adequate.  Some rents have risen from £1.20 to £35 a week and if such a scheme did not exist people would be on the roadside seeking accommodation from the local authorities.  It is to be hoped that a rent tribunal will be established as quickly as possible so that more equitable settlements may be reached. There is no question of any reduction in the rent allowance scheme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter indicated his hope that some Members of the Oireachtas might be included in the commission on social welfare.  He pointed out that they are the people who will enact any legislation to give effect to any recommendations made by the commission.  I will pass his suggestion to the Minister because the idea has great merit.  Public representatives have a wealth of experience in the area of social welfare, dealing with people at a very practical level.  The setting up of this commission is long overdue and I hope they will bring forward a report quickly within a given time.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  We have noted them and they will be considered.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Vaccine-Damaged Children.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment, which arises directly from a number of Dáil questions I tabled today and which were dealt with by the Minister.  It might be of assistance to the <Col N="1852" /> House if I outlined briefly the history of this matter.</P>
      <P>It goes back to the early 1970s when a number of parents alleged their children had suffered permanent brain damage as a result of the three-in-one vaccination programme, which included vaccination for whooping cough.  Following representations made by them to the Department of Health, in 1975 the records of some of the children were examined by medical officers attached to the Department who concluded that no children had been adversely affected by the vaccine.  Although the Department concluded no children had been adversely affected at that stage, about that time the Department introduced new procedures. They introduced a form of questionnaire that doctors or nurses would ask parents to reply to before the children were administered the whooping cough vaccine.</P>
      <P>The parents did not accept the medical officers' view in 1975 that the children had not been affected by the vaccine and they continued to put pressure on the Government to clarify the position.  In February 1977 this matter was raised in the Dáil and the then Minister for Health, Mr. Brendan Corish, rejected allegations that 30 children had suffered brain damage as a result of the whooping vaccine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The parents still did not accept the approach coming from the Department, and as a result of further representations in autumn 1977 the then Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, established an expert medical group to examine and assess cases of alleged damage resulting from the administration of the whooping cough vaccine.  This group took an extremely long period before they produced a report.  Their report was finally made available to the former Minister for Health, Deputy Woods, at the beginning of July 1982.  In a press release on 24 July 1982 it was stated the group had completed its examinations of some 54 persons whom it was alleged suffered permanent brain damage as a result of the administration of the whooping cough vaccine.  In the press release it was stated that on the balance of probability 14 of <Col N="1853" /> these people had suffered a disability while 40 had not done so.  It is worth stating that that report only became available in July 1982 as a result of considerable adverse publicity generated in the preceding three months.  As a result of a meeting I had with the former Minister for Health in June 1982 the expert medical group were required to conclude their deliberations and report.</P>
    <P>At that stage the Government did not clarify whether they were going to make any payments of an <i>ex gratia</i> nature in respect of the children whom it was alleged had suffered brain damage and whom the group had accepted had suffered brain damage.  On 4 November 1982 Deputy Woods announced that the Government had decided to offer a payment of £10,000 on an <i>ex gratia</i> basis in respect of the 14 children on condition that &ldquo;no further claims would be made against the State or any public authority in respect of the damage suffered by these children&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>All the parents who have alleged they have a child who suffered a disability as a result of whooping cough vaccine are extremely unhappy at the manner in which they have been treated by successive Governments in the past eight years. It is clear as a result of the representations they made in the early part of the 1970s that the Department of Health changed their procedures.  The report produced during the lifetime of the previous Government only became available because of adverse publicity.  The parents whose children had been adjudged unaffected by the whooping cough vaccine have been denied access to the reports prepared by the expert medical group and, despite their looking for them, no information has been made available to them stating the basis on which the expert medical group have reached their conclusions. A number of parents believe the matter has not been decided properly and that the serious disabilities of their children result from the administration of the whooping cough vaccine.</P>
    <P>I do not accept what the Minister has said that these reports are confidential, that they might contain information that <Col N="1854" /> would distress the parents and that they should not be made available to them.  At all times the parents co-operated with the Department, despite the unduly long time it took the expert medical group to reach their conclusions.  They made themselves and their children available whenever requested to do so.  It seems to me there is no valid reason for not allowing the reports to be produced and the information available to the expert medical groups to be made available to the parents.  Because this information has been refused to them, this is giving rise to suspicion and is creating a worry on their part that the matter has not been dealt with properly.  It is also creating a suspicion that there has been some kind of cover-up.  I am not suggesting there has been a cover-up.  Members of this House must accept that the doctors who formed the expert medical group are eminent and respected members of the medical profession.  I am sure they have dealt with the matter in as best a way as they could and I am sure they believe they made the right decisions.  The problem is that the parents do not believe they made the right decisions and the fact that the parents are denied access to basic information is fuelling that suspicion. This information must be made available to the parents.  If matters have been dealt with properly the parents can be so reassured, but if they have not been dealt with properly the parents have the right to know about it.  It is quite wrong the parents have been denied access to information to which they consider they are entitled.</P>
    <P>We heard from the Minister in connection with the <i>ex gratia</i> payment that although 14 children have been adjudged to date as affected by the vaccine, only two sets of parents have accepted the payments.  By requiring the parents to agree that no further claims will be made against the State arising out of the damage done to the children, the parents are being asked to sign away their rights to bring court proceedings which could result in their obtaining a far greater sum of money by way of compensation for the damage done to their children. However, they can only claim this <Col N="1855" /> if they are able to establish not only that their children were affected by the vaccine, which is something the group has established, but also if they can prove negligence on the part of the State or the health board.  It is quite possible that, while it is accepted that the children have been affected by the vaccine, in the context of a court case it may not be possible for the parents to prove negligence.  It is quite understandable that the Department have made the <i>ex gratia</i> payments on a &ldquo;without prejudice&rdquo; basis and without admitting liability; but the condition that prohibits parents from proceeding to the courts if they feel they should do so is wrong.  There is no reason the Department should impose such a condition.</P>
    <P>The whooping cough vaccination programme is a Government-sponsored programme and it is recognised that it should continue in the public interest.  The Minister was correct in saying that it is desirable for the vast majority of children to receive the whooping cough vaccination. Indeed, the consequences of whooping cough can be as damaging for children who suffer from whooping cough as have been the consequences to this small group of children who have been administered the vaccine.  If we have a public health programme that encourages vaccination, we have, in the interest of the community, a duty towards those who suffer damage.  It must be accepted that prior to 1974 the State did not have the efficient types of controls now exercised to ascertain if children suffer any contra-indications that could indicate to medical personnel that brain damage might result from the administration of the vaccine.  There is no doubt that if the controls now existing had operated some of the 14 children who have been adjudged to have been affected might not have been vaccinated.  Even though we exercise these controls now it is unrealistic to presume that in future no child will suffer damage as the result of the vaccine.  Since June last year 36 additional cases have been referred to the independent medical group and this indicates this is not a once-off type of problem. It will be with us for a period.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1856" /> One of the reasons I asked the Minister if he is aware of the ages of these children in the 36 new cases that have arisen is to ascertain if any of those cases have arisen since the controls were introduced in 1974.  I believe the State has a duty to deal with this matter in quite a different way from the manner in which it has been dealt with to date.  I believe legislation should be introduced to establish a formal statutory procedure whereby parents can have adjudged if their children have suffered damage as a result of the administration of whooping cough vaccine and should provide for making an <i>ex gratia</i> payment if such is established.  The point should be made &mdash; the Minister adverted to it &mdash; that nobody can compensate these children or their parents for the damage they have suffered.  All of the parents I have met sincerely believe their children have been affected by the vaccine.  I have no doubt, in the context of all the children that have been examined by the medical group, although their parents sincerely believe they have all been affected by the vaccine, that some have not been and that their disabilities arise from other reasons.</P>
    <P>Those parents do not want essentially to get compensation.  The majority are anxious to find out if it was the administration of the vaccine that caused the severe disabilities their children suffer from.  I believe they have a right to ascertain that.  I believe we should establish formal statutory procedures to allow such adjudications to be made.  I also believe there should be a proper appeals tribunal. The Minister is wrong in stating, as he did earlier today, that we have applied the most sophisticated way for dealing with these problems.  That is simply not the case.  If one looks across the water, in England they have established a statutory procedure to tackle this area. Initially, decisions are made by personnel in the equivalent of our Department of Health but, if in England a decision is reached that a child has not been damaged as a result of the vaccination programme there is an expert medical appeals tribunal to which the parents can appeal.  The Department of Health in England make available to the parents all <Col N="1857" /> the information on which the original decision was made by that Department. This procedure does not simply apply to England only.  It applies to the entire United Kingdom including Northern Ireland, which means at present that children whom it is alleged have suffered brain damage as a result of this vaccine in Northern Ireland are afforded greater rights than children who live in the Republic.  When there is an appeal in England they are given access to all relevant information for the purpose of the appeal.</P>
    <P>In the context of other European countries as long ago as 1972 Denmark introduced statutory provisions to deal with this area.  As I said earlier today, France, Germany, England and a number of other countries have statutory procedures. Some of the statutory procedures are not specific in that they do not only deal with whooping cough vaccine.  Some of them deal with claims in relation to damage suffered by public health vaccination or medication programmes.  The one in Denmark, which goes back to 1972, is specifically concerned with whooping cough vaccine.</P>
    <P>It is important that the parents who believe wrong decisions have been made are given the opportunity to have an independent tribunal re-examine their cases on the basis of all the original information that was available to the expert medical group.  I urge the Minister to establish such a tribunal.  This is not to cast aspersions on the integrity of the expert medical group.  It would be an acknowledgement that people with the best will in the world occasionally get things wrong.  While it has been suggested to the parents that the expert medical group could act as an appellant body from their own decisions that is completely unrealistic.  It is like asking the District Court to hear appeals against District Court decisions.  It is not a way of ensuring satisfaction that this matter is being properly dealt with.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of <i>ex gratia</i> payments the Minister suggested that the existing English restrictions are the same as the restrictions in Ireland.  That is not the case because the acceptance by a <Col N="1858" /> parent in England of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment does not prevent the parent bringing proceedings. The English legislation of 1979 expressly provides that the receipt of an <i>ex gratia</i> payment &ldquo;does not prejudice the right of any person to institute or carry on proceedings in respect of disablement suffered as a result of vaccination&rdquo;. It merely provides that in any civil proceedings the court shall treat a compensation payment, if it is ordered, as paid on account of any damages which the court awards in respect of such disablement. If parents in England go to court, prove negligence and are awarded £30,000 or £40,000 by way of a sum against the State, and those parents have already received, on behalf of their child, an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £10,000, that is taken into account in relation to the total payment to be made.</P>
    <P>I believe the failure to tackle this problem in an open, non-secretive way and the failure to make information available is now having a dramatic effect on the three-in-one vaccination programme. The Minister may have a comment to make on this.  Many parents, who do not fully understand the nature of this problem and who do not realise the risk of brain damage is confined to a very small group of children, are now refusing to allow children, who are not at risk of being affected by the vaccine, to be vaccinated. I am informed, as a result of this, that there has been a considerable increase in the number of children suffering from whooping cough in recent years.  The Minister might be able to clarify the position in relation to that.  Consequently, the failure to tackle this problem is not only causing a grave injustice to the children who have been damaged by the vaccine but it is also placing many children at risk of suffering from whooping cough who would not be at risk if they were vaccinated.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister to reconsider the advice he is being given by his Department officials on the basis of the very real concerns and worries I have expressed, which have been articulated to me by many of the parents who have found themselves in this position.  Unfortunately, the only conclusion one can reach <Col N="1859" /> in relation to this issue is that it is being dealt with on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis by successive Ministers in successive Governments without any clear policy or without fully appreciating or understanding the position in which many of these parents find themselves.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will seriously take the comments I am making.  I know he is genuinely concerned about social issues. I hope on this issue he will not adhere to the civil service brief given to his colleague, in the seventies, Brendan Corish when he was a Minister, Deputy Haughey when he was a Minister, Deputy Eileen Desmond when she was a Minister, and Deputy Michael Woods when he was a Minister.  I hope he will show some flair and innovation and deal with this in a humane and understanding way to ensure that the problems are properly dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House that an entirely independent expert medical group on whooping cough vaccination was established in 1977 to examine persons who, it was claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available to them and to indicate whether, in their opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination.</P>
      <P>The group consisted of Professor Brendan O'Donnell, the Dublin Medical Officer of Health, who is a professor of preventive medicine in the Royal College of Surgeons, Ireland, Professor Edward Tempany, Paediatrician, Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, and Dr. Sean Murphy, neurologist, Jervis Street and St. Laurence's Hospital.</P>
      <P>A total of 54 persons were examined by the group between 1977 and 1982.  Of the 54 persons examined, the group concluded that 40 of these were not damaged by the vaccination and that there was a reasonable probability that the disability of the other 14 could be attributed to whooping cough vaccination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the findings of the expert group were made known in July, 1982, the debate has related to four main issues. <Col N="1860" /> First, the special financial arrangements to be entered into for the 14 persons considered by the group to be damaged by the vaccine; second, the provision of the individual reports of the group to the parents of the 40 persons considered not to be vaccine-damaged; third, the establishment of an appeals system for the 40 persons, and fourth, permanent arrangements for dealing with vaccine-damage.</P>
    <P>Before dealing in detail with these issues and the various matters which have been raised relating to them, it is necessary that the House should be aware of the procedures which the three members of the medical group adopted and the difficulties which they encountered in attempting to reach conclusions in individual cases.  This background information is necessary to ensure that the question of vaccine-damage is put into a proper context and that consideration by the members is unemotive and objective.</P>
    <P>The work of the group was of a retrospective nature and in some cases it was inquiring into incidents alleged to have taken place up to 30 years prior to the examination of the person by the group. Despite the lengthy periods of time involved, the group set out to develop as comprehensive a picture as possible of each person who applied for examination, so as to enable it to draw conclusions. The procedure it adopted consisted of discussion with parents to establish a detailed history followed by an examination of the person.  In addition to a clinical examination, each person had relevant X-rays and tests.  In certain cases, the group made inquiries from family doctors, paediatricians and others who had a knowledge of the case and examined medical records relating to the case.</P>
    <P>At the outset, the group recognised that it would not be possible to prove conclusively in any case whether the person had been damaged by the vaccine. The reason for this is the fact that reactions which parents described to the group and which were recorded in such records as were available were reactions which, on the one hand, are generally recognised as occurring occasionally following whooping cough vaccination, <Col N="1861" /> while on the other hand, they are not uncommon occurrences in children who have never been vaccinated.  Examples of such reactions are persistent screaming, collapse, infantile spasms and convulsions. In view of this, the group came to its conclusions on the balance of probabilities in each individual case.  Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the group gave the benefit of that doubt to the applicant.</P>
    <P>The members of the group have come in for severe criticism since the findings were made known and having regard to the facts of the matter this criticism is unjustified.  It is fair to say that the expert medical group has looked objectively and sympathetically at each case and came to its conclusions having taken account of all the facts available to it.</P>
    <P>In September, 1982, the Government decided that an <i>ex gratia</i> payment of £10,000 should be made in respect of each of the 14 persons on the clear condition that the sum would be used, as considered appropriate by the parents, for the benefit of their child, and that no claim would be made on the child's behalf in respect of the whooping cough vaccination. The offer by the Government did not involve the acceptance of any liability on the part of the State or any public authority in respect of the child's disability.</P>
    <P>Two questions have arisen.  One is whether the offer should be increased, and the second is whether the conditions attaching to it should be dropped.  With regard to an increase in the offer, one must first of all consider whether it is appropriate that a special financial arrangement should be entered into in the case of whooping cough vaccination which is basically a protection given to a person against disease.  Whooping cough is a distressing disease which can have severe complications such as convulsions, pneumonia, neurological illness and even death.  In addition, there is no conclusive evidence that the vaccine caused the disability in any case.</P>
    <P>There is a wide range of medical and social services available to cater for the special needs of disabled persons which would be available to the 14 persons, as <Col N="1862" /> appropriate.  When the findings of the group were made known in July 1982, my Department asked each health board to ensure that the persons resident in their areas who were involved in the work of the group would be treated sympathetically and would benefit fully from all services available.  In adopting this approach, my Department was conscious that the special needs of persons considered by the group not to be vaccine-damaged were no less than the persons considered to be vaccine-damaged and was careful not to distinguish between disabled persons on the basis of the possible cause of their disabilities.  At this stage I see no reason for the provision of additional financial benefits of an excessive nature to the 14 persons considered to be vaccine-damaged.</P>
    <P>Similarly when considering whether the conditions attaching to the offer are justifiable or not, one must refer back to the retrospective nature of the group's work, the inconclusive findings and the fact that whooping cough vaccination is voluntarily received by the individual for his protection.  While I accept that there is a broad benefit to the community if a majority of persons are vaccinated, the protection received by the individual against the disease is the primary motivation for vaccination.  In the light of these considerations, it is reasonable for the State to protect itself and the appropriate public authorities by not accepting liability for a person's disabilities and by seeking a waiver of claims in respect of a person's whooping cough vaccination. There has been a falling off in vaccination in recent times.</P>
    <P>Many of the documents contained in the reports are of a sensitive and confidential nature and were furnished to the group purely for the purposes of its investigation. My Department have been advised that confidentiality would be breached if the documents were to be released.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate parents who wished to know how the group had arrived at their conclusions in respect of their child, my predecessor arranged for the chairman of the group to discuss the reports with such parents.  A number of <Col N="1863" /> parents met the chairman who went through the reports with them and outlined in detail the considerations which the group had made in forming their opinions in respect of their children.  Naturally, the parents were not satisfied with the chairman's explanations and requested that their children's cases be reviewed.</P>
    <P>Once again to facilitate the parents, my predecessor agreed to a review of the cases, provided new and relevant evidence was produced which had not been considered previously.  The stipulation that new and relevant evidence should be produced was not unreasonable as, in a situation where opinions are formed on the balance of probabilities, a review of the information originally submitted would be futile.</P>
    <P>Some of the parents responded to this request and the evidence submitted was examined by the group.  In no case did the group feel that the evidence was sufficient either to warrant a review of the case or to modify its original opinion that the vaccine was not the cause of the person's disability.</P>
    <P>I cannot accept the proposed appeals system suggested by Deputy Shatter because the suggestion derives from the fact that an appeals system exists in the United Kingdom as part of the vaccine-damage payments scheme.  In the UK, the appeals system is designed to appeal against the original decision taken by the Departmental Medical Officers on the basis of data submitted.  There is no examination of the person on whose behalf the claim is submitted at the departmental stage.  The Irish expert <Col N="1864" /> medical group actually examined each person as well as the data to support the claim that he was vaccine-damaged.  It is fair to say, therefore, that the expert medical group's consideration of a person's claim, being based on an examination of the person and his records, would be comprehensive enough to determine whether or not the person was vaccine-damaged.</P>
    <P>A great effort was made to resolve the situation.  I do not accept that there should be permanent arrangements made in relation to this matter.  The scheme in the UK is not a compensation one.  It was made clear during the debates on the Vaccine-Damage Payments Bill going through the House of Commons in 1978 that it was a scheme of lump sums payments. It is the only scheme in the EEC which provides for the payment of a specified lump sum.</P>
    <P>We are not unsympathetic to the persons involved but the issue must be considered having regard to the fact that vaccination is a proven preventive measure and that it is accepted that the benefits outweigh the risks that may be involved.  As a result of the vaccination of infants, which I hope will continue, a wide range of infectious diseases have been brought under control and infant morbidity and mortality have been greatly reduced.  It is of continuing importance that parents have their children vaccinated to afford them protection against infectious diseases.  I regret I cannot continue the matter further.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.30 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 24 May 1983.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed occupational injury benefit on 1 February 1983 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an accident at work on 28 January 1983.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of investigations arising from such accidents, claimants are first considered for disability benefit on an interim basis.  The person concerned, however, failed to satisfy the qualifying contribution condition for disability benefit which required him to have at least 26 contributions in the governing contribution year to 5 April 1982.</P>
      <P>Following confirmation by the employers of the occupational accident, injury benefit was awarded from the date of the accident.  All injury benefit to the date of the latest medical certificate received has been paid less a deduction in respect of supplementary welfare allowance advanced by the North-Eastern Health Board which has been refunded to the board.  In the absence of an underlying title to disability benefit he was not qualified for pay-related benefit.</P>

      <P>The person concerned, whose husband died in March 1972, claimed a widow's contributory pension in September 1975 but this was refused as he did not have the necessary average number of insurance contributions to qualify her for such pension.</P>
      <P>In April 1978 she made a further claim stating that her late husband had been a voluntary contributor to the social welfare scheme.  There was no record in the Department of any such contributions having been paid by him and her claim was again refused.  She appealed against this decision but her appeal was disallowed by an appeals officer.</P>
      <P>In May 1980 she claimed on the basis of her own insurance record but this was also refused as all her contributions were prior to 1936 before the widow's pension scheme was introduced and were not reckonable for the average contribution condition.</P>
      <P>Following representations received on the widow's behalf the question of payment of voluntary contributions by her late husband was re-opened and is currently under investigation by a local social welfare officer whose report is expected shortly.  On receipt of the report her case will be re-considered and she will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been awarded a widow's non-contributory pension with effect from 31 December 1982 at the rate of £37.15 per week. This is the maximum rate of pension payable to her as a widow over 66 years of age with no qualified children and it <Col N="1824" /> includes a living alone allowance of £2.70 per week.</P>
      <P>In view of this award she has been requested to return the old age pension book for £12.45 per week which she holds at present.  As soon as she does so a widow's pension book will be issued to the designated post office and the arrears of pension accrued from 31 December 1982 up to the date from which the new pension is payable will be paid to her by payable order.  Appropriate deductions will be made in respect of the amount of her own old age pension paid during the period in question and the six weeks' payment of her late husband's old age pension of £12.45 per week which was made to her after his death.</P>
