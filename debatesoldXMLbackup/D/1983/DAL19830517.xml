      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a number of questions down to the Taoiseach today which have been ruled out of order.  However, it is our understanding that they are in order.  We have checked Standing Orders and we have found that the function of the Ceann Comhairle is to &ldquo;examine every question in order to ensure that its purpose is to elicit information upon or to elucidate matters of facts or of policy&rdquo;. We consider our questions come within that ruling.  Deputies have received individual letters but they do not state the reason for ruling the questions out of order or why the questions do not comply with Standing Orders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, the Chair adjudicates on many questions each day: some day there could be dozens and other days there are less than that number.  Regarding the questions mentioned by the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, an adjudication was made on each individual question and a communication was given to each Deputy concerned, stating in writing the reasons on which each question was ruled out of order. Apart from not being in accordance with the rules, it would be quite chaotic and impossible to start having an adjudication <Col N="1234" /> on each question here, even if it were in order.  I am quite prepared to meet in my office Deputy Ahern, with or without the other Deputies concerned, and to explain the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am one of the other Deputies concerned in this matter. Standing Order No. 31 states that &ldquo;questions addressed to a member of the Government must relate to public affairs connected with his Department...&rdquo;.  On 20 March the Taoiseach stated he would want to know why interest rates would not come down.  In view of that statement, will the Ceann Comhairle endeavour to ensure that questions relating to this matter cannot be transferred to another Minister who has no responsibility in this connection?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is another question.  I have replied to the query raised by Deputy Ahern and, of course, I will reply to the query raised by Deputy O'Kennedy but beyond that I will not go. That would constitute a questioning of the Chair's rulings in the House which I could not permit.  In regard to the question raised by Deputy O'Kennedy, in my short time in the Chair I have pointed out on a number of occasions &mdash; as my predecessors have done on numerous occasions during my 20 years in this House &mdash; that the Chair has no control over the transfer of questions by the Taoiseach to a Minister or by any Minister to another Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that. Obviously the Chair has a special role and interest in ensuring orderly conduct at Question Time.  If a question is put to the Taoiseach arising from a statement he made to the nation on 20 March saying he would want to know the reason interest rates would not come down &mdash; in fact, they have not &mdash; surely it is a matter of importance that the Taoiseach should not be allowed to fob that off to another Minister as Question No. 603, to a Minister who has no knowledge or responsibility for this statement?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We are getting <Col N="1235" /> into an argument and this cannot continue. I am sorry the Chair has no control over the transfer of questions by the Taoiseach to a Minister or by one Minister to another Minister.  If Deputy O'Kennedy wishes to bring that matter before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for discussion, he has machinery available to do that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Further to my reply of 19 April last to the Deputy's previous question on this subject, I wish to state that the Tánaiste and Minister for the Environment has now resigned from Kerry County Council.</P>
      <P>The position in relation to the Ministers for Labour and Justice remains unchanged.  As I have already indicated to the House, I anticipate that both Ministers will resign their membership of the local authorities concerned within the time scale of precedents set by Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach agree with me that it was highly inappropriate for the Minister for the Environment to have continued as Minister in that Department while, at the same time, he held on to his membership of a local authority?  Is it the Taoiseach's opinion that there would have been a serious conflict of interest during that period and that it was highly inappropriate for the Minister to have continued as a member of the county council?  Further, will he clarify for the House the wrong impression he sought to convey here on a previous occasion that I had continued as Minister for Local Government and as a member of Galway County Council?  That was not true.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first two questions is no.  With regard to the last point, arising from a personal statement by the Deputy in this House when in reply to a supplementary question on 4 May last I referred to the continued local authority membership of the Deputy &mdash; Deputy Molloy raised the matter of membership of local authorities by Ministers of State &mdash; I was referring to the Deputy's more recent appointment as Minister for Defence, not to his appointment as Minister for Local Government and nothing in the context suggested otherwise.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> Imports of pork and bacon amounted to 6,400 tonnes in 1982.  While broiler meat is not identified as such in the external trade statistics, the term can be equated with &ldquo;Dead poultry &mdash;fowls (including cuts)&rdquo;, imports of which amounted to 5,300 tonnes in 1982.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the estimated number of people who will be excluded from benefit under the drugs refund scheme, when the base figure is increased above £16.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be no change in regard to eligibility following the recent changes.  The number of claims received this year will depend on the number of persons whose expenditure, including that of dependants, on prescribed medicines exceeds £23 for a month's supply.  In 1982 there were about 6,000 claims per month from persons with expenditure between £16 and £23.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the hardship caused to a number of people as a result of his decision to increase the amount the patient has to pay?  Is he aware that this is not taken into account when a claim is being processed for a medical card under the GMS scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Last year 430,000 claims were received under the drugs refund scheme.  My view and the view of the health boards is that if there is any particular degree of hardship being created for any person or that person's family the health boards are prepared to review the requirements of such people so that any serious hardship does not accrue to the families concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Since this time last year the figure has gone up almost 100 per cent.  I am sure the Minister accepts that it is creating hardship.  Would he ensure that any person who has a long-term illness or is on drugs for a long period would have the £23 a month allowed in an application for a medical card the same <Col N="1240" /> as rent paid for housing is allowed?  Will the Minister ensure that it is statutory on health boards to take into account what is paid in the drugs refund scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be extremely difficult for the health boards because the claims vary.  I assure the Deputy that if I receive any individual complaints about particular cases of hardship I will contact the health boards concerned and ask them to deal with the claims as expeditiously as possible.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this scheme should be index-linked in order to be fairer to the people concerned in view of the steep increases that have occured over the last two years?  Would the Minister agree that an index-linked scheme would be a fairer system?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Currently, £8 million a year is being spent on it.  For example, in the Deputy's constituency six out of every ten people have free drugs and 62 per cent of the population have medical cards.  In relation to the other 38 per cent of the population in the Deputy's constituency this scheme applies.  I have not had any detailed information about grave hardship being imposed on individual families.  Very few cases have been brought to my attention but in those cases the health boards have bent over backwards to give assistance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the situation arising where people have to wait for the refund from the health boards would the Minister consider introducing a system whereby the chemist's customer could pay the amount less the refund and the chemist would then apply for the refund rather than the patient?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am currently examining the claims by chemists to the health boards because very often those claims do not indicate on what drug the refund is being claimed.  As the Deputy knows, these claims are refunded to the chemist on the basis of retail price and this is of some concern.  I accept the Deputy's view <Col N="1241" /> that there is a delay of about five or six weeks in the case of some health boards in refunding.  That delay is too long.  It should not be more than three or four weeks.</P>

      <P>The annual report of the Medico Social Research Board is widely circulated to personnel in the health and research fields and copies are also sent to Deputies and Senators.</P>
      <P>The concluding chapter of the 1981 report contains brief references to a wide range of medico-social problems and should be considered in the context of the overall report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The report should be circulated to concerned persons in the health field and to all public representatives. I think the Deputy will agree that in many respects the report is quite technical and largely deals with research data undertaken by the Medico-Social Research Board and might not be of great interest to recreation clubs, voluntary bodies and so on.  The voluntary bodies in the health field, public representatives or any professional person involved in the health area can readily obtain the report free of charge.  It is expensive to produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if, in view of the additional expense to the Exchequer which it involves and in view of the serious inconvenience to patients, he will change the practice whereby all general medical service patients leaving any hospital with a prescription must consult their own doctor to have the prescription copied out on a special form before they can have their prescription dispensed by a pharmacist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The practice whereby a GMS patient brings a hospital prescription to his GMS doctor before obtaining medicines arose from the need for controls.  From a medical point of view it is not recommended that different doctors should be prescribing for the same patient at the same time.  The practice ensures that the general practitioner is familiar with the patient's total drug regimen.  There is also the question of control over the prescribing by hospital and family doctors.  Nevertheless, I feel that this is a subject which should be discussed by the working party now looking at the GMS and I am asking them to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am replying to this question instead of my colleague the Minister for Education to whom it was originally directed because day care support from public funds towards the financing of pre-school day care facilities usually comes from health resources.</P>
      <P>Grants to assist the development and operation of such centres may be paid by health boards who have the discretion to decide what particular centres to assist and the extent of the assistance.  In general the policy is to support those day care centres which are aimed mainly at assisting families from deprived areas. My predecessor in the previous Coalition Government, Deputy Eileen Desmond, made an additional £400,000 available for this purpose.  This enabled health boards to increase the number of centres which they could assist financially.  The effectiveness of this measure is reflected in the fact that by the end of 1982 the number of day care centres assisted by health boards had increased from 89 in 1980 to 180 and the number of children catered for in those centres increased from over 2,600 to almost 5,000.  The objective for 1983 is that health boards will be endeavouring to maintain their involvement at the 1982 level.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister remember that prior to the 1982 election the Coalition Government promised £1 million for day care centres?  Do they now intend to honour that commitment?  They had it as a firm promise in subsequent election campaigns.  Are the Minister and his Coalition Government prepared to put that £1 million now into the pre-school centres as they promised at that time?</P>

      <P>Discussions have taken place recently with the Pre-School Play Group Association and, generally speaking, satisfaction has been expressed about the provisions.  I would stress that in 1981 £400,000 was provided, in 1982 <Col N="1244" /> the amount was £800,000 and in 1983 I am maintaining support at that level; despite cutbacks and so on we are maintaining the overall funding.  I only wish we had more money to spend in that area, but that is the situation.  As far as election promises are concerned, we are all now reminded of the realities of the situation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is predominantly channelled through the health boards who make substantial grants up to 65 per cent of running costs &mdash; and even more in some very deprived cases &mdash; towards the running costs of the centres.  The grants usually include an amount towards the provision of accommodation, but it is overwhelmingly through the health boards with some subvention directly to the association on a sponsorship basis. Parents' subscriptions and fund-raising activities account for additional moneys. It is far more than £800,000.</P>

      <P>The new health centre in Dundalk is one of a number of new units ready for commissioning but was awaiting the provision of capital and revenue funds.  As the health board has indicated that actual net additional revenue costs of operating the new centre at Dundalk will be insignificant, I have recently approved the capital funds necessary to complete the furnishing and equipping of the centre.  The new centre should, therefore, be ready for occupation later this year.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the purchase of drugs by hospitals, my Department have recently concluded an agreement with the drugs industry governing the supply of drugs to the health services.  This agreement provides for substantial discounts off the trade price on orders of drugs for hospitals in excess of £100.  Health boards have been instructed to review purchasing arrangements to take maximum advantage of these discounts.  They have been asked specifically to consider combining orders from different hospitals, where appropriate. There are considerable difficulties in applying similar arrangements to hospital equipment in view of the wide diversity of products required.  In general, health boards are expected to ensure that equipment is supplied on the most favourable terms, in particular through competitive tendering, where appropriate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister mentioned that different hospitals are to co-operate in purchasing.  My suggestion was in regard to different health boards.  Up to now they have not used their combined purchasing power to any extent at all in either drugs or equipment.  Would the Minister agree with that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1247" />
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly we are bringing great pressure to bear on the health boards.  So far I have met five of the eight health boards and in particular I have stressed to the programme managers of the health boards the necessity to ensure combined purchasing.  A number of the health boards, particularly where they are running their own hospitals, have succeeded in a substantial measure.  Only yesterday I was with the North Western Health Board in Sligo and there the combined purchasing by the health board for a number of hospitals in the area is achieving significant savings. However, I agree with the Deputy that there is no centralised arrangement at the moment with regard to hospital equipment, and that can and should be provided. As I indicated, at the moment I am visiting all the health boards.  I will meet the Eastern Health Board next Friday and in Galway the following week I will be meeting the CEOs and the programme managers.  I shall be going through their programme with a view to ensuring that we get value for money.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that hospital costs spiral annually?  In other areas of manufactured equipment over the last number of years prices have been pegged and in some cases reduced. As a member of a visiting committee to a hospital, I have noticed this trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is difficulty in relation to expensive capital equipment because very often this is bought on a once-off basis, especially, for example, kitchen equipment and so on in new hospitals. I have stressed to the health boards that they must have competitive tendering and that will in many respects secure the lowest cost.  I share the Deputy's concern and a study is being carried out at present, involving three hospitals, on the purchasing and storage of items for hospitals. One of the recommendations likely to arise from that study is that there will be far greater centralisation of purchasing arrangements by hospitals and <Col N="1248" /> health boards to get the greatest possible discount from suppliers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">

      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board have sought a meeting with Comhairle na nOspidéal, which have the statutory function of regulating the number and type of consultant medical appointments in hospitals, to discuss the appointment of an obstetrician-gynaecologist to the County Hospital, Dundalk.</P>
      <P>The health board has also recently sought funding from my Department for this post.  A letter has issued to the board drawing attention to the new procedures to be followed in respect of applications by health agencies for sanctioning of posts falling within the ambit of the Comhairle.  The new procedures, which were set out in a letter of 8 March 1983, from my Department to health agencies, involve the completion by the health agency concerned of a form indicating the total costs to which the post will give rise and the extent to which these costs can be met by redeployment of existing resources.  When this information is received my Department will indicate the funding possibilities to the health agency and the Department's response should be included in any application to Comhairle na nOspidéal.  These new procedures have been arranged to meet difficulties posed by the current financial situation.</P>
      <P>The North-Eastern Health Board have also been informed that pending agreement on the funding of the Dundalk post and the approval of Comhairle na nOspidéal no steps should be taken to fill the post.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a unique situation in Dundalk County Hospital?  The county physician is expected to act as obstetrician-gynaecologist in 1983.  He is not qualified to carry out such procedures as caesarian sections, and he is obliged to call on the county surgeon to carry out those procedures for him.  The county surgeon who <Col N="1253" /> did that down through the years resigned and the new county surgeon does not carry out these procedures.  The county physician is in an impossible position, and so are the patients.  I am sure the Minister is aware that at Dundalk County Hospital there were 700 deliveries&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>There are 14 maternity beds in Dundalk County Hospital and obstetrics services are provided by the physician at the hospital as the Deputy indicated.  In 1981 the number of births was 500.  I have not got the figure readily available for 1982.  I will accept the Deputy's figure of 700 and have it checked.  An advertisement for a <i>locum</i> obstetrician-gynaecologist in the Dundalk hospital appeared in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 13 April last.  The CEO decided to advertise the post without waiting for Comhairle approval, and without having the Department's agreement on funding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We had no option but to inform the CEO that the filling of the post should not be proceeded with until Comhairle approval is obtained and until funding is agreed with the Department in accordance with the new procedures.  I am not indicating that we will not reach agreement, but I am adamant that the new procedures will have to be adhered to.  It is not just a question of appointing a consultant. It is a question of costing the additional back-up staff and all the other <Col N="1254" /> arrangements on a revenue basis.  When that is available we will make a decision.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="1256" /> An application to the Comhairle by the North-Eastern Health Board for approval to a second post of obstetrician-gynaecologist at Monaghan County Hospital was refused in March 1981 on the grounds that the workload in obstetrics and gynaecology at Monaghan would not justify the appointment of a second consultant.  The health board have not to date submitted a further application to the Comhairle.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the Department of Health and the Comhairle have reduced the number for double cover from 1,500 to 1,000? There is an anticipated increase in the area.  We had 1,000 live births in the area, and 700 of them in that hospital.  If we had a second gynaecologist the number using the hospital would increase.  There is a projection of a 20 per cent increase to 1,230 births by the end of the century. Is this not the time to prepare?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1981 the number of births in Monaghan hospital was 621. Admittedly, a second post of obstetrician-gynaecologist was established in Cavan County Hospital in 1978. The duties of the second post in Cavan were to include a cross-cover arrangement with Monaghan County Hospital, but the cross-cover services have not proved workable for some reason.  I accept that the projected number of births in County Monaghan in 1990-91 is 1,231 but, as the Deputy knows, the Comhairle could justify consultancy staff to a maternity unit with two obstetrician-gynaecologists only where births ranged between 1,500 and 2,000 a year.</P>

      <P>My Department are at present revising the draft scheme of the proposed new Bill to take account of my views on the type of court proceedings which should apply to children.  In the next few weeks, I expect to circulate the revised scheme of the Bill for the urgent consideration of the other Departments concerned.  Given priority treatment by those Departments, I envisage that the scheme should be ready for submission to the Government before the end of June.  Once the approval of the Government <Col N="1258" /> has been obtained, the drafting of the Bill could take some considerable time, because of the extent of its provisions. Bearing this in mind, it is likely that I will be in a position to introduce a comprehensive new Children Bill before the end of the next session of Dáil Éireann.</P>
      <P>The major changes which I propose to include in the Bill are: the imposition on the health boards of clear-out responsibility for a wide range of child-care services; the creation of powers to regulate playgroups, creches and nursery schools; the transfer of Ministerial responsibility for children's residential centres, special schools and the supervision of school attendance; an increase in the age of criminal responsibility; improvements in the juvenile justice system with greater participation by health boards; the strengthening of the powers of intervention by health boards where children are at risk; and control of the sale of solvents.</P>

      <P>They are subject to the ordinary by-law and fire regulations but the real difficulty is the disclosure of those playgroups and nursery schools by the proprietors who established them without consultation with the health boards and local authorities and without having a fire certificate.  I share the Deputy's view that a number of these nursery schools and playgroup facilities are run on a straightforward profit-making basis.  Under the new Children Bill which I will introduce, and my colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Brien will pilot through the Dáil, we are proposing very emphatic statutory requirements for the registration of those premises and introducing penalties to ensure that they are closed immediately.  At present health inspectors and fire officers can only apply the ordinary regulations, which, unless they <Col N="1259" /> become aware of the existence of such places, cannot be applied.</P>

      <P>In February 1982 out of the overall global allocation it was proposed to give a grant of £16,000 to the Irish Pre-School Playgroups Association from the then extra allocation.  The Eastern Health Board made an additional payment to the association in March 1982 and the board, having examined the association's projected deficit for the year ending 31 March 1983, decided that the remaining £10,000 of the grant should be paid as follows: £5,844 to cover a projected deficit at 31 March 1983 and £4,156 towards defraying the association's expenses in the current year.  The information I have is that it is anticipated that the funds available to the board will be sufficient to maintain the association's services at last year's level and enable them to continue their employment of a national adviser.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 20 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The levels of subvention given by health boards to organisations that care for homeless people would appear to me to be, in general, reasonable bearing in mind the many other demands on their <Col N="1262" /> resources.  In many instances health board grants go towards topping up funding from other sources.  It would be impossible to claim that all the needs of homeless people can be met through health board grant aid to voluntary and religious organisations.  The problems of homelessness are many-faceted and can only be tackled through joint commitment, co-operation and resource input by the various statutory, voluntary and religious organisations involved.</P>
    <P>I am not aware of any instance of a health board failing to accept responsibility for providing shelter and maintenance for eligible people.  Health boards are obliged under section 54 of the Health Act, 1953, to give institutional assistance to eligible people to the extent that appears to them to be necessary or proper in each particular case.  The arrangements for meeting this obligation vary from health board to health board in so far as the type of accommodation in which shelter and maintenance is provided is concerned.</P>
    <P>If the Deputy has any particular instance in mind where he feels that a health board might have made better provision I would be glad if he would let me have some information about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The series of questions down on this matter arise from a written reply I received in February which, to my knowledge, was inaccurate in many respects.  Would the Minister not agree that the subvention to the Simon Community in the Dublin area has fallen from 25 per cent of their expenditure in 1970 to slightly less than 3 per cent in 1982 and for the Cork area from 32 per cent of their expenditure in 1977 to 13 per cent in 1982?  This seems to indicate inadequate funding by the health boards of voluntary agencies.</P>

      <P>I am leading up to a question.  In 1982 there were ten men living rough in the Carlow area for whom the health board did not accept responsibility, and up to recently there were four men in that area living rough for whom the health board did not accept responsibility.  The only care they received was from a voluntary religious organisation which provided them with food.  What does the Minister intend doing about that situation?</P>

      <P>I accept that the situation in Carlow is unsatisfactory and I have asked the health board to make more positive arrangements.  The extent of voluntary commitment in the Carlow town area is limited unfortunately and the health board, together with local Christian voluntary organisations, are endeavouring to make arrangements, but the Sisters have considerable difficulty in making suitable arrangements.  In the south-eastern region there are 117 places for homeless persons, not as many as we would wish, and Carlow is about the only black spot in the country.</P>

      <P>This Bill is, in effect, bringing in regulations to deal with the implementation of the EEC Second Directive on Company Law.  This concerns the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance and alteration of their capital.  I was dealing with the question of the EEC's concern with the total harmonisation of all areas of company law and was a little critical of the Minister that he was not moving a little faster in having some of the directives and the legislation to implement them brought before the House.</P>
      <P>There are now eight directives and we are only still at the implementation of the Second Directive.  The Minister gave an undertaking to the House that he would be bringing in legislation in the immediate future to deal with some matters of a domestic nature which are causing considerable public disquiet at present in so far as company law is concerned.</P>
      <P>This legislation deals with the new style or title of public limited company or PLC, a description which will be borne in the names of all companies of a public nature henceforth.  The Minister in his Second Stage speech made some very important references to the Fourth Directive which would be the subject of legislation here before the end of the year.  It is to be hoped, on behalf of the business community and all concerned, that the Minister will be able to live up to his commitment of bringing forward this enabling legislation before the end of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While many are concerned about this legislation, they feel, however, that it is merely a part of the overall strategy to deal comprehensively with the reform of our company law.  The number of public <Col N="1391" /> liability companies is quite small &mdash; 340 is the figure.  This legislation will have very little real significance for the vast number of companies operating here at present.  Legislation dealing with private limited companies, numbering 69,000, would be of much greater significance. At the same time, it is important to get this legislation on the Statute Books to deal with public limited companies and their capital.</P>
    <P>Of particular interest and, as the Minister is well aware, anxiously awaited is the legislation to implement the Fourth EEC Directive.  This has been referred to by the Minister on Second Stage.  This must be regarded as the major directive of the eight existing directives already passed by the EEC.  It will involve us in a complete change of direction which will be expected to be incorporated into our company law to comply with our obligations. I would ask the Minister, seeing that we had the unfortunate experience of being brought before the European Court on one previous occasion because of our tardiness in dealing with the EEC Second Directive with regard to which we had to discharge costs of a substantial nature, to ensure that we do not end up in the same predicament as far as the other six EEC directives are concerned.</P>
    <P>The Fourth Directive deals with formative company accounts, their presentation and publication and it also embraces both public and private limited companies. The major disquiet here is with the private limited companies.  It is absolutely essential that the Minister press on and meet his deadline of the end of this year.  That directive will have a considerable impact on existing procedures in so far as company law is concerned. While the Minister should be urged to bring about early implementation, he must also be cautious and bear in mind the considerable impact that certain aspects of that directive will have on Irish traditional procedure and on the enticement here of foreign investment.  Of the many options before the Minister, in consideration of that directive I ask the Minister to take the one best suited to Irish company needs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1392" /> While improvements are necessary in dealing with a number of limited liability companies, which are in excess of 65,000, it must always be borne in mind that the private limited company here forms the basis of development for commercial enterprises since the foundation of the State.  A number of measures will be necessary to provide the proper guarantees and safeguards for the various interests concerned.  It will also be remembered that Irish company law has served our community well and provided a sound basis for the attraction of foreign investment, and, indeed, for national and local investment, as well, over the years.</P>
    <P>We hear a considerable amount of disquiet expressed about the disadvantages attaching to some of the provisions at present operating in relation to limited liability but there are also many good points which should be fully appreciated and considered when any new arrangements are being contemplated by the Minister.  With this in mind it is absolutely essential that we avoid any further appearances at the European Court in so far as our tardiness in the implementation of these directives is concerned.  In so far as company law is concerned these directives have formed the major part of legislation within the EEC.  Therefore we must explore every avenue open to us. Despite the fact that the Minister says he is short-staffed in that area he must at least get us to the stage of dealing with the fourth directive before the end of this year.  He will have the full support of this side of the House in doing so.  That is not to say he will have as easy a passage for it as the Companies (Amendment) Bill, 1982.  The fourth directive has many options open to it and is a major departure from traditional Irish procedures so far as company law is concerned.</P>
    <P>Because this Bill, which by and large is non-contentious and, as the Minister himself said, not negotiatable at this time, I would be anticipating giving it an easy passage on the question of the second directive.  The basic objective of this Bill is the protection of the interests of both shareholders and creditors in relation to the formation of public limited liability companies and the maintenance, <Col N="1393" /> increase or reduction of their capital.  The proper implementation of these procedures will have considerable benefits also for the employees of those companies. The most important parts of the Bill are Parts II, III and IV.  Part V deals with the change of status of limited and unlimited companies.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that there is no alteration in the effect of section 33 of the Principal Act, the Companies Act, 1963, which deals with the position and definition of private companies.  The dominance of the private company in the economy and the part it has played in the improvement of the economy generally becomes apparent from the figures outlined, indicating some 69,000 private limited companies on the register last year as against 340 public companies registered with the Companies Registration Office for the same year.  As I understand it, we are dealing primarily with the 340 companies in the latter category.</P>
    <P>The measures outlined in this Bill deal only with public companies limited by shares and public companies limited by guarantee and having a share capital. Part II deals with the name and registration procedures for the new public limited companies.  The old identification of &ldquo;company limited&rdquo; is to be replaced by &ldquo;PLC&rdquo;&ldquo;public limited company&rdquo;.  As I understand it, private limited companies will be able to continue to use &ldquo;and company limited&rdquo;.  Here I should like to refer to section 19, which deals with the specified or authorised minimum capital of £30,000.  On the face of it, that would appear small considering the extent of operations of some of the public limited companies.  This is a matter the Minister might consider during Committee Stage. I note that there is an amendment down in that regard in the names of Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa recommending a substitution of £50,000.  My attitude was that, on the face of it, £30,000 looked comparatively small in the circumstances and that perhaps it might have been based on the 1970 figure when this was first initiated.  But it is not worth making an issue of it.  I note that in subsection (2) the Minister may by order specify what is to be the authorised minimum.  Should <Col N="1394" /> the Minister feel at any other time that he wishes to increase that amount he has the legal vehicle available to him to do so.  Therefore it is not a matter I shall pursue except to say that it is interesting to note that, when the directive itself was promoted by the EEC the figure they had in mind was something in the region of £16,000.  The Minister has gone even beyond the dictate of the directive in bringing this to a realistic figure.  In the interests of not holding up the Bill I was prepared to accept the Minister's position in the knowledge that it is safeguarded anyway in section 19.</P>
    <P>There will be considerable activity with the re-registering of existing public companies, and the fact that many of them do not have the authorised minimum capital of £30,000; I think 30 per cent of them do not accommodate themselves in that way.  In respect of those companies who will not be able to meet the requirements within the stated period of grace the Minister, if he has any discretion at all in the matter, should be as flexible as possible. I understand it is 15 months for one section and then three years subsequently in which to deal with the matter.  In respect of companies who experience difficulty in accommodating themselves, companies who wish to maintain their status, I hope the Minister will make every effort to have them re-registered in some other form and that his office will be available to advise companies who experience difficulty in this regard.  It may be that many public companies will be anxious to re-register as private companies.  There should be careful scrutiny of private companies who wish to register as public companies, as also those of the other kind who wish to go in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>Part III relates to the share capital of public limited companies, a most important Part.  These requirements extend to payment for share capital, the maintenance of share capital, the rights of existing shareholders on the occasion of the issue of further shares in the company and the variation and registration of class rights attached to the shares.  The directors of a company may not &mdash; and properly so &mdash; allot shares unless authorised to do so by the articles of association <Col N="1395" /> of a company at a general meeting.  That authority must state the maximum amount of shares to be allocated and the duration of the authority given.  This constitutes a further control of the issue of shares which has been requested for some time by people involved in the operations of companies and is to be welcomed. There is also the pre-emption of rights and this provision applies to public and private companies alike.  Shares must be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to the nominal value of shares held by them already.  This is an additional safeguard that must be welcomed.</P>
    <P>The shares of a public limited company must be paid up to at least 25 per cent of their nominal value before they are allotted. Under the Companies Act, 1963 that figure stands at 5 per cent only.  Therefore this movement to 25 per cent is considerable and I support the Minister in it. Although there might be an amendment advanced to alter that by another 5 per cent I do not think it is necessary in the interests of the extended amount of share capital which, under section 19, the Minister has power to adjust anyway subsequently should he see fit.  They can be taken in conjunction with each other and afford the Minister the necessary control should a defect be found subsequently. This section of the Bill will also encourage the participation of employees in the capital of companies.  As I understand it, the 25 per cent limit need not apply to shares issued in connection with the employees' share scheme but the Minister might clarify that matter when replying.</P>
    <P>These are not new provisions as we understand the operation of company law here.  They focus more attention on a section of the 1963 Act which did not receive as much attention in the past in encouraging employees to hold shares in their companies.  In that regard it constitutes one of the biggest innovations in so far as the affairs of companies over the years are concerned, in that quite often employees did not understand the structure, financial gearing or attendant fiscal difficulties attached to their companies. Balance sheets are often devised or <Col N="1396" /> couched in language not readily understandable by the general work force.  For that reason it is important that employees be encouraged within the terms of that section and that the Minister give as much leeway as possible in respect of the application of the 25 per cent so that this would not have to be applied as rigidly in the case of employee share schemes as in the case of other shares.</P>
    <P>The Minister should endeavour also to bring about a situation in which employees would be made aware of the scheme.  Very often legislation is enacted here with the best intentions and with a ministerial statement which may not be reflected in the public media but which, as in this case, would be of great assistance to employees in helping them to understand what is being done thereby leaving them with a better knowledge of the gearing of their company.  Employees might then be in a position to purchase shares in their company and to understand the difficulties attendant on that.  That sort of situation might lead to better industrial relations between management and the work force.  Never has there been a better time than now to enact this legislation.  It might be worthwhile for the Department to publish a booklet explaining the changes that are being made by way of this Bill.  However, I appreciate that the Department are busy in the area of directives but there is a lack of understanding between management and the work force and it is this situation that has caused much of the difficulty in industrial relations.</P>
    <P>Too many companies have failed in the recent past.  It must be conceded that one of the principle reasons for these failures was that company directors and managers did not take appropriate action when difficulties were first recognised.  I am particularly happy about section 40 of the Bill which demands that an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders must be held when serious loss of subscribed capital is recognised.  This will help to relieve a situation that has existed for some time in company practice.  It is now duly recognised that, if appropriate action had been taken earlier for the <Col N="1397" /> proper restructuring of the finances of some companies, they might have survived the recession and saved a considerable number of jobs.  Instead of putting down an amendment for Committee Stage I should prefer to dwell a little now on section 40.  I do not know whether the Minister is tied absolutely in respect of the number of days allowed.  If I thought he was so tied, I would consider the matter to be appropriate to warrant the tabling of an amendment.  This relates to the period allowed to directors once it has come to their knowledge that their company have a financial difficulty.  They are allowed 28 days after the recognition of the difficulty.  As I understand the Bill, a company finding themselves in difficulty would come together and then decide to take 28 days before calling a general meeting or 56 days from the date of considering whether measures should be taken to deal with the situation.  A time lag of almost three months in such circumstances would seem to be an inordinate amount of time in dealing with an immediate problem.  If, in replying, the Minister tells us that he is confined to this decision by reason of the directive and that he cannot possibly adjust it, I would accept his explanation and would not put down an amendment.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the distribution of profits.  So far as the company executive is concerned the making of profits is every bit as important as are the work force.  Section 45 provides that the distribution be made only from profits available for that purpose.  In the past there has been difficulty as to the interpretation of the word &ldquo;available&rdquo; in this context.  While some effort is made in section 45 to define the word within the new circumstances, there is a difficulty which is causing much concern outside the House.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify that, too, when he is replying.</P>
    <P>As I read it, there can be no distribution until accumulated losses have been made good.  This is an accepted procedure so far as all the accounting bodies are concerned.  I understand that they have given a welcome to that aspect of the Bill on the grounds that it should lead to an improved situation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1398" /> There is one point in regard to that section that I should like to bring to the Minister's attention.  If a director makes an unlawful distribution of profits, there is no stated liability that would attach to him.  There seems to be no penalty outlined either in section 45 or in the section dealing with penalties to deal with such a situation.  It is in such circumstances that the word &ldquo;availability&rdquo; would seem to be somewhat ambiguous.  However, if I am reading the section incorrectly in that regard, I should be grateful for clarification from the Minister.</P>
    <P>Part V of the Bill deals with the matter of companies changing from limited to unlimited status.  This becomes necessary because many companies will be changing their status either way.  The 1963 Act allows an unlimited company to re-register as a limited company but there was no regulation to deal with the opposite situation.  This was one of the failures of the Principal Act.  Section 52 of this Bill sets out to remedy that situation by reason of the requirement of the assent of all members of a company in the event of a change from limited to unlimited status.  This is important because the limited liability status means that the members are responsible for the debts of the company to the full extent of their personal assets.  This would enhance the position of creditors and employees but I am sure the Minister would agree that not many companies are likely to change from limited to unlimited status.  This is a new procedure in Irish law and it is to be welcomed.  The danger is, though, when an unlimited company re-register as a limited company and then go into liquidation to the detriment of the creditors and employees.  It is in that area of activity that I am asking the Minister to move as quickly as possible in dealing with the new domestic measures he has in mind, measures that must necessarily be backed up with the Fourth Directive. Failure to implement that directive would leave any domestic legislation without proper structuring internationally.</P>
    <P>Part IV of the Bill deals with the provisions for penalties.  The maximum penalty for an indictable offence is £500.  That is the maximum monetary penalty that <Col N="1399" /> can be imposed by a court in a summary jurisdiction.  This level of penalty would not seem to reflect in any way the importance that might be attached in present-day circumstances to offences in the area in question.  I take it that these indictable offences can be tried summarily but I should like the Minister to clarify whether he is at liberty to increase the penalty maximum or whether he will be bound by the judicial system which debars him from doing so.  A £500 maximum in this area would seem ludicrous. I understand that an amendment has been tabled in this matter.  I would gladly support that.</P>
    <P>I understand that the maximum penalty allowed is £500 and I am quite sure the Minister would wish this amount to be greater if it were possible.  This is a matter for another Bill but it is a reform which is long overdue.  The Minister should be enabled to increase the penalties substantially.  If another Bill were to provide for increased penalties, would the Minister be able to increase this penalty by regulation or would it require amending legislation?  I would hope that it would be possible to allow the Minister some flexibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister will agree that the tendency in Irish judicial practice has always been to go for the monetary penalty as against the jail sentence.  It would appear that even people who are trading fraudulently have no fear of monetary penalties.  I would be much happier if the jail sentence were six months and the monetary penalty a minimum of £2,000. <Col N="1400" /> This would be more appropriate in today's terms.</P>
      <P>There has been an amount of comment about certain malpractices in the operation of companies and matters concerned with tax evasion.  Some commentaries have said that tighter penalties should be imposed as well as jail sentences in support of bringing about these improvements. If our laws were framed in such a way as to incorporate these new arrangements and the other directives, we would not have to rely on monetary penalties or jail sentences, although there will always be someone who will seek to carry on a fraudulent practice.  It is our responsibility as legislators to tighten arrangements so that this is not possible.</P>
      <P>It is recognised that there are many loopholes in existing legislation and the current implementation of directives will go a long way to removing the difficulties attached to the proper control of companies. It must be remembered that, while legislation is for the protection of all the various parties involved, it must also take into account the need to protect what must be regarded as a widely based economic environment served by a large number of private companies who, by and large, have been carrying out their business in a competent and professional manner.  It is as well to put the Minister on notice that quite a number of private limited companies are not a little scared as to what might happen under the new arrangements.  The Minister may retort that they have nothing to fear if they are carrying on their business in a proper fashion.  The vast majority of companies have been carrying out their functions properly in as diligent a way as possible and they do not wish in any way to defraud their employees, their shareholders or the Revenue Commissioners. However, reform of company law is necessary to take account of changing circumstances. This can be done in a rational way without unduly upsetting the traditional means of dealing with companies and the attraction of foreign investment to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  If the Minister can satisfy me on the points I have made concerning penalties, share capital and <Col N="1401" /> the distribution of profits I will be happy to allow the Bill to pass unaltered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Stage of the Bill.  The legislation is long overdue and we all agree that it goes only a small part of the way.  I do not intend to take up too much of the time of the House, the Minister or the parliamentary draftsmen. The urgency of this matter has been reiterated.  We must get the Bill through as quickly as possible and deal with the amending legislation that is still to come, particularly that related to the Fourth Directive.  All of us are frustrated to the extent that we know that the legislation before us covers only a very small amount of the ground that needs to be covered.</P>
      <P>Because of the way our economy has developed we have 340 public companies which will be dealt with by this legislation but an astonishing 69,000 private companies which still have to be covered by amending legislation.  It is within the private limited companies that most abuses would seem to lie.  When one considers how quickly the focus of our economy is changing, as well as other economies which have been considered in the EEC directives, it is astonishing that, apart from small amendments twice in 20 years, we still rely on the Companies Act, 1963. The changes have been immense since 1963 when we were at the dawn of an industrial revolution.  We would hope that we are now about to strengthen our industrial base.  This legislation becomes even more urgent when we consider the new technology which will be introduced during the eighties and nineties and the control that will be necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's statement that he hopes to have legislation on the Fourth Directive introduced before the end of the year.  I also welcome the constructive approach on the other side of the House towards working positively to get the best legislation possible designed to cover all the different components, complexities and sensitivities of company law.  We must ensure that there is justice for everybody involved in industry, particularly the employees and creditors who have not received the same attention as shareholders.  By doing this we walk a <Col N="1402" /> tightrope because while we must tackle injustices we must also do everything possible to support initiative and enterprise in an effort to bring about full employment.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech anticipated many of our remarks on the Bill.  An alarming amount of freedom appears to be given to private companies.  Abuses can be such as to bring the whole image of industry and company law into disrepute. Because of the abuses that can occur under present company law, the real victims are the employees and we have seen a sorry history of this since the recession hit us.  Quite rightly it has been mentioned on many occasions that a company can be shielded by being a private limited company.  A search of the Companies Office will not disclose the real shareholders &mdash; the name of a law clerk or a typist can be used to shield the promoters of a company.  We know that companies can liquidate themselves, with the further abuse of not having paid their PRSI and PAYE contributions, and can set up in future and continue with the same kind of exploitation and injustice towards their employees.  All Members of this House know of the hardship and distress caused to employees when this happens.  We must make sure that this practice is not allowed to continue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the provision that £30,000 share capital will be needed for public limited companies.  However, the Minister must be aware that huge empires have been set up under a risk capital of £2.  In today's context that has a lunatic tinge. With that shaky risk capital empires have tumbled like dominoes and the victims have been the workers and the creditors left to pick up the pieces.  In many instances the creditors have gone out of business also.</P>
    <P>Traditionally there has been a focus on the rights of shareholders, on enterpreneurship and on private property and not sufficient rights were written in for employees and creditors.  We must achieve more by legislating for employees. In future there should be all kinds of positive initiatives and even positive discrimination in legislation to encourage and allow employees to have a share in <Col N="1403" /> the industry in which they work.  We must not forget that it is the industry and skill of the workers that produces the profit. Only by acknowledging the productivity of the workers and giving them their rightful share can we give a human value to the skills of our people.  They must be given a participatory role that will allow them to see if their enterprise is succeeding.</P>
    <P>In many instances when industries close down the first intimation the workers have that something is wrong is when they are peremptorily told on the day they are dismissed &mdash; sometimes with no redundancy.  Frequently the first indication of trouble is found in the share market, not in information given to the workers themselves.  We cannot talk about a just society, about justice for workers, about the value of human skills and the work ethic about which we hear so much, if we do not acknowledge completely the right of the worker to share and own part of the enterprise in which he works.  I hope that will be the major thrust of future legislation.</P>
    <P>There is a provision which allows the Minister to increase the minimum share capital of a public limited company to £30,000.  I take the point made by Deputy Flynn regarding certain companies who started below that share capital and who suggested that flexibility be given to them.  He made the point that companies should not be driven to the wall because of an inflexible date in legislation.  However, in present-day circumstances one could hardly buy a moderately sized house for £30,000.  We must ask ourselves if £30,000 should be the minimum amount on which we should allow companies to base themselves.  We must not forget that the careers and skills of others are dependent on such companies.  I am worried about this point.  I am glad to see that section 19 enables the Minister to increase the minimum capital by order. What £15,000 or £30,000 could buy in the mid-1970s bears no relevance to what that amount would buy today.  When setting amounts we must remember our soaring prices.</P>
    <P>I will continue to make the point that <Col N="1404" /> future legislation should not acknowledge overmuch the position of shareholders to the detriment of the other groups concerned.  At the same time, we must remember some of the takeovers by large and powerful multinationals.  It is important that we safeguard the interests of existing shareholders against a change of control of a company that is almost outside their control.  We must look at our legislation from a national point of view. Large groups or multinationals can make an offer that existing shareholders may feel they cannot refuse, but this may be detrimental to the national interest and it may damage our economy.  I accept that there may be difficulties with regard to drafting legislation but we will have to do something about this matter.  Selfcentred, selfish and competitive multinationals can take over smaller less competitive industries that do not stand a chance of competing with them.  We do not know the extent of it, but anything we know is very frightening.</P>
    <P>One of the reasons I welcomed our membership of the EEC was that the EEC would be able to guarantee the rights of national companies against the power and control of multinationals.  I know the Minister shares with me the hope that the EEC Commission will start to take on the multinationals at some stage, because I do not believe they have been taken on.  Their net stretches to areas we do not even know anything about, but they affect the daily lives of many of our people.  Those multinationals are based totally on competitive profit-making and exclude the human, just and productive aspect.  A group as large as the EEC should at least inform us about how far the tentacles of multinationals stretch.</P>
    <P>One of the innovations of the directive, as the Minister said, is that the shares of a public limited company must be paid up to at least 25 per cent of their nominal value and that the whole of any premium on them paid before they are allotted. This is a way of obtaining a secure base. I am glad the Minister in his discretion is taking advantage of the options offered by the Directive whereby the payment on allotment of at least 25 per cent of the <Col N="1405" /> nominal shares need not apply to shares issued in connection with the employee share schemes.  This goes back to the point I made about the right of workers to share in the profitability, productivity and shareholding of a company.  I hope we will go further in future directives. We have witnessed the terrible results of some of the crashes of what we regarded as very safe industries.  There is a feeling that if there was an alarm system that could have gone off in time and warned not alone the directors but the workers and the creditors, we might not have had such costly breakdowns.</P>
    <P>I welcome section 40 of the Bill because not alone does it oblige the convening of an extraordinary general meeting, which must alert everybody concerned, but it places responsibility on the directors and the shareholders to see that companies and industries are not set up for their profitability alone but that there is responsibility right down the line and when one takes on the employment of people there is a huge responsibility to carry this out in as responsible a way as possible.  Section 40 certainly gives an opportunity for the directors of a company, under obligation, to convene this extraordinary general meeting and alert everybody.</P>
    <P>A lot of constructive things can happen there.  There will not be the tendency to throw good money after bad.  Some people might feel that when they have lost such a lot that a last gamble might pay off and there could be a tendency to throw good money after bad.  That can have alarming consequences.  This will alert everybody that the company are in a dangerous situation but still, hopefully, in a rescue situation.  I hope our legislation and the enlightenment of management will actually have us informing the workers in the company so that their participation can be called on in relation to saving the company and treating everybody with the dignity they deserve.  This means that if there is a problem in a company it not alone affects the shareholders, the managers and the directors but affects in a much more dangerous way the very workers who would find <Col N="1406" /> themselves out of work and perhaps without redundancy money.</P>
    <P>I hope section 40 has that kind of constructive approach, that it is not seen as being destructive but a warning system which will mobilise all the efforts and all the rescue structures we have to make sure that the industry concerned does not go to the wall.</P>
    <P>I support what Deputy Flynn said about penalties, because with changing prices a penalty not exceeding £500 will raise all kinds of questions.  However, I bow to the information given to us by the Minister in relation to that.  Is the present Bill sufficient to cover this or is amending legislation needed?  We have all seen Bills being introduced here and a lot of lip service paid to them.  But unless the provisions of the Bill are followed up and enforced, we not alone waste our time in the House but we bring all legislation, ourselves and our role as legislators into total disrepute.  I hope that when this legislation is brought in the structures will be set up to enable us to make sure that it is monitored and enforced.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to elaborate on this.  Will a number of inspectors be needed?  I do not mean a group of inspectors going around whipping people into shape and making sure they hit them over the head with penalties.  If they break the law penalties should be imposed, but there is something more important.  I ask that the legislation not just be introduced but that everybody concerned is fully informed of it and that through the media and information leaflets we make sure that people who will benefit from this legislation will be aware that it is there. If more skilled people are needed to go around in an advisory and constructive capacity, I hope that will be taken into consideration.  We should ask ourselves what are the structures we need to enable the legislation to become reality, recognised in the spirit and not disregarded or flouted.</P>
    <P>I speak with great enthusiasm about this Bill and I look forward with even greater enthusiasm to the further legislation when we can actually get down to addressing ourselves to the whole area of the private limited company, which <Col N="1407" /> places creditors and particularly employees more at risk than anywhere else.  We must ensure justice to all who work in this country and that their skills &mdash; sometimes their life's work for 30 or 40 years &mdash; are not wiped out without perhaps even redundancy payment and without the reward that is fundamental to the satisfaction of working.</P>
    <P>Deputies are aware that this legislation came through the Seanad.  In my address in the Seanad at that time I referred not to a certain part of the amending legislation of this Bill as such but to what I hoped would be a wider amendment.  On page 70 and 71 of the Bill &mdash; this has been done in a traditional sense but I am glad that some of our traditions have changed in this House &mdash; are examples of shareholders and their names and professions. On page 70 is a list of the names of seven men who are solicitors, engineers, a geologist and an accountant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The few words I will say on this Bill will be related mainly to the types of amendment I would like to see incorporated into it.  The Bill, as has been stated a number of times, is in order to comply with the Second Directive on Company Law which was passed by the EEC some years ago.  I understand that this Bill is two or two-and-a-half years late in being brought before the House; but I welcome it, limited and late as it is. However, as the Bill stands its implementation will have little or no impact even in the limited areas which could have been affected by the legislation.  For example, few if any existing Irish public companies would have an authorised capital of less than £30,000 or a paid up share capital of less than £7,500.  Thousands of private companies have these types of shareholdings and these are causing most of the problems at present in relation to company formation, re-formation, liquidations and so forth.  No doubt the Minister will be bringing in legislation later in the year relating to private companies, and I look forward to that.</P>
      <P>Unfortunately, the present Bill will do nothing to improve the situation as it stands in relation to these private companies. Private companies are currently forbidden to offer their shares for sale to the public and if they do that they lose certain privileges such as the freedom from any obligation to publish accounts. Section 21 of the new Bill seeks to introduce additional penalties, presumably because the Fourth Directive of the EEC would eventually oblige most companies to publish some form of accounts.  The maximum fine in the Bill as proposed is only £500 and this would hardly be a major deterrent to any substantial private company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also imposes an obligation on company directors to call an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in the event of what is called a serious loss of capital.  This is dealt with under section 40.  According to the Explanatory Memorandum this will apply to all companies and is considered as a valuable advance <Col N="1409" /> because it will enable shareholders and company managers to take early and appropriate action to cope with financial difficulties.  I make two points in relation to that.  First, serious losses are defined as occurring when a company's net assets fall to half or less of the called open share capital which in turn is defined as 25 per cent of the authorised capital which in its turn must be at least £30,000.  In effect the serious situation exists when net assets are less than 12.5 per cent of the authorised capital &mdash; in other words, a minimum of £3,750.  That would seem to be an extraordinarily low figure and we propose on Committee Stage to increase that figure.  These figures are very low, being related to the minimum share capital, which figure is itself very low, and it is debatable if the provision will be valuable if the figures are left as they are.</P>
    <P>The second point in relation to section 40 is that it calls for the shareholders to be informed of the serious difficulties but does not propose to involve the employees of the company or their representatives in any way when the company reaches such a low level.  We would propose also to have that section amended in order to enable employees and their representatives to be brought in to any consultations that would take place. Probably more important is the fact that section 40 should be amended to include an obligation on company directors to inform workers and their representatives and not leave it simply to their good offices and good will to do so.</P>
    <P>I conclude by welcoming the Bill, limited as it is, and I hope that the Minister can see his way to adopting the amendments we will propose on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I welcome the intention of the Bill in its stated aims of correcting the abuses on the present industrial scene and the Minister's commitment that he will spare no effort in trying to put an end to the activities of fly-by-night operators in various sectors who make a mockery of the privilege of limited liability.  This is long overdue and will be significant legislation put through by this Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1410" /> I would like the Minister's assurance that he will also introduce legislation to give effect, following on this, to the EEC Fourth Directive because the two are interlocked.  This directive obliges companies to disclose information to their employees on all aspects of their transactions, policy, profits, and so on.  This is crucial at present, as highlighted by the recent tragic collapse of Ranks, Telectron and other companies.</P>
    <P>The certain collapse of Ferenka was known almost a year in advance by economists who had access to the company's balance sheet but who could not disclose this fact for fear of undermining confidence in the company in the belief that they could get out of their trading difficulties. It is a disgrace that a group of shareholders thousands of miles away who do not even know where Ireland is can decide to close down an enterprise here to which workers have given a lifetime, even generations in the case of some families, and whose standard of living is geared to these companies.  In my own city we had the awful spectacle of the closure of Ranks, without any proper consultation, in a meaningful sense, between the company and their workers.</P>
    <P>I understand that the multinational companies operating here have strenously opposed the application of the EEC Vredeling Directive on information.  If multinationals wish to operate here, they cannot have it both ways.  When in Rome they must do as the Romans do.  We are a member state of the EEC and the Vredeling Directive obliges companies who have subsidiaries here with over 100 employees to disclose information on all aspects of their activities.  I never fail to be amazed at the innocence of the speakers from the Opposition side.  I listened to Deputy Flynn urging the Minister to introduce this legislation and I am advised that two members of that party opposed the introduction of that directive here.  The then Deputy de Valera sought to have an amendment to the directive which would oblige companies here to employ 2,000 before they would have to disclose this information to their workers.  Deputy Seán Flanagan is <Col N="1411" /> alleged to have said that if that directive was introduced here it would drive all the foreign companies out.  It is surprising that Opposition Deputies do not get political pneumonia from the crocodile tears that fall on their shirts in this House when they express concern for the workers.  Now that they have moved into opposition they seem to have the answer to everything and the solution to nothing.</P>

      <P>I am very slow to interrupt any Deputy but I wish to remind him that when I temporarily strayed from what would be regarded as the major content of the legislation he was very quick to interrupt to ask what relevance it had. Deputy Prendergast should confine his remarks to the Second Directive.  When the time comes for the implementation of the Fourth Directive, I will speak on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  He need not worry about that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>As a matter of course I do not interrupt anyone, as I am well versed in procedure.  I am merely making the point that the public should be told the facts.  When Irish workers were being afforded the protection of the appropriate EEC Directive, it was opposed at the instigation of a very powerful lobby here.  More drink was passed from that lobby in Brussels that night than had ever been seen there.  I am not saying that the two Deputies I mentioned did that, but their cohorts were there and there were witnesses to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are 65,000 companies in this country but only 339 of them disclose their accounts to workers.  In turn, workers are expected to listen to companies when they say they cannot meet wage claims.  I have been involved in situations where the company were aghast at the enormity of the claims made by workers until I asked them to disclose their balance sheet and then they all backed away.  There is an even more significant aspect to their failure to disclose information.  Over 1,000 new chemicals at least are coming on the market from Europe alone onto the industrial scene every year and these are potentially very <Col N="1412" /> dangerous to workers' health.  The companies refuse to disclose their names.  We all know that it can be 30 years before the effect of working with asbestos manifests itself.  There is a need for reform in the area of the statute of limitations with regard to compensation for industrial diseases. The companies here are only obliged to pay compensation if a claim is made within three years of the contraction of the disease whereas in the UK it is within three years of the discovery of the disease.  A worker in a well-known company in the south contracted cancer through his involvement with one of the basic raw materials.  He made a claim which was passed on to the parent company in the UK who paid up promptly.  If they had but realised it, under our law they need not have paid that money.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister, as a logical corollary to what we are talking about, to implement the EEC Fourth Directive.  In the monthly newspaper of my union, <i>Liberty,</i> an article in the April edition states that the private sector here is one of the most pampered in the world.  It has received every conceivable support from the State at a cost of thousands of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  Yet the return to the State and to the workers who pay these taxes is minimal.  It says that arguably we have one of the most pro-business environments in the world, including the US, where State intervention goes nowhere near the Irish level.  It also says we are renowned as a tax haven and even trade unionists have been muted in criticism of the endless growth of incentives in our anxiety for jobs.</P>
    <P>I welcome unreservedly foreign enterprises with their skill and know-how and the benefits they confer on this country in the area of industrial relations, because we were primitive before that.  However, it should be pointed out that the State is the real risk taker.  In the decade up to 1983 the IDA poured £1,132 million of taxpayers' money into mainly private companies and industrial employment has remained static.  A recent table in <i>Irish Business Magazine</i> of October 1982, showed that State aid to the private sector totalled £2,555.7 million up to 1982.  This was aid to industry and agriculture, and <Col N="1413" /> included State expenditure on construction. When you take into account the grants to tourism, fisheries and An Foras Forabrtha, you realise the contribution Irish workers have made.</P>
    <P>The Telesis Report estimated that £2,800 million was given in aid to the manufacturing industry in the ten years to 1980, excluding the current cost of supplying the aid.  No fewer than 26 State companies are devoted almost wholetime to promoting private sector interests from the IDA and CTT to Fóir Teoranta and Bord Fáilte.  These are never called white elephants.  The State builds the factories, trains the workers and management, pays for the machines, researches the products and export markets, gives cheap loans and numerous tax allowances and exemptions, and huge hidden subsidies through tax avoidance lending, rescue operations to companies in trouble, and gives large State contracts for the products.  In short, the State does everything except take control and profit, although it does pick up the loss.</P>
    <P>The State is the entrepreneur, the risk taker, while private enterprise takes the profit.  In these circumstances, it should be pointed out that the large amounts of State aid to industry include £60 million from Fóir Teoranta over the past ten years, of which only one-third has been repaid.  There are numerous examples of the softly softly approach by the State to the millions of pounds of tax still outstanding.</P>
    <P>With all this aid, have we got value for money?  What proportion of it is now owned and controlled by the State which puts up so much of the capital?  Has there been increased disclosure of financial information to the workers?  Do the companies even warn workers of their approach?  We suggest, no.  In view of all this generosity by the State and the workers to foreign companies, and native companies no less than foreign companies, there is an obligation, in morality if not in law, on these companies to tell their workers what they are doing and to give them adequate warning of what is happening in their industries.</P>
    <P>I welcome the intent of this Bill.  I <Col N="1414" /> commend the Minister.  In the past he has made notable contributions to the welfare of workers.  I thank him for and congratulate him on his intention to promote this legislation.  I welcome the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is symptomatic of the situation in which we find ourselves that the Minister has had to tell us this measure is not negotiable at this stage.  He said most of the provisions in this Bill are not negotiable.  It can be seen from that that we have sold a large measure of our sovereignty. One wonders why the Bill is put before us.  Are we just here to debate it? Are we in a position to achieve any substantial worth-while change?  Apparently not.  We are told: &ldquo;The Bill is before the House.  Pass it, because an authority in Brussels or Strasbourg says it has to be done and it is not negotiable.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>It is not that we are not in very urgent need of reform of important aspects of our company law.  We certainly are, and that was touched on by all the previous speakers and by the Minister.  The key point is that the matters on which reforms are so urgently needed are not in this Bill.  They are talked about for some future Bill at some future time.  The Minister pointed out that the resources of his Department are limited, and that is perfectly understandable.  Is it not regrettable that those limited resources have had to be taken up in the preparation, with great usage of time and man-hours, of a Bill for which there is no pressing need in the present circumstances of Irish company law, and when so many other measures are crying out for the attention of the skilled staff in the Minister's Department? I find that highly regrettable.</P>
      <P>The main thrust of the Bill, far from bringing in anything which will help creditors or workers, is to change the designation of public companies into a new format with the object of bringing us into conformity with the EEC.  They have a great will there to bring about uniformity in all sorts of matters.  The trouble is that the requirements in each of the member states are quite different.  What suits uniformity in highly industrialised countries like France, Germany and Holland may be inappropriate to our purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1415" /> As I have said, the main thrust is to have a new format of company to be known as a public liability company.  That change in designation will not bring about any radical alteration for anybody.  Perhaps it will generate a highly increased volume of work in the Companies Office and for practitioners who deal with companies.</P>
    <P>The Bill goes on to deal with a minimum provision for allotted capital of a company at £30,000.  Some of the contributions in the debate so far seem to indicate that Deputies thought that was too low.  The Minister suggested that in some case it could cause difficulty for certain of the existing companies and that perhaps as many as 30 per cent could have problems as a result of this new provision.</P>
    <P>It is unfortunate that old companies which have been trading for many years, and new ones yet to be formed, have been set to be covered by the same criterion, the same test of £30,000.  This is a major shortcoming and has given rise to unease both as to the highness and the lowness of the figure.  It may be fair to say that new companies to be formed and put into operation should have a minimum allotted capital of £30,000. That is one thing, and it may be fair enough.  I am not sure it is also reasonable to impose that figure, after the event, and after so many years, on many existing companies who have been trading and providing employment.  It would be highly regrettable, to say the least, if, as a result of this imposition, old companies which have been trading and providing employment, should have to close their doors at the behest of the EEC.</P>
    <P>I know the companies have three years in which to make their arrangements.  I also know there is a provision in the Bill for them to re-register as another form of company.  I do not think re-registration has very much realism or practicality. The likelihood of any company in that situation being able to re-register in another form of company is doubtful in the extreme.  The three-year period of grace will be a help, no doubt, but there will be a fair number of companies at the end of the three-year period, who got by <Col N="1416" /> over very many years perhaps with difficulty, and perhaps hand to mouth, but nevertheless continued to trade and provide employment possibly in a small way on borrowed capital, with a good year following a bad year, and so on, who will be forced to close as a result of this measure. Left to our own devices, we would not have brought in such a measure which is brought in for the sake of uniformity at the pressure of an EEC Directive.  If that was to happen and those companies, many of them long standing, had to close down, albeit in three years' time, it would be most unfortunate and highly regrettable.</P>
    <P>The Bill has a provision which tries to provide an early warning system, the procedure of calling an extraordinary general meeting where it would appear to the directors that the capital had fallen below a certain level.  Deputy Flynn spoke with approval of that measure as did some other Members and, no doubt, as far as it goes it is all right but, frankly, it leaves a lot to be desired.  I regard it as an inadequate remedy for trying to cope with the type of situation it purports to deal with.  If one looks at that part of the Bill one will see that the only obligation on the directors is to call the extraordinary general meeting.  When they call the meeting and tell the shareholders about the difficulties and problems they have met their obligations under the Bill. There is no obligation on them to do anything to rectify the situation.  Once the meeting has been called and the announcement has been made that is sufficient. They can carry on trading and may run up further debts, cause problems with other companies or for their work force but they will not be breaking the law because they will have complied with the one requirement in the Bill, the calling of the meeting.</P>
    <P>If the Bill wanted to tackle the situation which requires urgent attention and which it was directed at, it should have gone on to provide that if having called the meeting nothing was done about the problem certain consequences would follow. Those consequences could include various measures such as putting a personal responsibility on the directors for <Col N="1417" /> additional debts that would have been incurred after the date of the meeting, possibly putting a liability on associated or parent companies that would have a controlling or major interest as shareholders in that company.  They could require those associated or parent companies to have a responsibility to make up further losses incurred as a result of not taking action following on the meeting. I regard the provision as being weak in the extreme.  It may be a first step but in my view it does not go any appreciable way towards dealing with the type of situation for which it was envisaged.</P>
    <P>There is another method that might have been adopted in the Bill and I suggest it now for consideration by the Minister. There is a provision in section 6 requiring a company at the point of registration to acquire a certificate from the registrar of companies to authorise it to carry on business, and to enable the company get that certificate it has to meet certain requirements and file certain documents with the registrar of companies. That detail and that certificate of authorisation to carry on business only has to be obtained once, at the beginning. In other words once the company gets under way and gets its certificate that certificate lasts indefinitely.  The certificate does not have to be renewed or reviewed at any time.  A useful measure that could be brought about by the use of such certificates would be to provide that the company must obtain that certificate not just at the beginning of its incorporation but at fixed intervals.  To enable it to obtain the certificate authorising it to continue to carry on business it should have to file in the Companies Office, in addition to the information which every company has to file annually, certain other important requirements which would be of great value to the work force of that company such as perhaps information as to proposed changes in the structure or the staffing of the company.</P>
    <P>In other words, the company would have to fill in a questionnaire for the Registrar of Companies at whatever period was thought appropriate.  The company could be asked if any changes were intended in the structure of the company <Col N="1418" /> during the coming year, what proposals the company had for changing the staffing of the company, the present financial situation, the estimates for turnover, production and sales, the working conditions in the company, if the company had complied with the requirements regarding the protection of workers' health, the employment intentions of the company in the coming year, if the company intended to bring in rationalisation measures, what social protection was provided for the workers, if the PRSI and social security contributions were paid up to date, if it was intended to bring in new technology, if there were proposals to merge the company with another or have it taken over and if the company had any plans which would in any way substantially affect workers' interests.  A questionnaire on those lines might serve a useful purpose if companies had to answer it year on year.  Could any company reasonably object to having to furnish and have on file in the Companies Office that type of information?  As Deputy Prendergast pointed out, in the past we have been all too lax in this type of situation.  An examination of the situation in other industrialised countries will show that their requirements are much more stringent than ours.</P>
    <P>I would like to have seen those measures in a Companies Bill coming before the House.  Having regard to the pressures on staff in the Minister's Department it is regrettable that all we have before us is a Bill dealing with measures which will be of little help to creditors of companies and workers.  At this time, having regard to the state of economic development of the country or regression, as appropriate, the need for such a measure is pressing because companies are going into liquidation and receivers being appointed weekly.  The time for such requirements is now.  If the economic progress of the country was on an upturn the need might not be so great but the need is urgent now.  I hope the measures promised by the Minister will be before the House within a short time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. Cluskey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to <Col N="1419" /> thank the House for the constructive and stimulating contributions on the Bill.  I would particularly like to thank Deputy Flynn for recognising the urgency with which this Bill is needed and facilitating its passage, all Stages, through this House today.</P>
      <P>There has been, understandably, some confusion and considerable overspill in relation to this Bill and other aspects of company law.  That was best illustrated by Deputy Taylor when he spoke of matters relating to company law but which are not, and cannot, be covered in this aspect of company law.  The purpose of this Bill is to give implementation to the Second Directive of the EEC.  Deputy Taylor and others may not like Ireland being a member of the EEC and may see certain objections to the operations of the EEC but the fact is that by the express wish of the Irish people, expressed in the ballot box in a referendum, we are members of the EEC and that imposes certain obligations on us and the purpose of this Bill is to give effect to one of those obligations.</P>
      <P>It is easy to stray into areas in the field of company law &mdash; we all do it &mdash; because there are instances of overlapping and one thinks one piece of legislation should be able to deal with another problem. This Bill is the commencement of a major reform of company law.  The aspects that have been referred to in this House by many Deputies, and by me, are abuse and malpractice.  There are 69,000 companies but the number of companies and people engaged in malpractice is very few.  If one looks at the situation one will see that the same people are involved over and over again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to give the House this assurance: as fast as possible I will put an end to the operations of these people, who can only be described as legalised confidence men, operating under the present law.  That law will be changed and that will bring an end to the operations in which they have been engaged.  These people have left so much misery behind but they got away scot free.  I can assure the House that these laws will be changed as speedily as possible both by the proper utilisation of <Col N="1420" /> EEC directives where discretion is given to us &mdash; to exercise that discretion and to maximise its effects in the context of conditions as they apply in Ireland &mdash; and by the introduction of domestic law which will ensure that these practices come to an end.</P>
    <P>A number of issues have been raised. Deputy Flynn said all companies should be obliged to prepare full accounts and have them audited.  This is the present requirement.  Companies are obliged to do this under the 1963 Act and, in addition, public companies are required to file copies of their accounts with the annual returns sent to the Registrar of Companies.</P>
    <P>The question of disclosure will be dealt with in the Bill to give effect to the Fourth Directive and I have already said publicly and in this House that we are working on that directive as speedily as possible.  I am confident it will be before the House for consideration before the end of the current year.  I am also hopeful that domestic legislation dealing with aspects of company law will also be before the House before the end of the current year or, if not, early next year.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn, Deputy De Rossa and Deputy Barnes raised the question of penalties and fines.  I am not satisfied with the monetary penalties that have been imposed, but it is necessary to consult with the Attorney General when imposing monetary penalties because other penalties under other legislation must be taken into account.  Because these cases are dealt with summarily in the District Court there is a limit on the monetary penalty that can be imposed.  Apart from the £500 maximum fine there is also provision for a jail sentence which may be imposed instead of the monetary penalty or both can be imposed.  I believe there is a definite deterrent there.  I take the point &mdash; and it is one which should be examined not only in relation to this Bill but under a whole range of legislation &mdash; that monetary penalties provided for as maximum penalties in a Bill can very quickly bear no relationship to what was intended as a deterrent when the Bill was going through the Oireachtas.  They can very quickly become outdated.  There <Col N="1421" /> should be a review of monetary penalties at Government level and we should try to find some mechanism to update them without introducing new legislation.  That would be a very desirable development and one I will be advocating at Government level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>We might even have to go further than that.  Deputy Flynn also recommended applying some provisions of the Bill to private as well as public companies.  In fact, the Bill does that in some respects.  Many of its provisions simply reinforce existing practice desirable for the proper conduct of companies and in the interest of the development of company law generally.  I consider it appropriate to apply some of the provisions of Parts III and IV to private companies. I have not however extended the authorised minimum capital requirement of private companies.  The Joint Committee of the Oireachtas considered this and advised against it.  It is to comply with the observations of the joint committee that that approach has been taken.</P>
      <P>Many small companies work very successfully on credit and have very little capital.  To impose a minimum capital requirement on them could well damage them and very easily end up in closing them, leading to loss of employment.  The amount of capital is not always the determining factor.  A recent report has shown that a large number of company failures are due to bad management and that this has been a major contribution in firms going to the wall.  Many small companies with very little capital operate successfully and to impose these conditions on them might not be in their best interests and certainly not in the best interests of their employees.  One would have to be very conscious of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies have mentioned that provisions under Bills and in changes of legislation having an effect on shareholders, creditors and employees are not made known to these people because there is not sufficiently coverage.  It is true.  There is a great need for a much wider publicising of legislation passing through the <Col N="1422" /> Oireachtas which has definite effects on various groups and sections within our community.  The people directly affected are not fully aware of the changes which have taken place which affect them to their detriment or benefit.  I will be having a very close look at all legislation involving my Department in this regard and Deputies were correct in mentioning it.</P>
    <P>A number of other issues were raised. Deputies Flynn, Barnes and De Rossa raised the question of the £30,000 capital. As Deputy Flynn pointed out, under the directive the requirement is approximately £16,000.  At this stage it would be wrong to go above the £30,000.  Approximately 25 per cent of companies have under £20,000 capital at present and 30 per cent under £30,000.  There is also provision in the Bill that the £30,000 may be increased by order if it is thought desirable to do so.  It is very important that we do not impose overnight an obligation on companies which may adversely affect their operations and might force them to close, with subsequent loss of business and of jobs.  The three year provision which Deputy Flynn mentioned, I can assure him and the House, will be very much used now to give companies who may not be in a position to meet quickly that requirement a three year period to do so.  It would be unwise to go higher than the £30,000 without observing its effect.  If necessary, after giving it some period of time to operate, one can use a ministerial order, if desirable, to increase the sum.  We are starting from no requirement at all and going up to £30,000, which is not a bad start.  I am not ruling out that at some future date it may be thought desirable or necessary to increase the amount.</P>
    <P>On the question of special meetings, Deputy Flynn spoke about the number of days' notice required.  The calculations may have been somewhat confused because the total number of days is 56, within which, under the provision of the Bill, action must be taken.  That is reasonable notice because under the rules of companies certain provisions must be observed.  There may be requirements to give notice of special meetings and consideration has to be taken of the position <Col N="1423" /> of the company and the presentation of its position to the special meeting.  That is not an exorbitant amount of time to grant.  It may be necessary for a company under its rules to give a considerable amount of notice before the holding of a special meeting.  If that was seen to be abused in any way, it could be looked into.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes mentioned takeovers and mergers, but these are not covered by this Bill.  There are provisions under the Mergers and Takeovers Act which give full safeguards in this regard.  These matters need not be taken into consideration in dealing with the legislation now before the House.  I think I have covered the points raised during the course of the discussion on Second Stage.  A number of amendments have been tabled and if I have missed matters which were raised, I can respond to them when dealing with the amendments.</P>
    <P>I again thank the Deputies for the constructive way in which they have approached Second Stage and also for facilitating the passage of the Bill at all Stages here today, in order to ensure that we can comply with the obligation upon us, particularly in the light of the fact that we have been already brought before the European Court for not complying with the time allowed for implementation of this directive.</P>

      <P>This section deals with definitions.  One definition, of the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo;, is not defined in this interpretation section.  It is referred to in a number of places, in particular in section 6 (7):</P>
      <P>... the company and any officer of the company who is in default shall be guilty of an offence... </P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is defined to some extent in the 1963 Act, but its definition in that Act is rather limited.  It is stated there that: an officer in relation to a body corporate includes a director or a secretary. I suggest that the Minister might consider a slightly wider definition of the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; for the purposes of this Bill and consider the following:</P>
      <P>that an officer would also include a person in accordance with whose directions the directors have been accustomed to act. </P>

The point that I am making is one of definition and as this is the definition section, I thought that this would have been the appropriate place in which to mention it, if there was going to be any amendment.  If the Chair thinks it more appropriate to do it under the other section, I am agreeable to that.</P>

      <P>To amplify very briefly, a very frequent situation arises, particularly in the case of a subsidiary company, where a board of directors will take their instructions from elsewhere, perhaps from the parent company or superior company.  They might only be nominee directors.  If an offence is to be committed by an officer, that person who is giving the orders would be the appropriate person who should be made amenable yet that person, as the section stands at present would not be an officer of that company.  The purport of what I am suggesting for the Minister's consideration would be that the definition be widened to include a person in accordance with whose directions directors have been accustomed to act.</P>

This has been discussed in the Department but because of the urgency of this legislation &mdash; as the Deputy knows, from earlier explanations we have already been before the European Court and been found in breach of our obligations &mdash; it was considered that the wider definition, somewhat wider even than the Deputy's suggestion, would be included in the No. 3 Companies Act which would be coming before the House later this year.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, subsection (4), lines 9 and 10, to delete &ldquo;sufficient evidence until the contrary is shown&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;conclusive evidence&rdquo;. </P>
      <P>These are ten identical amendments which have been requested by the Parliamentary Draftsman.  Section 5 (4) provides that a certification of incorporation given under section 18 of the Principal Act in respect of a public limited company is sufficient evidence, until the contrary is shown, of the company's status and its compliance with the requirements of the Company's Act and that it has been duly registered.</P>
      <P>In including that provision the Parliamentary Draftsman departed from the long standing position in the Principal Act, and indeed earlier company legislation, that the certificate of incorporation is conclusive evidence of the matters mentioned therein.  For example, under section 19 of the Principal Act, following expressions of concern by legal and other professional interests that the drafting of section 5(4) had the effect that the certificate of incorporation would in future be <i>prima facie</i> evidence only and would leave the very existence, status and validity of any company open to challenge, the Parliamentary Draftsman was required to reconsider this.  He concluded that it was appropriate and necessary, in the interests of certainty, to provide that a certificate of incorporation referred to in section 5 (4) should be conclusive evidence of the matters mentioned in that subsection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of this amendment, therefore, is that all who deal with a company will know that they are dealing with a legal entity whose actual existence or status can never be challenged.  The same issue arises in the case of certificates of incorporation issued under section 9 (9), section 11 (3) (b), section 14 (5), section 43 (11), section 53 (5) and paragraph 20 (b) of the First Schedule and in the case of certificates issued under section 6 (6), <Col N="1427" /> identical amendments are proposed in amendments Nos. 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 21 to 23, inclusive, and 27.</P>

    <P>There are two points I wish to make on that.  &ldquo;Evidence of doing business&rdquo; would be capable of perhaps a wide variety of interpretations, buying and selling and so on.

Would that be a way of getting around this section?  I am not sure on that point.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the point the Deputy is making but in the circumstances I consider myself justified in rejecting these amendments.  In adopting the minimum requirement of the directive &mdash; that 25 per cent of allotted shares be paid up on incorporation or before commencement of business by a public limited company &mdash; I would draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that this represents a considerable increase on the requirements of the Principal Act which provides for only 5 per cent minimum subscription.  I should explain also that the rate of 25 per cent represents the average of the national rate which applies in other EEC member states before the directive was passed.  In addition, it should be borne in mind that the Bill provides for almost a doubling of the amount required by the directive.  The figure will be £30,000.  The minimum amount to be paid up on the alloted shares is, therefore, higher than that envisaged in the directive.  In those circumstances, the present provision is adequate.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I would simply make the point here that <Col N="1432" /> there is no provision in the section for prison sentences.  The proposal to eliminate the maximum on the accumulative fine would be to the benefit of those who are simply in breach of the rules on a technical basis but the elimination of the upper limit would fall most heavily on those who break the regulations persistently. We could have proposed that the base fine be increased across the board, though perhaps that would be unfair to those who because of oversight would be in breach of the rules.  However, £500 is a negligible sum so far as most large companies are concerned and would not do anything to encourage them to observe the regulations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said on Second Stage, I understand what the Deputy is getting at.  Indeed, I have some sympathy with his approach to this matter but as I explained then, in the case of summary conviction, only a certain level of fine can be imposed in the District Court; otherwise the matter must go to the High Court.  The question of fines which become outdated in a relatively short time cannot be viewed in isolation in one Bill because it must be related to other legislation and must be considered in consultation with the Attorney General.  As I said when replying to Second Stage, this is a matter which the Government should consider so that fines can be updated and represent a true deterrent without the need to introduce legislation.  It is sometimes very difficult to get legislative time to deal with such matters.  I will bring the matter before the Government, not just in the context of this Bill but in relation to fines under other legislation which do not at present represent a deterrent because of the limitations imposed.  I understand the Deputy's point and I have given the reasons for not accepting this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister would clarify a point on the section dealing with an old company which does not re-register.  It provides that a company, if it carries on after a 15-month period, is in default and commits an offence.  It then <Col N="1433" /> goes on to refer to any officer of the company who is in default.  I am wondering how it is envisaged that an individual officer would be in default because an officer or a director cannot by himself effect a registration.  A majority of the board of directors might deliberately not take the steps or neglect to do it but there might be one director who would be more than willing to do so.  Would he be in default and liable to be prosecuted, due to a matter outside his control?  How would an individual officer be in default under that section and liable to be prosecuted?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>In case my silence on the hypothetical case put by Deputy De Rossa goes unnoticed or is taken to mean that I have given my assent, I would put down a marker that the matter of changing monetary penalties and having them updated on a month-by-month or year-by-year basis related to the CPI has inherent difficulties and dangers.  It is not to be expected that assent would be given to the promotion of such an idea without very careful consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entitled to take that view.  It is extremely important that the level of fines imposed is a genuine deterrent to people who habitually break the law.  There are people who make a very calculated judgment and consider that even if they are caught it is worth paying the fine because they are making so much money from breaches of the law. The level of fines should be a genuine deterrent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>While I accept that the maximum penalties for indictable offences are as outlined here, perhaps we should consider it from another point of view.  The jurisdictions of the various courts could be reviewed to establish the limits that should apply.  I am quite sure that the Minister would utilise the maximum available to him.  Perhaps the judicial system could be altered to gear up the maximum penalties to be imposed under their jurisdictions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the intention of this provision is to bring all the old public limited companies into line and a nominal fine is called for in order to remind them. It is not a punitive fine, and I hope the Minister is not suggesting that we should have prohibitive fines, which is what The Workers' Party are suggesting, in every aspect of business.  This would make it difficult for companies to continue in business.  This is a very ordinary section dealing with the failure of a public limited <Col N="1435" /> company to re-register.  I gather from the amendments tabled by The Workers' Party that they would have such prohibitive fines that it would be impossible to go into business at all.  I would not subscribe to large fines in this area.  I agree with the Minister that there should be serious fines in the case of habitual major breaches of the law, but not in this instance or in similar instances mentioned by Deputy De Rossa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to agree with Deputy Skelly on this point.  One might even have sympathy with a company who, having traded for many years and given good employment, find themselves having to go through a whole new procedure to re-register, which they never envisaged when they started their company, and possibly having to go out of business.  These are not appropriate circumstances for a punitive measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I made the point to the Minister that we were not seeking to have the base fine increased, that we were seeking to take away the limit of £500 in the case of a cumulative fine of £25 per day.  In other words, if a company having been found guilty of an offence and fined the maximum of £250 continues with that offence and continues to ignore the regulations we suggest that there should not be an upper limit on the fines they could accumulate if they persist in breaches of the regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made the point also that in our view the base fine was adequate for those in technical breach of the regulations, that only where companies persist in a breach of the regulations over a long period that the fine would accumulate.  I do not suggest that fines on individuals should be treated in the same way as fines on companies that are in the business of making money.  Clearly the capacity of an individual to pay will decide if a fine is punitive. Obviously a person earning £13,000 or £14,000, as we do, can pay a fine of £50 without any great dent in his pocket but a person on £25 a week &mdash; as is the case with many people &mdash; would find it very difficult to pay such a fine.  I would <Col N="1436" /> not like to see fines treated in the same way across the board but I hope that a system of fines adequate to the situation would be applied in company law.</P>

      <P>In this section shareholders of various categories are given power to apply to the court for cancellation of a resolution re-registering, and the members of the company are provided for also.  The workers of the company will also have an interest and the Minister might consider adding in a provision that no fewer than five of the employees of the company would have a right to apply for cancellation.  Subsection (6) states that the court shall make an order either cancelling or confirming the resolution but guidelines are not given to the court as to the basis on which the court would decide whether a resolution could be cancelled or confirmed.  I could visualise a judge having an application before him under the subsection and wondering the basis on which he was to decide whether it would be appropriate for him to cancel or confirm the resolution.  Perhaps there should be some provision giving guidelines to the court on considering an application under that subsection.</P>

      <P>In page 41, to delete lines 46 to 51, and in page 42, to delete lines 1 and 2, and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Subject to subsection (4), where the net assets of a company are three-quarters or less of the amount of the company's called-up share capital, the directors of the company shall, not later than 28 days from the earliest day on which that fact is known to a director of that company:</P>
      <P> (a)  notify all employees of the company and their trade unions,</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  duly convene an extraordinary general meeting of the company for a date not later than 56 days from that day for the purpose of considering whether any, and if <Col N="1442" /> so what, measures should be taken to deal with the situation.&rdquo;.    </P>
    <P>I feel that the Bill is defective in not making it obligatory on the company to inform the employees and their representatives of the condition of the company when it reaches a point when the assets are as low as indicated in the Bill.  The Bill should at least do that in relation to the efforts which workers put into a company. It must be accepted, by and large, without the work force, a company would virtually not make any money whatsoever. The very significant part which workers play in any company should be recognised by the shareholders and the management of that company.  As Deputy Barnes indicated the work force are, by and large, the last to know that a company are closing down.  In some cases they are told on the Thursday or the Friday, when they collect their wage packets, they need not come in the following Monday.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that the position outlined by Deputy De Rossa is a legitimate concern.  However, it is important when we are dealing with legislation that we deal with it in the appropriate way.  As I outlined at the beginning and have repeated a number of times during the passage of the Bill, this is not the appropriate Bill for that type of legislation. These provisions, particularly the one about the 50 per cent, were the subject matter of considerable discussion by the Joint Committee on Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. They thought it was important that it would be as in the directive, of 50 per cent, and that that would not be changed. I agree with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the question of disclosure of information to employees this is a major issue and I fully accept the concern that has been expressed.  It is particularly important that it goes into appropriate legislation and is dealt with in an appropriate manner.  The provisions under this directive are such that corrective action can be taken before a company get into too much financial difficulty and that a warning bell is sounded.  This <Col N="1443" /> has to be done in such a way that the warning bell is not in fact the doomsday bell.  If wider provisions were to be made under the provisions of this Bill you would precipitate the closure of a company which need not necessarily close. One has to take that into consideration and strike a balance between what people are legitimately entitled to know and be aware of and the dangers of extending it, particularly in a Bill which is not designed for that purpose, as would be the one under the Fourth Directive where disclosures of information would be the subject matter of that directive.  While understanding what motivated the tabling of this amendment I feel not only would it be inappropriate to this particular Bill but if it were to be included under the provisions of this Bill it could be counter-productive and, in some cases, if it were to be accepted and implemented, it could precipitate the closing of a company which otherwise may not necessarily have to close.  On that basis, I ask Deputy De Rossa to reconsider this.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully recognise the dangers which the Minister has outlined. However, I counter his argument on two points.  First of all, the point at which these consultations are required to be held is when the net assets are at such a low level that it seems to me the dogs on the street would know that the company were in trouble without necessarily having formal notice of this fact being given to the employees and the shareholders. I am sure the Minister, from his experience, is quite well aware that employees from a very early stage of a company getting into trouble know precisely that something is wrong.  They do not know necessarily what is wrong but they know something is wrong.  Rumours fly and the morale of the work force falls to a very drastic level.  This affects production and in some cases results in demands that the company make the staff redundant.  The unsettling affect of rumours also gets the work force thinking in terms of getting out of the company as much as they can.  That is not confined to <Col N="1444" /> the work force.  Shareholders are also inclined to do that.</P>
      <P>In the best interests of the company, in view of the very low figures which are incorporated in the Bill the work force should be brought in at the same time as the shareholders.  It cannot be argued that the shareholders and the management operate in a vacuum and are completely isolated from the work force.  If events are moving towards a situation where a company are in trouble the work force should know about this and they should be asked for their support in order to help the company instead of allowing the situation to deteriorate and the work force to be kept in the dark.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa's suggested solution would be akin to crying &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; at a very early stage.  Increasing the figures would not help at all.  Given that we are dealing with companies and extraordinary general meetings it would alert the officers of the company and the situation would become known outside the company.  Rumour-mongering and calling in workers and trade unions at an unnecessarily early stage could destabilise an otherwise healthy company.  For those reasons the section should not be altered.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that.  While the <Col N="1445" /> Minister is trying to envisage an early warning system whereby companies could deal with problems that could arise by way of financial collapse, at the same time one must see the wording.  It is very difficult to know who the person would be who would assess when the net assets of the company would be less than half the called up share capital.  Section 40(1) of the Bill refers to &ldquo;the directors of the company after 28 days from the earliest day on which that would come to their notice&rdquo;.  Who is to determine what the earliest day would be if the directors decide to leave it in abeyance until it suited them to convene the meeting?  The subsection also states &ldquo;the earliest day on which that fact is known to a director&rdquo;. One director could pass the buck to the other and effectively bring about a situation where they would not discharge their responsibilities against that section. I have already stated my reservations about the time scale involved.  It seems peculiar that a director, presumably after consulting with his directors about the imminent colapse of a company, would have to wait 28 days, that he would be given such latitude before it would become incumbent upon him to call a general meeting.  An extraordinarily long period of 56 further days could elapse.  Is that so or do I take the Minister as saying on Second Stage in his response that 56 days would incorporate day one, or is it an addition&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No, from day one.  The total is 56.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that absolutely clear in the wording as outlined in the section? It says &ldquo;an extraordinary general meeting of the company for a date not later than 56 days from that day&rdquo;.  From which day? Is it from the last day on which he might take the option to call the meeting?  That would be after 28 days had elapsed if he so wished.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>From the earliest day.  I want to be absolutely clear on this.  Even at 56 days I suggest that eight weeks is a <Col N="1446" /> pretty long time if it has suddenly been discovered by a director that the net assets have slipped and are half the called-up share capital.  It is not a good way of providing an alternative whereby the directors could get together speedily to provide an alternative to the closure of the company.  The thrust of that section as I understand it is to provide an option whereby directors can come together quickly and deal effectively with the company before it goes out of business.  Further to that, while written in in a number of the other sections are the monetary penalties that might or might not be applied, section 40(2) (b) states that those who do not comply with the calling of these meetings to deal with the imminent difficulties of the company shall be guilty of an offence.  There is no determination of what might be the extent of that offence or what penalties might be applied, monetary or otherwise, in regard to the offence.  It is the weakest section of the Bill.  The Minister might indicate to us a direct insertion in accordance with the directive, or is it a peculiar section of his own Department?</P>

      <P>To finalise what I have to say about the amendment, I stress that it is important that the employees of a firm be treated at least on the same level as directors who may not even be living in the State.  Such employees are at least entitled to know what is happening to the company where they earn their livelihood. I urge the Minister to reconsider his opposition to the amendment.  I recognise that there are wider implications in this area and that he will be dealing with <Col N="1448" /> them in a more substantial Bill later in the year, but this Bill should not pass through the House without the contribution which the work force makes to a company being recognised to even this small extent, that they be at least notified that a company is in trouble at the same time as the shareholders and directors are notified.</P>

      <P>As I explained, the principle which inspired the amendment is not one that I disagree with.  I believe strongly in the right of workers in a particular concern to have access to legitimate information.  I have explained that it is inappropriate to include that type of matter in this Bill.  At the outset when introducing the Bill on Second Stage I said that it was one of a series of Bills and that this one had very little of the employee aspect in its content.  The amendment which is proposed by Deputy De Rossa is not appropriate to this Bill. In the context of this Bill, I believe it could be counter-productive and could work directly against the interests of employees in a particular company.  It is easy to envisage situations where a company could find themselves in financial difficulties but, if they take the appropriate action which they are required to do under this Bill, they may not be terminal. Under section 57 there are penalties imposed of £2,500 and two years' imprisonment for not complying with this provision. If we were to comply with the Deputy's amendment, it could precipitate the closure of a firm where without this provision, it might be able to weather a temporary storm.  If we were to use the wrong vehicle to enshrine it in legislation which in principle I agree with, we could be doing a disservice not only to the legislation but to the people I accept the Deputy is trying to assist.</P>

The amendment <Col N="1449" /> seeks to raise the threshold at which notification would go out and, therefore, the company would not be in as bad a position as it might otherwise be if the Bill goes through as it stands.  I still firmly believe that a company which brings the work force into their confidence in the early stages of financial trouble have a better chance of survival.  For that reason, I wish to press the amendment.</P>

      <P>I welcome this provision. I was tempted to speak on Deputy De Rossa's amendment because he was trying to do something in which we are all interested in doing but I feel he was not going the right way about it.  The big problem is not just the relationship between the net assets of a company and the called-up share capital of a company but rather the application of this provision once it becomes law.  What possible means has the Minister to police the system to ensure that directors abide by the provisions of the law?  We are all aware of companies who find from time to time, that their debts exceed their assets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The directors of most companies are responsible people who are concerned about the work force, the future of the company, the creditors and the goodwill of the company and act properly.  However, there is no doubt that we also have companies that trade on a basis that is completely and utterly unacceptable. Although I welcome this provision, it does not go far enough because it does not provide teeth to anyone, other than creating an offence, which is too late because the damage will have been done at that stage.  Perhaps the Minister could consider an amendment to the Bill on Report Stage to deal with this problem. I should like to give an example.  A particular group of companies went into liquidation <Col N="1450" /> last October.  The liquidator of the group of companies involved, Kerrigans, reported a short while later to the creditors who consisted of small public investors and not of business people who would be conscious of the dangers involved.  The companies went into liquidation in October; in November the liquidator, Mr. John McStay, announced the appalling news to the creditors that the net assets of the company amounted to no more than £250,000 and that the liabilities of the company amounted to £1.25 million, showing an overall deficit of £1 million.  The directors and proprietors of that company were clearly trading in a situation where one would certainly at the very least ask some very pertinent questions about the propriety of their so doing.  If this law had been there in 1982 when this situation was developing in that group of companies, would this provision have stopped the carnage that was about to take place?  I regret to say that this will not do that.  What steps is the Minister taking to ensure that directors who do not abide by the laws of the land do not trade while they are insolvent?  I admire the provision as it stands but is there any way the Minister can ensure that there will be some system of policing it?</P>
    <P>There is a provision that people who trade without regard to calling the extraordinary general meeting that section 40 calls for, will be guilty of committing an offence.  When is the person likely to be prosecuted?  Is it going to be months and months after the company has collapsed? Is that of any use at all?  There may be some point in sending someone to prison who has flouted the law but that is going to be of no benefit to creditors. Can someone who has been found guilty of such an offence start in business again and run the risk of doing the same thing? There is no provision in the section to prohibit a director who has been found guilty of such an offence from starting up another company, carrying on business and putting the public at the same risk as they were in the first enterprise.  I have already mentioned the Kerrigan group of companies which are notorious because of the enormous deficiency of assets.  I wish to express my grave concern at the fact <Col N="1451" /> that the two proprietors of that company&mdash;&mdash;</P>

It is for that reason and not with any intention to cause difficulties, that I referred to the group of companies.</P>

It is at our regime, our company law and our bankruptcy law which allow situations like this to develop.  I have made my point in relation to the company.  The proprietors of a certain company which went into liquidation last October and showed a deficit of £1 million in their assets in the report of the liquidator the following <Col N="1452" /> month, have now actually started in business again at a time when the liquidator has not even determined&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It seems to me that the purpose of the section is to avoid collapses like the one to which I have referred, to protect creditors and to protect members of the work force of a company. I offer my comments on the Minister's aims and principles in that regard. In view of what I have said, and in view of the fact that there are many instances &mdash; and the one I have mentioned in particular &mdash; where somebody restarts in business before investigations are completed, would the Minister consider including in section 40 some prohibition on a person who has committed such an offence actually starting in business again?  That is one point.</P>
      <P>The second point is the one I made first.  I want to come back to it because it is a most important point.  How will the Minister police the system to ensure that directors abide by the law?  The problem does not arise with regard to your average director, or anywhere near your average director.  The problem arises with people who are unscrupulous and uncaring about the damage they may do to their work force or their creditors.  We must remember that, while a lot of business is done with big business people who understand the risks involved, and who can take precautions and advice, there are also companies that trade with people who are innocent of the wiles of some businessmen and who do not understand the pitfalls and dangers they are facing. Those people require attention and protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems to me that this section, good as it is, does not go far enough.  I urge the Minister to take steps to ensure that directors will, by some regime outside the mere obligation on them, take some steps voluntarily.  We should have some <Col N="1453" /> system within the Companies Office, or in some Department, that will actually ensure that there is some task force or emergency force which can go to a company where suspicions or doubts have been raised and bring to heel directors who are already ignoring the provisions of the law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>In my speech on the Second Stage of this Bill I referred to some of the matters raised by Deputy Molony. I also said I wished the section had gone considerably further.  In fairness to the section it must be said that very substantial penalties are provided in it for its breach.  Presumably the intention of the section is that, after the passage of the Bill, a director will know that he is committing a serious offence involving a very substantial fine and a term of imprisonment and will be constrained to take the steps required by the Bill which he was not required to take hitherto.  That may be the explanation of the case raised by Deputy Molony.  The section is an innovation in that respect and it may be a sobering thought for any directors of companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to suggest two very slight amendments to the section which I ask the Minister to consider very seriously. Even though they are slight alterations they would make an appreciable improvement to the section.  In section 40 (1) I would ask the Minister to add to the words &ldquo;the earliest day on which that fact is known&rdquo; the words &ldquo;or ought to have been known&rdquo;.  There are many directors who regard themselves as having the privilege of sitting on a board of directors and taking no interest in the company, being above it all except for the collection of the directors' fees as the cheques come in every six months or every year.  They feel they have no obligation other than to be sleeping partners, just sitting there and collecting their directors' fees.  If they are directors they have a responsibility to look into the affairs of the company.  It should not be a let-out to a director, I submit to the Minister for his earnest consideration, to say: &ldquo;I was a sleeping partner.  I did not <Col N="1454" /> bother very much with the company.  I did not know&rdquo;.  The offence should be committed if his duties as a director required that he ought to have known.  I urge the Minister to consider agreeing to the inclusion of the words &ldquo;or ought to have been known&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I also suggest to the Minister that the words &ldquo;known to a director&rdquo; should be amended to read &ldquo;known to a director or the secretary&rdquo;.  The fact that the knowledge was with the secretary should bring this section into play as well.  In many cases the secretary plays a key role in the administration of the affairs of a company. In section 6 responsibility is placed on the secretary as well as on the director where the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is used.  A director or the secretary can bring about the commission of an offence under section 6.  There seems to be no logical reason for excluding the secretary from this section. I ask the Minister to consider seriously those two alterations so that the section would read &ldquo;the earliest day on which that fact is known or ought to have been known to a director or the secretary of the company&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molony said the Bill was not comprehensive enough to deal with certain types of malpractice under company law.  I accept that fully. I stated it quite emphatically when I was introducing the Bill.  When I was replying to the debate on Second Stage earlier this afternoon I said the Bill enables us to comply with the Second Directive from the EEC and in that respect it is quite limited.  I made it quite clear that I am determined to stamp out the type of practice to which the Deputy referred.  It cannot be done under this Bill.  It is more appropriate to legislation under the Fourth Directive, or domestic law in this area which is in the process of preparation in my Department and is at a fairly advanced stage.  There is wide public concern about this area and I have already expressed my total determination to cut out that type of practice by people who could be described properly as legitimised confidence men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Taylor raised the question of <Col N="1455" /> whether a director knew or did not know, and how we would police the legislation.  In the balance sheet the auditor must draw attention to the fact that the companies are in financial difficulties and the extent of the financial difficulties and, when they have reached the limit provided under the Act, he must draw this specifically to their attention.  I accept that there are people who draw their directors; fees only and do not have any other responsibility or interest.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for the present chaos and confusion in the school transport scheme and for inflicting hardship on many thousands of families. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1456" /> At the outset I am anxious to state that the present school transport scheme which the Minister is endeavouring to operate is not working and cannot be made operable under its present terms. The indications today are that it is not operable.  I learned that from the many phone calls I made and from representations made to me about the scheme.  It is just four months since the Minister assumed control of the Department of Education and in that time the House debated the subject of school transport formally on two occasions and informally on one occasion.  Therefore, for the third time in four months the House is formally debating the question of school transport. There must be something wrong if Members must constantly refer to the anomalies in the scheme, ask for relief, get half-baked satisfaction but are still left with a patchwork scheme.  In four months the issue has gone from disbelief to bewilderment, to confusion and to total chaos as exists today.</P>
    <P>The Minister may choose to repeat her old record using her worn out needle of looking back and saying that the Government are the goodies and Fianna Fáil are the baddies, that it was Fianna Fáil that started all this.  In my view it is immaterial who thought up the scheme.  What is of concern is who is implementing it.  I can tell the House that such a scheme would not have been implemented under Fianna Fáil.  We would not have implemented a patchwork, half-baked daft scheme such as the Minister is implementing. I am sure the country is tired of hearing about school transport.  I am tired referring to it in the House.  The Minister may tell us that CIE are tired of it, that she is tired of it and that the Department are tired of it but we must consider the feelings of parents and children who are involved in this.  They are more than tired; they are fed up with it, confused and annoyed.</P>
    <P>The current mess over school transport is the result of massive ministerial mishandling of the matter.  The Minister is succeeding through her school transport scheme in settling household against household in rural Ireland, street against street and village against village.  I am <Col N="1457" /> aware of rural areas where neighbours are not talking and where children are not talking because some are being taken on school buses and others left behind.  It is an appalling situation that CIE are being forced through instructions from the Department of Education to refuse admission on buses to children even if it is raining heavily or is very cold.  Many of those children will have to sit their leaving certificate, intermediate certificate and group certificate examinations within a few weeks.  There is something rotten in the country if such children are refused permission to use the school transport system.</P>
    <P>The scheme was never investigated.  It was a case of bureaucratic memos placed on the Minister's desk and the contents of them accepted by her.  That has led to the bungling and blundering we have had in relation to the scheme.  It is easy to appear on television, go on radio or meet the media about other educational matters which are valid, topics such as sex bias in education, private schools versus public schools and so on but they are only academic questions because if children cannot get to school the other issues do not arise.  There are thousands of second level students, many of them preparing for State examinations, whose parents cannot afford the school transport fees. Many of those parents are medical card holders but their children do not qualify for free transport.</P>
    <P>I am not happy with the medical card being used as the criterion of need.  However, the Minister used that criterion to judge those in need.  When the liaison officers and other agencies refused to decide on who should be entitled to use the school buses the Minister adopted the medical card criterion.  It is distinctly odd and strange that up to 2,000 children of medical card holders cannot get on a school bus.  The answer I expect from the Minister, from CIE and the Department is that those students are not attending their &ldquo;appropriate school centre&rdquo;.  That &ldquo;appropriate school centre&rdquo; was as a result of the catchment boundaries which were drawn up many years ago.</P>
    <P>Over the years there have been variations of those boundaries but they were <Col N="1458" /> never formalised.  When I speak about catchment boundaries I know what I am talking about.  The people of County Mayo will be delighted to know that Deputy Kenny approves of the present school transport chaos.  In my constituency, Longford-Westmeath, there are many children who have been told that they are not attending their appropriate school centre.  I have letters from the parents of those children and in 75 per cent of the cases the appropriate school centre is almost two miles further away than the school they are attending.  That is a daft situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister must accept that the use of the medical card criterion has led to awful confrontations and feelings of inadequacy by children and parents.  I always thought that medical ethics dictated that the holding of a medical card was a private matter for the recipient, the doctor and the bureaucracy, the Midland Health Board, that handled such applications.</P>
    <P>The holding of medical cards now has become a matter of public knowledge, ribaldry and comment.  Children can be cruel, and I know of instances of children standing up in buses and saying &ldquo;Hurrah, his parent has a medical card and mine has not.  We are better than you&rdquo;.  These comments are going on throughout rural Ireland.  It is not the Minister's fault that she lives in Dublin.  It is her abode, but I want to make it clear that she does not know, and neither do her civil servants, with respect to them, what is happening throughout rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are back to the old poor law system under which the recipient of poor law benefits went along, cap in hand, to get his due, whether it be the bowl of porridge or something else.  You were poor and everybody knew you were poor.  It reminds me of Marie Antoinette who said &ldquo;Let them eat cake&rdquo;.  It is a poor reflection of the Just Society policy of Fine Gael which was to have been introduced.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the medical card criterion, but it is set out.  How can the Minister justify saying a person is in need if his parents hold a medical card and then saying he is not in need because under some rule of years ago he is deemed to be living in a catchment <Col N="1459" /> boundary facility area?  That is wrong. You are in need if you live on one side of a street and not in need if you live on another side.  This will have to be looked into fully.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister and her officials would say that the children should change schools.  Children cannot change schools in the middle of a school term.  I submit that it is not feasible.  In any period of a course in a second-level school children cannot change schools because the idea is that in year one the child builds up a rapport with the teacher and the staff and the other pupils.  Of course education is not just sitting and learning.  Learning and teaching are a two-way process.  It is continuing and developmental.  As the child develops so does her relationship with the teacher.</P>
    <P>Therefore, the Minister cannot say that children should change schools and that the problem would be solved.  It will not all be solved because it is not educationally desirable that a child should change schools at any period of second-level education.</P>
    <P>The people of Ireland are annoyed. The people who pay the fares are annoyed.  Those who thought they were exempt because they held medical cards are cross and annoyed when they find that because they are living in a catchment boundary facility they are not included.  Above all, the medical card holders and their children are annoyed because they are being pointed at and the world knows their income and what they are or are not entitled to.</P>
    <P>In the Upper House recently it has become fashionable for people to read out correspondence they have received and to have it on record, saying how annoyed and frightened people have expressed themselves to be in correspondence. All public representatives receive many letters, some of them abusive, some of a happy nature but some of a very sad nature.  I have here a file of more than 200 letters.  Since I came into the spokesmanship on education and since the change in the school transport system, I decided that this was not an issue easy to be resolved, that it would <Col N="1460" /> not be solved just by regulations sent from Dublin to rural Ireland.  I decided I would keep a file on the cases.  I shall not give the names, naturally, because that would be a breach of confidence, but I will give them privately to the Minister.</P>
    <P>In front of me I have a very sad case. Last night I visited the parent concerned so that I would have my full facts before I stood up here.  It is the case of a woman who has a daughter without a left arm. That woman has attached the medical certificate, signed by her local doctor, which the child submitted to CIE, to the Department, everywhere it should have been submitted.  The medical evidence is clear and concise.  The doctor's opinion is that the child will be disabled for attending school unless she gets school transport.  The woman writes: &ldquo;Just a note to thank you for the work you have put in for me but&rdquo;&mdash; I will not give the child's name &mdash;&ldquo;was put off the bus this morning, Tuesday, 10 May and all the children on the bus laughed out at her&rdquo;. That child, physically disabled, produced the medical certificate and that is what happened on Tuesday last.</P>

I will read the bones of a second letter to the House.  <i>Inter alia</i> it states that the writer is a widow.  Her only means of income is a non-contributory pension.  One of her children is doing the intermediate certificate and the other is doing the leaving certificate.  Both are girls.  She says that because she is half a mile from being within catchment boundary facilities she is being asked for the fee.  She asks if she will go to the St. Vincent de Paul Society to get it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where can she get the £50?  She is a woman with two children living on a widow's non-contributory pension.  She is the holder of a medical card, but because of this harebrained catchment boundary facility clause she cannot qualify. I telephoned her neighbour and I was told that one of the children is doing <Col N="1461" /> intermediate certificate and one doing leaving certificate this year and both have to walk.  They have been walking to school in the last two weeks, between four and six miles.  There is no use in the Minister saying here that this scheme will work.  I heard the Minister on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, a programme to which I was not invited.  Various people from her constituency had said they were unable to pay the fee.  It was the day on which the Minister had made the announcement about the medical cards. She looked out of the television and said: &ldquo;I would like to tell those people that they need have no fear, they will be included under the scheme&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Will the children in my file of cases be included?  That file is of letters from people who cannot afford to pay the fee. I do not want another half-baked amelioration because it will do nothing to solve the problem.  There are children who in two or three weeks will be sitting at desks in large and small school halls to compete in State examinations to do between five and eight subjects.  I am not too far from my youth or my teen years not to remember the stress, strain and tension young people are subject to, particularly in the competitive world we live in.  They know how important it is that they pass their examinations, how important it is to their future and to their hopes for jobs.  Yet they have this hanging over them, and how can that be right in a very testing time?  Even in a tranquil environment these children are under considerable stress.  I have a child doing a State examination this year and I know what he is going through.  I try to make things easy for him in every way I can by trying to understand his problems.  How can these children face their school examinations while being burdened by outside worries?</P>
    <P>The Minister is a woman and a mother. She knows what she is doing is not right. She should forget what her civil servants and advisers are saying because they are living in Dublin and do not know what is happening in rural Ireland.  I am not speaking for the whole of rural Ireland because many other Deputies behind me will back up my case.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1462" /> Something will have to be done about this school transport scheme.  My attitude is not destructive.  I am on record as saying, and I also said it on the radio last Wednesday, that I and my party are prepared to look at a reasonable transport scheme but we are not prepared, and neither is the country, to put up with this farcical scheme which is not operable. When the Minister, takes her head out of the sand she will see this scheme collapsing in ruins around her feet.</P>
    <P>I know CIE operatives are not happy with this scheme.  In a written reply to Deputy H. Byrne last week the Minister said that to date the school transport scheme had brought in £1 million.  I realise the Minister may not have the information to hand but perhaps tomorrow evening she will let me know what the CIE overtime costs in working out this scheme have been, taking into account constant changes, fluctuations, ministerial orders and so on.  I can imagine the frustration felt by those people who are trying to operate a scheme they know is not operable.</P>
    <P>We are prepared to look at a scheme which is reasonable and is seen to be fair in its application.  This is the strongest point that has come back to me from the people I have spoken to.  The medical card holders do not like this scheme and the people who are paying are very cross, but all are prepared to look at a scheme which is seen to be fair, but they are not willing to look at a scheme which is discriminatory in every way.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention Irish-speaking schools.  This subject has been discussed here before but I wish to bring it to the Minister's attention tonight.  Heretofore the Irish-speaking schools had an area of positive discrimination in their favour by way of a transport subsidy.  This has disappeared. In the light of the recent study which has issued on the future of the Irish language &mdash; and the Minister said she was very interested in this study and its implications for the young &mdash; this scheme has done a great disservice to the people who send their children to all-Irish schools. Therefore this transport subsidy for Irish-speaking schools should be continued. I understand that the withdrawing <Col N="1463" /> of that subsidy is having drastic consequences on the projected intake of students.  I know of one such school, Scoil Mhuire, where the Minister's colleague, Deputy Dukes, was once a pupil.  The projected intake of pupils into this school has dramatically fallen.  If that trend were repeated in all the Irish schools around the country &mdash; there are only 14, and that includes the Gaeltacht areas &mdash; the enrolment rate in future years will rapidly diminish.  People might ask why we should discriminate positively in favour of those schools.  I see the Irish language as being worth positive discrimination.  If we do not discriminate positively in their favour we may forget about Irish for young people.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to parents whose children attend these schools.  They are sending their children there because they want the Irish traditions and the Irish language kept alive.  Very often they send their children to these schools at great cost to themselves, and the transport subsidy went but a very small way towards alleviating these transport costs.  That subsidy was an act of faith in the future of the Irish language.  I ask the Minister to look positively at this area and to try to change this disastrous Government policy.</P>
    <P>People might ask what can we do about the school transport system.  We can take one positive action.  I am not diverging from what I said last February, March, yesterday or today.  Then as now my policy is the same.  This scheme is not operable. The Minister should declare an amesty, bring the children to school for the remaining few weeks of this term, and let there be no discrimination.  When the school term ends there will be a three-month summer recess.  The Minister, her Minister of State, her civil servants and some of the ordinary people whose children are involved in this tug-of-war should sit down and discuss this scheme, and then work out a new scheme.  My party and I would be prepared to look constructively at such a scheme.</P>
    <P>I would like to sound a note of warning to the Minister: her colleagues are deserting her when this matter is discussed at <Col N="1464" /> branch meetings.  They say &ldquo;it has nothing to do with us.  Mrs. Hussey in Dublin has made these regulations&rdquo;.  I am waiting to hear what a particular Deputy might say in this debate, because I know exactly what he said at a branch meeting &mdash; I have a copy of his speech here.  It is not fair what her colleagues are doing to the Minister, but as this campaign has escalated and as the inequalities have come to light, some of her Deputies are cutting and running and saying it is the Minister Deputy Hussey's fault.  That is quite true.  I say the sooner the Minister puts her house in order and indeed the whole party in order the better for them.</P>

      <P>To come back to the debate in hand, which is the school transport charges, I would think the best action the Minister could take now would be to say truthfully &mdash; and mind you she will not lose face for being truthful; I will repeat she will not lose face for facing up to the fact &mdash; that we have all made mistakes from time to time.  Indeed, I have made many and I know I will make an awful lot more.  I was going to say I hope they will not be ministerial ones; I hope they will be in my capacity as a Minister but that they will not be mistakes. I would recommend to the Minister that she own up to the fact that she has made a gigantic ministerial mess of the school transport issue in Ireland today.  Unfortunatley, it is one that will be hung around her neck like an albatross for some considerable time to come.  I am not taking positive delight in that; I am merely stating a plain fact, particularly in the light of the scuttling of the ship that has been taking place in the last week as the crisis has mounted and as it has become so obvious that the scheme is non-operative.  Whether she does it tonight or tomorrow night, she should look into her own heart, listen to some ordinary people, mostly from rural Ireland and say to herself: &ldquo;The scheme is not working.  What can I do immediately to alleviate the situation?&rdquo; I say <Col N="1465" /> she can take the boys and girls trudging the roads of Ireland and put them back on the bus.</P>

      <P>That would stop immediately the ministerial bungling that has gone on.  Secondly, she might say to herself: &ldquo;I will work out a scheme in the relative tranquility and peace of summertime&rdquo;. I would recommend that she would then put before the parents an alternative scheme.  Mind you parents, in the perspective of what has happened in the last four months, are anxious to see a correct, fair scheme implemented.  I say to the Minister that the scheme is not working.  It has been ministerially mishandled. It has all been blundering and bungling.  Forget the school transport scheme, bring out an equitable scheme of school transport, when I shall be prepared to look at it, be constructive and fair in my appraisal of it.</P>

      <P>I have no desire to cover old ground but apparently Deputies opposite are insisting on doing so. Indeed, the ground in relation to the introduction of charges for school transport has already been well covered in this House.  We had a lengthy debate on the issue during Private Members' Business on 15 and 16 February last.  The Dáil has had the further opportunity of explanation and elucidation through the medium of some 59 questions both of a general and particular nature.  However, faced with the ever-changing stances adopted by the Opposition in this matter I have little option but to set out once again what has now become a substantial portion <Col N="1468" /> of the record of this Dáil.  I make no apology for doing so even though Deputies may not like to listen to it.  The Estimates for the Public Services for 1983&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to remind the Opposition that I did not utter one word during the contribution of Deputy O'Rourke.</P>
      <P>The Estimates for the Public Services for 1983, as published on 18 November 1982, provided £28.2 million for the operation of the school transport services.  While this is, in any terms, a substantial sum, the provision had to be measured against an outturn of over £28 million in 1982 and against the fact that, at the time this provision was made, it was known that to continue the service in 1983 on the same basis as 1982, would cost an estimated £33.6 million.  This resulted in an underprovision of £5.4 million. There is no question of this underprovision being accidental.  The then Fianna Fáil Minister for Education, Deputy G. Brady, in the honest and forthright manner we have come to expect from him in Dáil Éireann, issued a public statement on the same day that the Estimates were published.  In this public statement he outlined the decisions of the then Fianna Fáil Administration regarding school transport and I quote once again:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There will be no charge introduced for pupils of national schools eligible for free transport in accordance with the school transport regulations.  The cost of the scheme for primary and <Col N="1469" /> post-primary schools has, however, been growing to such an extent that measures need to be taken with regard to it.  Since no alteration is contemplated on the range of the service, the measures required to control cost must involve the introduction of a charge in the case of second level school pupils. Consideration is being given to the question of the arrangements to be made for the implementation of such charge.  It is contemplated that such arrangements would take the form of the issue of a season ticket, that there would be a lower rate for junior pupils and that a concession would be made to take account of the circumstances of members of large families. </P>
    <P>This oft-quoted statement is beginning to assume the character of Biblical reference on questions relating to the introduction of charges for school transport and well it might.  It is a fundamentally honest statement, without prevarication or equivocation.  Attempts were made during previous debates on this issue to describe the decision of the Fianna Fail Government to introduce charges in respect of school transport as provisional, or not final, or subject to ratification. These claims do not stand up to examination in the light of that statement and of the shortfall of £5.4 million in the provision made for the operation of the school transport service in the Estimates for the Public Services, 1983.</P>
    <P>The accusation has been made in this House, that, on coming into office on 15 December 1982, the Government &mdash; and I quote: &ldquo;put on the shirt of the previous administration and did not don its own clothes&rdquo;; that it was devoid of policies of its own in this area.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  During the election campaign we made no secret of the fact that we would have to accept the general outlines of the published Estimates and that we were seeking after a substantial reduction in the current budget deficit.  We inherited, from the previous administration, a deficit of £5.4 million in the provision for the operation of school transport services and we did not differ in the general approach of <Col N="1470" /> endeavouring to maintain the range of the service.  Given this approach there was no option but to seek a contribution from the users of the service as a means of making up the shortfall in the financial provision.  The charges introduced were along the same general lines as those announced in the statement of 18 November 1982.  What characterised the policies of the Government, however, and what made them different from those of Fianna Fáil, was the concern reflected in them for the less-well-off members of our society, for the people for whom the payment of school transport charges for their children would have involved hardship and difficulty.  Hence the provision made initially to exempt from the charges pupils in the senior cycle attending their appropriate centre and whose parents or legal guardians were holders of medical cards, and the further extension on 2 March 1983 to junior cycle pupils of this concession once experience had been gained of the operation of the scheme and following consultation with the concerned organisations and agencies.  I know &mdash; and I should like to say this here &mdash; that Deputy O'Rourke, the Fianna Fáil spokesperson on Education, is a concerned and compassionate person, but it is almost beyond belief, that as representative of a party which, when in office, made no provision whatsoever to exempt the children of the less-well-off from the school transport charges, she should have the temerity to put her name to a motion condemning the Government for &ldquo;inflicting hardship on many thousands of families&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Deputy has on more than one occasion voiced her criticism of the use of the medical card as an indicator of hardship.  I would certainly agree with her that the medical card system was not designed specifically to deal with school transport cases, but is she alleging that the medical card is not an indicator of hardship?  Does she feel that a medical card is too easily obtained and that people are benefiting not only from health services, but also, incidentally, from school transport services&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Or is she concerned, as she should be, with hardship cases that do not come within the medical card provision and is consciously trying to suggest a means whereby such cases can be identified and assisted?  While I have heard various general statements on the need to employ some criterion of hardship other than the medical card I have yet to hear a concrete and workable suggestion.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputy that the medical card was not adopted without considerable thought, examination and consultation.  For one thing the school transport scheme is essentially a rural scheme and it is in rural areas that the possession of medical cards is most widespread.  The setting up of a separate scheme of determining hardship, solely for the purposes of the relatively modest contributions required for school transport could certainly not be justified and the costs attendant on any such arrangement would inevitably be reflected in terms of higher charges for school transport for those who had to pay.  The application of the medical card concession is carried out with the greatest sensitivity and anonymity.  Parents who are entitled to seek this concession on behalf of their children apply in the normal way to the local CIE office enclosing their medical card with the application.  All applications are treated with confidentiality and the validation ticket issued to the child of the medical card holder differs in no way from that issued to the child on behalf of whom the requisite charge has been paid. And that is as it should be.  Let me put the Deputy beyond doubt as to my position in this matter.  If it can be established that there is a more appropriate criterion of hardship than the possession of a medical card and if such a criterion can meet the two requirements of (i) not burdening the school transport scheme with extra administrative costs and (ii) seeking to <Col N="1473" /> preserve the anonymity of the children who benefit from the concession, then I would have no hesitation about adopting such a criterion.</P>
      <P>The Deputy has also voiced her concern about the fact that the medical card concession of which she is so critical has not been extended to pupils availing of what is known as &ldquo;catchment boundary facilities&rdquo;.  This is a topic on which there is a great deal of self-proclaimed and convenient ignorance and examples have been quoted of large and flourishing schools which stand to lose a few pupils to adjacent and less populous centres unless the catchment boundary concession is put on a par with the conditions obtaining for pupils who have full eligibility within the terms of the school transport scheme.  In this matter we have to be quite clear what we are talking about. For the purposes of school transport the country is divided into catchment areas, each such area served by its own adequate post-primary centre.</P>

      <P>These catchment areas were drawn up initially in consultation with the schools' authorities and had <Col N="1475" /> regard to distance and traditional patterns of attendance as well as to the economics of school transport and the maintenance of a viable network of post-primary school services.  Pupils who live more than three miles from the post-primary centre serving their catchment area are eligible for transport to that centre.  As a special concession, pupils who are eligible for school transport, but who choose, for reasons of their own, not to attend the post-primary centre serving their catchment area, but to go instead to the centre serving an adjoining catchment area, are granted what is known as &ldquo;catchment boundary facility&rdquo;. To avail themselves of this facility such pupils must board the school bus within the catchment area of the centre they are attending.  They are themselves responsible and they always have been responsible for getting to such a boarding point and there never has been any question of their using school transport services for this purpose.  Once they have got to the catchment area of the centre they are attending, they may be given transport to that centre subject to the payment of a catchment boundary charge of £24 and provided there is spare accommodation on the school bus after all eligible pupils have been served.  The medical card concession does not apply to pupils availing themselves of &ldquo;catchment boundary facilities&rdquo;.  It is hardly necessary for me to defend a long-established structure of school transport services, nor to point to the fact that the service was established in the first instance to enable children who would have had difficulty on grounds of distance in making a satisfactory attendance at school, to do so.  The service was not and could not be established to assist in the exercise of choice as between one post-primary centre and another.  When pupils choose to go to school outside of the centre serving their catchment area, they do so in the knowledge that transport may not be available at all, or that even if they can be accommodated initially as &ldquo;catchment boundary pupils&rdquo;, their continued transport is not guaranteed as they can be displaced at any time by an increase in the number <Col N="1476" /> of eligible pupils using the particular service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Looking at the &ldquo;catchment boundary facility&rdquo; in this light it is perfectly clear why the medical card concession cannot and should not be extended to pupils wishing to avail themselves of the catchment boundary facility.  First, the use of the catchment boundary facility is not a necessary prerequisite to ensure a satisfactory attendance at school on the part of pupils who would have difficulty in doing so on grounds of distance.  It arises solely from a free choice made by the pupils and their parents not to go to the centre serving the catchment area in which they live, but rather to go to a centre, frequently more distant, serving an adjoining catchment area.  Secondly, catchment boundary transport is in itself a concession within the terms of the school transport scheme and is not guaranteed. Should the medical card concession be extended to pupils wishing to avail themselves of the catchment boundary facility, the conditions would certainly arise where there would be pupils entitled to claim the medical card concession and for whom no catchment boundary transport would be available. Thirdly, such an extension would clearly raise extremely difficult problems of priorities, where pupils in excess of the spare capacity of the service are applying for catchment boundary transport. Should pupils entitled to avail themselves of the medical card concession be given priority over pupils on whose behalf the appropriate charge must be paid?  I need not comment on the threat such an arrangement would pose to the anonymity of the arrangements attending the medical card concession.  At present priority in catchment boundary transport is given in accordance with seniority within the post-primary school course and this is seen to be the most equitable system of allocating a restricted number of places.  With a &ldquo;medical card&rdquo; concession in operation the conflicting claims of medical card status and seniority would not be subject to ready resolution.  All in all there would appear to me to be several sound and convincing reasons for the medical card concession not being <Col N="1477" /> extended to catchment boundary transport and it is not proposed to grant such an extension.  I concede that this can give rise to temporary hardship in a small number of existing cases but this arises as a direct consequence of the deliberate choice made regarding the post-primary centre attended.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to leave the detailed reply to the allegations of chaos and confusion in the school transport system to my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Donal Creed, and to deal with them only very summarily in this part of the debate.  Before doing so, however, I think it necessary to point to the poverty of ideas on the Opposition benches regarding the entire question of school transport charges.  In a recent interview on &ldquo;Women Today&rdquo; the proposer of this motion accepted, I am glad to note, the introduction of charges for school transport.</P>

      <P>In the course of this interview she appealed to me to suspend the present system of charges and to sit down during the relative tranquillity of summer time and work out a more equitable system of charges to go into operation in the school year 1983-84.  She appeared to see some merit in a suggestion regarding the possibility of imposing a smaller charge on all pupils throughout the country.  I cannot help wondering whether the Deputy was seriously implying that we should now abolish the medical card concession and evolve a system whereby the better off would be further subsidised by the subscriptions of those less well able to pay.  Or perhaps she was considering that we should now extend the charges to pupils in primary schools eligible for free transport under the terms of the school transport scheme, despite her own expressed concern and that of her colleagues regarding the Constitutional obligations resting on me as Minister for Education, on behalf of the State, in the matter of provision for education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can assure her that neither of these two options will be considered by me, nor by the Government in which I serve. As to the giving of an amnesty in respect of the current charges, I would not in any circumstances put myself in the position of offering such a gratuitous insult to the many thousands of people who recognised and accepted the necessity for the introduction of such charges in the interest of maintaining the school transport scheme, and who voiced this recognition in the most articulate way possible, not by public marches and protests, but by making valid applications for continued school transport for their children.  There is no question of a suspension or an amnesty in relation to such charges, nor could there be without establishing a charge for the coming term of some three times that which is currently in operation. I am afraid that Deputy O'Rourke was merely giving voice to the freedom enjoyed by Deputies in Opposition from the financial arithmetic of the situation and indulging in that well-known dalliance of Fianna Fáil with financial rectitude <Col N="1479" /> which might be expressed as &ldquo;Lord make me good, but not yet&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Those who have used the school transport service in the winter term and did not pay the appropriate charge &mdash; and I am glad to say that this is a very small proportion &mdash; have a debt to clear just as surely as they would have if they had not paid their ESB bill or their television licence.  This, however, is being considered as a matter separate from the arrangements which obtain in the current summer term.</P>
    <P>Under these latter arrangements a validation ticket has been issued to all pupils on whose behalf an appropriate application was made by the due date and only pupils who have the appropriate validation ticket together with their travel permit are granted facilities on school transport services.  This position must now be very clear to all concerned.  If any confusion or chaos exists in regard to these arrangements, it cannot be attributed to the Government.  Córas Iompair Éireann, who act as agents for my Department in the matter of school transport, distributed application forms in connection with charges for the summer term to all post-primary schools on 1 March 1983.  The deadline set for the receipt of applications was 9 April.  In consultation with my Department, CIE extended this deadline to 27 April and warned that transport would not be available to those without validation tickets after May 6.  This information was conveyed through advertisements in the public press, on radio and on television, and all school bus drivers were instructed by CIE to remind the pupils travelling on the buses of the terms of the notice. Nobody can dispute that every possible effort was made to bring the arrangements to the attention of those parents concerned and to the extent that they disregarded the notice and neglected to submit valid applications on or before the extended date, they have, unfortunately, only themselves to blame.  The consequences of not obtaining a validation ticket were clearly and unambiguously stated.  I have to state that CIE have made every possible effort to facilitate <Col N="1480" /> parents who wished to submit applications even after the announced deadline and it is still open to parents who have not applied to do so even at this late stage.</P>

      <P>The local offices of CIE have arranged to process applications so as to ensure the issue of validation tickets with the minimum delay and on receipt of such tickets pupils may again avail themselves of school transport facilities. With regard to the coming autumn term the same scale of charges will apply and arrangements are in train whereby the charge may be paid in two moieties, the first moiety, comprising half of the appropriate charge must be paid on or before 16 June.  Pupils on whose behalf the medical card concession is being claimed must also submit their application by that date.  The school transport <Col N="1481" /> services for the autumn term will be organised on the basis of such applications received.</P>
      <P>The details of the charges in respect of school transport were first announced by me on 23 December 1982. Since then they have been the subject of considerable publicity and debate.  They have not been altered.  The only amendment since the first announcement has been the extension of the concession of free transport to eligible junior cycle pupils attending their appropriate centre whose parents/legal guardians are holders of a medical card, a concession previously enjoyed by senior cycle pupils in similar circumstances. The Government have exercised both consideration and forebearance in the introduction of the scheme of charges for school transport.  It was clear from the beginning that once a charge is introduced anybody who fails to pay this charge or who is not exempt from it forfeits the right to continued use of the service.  It would be totally unacceptable, in consideration of the many parents who have paid the school bus charges, to permit the continued use of the service by those pupils on whose behalf the charges have not been paid.  To fail to take action in a matter of this kind is a recipe for public discontent and would lead to the type of confusion which the Opposition allege.  Nevertheless, the Government, having regard to the fact that the charges had been newly introduced, desisted from taking action during the winter term in respect of pupils on whose behalf valid applications had not been made.  They considered it appropriate, however, after due and extensive notice had been given, to take action in the course of the current summer term.  Pupils on whose behalf an appropriate application has not been made will not be facilitated on the service from the commencement of the autumn term.</P>

      <P>The Minister put down an amendment which states:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;approves of the arrangements made by the Government in connection with the imposition of school transport charges to alleviate any hardship which might be caused to families by such charges.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This amendment is not honest and is certainly not accurate It shows an arrogant disregard for the rights of young people. Those who support the amendment will have a lot to answer for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know many rural Deputies who share my views and the views put forward in our motion.  I have heard members of the Minister's party who claim to support our <Col N="1485" /> motion, perhaps not in so many words but certainly in its tone and sentiment and they say they will use every opportunity to defeat this inequity.  The Minister should be warned that members of the parliamentary party are frustrated by the original stupid decision and may give vent to this frustration tomorrow night. Remember the embarrassing defeats of the Government just two weeks ago. Their own people let them down.  They were tired of the &ldquo;bully boy&rdquo; antics of the Government.  I will be keeping a very close eye on my three Wexford colleagues on the Fine Gael benches who I know agree with me in denouncing this amendment.  I will be interested, as will the people of Wexford, to note the direction they will take when they vote.  Will they vote for a continuation of the charges?  Will they vote to deny children the opportunity to get second level education?</P>
    <P>I am supporting the motion.  The scheme to impose tranport charges was introduced by the Government on Christmas Eve, 1982.  Christmas is usually a time of enjoyment for children but this time it was a total disaster.  The scheme was introduced outside the Dáil in the hope that it would be forgotten when the Dáil resumed.  I say the scheme will never be forgotten.  The Minister will be known as the Minister for Education who hated little children.  She will be remembered as the Minister who was bullied by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Alan Dukes&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme has had disastrous results.  It applied from January 1983.  Pupils attending school in their own catchment area were charged £14 per term and pupils attending school outside their catchment area were charged £24 per term.  The charges were collected in a haphazard manner: some paid and others did not.  Some families <Col N="1486" /> paid £50 for the first term, while others paid nothing.  Yet, the same service was provided for all.</P>
      <P>As a result of a motion put down by Fianna Fáil, the Minister began to see the stupidity of her action.  She saw the light of day and changed the scheme but unfortunately she still insisted on charges. Refunds had to be paid to parents who are the holders of medical cards and whose children attended schools within their catchment boundaries.  Parents who were the holders of medical cards thought their children would be included and this led to confusion.  Confusion is the hallmark of this scheme.  All refunds have not yet been made.  In the Easter term all children were taken on the buses, including those who had not paid.  Then, the Government issued a &ldquo;high noon&rdquo; ultimatum on Monday, 9 May.  The children of the nation were to be denied access to the buses and to education.  There was more confusion.  Some pupils got on the buses, some did not, some were ordered off and general chaos ensued.  The scenes at crossroads reminded us of the hedge school days, with timid, innocent children scurrying into hiding in embarrassment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>This is the exam term.  Pupils doing their leaving certificate examination are <Col N="1487" /> tense and uptight.  In some of the most important weeks in their lives they are worried and upset and the additional strain of not knowing if they can go to school is the killer blow.  Thousands of pupils and families are affected.  Many pupils live more than ten miles from their school and their parents cannot afford the transport charges.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister of State, as I would ask the Minister if she were here, what are the pupils to do?  Are they to forego doing their leaving certificate after five years of struggle, hardship and commitment? Are these pupils to be thrown on the scrap heap?  In a few months those pupils who have been prevented from doing their leaving certificate examination will have to compete with students who could afford to do their examination. It is easy to know who will be the winners.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is setting child against child, parent against parent and, above all, is denying the children the opportunity to education.  This is all to satisfy the Minister and the Minister for Finance.  He told the Minister for Education to get the money, irrespective of how she got it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last week in reply to a question the Minister told me that £1 million had been collected in school transport charges. Collection of that money has caused more agony than any money collected in the history of this State.  In 1968 Fianna Fáil, recognising that every pupil is entitled to second level education, introduced the concept of free education. Since then every child has had the opportunity of attending a second-level school. Before 1968 only the better-off could go to second-level schools: now we are back again in that situation.  This achievement by the Government has brought in £1 million but how many millions have been wasted?  The Government spent almost <Col N="1488" /> £1 million providing advisers and personal staff for their benefit in an exercise in jobs for the boys.  In these hard times could they not forego that luxury and let every child have an equal opportunity of competing for jobs?</P>
    <P>Nowadays children finish their national school education at 12 years of age.  It is well known that many children cannot go to second-level schools because they cannot afford it.  What do these children do when they leave school at 12 years?  Do they look for a job?  What do the Government suggest that these children should do?  Children are obliged by law to attend school until they are 15 years but they cannot afford to go because they are poor.  Thus, they break the law.  Is it school or jail for those children?  Last Monday week in Taghmon, County Wexford, because parents refused to pay transport charges, their children were denied transport to schools in Wexford or Adamstown.  A school bus went to Adamstown vocational school with two pupils on board.  Other school buses went to Wexford with ten pupils and fewer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.  Buses being paid for by the State without anybody on them are travelling great distances and pupils are huddled together at crossroads in the rain with only the prospect of home and the leaving certificate looming in the near future.  The parents decided to take the discriminated children to the local national school.  The principal was sympathetic but told them there was no room in the inn.</P>
      <P>How can those pupils face the leaving certificate?  What happens to those who have paid for both terms?  Since there are so many who have not paid anything it can hardly be regarded as fair.  The people in Taghmon and the surrounding areas would accept a reasonable scheme which would be applied across the board. Our party agree with this.  Our policy is that all children will have the opportunity of second level education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was handed a letter before the debate saying it was felt that pupils doing public <Col N="1489" /> examinations, particularly the leaving certificate, should not be left on the road. State examinations begin on 8 June. Today, pupils who intend to do those examinations were put off the buses 13 miles from their school.  Does the Minister consider this is fair?  Do Government members consider it fair that those pupils should be denied the opportunity of sitting for their leaving certificate at the most important time of their lives?  Does the Minister expect those children to walk to school in the rain?</P>
    <P>It is hard to believe a scheme could have been introduced with so little compassion for the children who have almost completed their second level courses and cannot now get to school or sit for their examinations.  Will the Minister take into account the plight of these children?  I would like to hear the Minister of State replying to the statements I have made. It is well known that what I have said tonight about County Wexford is the same throughout the country.  There is chaos in relation to transport to every second level school.</P>
    <P>Is it the Minister's intention to prevent pupils attending school in order to cut down the number of teachers?  What we have heard tonight and what has happened since Christmas seems to have spread right across the board, even into the Department of Agriculture, when the education of girls has been discontinued by the Government.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the necessity for education cuts.  Fianna Fáil have kept a close eye on the many activities of the Minister.  I appeal to her to forget this ridiculous scheme which is divisive and unworkable.  It has set parent against parent, pupil against pupil, caused rows at crossroads like we had on fair days.  If this is not the Minister's intention, she must react positively.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1490" /> The Minister of State knows that everything Deputy Mary O'Rourke and I have said is true.  It is quite obvious from what the Minister said tonight that she has spent very little time in rural areas.  Maybe it is worse in Wexford than in other places but it is pretty bad all over the country.  My two colleagues sitting on the Government back benches know as well as I that there will be many pupils ready to sit for examinations who will not now have the opportunity to do so.</P>

I will not tell the people of Wexford, but I suspect they will be watching.  What is to happen to the pupils in Wexford who are denied the opportunity to sit for the leaving certificate and the intermediate certificate?  I would like the Minister of State to reply to that question.  I can give him the names of several who will not be able to sit for those examinations.  I am sure there are so many throughout the country that they will number many thousands.</P>
      <P>The Minister must know the scheme is a disaster.  Can I appeal to her to climb down off her high horse, accept what is good for the pupils and scrap the scheme. Let us have an amnesty until this term ends, let bygones be bygones.  We are prepared to forget that this was a disastrous mistake.  The Minister should be big enough to admit this and I believe she would be admired for it.</P>

In response to these proposals the local authority were advised that preparation of contract documents for the further stages of the scheme would be premature because of insufficient demand by way of group water scheme development.</P>

      <P>The provision, operation and maintenance of a public water supply in Phibsboro' is primarily the responsibility of Dublin Corporation, as sanitary authority for the area.</P>
      <P>Dublin Corporation have said that while at the moment pressures in the Phibsboro' area are adequate, it is known that, in the recent past, pressures were unsatisfactory.  This situation is partly due to the general deficiency in the overall supply system, which requires that pressures be kept down to conserve the supply.  This stringent pressure control tends to affect elevated areas like Phibsboro'. The corporation and county council's current work programme will provide an adequate supply of water for the entire city area within the next few years.  Significant improvements have already been made, and others are anticipated this year and over the next number of years, as various projects are brought to fruition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problem at Phibsboro' is compounded by inadequacies in parts of the <Col N="1278" /> local distribution system, particularly in the mains in the North Circular Road. These are included in the corporation's work programme for replacement in the short term.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 655 and 660 together.</P>
      <P>While the Report on the Fire Service was published without Government commitment, the recommendations of the majority report have in general been acted upon.  Fire authorities carried out reviews to assess the strength and adequacy of their fire services as recommended by the report and were recently requested to carry out a further assessment. Capital investment in fire stations and equipment has been substantially increased and a 50 per cent subsidy on loan repayments has been introduced. The Fire Services Act, 1981, has been in force since January 1982.  This Act concentrated fire functions in county councils, county borough corporations and a small number of urban authorities, improved the powers of fire authorities in relation to fire fighting, emergencies, fire safety and inspections, placed statutory obligations on persons having control over premises to which the public have access and empowered the Minister to establish a Fire Services Council.  A number of guidelines have been published with the aim of promoting standardisation and greater efficiency.  Central training courses to supplement local training activity have been arranged by the Department and that programme is currently being expanded.  The need for improved telecommunications facilities in the fire service is being examined.  The Fire Prevention Council was established in 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The recommendations of the majority report and the five minority reports contained some fundamental differences on important personnel issues, including recruitment and reporting relationships. Efforts to secure acceptable solutions on these issues through the relevant conciliation machinery, although hindered for a long time by differences between staff interests, have resulted in a conciliation <Col N="1284" /> agreement covering the introduction of a new senior staff structure for the county fire service and certain consequential arrangements.  The finalisation of certain other matters, such as the provision of appropriate educational facilities and the reporting arrangements of chief fire officers, which are covered in the conciliation agreement, is being pursued in co-operation with the relevant staff interests.</P>
    <P>It is my intention to maintain capital investment at the level required to ensure that fire stations and equipment are adequate to meet the demands placed upon the fire service.  As I announced in my Estimates speech I am going ahead with the establishment of the Fire Services Council.  This body will play an important role in the provision of central training and in the preparation of draft regulations, codes of practice, guidelines and standards relating to fire safety and other fire matters.  In the legislative area, I will shortly be introducing a Bill which will provide a statutory basis for the making of building regulations and for their administration and implementation.  My Department is at present preparing regulations relating to fire safety in places of public assembly.  The operation of the Fire Services Act, 1981, will also be kept under review.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 657, 658 and 659 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The undertakings which I gave to representatives of the building industry on the occasion of my meeting with them in January last and to which I referred in my reply to a parliamentary question of 27 January are being processed as quickly as possible.  They include initiatives to remove or lessen the effects of existing obstacles and constraints affecting the industry.  This is a matter that will require attention on an on-going basis but in the short term I am taking measures to speed up decision-making in the planning appeals area with a view to expediting the release of building projects.  Additional staff are being made available to An Bord Pleanála and the board itself is implementing new administrative procedures aimed at eliminating delays.  Also I will shortly be introducing a new Planning Bill designed, <i>inter alia,</i> to bring about desirable changes in the structure of An Bord Pleanála and in the procedures for processing planning appeals. <Col N="1291" /> Regarding planning law generally I am having a special review carried out in my Department to identify any changes that would make the system more efficient and enable it to contribute to economic and social development in a more positive way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the establishment of a broadly based council, I had proposed to set up such a council following the receipt of a major report on the building industry which was to have been completed early this year.  However, I understand now that this report may not be available for some months yet.  I have recently met both the Construction Industry Federation and a group representing the construction unions of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and have agreed with them the desirability of establishing a system of regular liaison to discuss matters affecting the industry generally.  Initially, I have proposed a further meeting with each group in about two months' time in order to review developments in the meantime in regard to the matters discussed. Other matters discussed at the meeting of 17 January last included the need for greater private investment in construction and the continuation of section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981.  On the question of private sector investment, the Government are giving urgent consideration to the organisation of arrangements that would enable institutional funds to be channelled into infrastructural works, particularly into roads projects. This is something on which I hope to be in a position soon to make an announcement.  With regard to section 23 of the Finance Act, 1981 the Deputy will be aware that this year's Finance Bill proposes to continue this measure for a further three-year period up to 31 March 1987.  According to information made available to me, the continuation of the section 23 concession is likely to result in the early release of a substantial volume of construction work on new apartments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 662 and 665 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fixed allocations have not been made in respect of rates support grants.  In the case of the domestic rate grant, the voted provision for 1983 will be divided among local authorities on the basis of rateable valuations of the relevant domestic property in each area and, in the case of the grant in lieu of rates on land, on a basis equivalent to land valuations.  Local authorities have been given a preliminary estimate of the payments they may expect <Col N="1293" /> to receive this year.  Details of these estimates have been given in reply to a previous question from the Deputy (Official Report, Volume 341, columns 672 and 673).  The final amounts will be influenced by valuation buoyancy and the figures are subject to review when fuller information is available from the local authorities.  The payments to each local authority in respect of domestic rate and grant in lieu of rates on land in 1982, the percentage increase of the 1983 estimates over the produce of the 1982 rate on the relevant valuations, including all shortfalls, and, the shortfall in domestic rate <Col N="1294" /> grant and the estimated amount of rates withheld by farmers in respect of 1982 are set out in the tabular statement.</P>
    <P>The voted provisions for domestic rate grant and the grant in lieu of rates or land of £277.5 million in 1983 include an additional £31.5 million provided in the budget.  They represent an increase of 22 per cent over last year's provisions and almost 13 per cent over the estimates published in November 1982.  In this way account has been taken, as far as is possible in the difficult budgetary situation of the shortfall in the 1982 allocations</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reference which I made to this matter in introducing my Department's Estimate to the House on 12th instant.

I indicated that I intended to examine the issues involved and the options as regards changes which would contribute to making the system stronger, more effective and more democratic, and that I was proceeding with a special examination of means to ensure the financial viability of the local government system for the medium and longer terms.  It will be the <Col N="1308" /> aim to make as much progress as possible with this work in the period ahead.</P>

      <P>Information as to the number of rate collectors in each local authority has been compiled from returns submitted by local authorities in relation to numbers employed at 31 December 1982, which is the latest date for which figures are available. This is set out in the attached tabular statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.  The figures include officers whose duties embrace rate collection work, such as revenue collectors and rent/rate collectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The salaries and expenses of rate collectors vary not only from local authority to local authority but even within individual local authorities.  Consequently the time required for compilation of the requisite <Col N="1315" /> information would be disproportionate.</P>

      <P>The European Communities (Lead Content of Petrol) (Amendment) Regulations, 1982 which came into operation on 1 September 1982 reduced the maximum permissible lead level in petrol marketed in this country from 0.64 to 0.40 grammes per litre and brought this country fully into line with present EEC requirements.  The extent to which lead levels can be further reduced or totally eliminated in Ireland depends in part, on the action taken by other countries to achieve improved standards.  It is also linked to refining operations at Whitegate and the technical ability of motor vehicles to use lead-free petrol.  I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Industry and Energy, that the Irish National Petroleum Company are awaiting the results of studies on lead content which were commissioned shortly after Whitegate was reopened in September 1982.</P>

      <P>The Government are seriously concerned about the grave violations of human rights in Argentina, and the failure to bring to justice those responsible for such violations.  The Government, together with our partners in the Ten, <Col N="1316" /> have on numerous occasions made representations to the Argentine authorities about the fate of the disappeared.  Most recently, in relation to the document on the fate of disappeared persons issued by the military junta on 28 April, the Ten stated that this document could not be considered a sufficient or final answer to the numerous approaches on this matter which the Ten had made previously.  The Ten further urged the Argentine authorities to give satisfactory clairfication of the fate of the missing people.</P>

However, the Government are, of course, willing to assist the Contadora group of countries in this search for peace in Central America in all appropriate ways.  As the Deputy will recall, in my statement on the motion on Central America which I made in the Dáil on 26 April, I indicated the Government's full support for the efforts of the Contadora group to bring peace to Central America.</P>

      <P>The high level of youth unemployment in the Finglas and Ballymun areas is recognised and a wide range of programmes which aim to improve the employment prospects of participants are currently in operation.  An AnCO training centre with 384 training places was recently <Col N="1320" /> opened in Finglas and about 1,100 people will be trained there this year in addition to those undertaking external programmes. Another AnCO training centre at Baldoyle will be completed shortly and the availability of this training facility will allow for greater access to the Finglas Centre for unemployed youths recruited more directly from the locality than present arrangements permit.</P>
      <P>The Youth Employment Agency is giving special attention to the unemployment problem in Finglas and Ballymun and has initiated a range of contacts with local and community groups, some of which have already resulted in the commencement of projects and additional proposals for the area are now under examination by the agency.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed and was paid occupational injury benefit from 28 September 1982 to 28 March 1983.  Injury benefit having been paid for the maximum period of 26 weeks his claim was then treated as one to disability benefit from 29 March 1983.</P>
      <P>He was not qualified for payment of disability benefit at that stage, however, as according to the records of my Department he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in 1981-82, the contribution year governing his claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following receipt of an employer's statement on 2 May 1983 confirming the claimant's employment record in 1981-82 it was established that he had a total of <Col N="1339" /> 47 contributions in that year and was, therefore, entitled to disability benefit at a weekly rate of £30.50.</P>
    <P>All disability benefit payable to 26 April 1983, date of latest medical certificate received, has been issued to the claimant. In addition pay-related benefit has also been paid to 26 April 1983.  The rate of pay-related benefit is £15.35 per week.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>A PRSI contribution at the Class K rate, which is currently 3 percent, is payable on the amount of a person's occupational pension.  However no liability exists if the person holds a current medical card.</P>
      <P>PRSI contributions are currently being deducted from the occupational pension of the person concerned because the Paymaster-General's office, which is the paying agency for the pension, was not aware of the award to him of a medical card.  This fact has now been brought to the attention of the Paymaster-General's office, and as a result a refund of PRSI contributions amounting to £4.42 in respect of the current income tax year will be made shortly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned should apply to the Office of the Collector-General, PRSI Refunds, Baggot Bridge House, 85 Lower Baggot Street, Dublin 2, for a refund of the PRSI contributions overpaid in the 1982-83 income tax year and should submit his P.60 for that year with his application. It is understood that he received his medical card on 28 April 1982.  The amount of the refund for the 1982-83 income tax year will therefore be the total <Col N="1340" /> amount of PRSI contributions overpaid by him since he received this card.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 2 July 1982 and was paid to 9 February 1983. Payment was discontinued after that date following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that the claimant was capable of work.  In the meantime, however, he was hospitalised from 7 March 1983 to 21 March 1983 and payment was made in respect of this period.  He appealed against the disallowance of benefit from 10 February 1983 and in connection with his appeal it is proposed to have him examined by a different medical referee in early June. However, following a review of his claim on 12 May 1983 it was discovered that he should not have qualified for benefit in the first instance as his insurance record is deficient.  The Social Welfare (Contributions) Regulations provide that where an insured person has no contributions paid or credited for two or more consecutive years that person cannot qualify for disability benefit or the award of credited contributions until he has a further 26 weeks of insurable employment for which the appropriate contributions have been paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He had a total of seven paid contributions in 1980-1981 and the previous contributions <Col N="1344" /> paid on his behalf were for 1973.  Consequently his claim should not have been authorised for payment.

Payment ceased after that date as she had less than the required minimum of 156 paid contributions to her credit since her entry into insurable employment to entitle her to further payment.  This was her maximum entitlement as she has only 153 paid contributions to her credit since entry into insurance.

      <P>It is intended to provide a full employment exchange service for the Tallaght area in the proposed new Tallaght town centre when it is developed.  It is understood that work on the development will commence early in 1984.  In the meantime pending development of the town centre the provision of a temporary employment exchange is being urgently pursued.  It had been hoped to obtain from the Department of Posts and Telegraphs premises that would be suitable for this purpose.  These premises are, however, no longer available but negotiations are at present proceeding for the acquisition of alternative premises at an early date and, provided no difficulties are encountered, it is proposed to acquire these and have them fitted out as a temporary employment exchange within 12 months.</P>

      <P>According to the records of the Department, the minimum requirements for receipt of contributory widow's pension were not met by the person concerned on either her own or her husband's insurance.  Her claim was therefore refused.</P>
      <P>She indicated when making her claim that she had been in insurable employment from 1936 to 1940.  No record of this employment could be traced and she was informed accordingly.  However, employment for this period or for a possible period of ten to 12 years prior to 1946 as referred to by the Deputy would still not qualify her for the contributory pension.  To qualify for the minimum contributory pension she would need an average of at least 24 contributions a year from the commencement of her employment up to 1980, the year before her husband's death.  Even 12 full years of contributions from 1934 to 1945 would only yield an average of 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her claim to a pension from the Department of Health and Social Security. <Col N="1356" /> Newcastle-on-Tyne, has also been examined and refused by them.  She is currently in receipt of a non-contributory widow's pension at the rate of £25.80 per week.  This is the rate appropriate to a widow under 66 years of age with no qualified children and with means between £12 and £14 per week.  Her means are derived from a holding, profit from a shop and capital.  The means are at present being reviewed by a local officer and when the investigations have been completed the person concerned will be notified of the outcome.</P>

It will be the first time since the Department were set up that a commission will examine and report on the whole system of social welfare and make recommendations to the Government on the effectiveness of the system as it has developed over the years.  The establishment of the commission will not, however, preclude any immediate improvements and reforms which might be considered necessary.</P>
      <P>There is also a commitment in the Programme for Government to initiate a national income-related pension scheme during the lifetime of the Government.

      <P>One of the items of which, by statute, account must be taken in calculating the means of an applicant for supplementary welfare allowance is the value of benefit or privilege enjoyed by him.  In the case of the persons in the category referred to in the question this item normally consists of free board and lodging.  The annual value is assessed having regard to the circumstances and standard of living of the household and for this purpose it is necessary to have evidence of the parents' income.  The assessment of the value of benefit or privilege in this manner achieves a degree of equity as between the children of affluent parents and those whose parents are in less fortunate circumstances.  The procedure is not, therefore, considered to be discriminatory or inappropriate.</P>

      <P>An instruction dated 14 December 1982 concerning extra transport facilities from Drummond to Mountmellick was received from the Office of the Minister of State for Education in the School Transport Section of the Department of Education on 15 December 1982.  The provision of extra transport facilities was not possible at that time.  As previously explained to the Deputy, the transport scheme does not permit, nor is there the necessary financial authority for, additional State expenditure on the provision of extra transport in the particular circumstances. In addition, the implications of the provision of extra transport from the Clonaslee area on the future of Clonaslee <Col N="1382" /> post-primary centre had to be considered.</P>
      <P>My Department have been advised that to date no contributions have been refunded to children in the Drummond area.</P>
