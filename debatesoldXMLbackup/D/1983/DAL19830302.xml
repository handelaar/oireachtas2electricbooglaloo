      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach if it will be possible for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to give some report to the Dáil of what seems to be a very important meeting of Foreign Ministers by way of statement to the House or perhaps circulating a communiqué to us.  I would be particularly anxious to have a report on the discussions on the Genscher Colombo proposals.</P>

      <P>I have no notice of that, but it can be considered through the Whips.  I would point out that it has not been the practice for statements to be made at meetings of Foreign Ministers' councils but only at meetings of the European Council.  The matters discussed at this meeting were preliminary to the European Council and I will, of course, be making a statement to the House after the European Council.</P>

I want to suggest to the Taoiseach that this seems from press reports to have been a particularly important meeting and the Genscher Colombo proposals are of very considerable significance to us.  I understand that this is leading now to a European Act or a solemn declaration, and I think it is important that we should have as full information as possible about it.</P>
      <P>I would like to raise another point.  I ask the Taoiseach in regard to item No. 7, which we will be resuming today, if there is any announcement yet by the Government or the Minister about an alternative form of wording or are we still proceeding with this legislation on the basis of the existing wording?</P>

      <P>I would like to place on record my objection to the manner in which these EEC seats are being used virtually in a game of musical chairs by the Labour Party.  The whole system which has developed in this State of replacing Irish members of the European Parliament is most unsatisfactory.  It is bringing the whole matter of the acceptability of the EEC into question with people in this State.  The two people being proposed in this instance did not at any time present themselves for election to the EEC.  Both of them have on a number of occasions presented themselves for election to this parliament and failed.  I would ask the Minister for the Environment to give an undertaking to this House that these two persons will remain as members of the European Parliament for the full term.  Failing that, can <Col N="1455" /> we expect resignations in six months time in order to provide a handy spot for two more members of the Labour Party?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We do not propose to object to these two nominations and we are relieved to see that at least on this occasion the question of the dual mandate is not involved.  The persons proposed are not Members of the Dáil, although one is a Member of the Seanad. While we are not opposing the appointments, it is necessary to draw attention to the fact that the Labour Party in this area do not behave with a great deal of responsibility and I feel that this constant changing of their members in the European Parliament is not reflecting credit on this country in that institution.  I would hope that this is the last of these party political manoeuvres that we will see.</P>
      <P>I do not complain at all about the quality of the two members now selected. They are experienced in our political life and in public affairs generally and I would not like to be taken as casting any aspersions whatever on their qualities or qualifications for membership of the European Parliament.  However, from the point of view of the dignity of our political life here and our standing in the European Parliament it is time, as Deputy De Rossa rightly said, that this musical chairs type of operation should cease.  Having said that, we will not object to these appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="The Tánaiste Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>The Tánaiste</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition and Deputy De Rossa, membership of the national Legislature and the European Parliament is allowable under Community law.  Any questions arising in relation to the dual mandate will best be dealt with by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities, which include the matter of dual membership of the Dáil or Seanad and the European Assembly within their terms of reference.  The Joint Committee have already touched on aspects of the dual mandate and the overall relationship between the Oireachtas and the European Assembly.  A motion of expediency <Col N="1456" /> to both Houses of the Oireachtas to establish this Joint Committee is on the Order Paper of both Houses and will be moved shortly.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition has no personal objection to either member being nominated this morning and I am confident they will both do us justice in the European Assembly.  As the European Parliament will run its term to 1984, I am also satisfied that both members will retain their membership to that date and will represent both the Labour Party and our country satisfactorily and with pride.  I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the courtesy of allowing these motions to be put through this morning.</P>

    <Title>Land Bond Bill, 1983: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this short Bill is to raise the limit on the amount of land bonds which may be created to pay for lands acquired by the Land Commission.  The bonds are created by the Minister for Finance by way of Land Bond orders <Col N="1457" /> which fix the rate of interest to be borne by each particular series of bonds.  The orders are normally made on an annual basis to meet the Land Commission's requirements for the year.  The last order, made on 29 January 1982, brought the total amount of bonds to the present statutory limit of £105 million.  Accordingly, statutory authority is now required for the creation of additional land bonds and the proposal is to raise the limit from £105 million to £130 million.</P>
    <P>I should say that the present Bill is purely an enabling measure.  The actual amount of bonds that will be created from time to time will be settled by the Minister for Finance having regard to the amount of land that is in the process of being acquired and the cost of it.  The additional £25 million provided for in the Bill represents an estimate of what is likely to be required for the commitments that will have to be met during the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>The amount of land being acquired by the Land Commission for relief of congestion has been declining in the recent years.  This is due to several factors. First of all, there are now few large estates suitable for acquisition left in the country.  Secondly, the high prices of land that have prevailed for some time past limit the amount of land that can be acquired.  Additionally, the high prices mean that most of the land acquired must be re-allocated at well below its original cost.  The loss on re-allocation represents a subsidy by the State &mdash; in many cases a very substantial subsidy &mdash; to the allottees. Land acquisition is also surrounded by a complex of legal constraints that slow down the whole acquisition process. For these reasons it is unlikely that the traditional Land Commission activity of acquiring land for redistribution to smallholders can make any dramatic impact on our land structure problems in the future.  Indeed, I think it is fair to say that there is now a fairly general consensus that a land policy based solely or mainly on the traditional activity is not really appropriate to the agricultural industry of the present day.</P>
    <P>There has been widespread discussion and much has been written over the last <Col N="1458" /> decade or so about our land structure problems.  The last piece of legislation relating specifically to these problems was the Land Act of 1965.  Agriculture has changed greatly in many respects since that Act was passed.  Our accession to the EEC has, of course, contributed more than anything else to the changes that have occurred.  However, the more some things change, the more others remain the same, and certainly our land structural situation is not improving as rapidly as we would like to see it.</P>
    <P>This concern about the slow rate of change has led to some demands for new legislation with new policies.  Some changes in policy are clearly required and it may be necessary to enact fresh legislation to put many of them into effect. However, experience has shown &mdash; indeed the 1965 Act itself would show it &mdash; that the mere passing of a new Act will, on its own, achieve little.  The most fundamental change needed is a change of attitudes to the ownership of land and to land problems generally, a willingness to see land as a scarce and valuable resource that we can ill afford to see lying idle or under utilised on any wide scale. Too much of our land is not being used productively and it seems to me that the first objective of any new land policy must be to promote the most efficient use of land.  Indeed, all the studies and reports of recent times on the subject of land structure have agreed that this has to be the priority objective.  What is much more difficult to get consensus on is how precisely the objective is best pursued.  It is argued that a greater degree of land mobility is a necessary first step.  The fact that our land tenure system is solely an owner-occupier one obviously curtails mobility.  The ideas advanced for tackling this particular difficulty include the promotion of longer term leasing, earlier inheritance, the development of arrangements for the gradual transfer of management of the farm to the succeeding generation by partnership agreements, and greater encouragement for elderly farmers to retire.</P>
    <P>I propose to give careful thought to these matters.  I am conscious that structural change is of its nature a slow process <Col N="1459" /> and it is best to hasten slowly in deciding finally on what new direction policies might take.  My primary aim will be to see how best the State can assist in the creation of conditions under which land will be, as far as possible, directed towards those who are likely to make the best use of it.</P>
    <P>I have made these general comments so as to let the House know that the presentation of this Land Bond Bill should not be taken as representing any commitment by the present Government just to continuing existing land policies as they are.  Policy changes are necessary but their formulation and direction will require calm and careful thought.  In the meantime, funds are required to enable the Land Commission to carry through the acquisitions they have on hands at present and those that will fall for completion over the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>I therefore commend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I would like to congratulate Deputy Connaughton on his appointment as Minister of State.  As this is my first opportunity of doing so I would like to wish him well for as long as he will be in that Department. Naturally this side of the House hope it will be as short as possible.  Nevertheless, for the period he is there I wish him well. We welcome this Land Bond Bill.  It is to a certain extent enabling legislation to increase the amount of land bonds to be made available to the Land Commission to purchase more land.  The major problem affecting the Land Commission at the moment is a shortage of cash.  While I welcome this Bill I feel it is only a short term process because the greatest problem facing the Land Commission at the moment is a shortage of the necessary finance.</P>
      <P>I feel the Land Commission should be restructured and that the legislation to change the structure of the Land Commission should be introduced as soon as possible.  As the Minister of State pointed out this morning:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most fundamental change <Col N="1460" /> needed is a change of attitudes to the ownership of land and to land problems generally, willingness to see land as a scarce and valuable resource that we can ill afford to see lying idle or under utilised on any wide scale.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the proposals by the Minister outlined in his statement to <i>The Farmers Journal</i> of 25 February.  On reading through the points made I cannot but think back on the White Paper our party issued and the major policy changes outlined by the Minister in <i>The Farmers Journal</i> are more or less the same policy changes we outlined a number of years ago.  Unfortunately, due to the number of general elections we have had over the last two years, it was not possible to implement this legislation.</P>
    <P>I hope the Government will allow the Minister to implement the legislation, which is so necessary at the moment, for land reform.  As the Minister of State rightly stated the question of land reform, and the mobility of land particularly, is very important.  I would like to refer to <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> where it is stated that the high price of land adds to the problem of acquiring estates today.  The Minister of State outlined that in his statement this morning.  <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> states that the Land Commission is obliged to buy land at the market price, and, therefore, as long as prices and interest rates remain high the annuities required to recover the cost of the land will be beyond what any normal farming activity can carry.  This is correct but at the same time I wonder what is the policy of the Government with regard to land mobility when one considers their decision to suspend the proposals which our Government had to make funds available at low interest rates through the EEC scheme.</P>
    <P>We can talk about land being made available and the price of land but ways and means must be available to counter that problem.  If there is a willingness by the Government to counter that problem there must also be a way.  I know the Minister of State is sincere and is conscious of the very great problems which affect the Land Commission today, <Col N="1461" /> particularly in making land available to young people, I hope that he, through the Minister for Agriculture at the Cabinet table, will see that legislation is introduced irrespective of whose ideas and whose thoughts they are.  The important thing at the moment is to make land available at a reasonable price so that it can be given to young people and those who want to make a career in agriculture.</P>
    <P>We know that the budget for the Land Commission in the region of £15 million is inadequate.  Land is on offer at the present time but it cannot be purchased by the Land Commission because of the lack of the necessary finance.  If we are to restore confidence in agriculture this can be done by making land available at a reasonable price.  The only way of making this land available is through the Land Commission.  The name of the Land Commission may be changed but it is basically the only hope in the years ahead of making this land available.  When we consider at the moment the uncertainty in farming, that a farmer may not have either the courage or the capacity to purchase land or indeed to increase his holding, we should ensure that where small parcels of land become available they are distributed only through the Land Commission. Another aspect in which the Land Commission must be involved is in relation to larger estates because only the commission are in a position to purchase these lands but one would hope that the machinery for this process would be speeded up.  There is the question also of the consolidation of holdings and in this respect, too, the Land Commission can play a useful role.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for expanding on his views in respect of the distribution and mobility of land.  In regard to young people going into farming from scratch, the involvement of the Land Commission is vital in terms of the making available of land.</P>
    <P>We should aim at bringing about a situation in which all land that is under-utilised is made available by way of a long-term leasing system.  Land has been always an emotive subject in Ireland, but failure to utilise it fully can result in <Col N="1462" /> many social problems expecially in the area of ownership.  Therefore, I look forward to the Government introducing leasing arrangements in respect of land that is under utilised.  Any such arrangements must be encouraged and promoted by the Department and by the commission.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the Farm Retirement Scheme has been suspended by this Government.  This is a step in the wrong direction and is not in keeping with the Minister's peoposals as outlined in <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> to which I have referred.  We all know that this scheme has not been a success but that may have been due to the lack of incentive necessary to encourage farmers to retire.  However, the suspension of the scheme is hardly the answer and I am surprised that the Government should take such a step. In an effort to save money they have seen fit to launch this attack on the farming community.</P>
    <P>There was a problem in respect of eligibility for non-contributory old age pensions for farmers who retired under the scheme, in that they often were disqualified on the basis of a means test as a result of payment that had been made to them from the Land Commission or of payments being received under the scheme.  Perhaps if we dealt with that problem more farmers would be encouraged to retire thereby making land available to younger and perhaps more ambitious farmers.</P>
    <P>I hope, too, that the Land Commission or the new land agency will have a role to play in the area of the group purchase of land.  The commission can be the source through which the land is purchased and distributed with the least possible delay.  In addition, when an estate is put on the market local farmers can make the Land Commission aware of how much each of them is in a position to contribute.  This system would help to reduce the time that elapses between the purchase of land by the commission and its allocation afterwards.  While recognising that very often there are legal constraints caused by such problems as title <Col N="1463" /> and so on, this procedure must be speeded up.</P>
    <P>I also ask the Minister to consider under this new land agency that in cases where the land is purchased by a group of farmers and divided by the Land Commission there should be a waiving of the fee for registration.  This would improve the mobility and redistribution of land to younger farmers.  At present the Land Commission use a farm size of 40 to 45 acres, but I hope that the new land agency will not stick rigidly to a farm size.  They may consider a farm size of 40 to 45 acres a viable holding but any agriculturalist today would not agree with that.  Farm size should be flexible in order to suit normal local conditions.</P>
    <P>I have already referred to revamping the farmers' retirement scheme and to negotiations with the Department of Social Welfare in relation to legislation concerning the means test.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of one farmer selling to another qualified farmer under 35 years of age.  Where this younger farmer has completed in an agricultural college one of the EEC courses such as that under Directive 161, the possibility of exemption from stamp duty should be considered to encourage full utilisation of our land, which is a very scarce resource.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have problems. I hope that the Minister and the Government have the will and the courage to tackle these problems and from this side of the House I assure them of our wholehearted support.  If we do not agree with certain aspects of Government policy we will criticise them &mdash; I hope constructively. I look for a commitment on the part of the Government, although from what I have seen happening over the past few weeks I doubt if there is that commitment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Firstly, I congratulate Deputy Connaughton on his appointment as Minister of State and Deputy Noonan on his new appointment as Opposition spokesman for the main Opposition party on agriculture.  I am not sure that what I have here is the Minister <Col N="1464" /> of State's own script.  Coming from the west of Ireland the Minister, Deputy Connaughton, is acutely aware of the problems surrounding the Land Commission on an emotional issue &mdash; the distribution of land.  That has been the case since the Land Commission were founded over a half a century ago.  The policies pursued by the Land Commission in many of our rural parishes have divided families for generations over small portions of land which might or might not have any real agricultural value.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connaughton comes from the same constituency as one of our first Ministers for Agriculture, Deputy Hogan, and is only too well aware of the enormous complications and divisions which can be caused in discussing land distribution policy.  Approximately 1.5 million acres have been acquired in the last half century by the Land Commission, most of this being distributed to various farmers.</P>
      <P>The phrase &ldquo;the more things change, the more they are the same&rdquo; is included in the Minister's script and he is quite right about that.  I have heard various discussions on land bond Bills in this House over the last eight years and things do change and they are the same.  When the people now on the Opposition side were on the Government side they defended the acquisition of land by land bonds and we in Opposition had to make our case for the abolition of land bonds as a means of securing land for distribution. The interdepartmental committee set up on land policy some years ago reported, at paragraph 11.5:</P>
      <P>We are of the opinion that the use of Land Bonds as a payment medium for lands purchased or acquired for land structural reform purposes is no langer justified and should be discontinued.</P>
      <P>The committee went on to describe land bonds in a reasonably fair fashion as follows:</P>
      <P>Land Bonds amount to a forced loan without guarantee of repayment date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a simple fact of life that anyone in <Col N="1465" /> rural Ireland wishing to dispose of land does so on the basis of receiving cash in return.  It is not an easy thing for any Land Commission official to tell a farmer who has held on to land for many years that all he will receive in return for giving the land to the Land Commission is a bundle of papers which might mean nothing to him, even though the interest rates on land bonds in recent times have held up reasonably well.  However, there have been cases where former issues of land bonds at different rates have not held their value when being disposed of on the market, which caused an amount of confusion and resentment among those who had to dispose of land in that way.</P>
    <P>The question inherent in the Minister's speech when referring to changes in land policy must be the abolition or non-abolition of the Land Commission.  Has it outlived its usefulness?  Is there still an effective role for it with regard to distribution of our land?  Can its powers of acquisition and distribution and the criteria used for distributing land be changed to make it a more effective, more presentable and more attractive body, in so far as our farmers are concerned? The reports one hears from many small farmers of Land Commission activities are not what they should be. The method of disposal and acquisition of land down through the years has not been as attractive as it should be to farmers. Less than .3 per cent of the land sold is disposed of in the market place.  Land is normally sold privately or by auctioneers and the amount of land going before the Land Commission for acquisition and division, with the genuine consent of the farmer in question, is minimal indeed.</P>
    <P>When the Minister sets out to implement changes in land policy, coming as he does from a province where these problems are very prevalent, he should set about it in a very workmanlike fashion, as I am sure he will, by calling in various authorities, the various interested groups and organisations, in an effort to do something effective about these problems that have gone on for so long, and a range of other related problems <Col N="1466" /> have been raised by his speech today.</P>
    <P>One of those concerns the division of commonages which in the west of Ireland is a rather pressing problem.  Hundreds of thousands of acres have been held in common for years.  There is a move among farmers to have these commonages divided among them either under the western package scheme or some related scheme so that they could fence off appropriate areas and use them for better agricultural purposes.  Inherent in the law at present is the problem of objections by one or more of the commonage tenants and this has been making it practically impossible legally for the Land Commission to divide the commonages. They can only do it with full consent of all the tenants.</P>
    <P>A serious problem relates to the division of commonages, because a farmer with a share in a commonage, whose herd go down as a result of a disease and are then locked up, has an escape alley, to put his herd out on the commonage in which he has a share.  The herd would be free-range to mix with other cattle, thereby spreading the disease.  I raised this question some years ago in the House with the former Minister, Deputy Gibbons. He agreed on that point and said that some effective work would be put into that aspect of commonage division and of restructure.</P>
    <P>There is a genuine feeling among farmers that they should be able to acquire at least a special portion of these commonages to be divided among themselves.  It should be looked at seriously by the Minister under the terms of the western package. The present position is unsatisfactory because when one makes a case to the Land Commission or to the Department for division of commonages, when consent has not been given by all of the tenants one does not make any progress whatever and that causes a lot of resentment among other things.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also pay attention to the matter of extra turbary or bog plots from the point of view of the Land Commission. With increased fuel costs in recent years there has been an increasing demand for native resources.  Thousands <Col N="1467" /> of people are now willing to cut turf either by machine or by hand if they had access to bog plots.  Undoubtedly many thousands of acres of bog could be acquired which is now either in the hands of the Land Commission, in commonage holdings and in some cases held by the Forestry Department.  Such areas could be acquired and road systems could be put into them at reasonable cost under the EEC package.  The bogs could be let out to tenants who are only too willing to use them to the maximum advantage.</P>
    <P>The Minister should be concerned that in recent years along the west coast there has been an enormous increase in the amount of property being acquired by non-nationals.  This should be looked at seriously by the Department.  From Donegal to Cork the incidence of ownership of land, either in small parcels or in reasonably large areas, by people from outside the country is on the increase all the time.  The Minister should look at the system of acquisition.  It is unfair to smaller farmers who have never had the financial means to acquire that land, farmers who could not acquire it except through the agency or the Land Commission, that they should have to remain stunted in their agricultural output or potential because somebody from abroad can walk into a place and acquire it after the appropriate sanction has been issued.</P>
    <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister's reply in relation to the criteria that are used and will be used in any modified restructuring of the Land Commission in regard to the allocation and the allotting of land to tenants.  Many people living on small holdings &mdash; there are 63,000 holdings of land of less than 40 acres of which approximately 42,000 would be in Connacht which are not viable &mdash; find it is not easy for farmers to attempt to make a living on a farm of that size.  Down through the years the emigration valve to Britain and the US always relieved the pressure on smaller holdings in the west. Many people have been sustained by the continuous stream of money from abroad, from Britain or the US.  It helped those families to rear the remaining children <Col N="1468" /> and to make some effort to eke a decent living out of the land.</P>
    <P>Those people who have the initiative or were fortunate enough to go out to get jobs for themselves often found themselves out of luck in relation to land allocation when the Land Commission came to divide an acquired estate in a district. I should like the Minister to give a clearer explanation on whether a person with a part-time job is entitled under any modification of the Land Commission Acts to be given an allocation of land when division would occur.  People with jobs have the potential to plough that money back into any holding they might get and make the land a little more productive than it had been.  The argument against that, of course, is that the person who has not been lucky enough to have acquired a job and who would have to resort to unemployment assistance does not have the same means of ploughing money back into a holding of land.</P>
    <P>That raises the vexed question of unemployment assistance or farmers' dole in western Ireland.  A recent announcement in the budget stated that the PLV system has been determined to be unconstitutional for the first time, on appeal to the Supreme Court.  No increased payments were made to smallholders who had been drawing farmers' dole.  Various attempts were made during the years to do something about this, to have the system linked either to productivity or to get some return for the money being paid out.  The system of following through on farmers' dole payments and assessments made on people who seek the dole is very complicated and takes a long time to sort out.  Farmers' sons aged over 18 years who intend to draw unemployment assistance, or farmers' dole, find themselves assessed for board and lodgings if they stay at home, and the amount of money they will qualify for is only a pittance.  When money is paid out at that level &mdash; the amount of money paid out in recent years has been increased enormously &mdash; the Minister should look seriously at the return given for that.  The Minister might look at and develop a system in any parish in rural Ireland where there are some portions of ground <Col N="1469" /> not being worked as they should be. There are hundreds of thousands of acres of land lying fallow.  Land is our most potentially productive resource and, through the co-op or some other system, something could be done to improve the potential output of much of such land.</P>
    <P>One could take a typical rural parish and note all of the people drawing farmers' dole in such a parish.  One could ask the people of the parish to look to see how there could be greater production from the land &mdash; I speak in terms of the number of fences that have to be repaired, the number of gates to be hung, the number of acres to be cleared of scrub, bushes and so on.  The Department could provide a service for such farmers. ACOT will lay out the various plans that must be undertaken for the development of an individual farm, whether by way of drainage, land reclamation, reseeding or whatever.  If that plan were undertaken in respect of each parish, farmers drawing dole in any of those parishes would be only too willing to give some assistance towards its implementation because it would be in their interest.  Also it would give people a sense of pride in what they were doing rather than continuously signing on the line and being handed money for nothing.  The farmers who at present draw such dole money would see the value of having the potential productivity of their land increased with help from other farmers and from Government agencies.  There would be an intrinsic value for everybody concerned as a result of increased productivity from the land. That is merely an idea from which endless conclusions can be drawn.  I would ask the Minister to examine that matter within his Department, to discuss it with the relevant authorities, examine the various options open to him in regard to improving the productivity of our land.</P>
    <P>One might well ask: what will the Minister do with these £25 million extra in land bonds?  The value of land has fallen in recent years.  For example, if he were to acquire land at £1,000 per acre, he would acquire approximately 25,000 acres; if he were to acquire land at £2,000 an acre he would acquire approximately 12,500 acres.  Therefore we can assume <Col N="1470" /> that, on average, this £25 million in land bonds should acquire approximately 10,000 acres of land.  That is not the amount of the land the Land Commission should be acquiring in a year; they should be acquiring much more than that.  The section 40 notice is issued for land acquisition initially.  Then the process continues until eventually the land is vested in the Land Commission.  Perhaps the Minister in replying would indicate how many thousands of acres are in the pipeline for division, that is the amount of land in respect of which section 40 notices have been served but which have not yet been vested in the Land Commission.  That would give us some indication of how much work must be undertaken by the Land Commission in the distribution and/or allocation of that land.</P>
    <P>The fact that land bonds have not held their value on disposal in many cases over the years has led to a strong reaction on the part of people who have had to give up land under that system.  I know the Government answer always has been that it would require massive borrowing in order to facilitate farmers by way of cash in return for the acquisition of their land. Certainly it would be much more attractive to farmers to do it that way.  However, I know that the financial constraints imposed on the Department and indeed the Government at present will limit that possibility in the foreseeable future.  But it is a matter that must be faced up to.  If the Department and the Land Commission want to render the latter an attractive body for the disposal of land, then they must give farmers cash for their land, allowing them to dispose of it as they wish afterwards.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned the farmers retirement scheme.  I think less than 600 farmers have availed of that scheme since its inception.  Deputy Noonan was quite right when he said that this scheme has not been successful.  Indeed it should either be abolished or reintroduced in a new form, making it more attractive to farmers.  One aspect of that scheme has been that a farmer could not give the land to his son under the scheme as it operates at present whereas his counterpart in some other European countries can do so.  The Minister should ensure that that <Col N="1471" /> scheme is either totally revamped or introduce some alternative, making it much more attractive for people to dispose of their land.</P>
    <P>The amount of land lying fallow at present does the country no credit.  We have the potential in our soil to greatly increase productivity.  We have also the possibility, by way of the various EEC schemes obtaining, to ensure that land at present not in productive use can be brought into some semblance of production. The channelling of those moneys through to the soil rather than having it wasted in administration and bureaucracy, either through the EEC or the various agencies of the Department, must also be examined by the Minister.  There is no point in having £300 million available for the development of ten counties if a minute proportion only finds its way into actively promoting the productivity of the land for which it was intended initially, resulting in an increase in income to the farmers concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his new role. Certainly he has a complex problem on hand with regard to the Land Commission. Various Deputies on this side of the House over the years have spoken about the matter of land bonds, about the Land Commission and what they considered should be done about them.  The Land Report has been produced.  I am not aware that the headings of the relevant Bill have been drafted.  That may take some considerable time.  The various agencies involved will have to discuss those headings before anything else is done.</P>
    <P>I want to pay the Minister's Department a tribute and thank them for the special allocation made, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, in respect of Ballinafad Agricultural College in my county which I trust will prove of great benefit in the years to come.  The ideas inherent in the type of development envisaged there, through the co-operative system, with the assistance of various other organisations, will create a new era in so far as agricultural colleges are concerned.  I want to compliment the Minister on having seen to it that that will be allowed continue.</P>
    <Col N="1472" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, on his appointment.  Indeed I congratulate him as a fellow Galwayman and neighbour.  I wish him much success in his Department.</P>
      <P>Having said that I must be somewhat critical of what he has said.  I am somewhat disappointed that the Minister has not given us more information on what will be future land policy.  After an interview he gave, which appeared in an article in the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> of 26 February, in which he said that there would be no more reports, no more review bodies, no more study groups, I am amazed that he said this morning we must hasten slowly, giving calm and careful thought to our future land policies.  I understood from that interview that there was sufficient information available, that there was general agreement on the kind of reform necessary in regard to our land policies and that we would shortly have a new land policy.  Indeed in my time in this House we have had three former Ministers make the statement that they were introducing the last Land Bond Bill.</P>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister does not want to fall into that trap.  I thought he was going to say this morning that this was the last Land Bond Bill but he did not say that. Neither did he say what will be future land policies.  I hope he will give us some information in that respect very quickly. We produced a Government White Paper which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas in December 1980. Indeed in that interview which the Minister of State gave the <i>Farmers' Journal</i> he made some suggestions when outlining his proposals.  Deputy Kenny posed a very important question as to exactly how many acres will be acquired by these £25 million.  I hope the Minister will reply to that question.  Indeed I should like to know also what rate of interest will be borne by this series of land bonds.  I hope the Minister will be able to tell us that soon, if not today.  In the past possibly people were robbed by land bonds, and the high interest rates also meant that people receiving land had to pay very high annuities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what I have said the Minister <Col N="1473" /> knows I have reservations generally about land bonds.  I welcome this Bill for one reason in particular, that is, that it might help to relieve congestion in the western counties.  The Land Commission should concentrate on trying to relieve congestion there.  In the past the policy of the Land Commission &mdash; and I am sure it is the same at present &mdash; was to try to enlarge holdings to a viable standard.  We are told that is around the 45-acre mark. In the west of Ireland the smaller farmers always looked to the Land Commission for additional land.  The only way I can see them getting that type of land is through acquisition and distribution by the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>At present the Land Commission are not acquiring as much land as they did in the past.  I want to refer to a question put down to the Minister by Deputy Molloy for answer on 15 February.  In his reply the Minister said that the initiation of proceedings for the acquisition of further properties is necessarily curtailed because of the Exchequer situation. What is the position where an estate is for sale and the Land Commission will not acquire it because of a shortage of money?  Smaller farmers cannot purchase that land.  The Minister should not leave the farming community in a Catch 22 situation in which they are helpless.  I hope this money will go towards acquiring that type of land in the west in particular.</P>
    <P>I could not agree that large estates are not available for acquisition.  Some have been available for sale and are suitable for acquisition by the Land Commission in my own constituency, but this has not happened.  Something like 60 per cent of our farmers have under 50 acres, and 35 per cent under 30 acres.  That is mostly in the Connaught and Munster provinces. I welcome this Bill and I hope the Land Commission will proceed immediately to acquire suitable land.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan and Deputy Kenny referred to the farm retirement scheme. I hope the Minister will consider re-introducing this scheme.  It is curtailed at the moment.  I hope we will get greater subventions from the EEC to increase pensions and cash premiums.  This would <Col N="1474" /> make the scheme more attractive.  It is very disturbing that this scheme has not been a success.  I hope the Minister will take note of that.  In reply to that parliamentary question the Minister said the land pool is reducing.  Many Deputies are concerned about the fact that the land in the possession of the Land Commission is not divided quickly enough.  When it comes to dividing the land it is usually in bad condition and of poor quality.  I hope the Minister will look at the possibility of dividing land much more speedily.</P>
    <P>The retirement scheme of which only 600 farmers availed released only 22,000 acres of land.  This land is supposed to go to potential development farmers.  In many cases this does not happen.  It might be as well if it went into the general pool because, in the western areas in particular, it is not easy to find many potential development farmers.  If we had a proper farm retirement scheme with improved pensions and cash premiums, more land would become available.  I agree with the Minister that we are talking about the mobility of land and the transfer of land. That is a most important aspect.</P>
    <P>The fact that in the west we have undersized farms and fragmented holdings makes it clear to me that the Land Commission should make a determined effort to solve the congestion problem. To do that the Land Commission should continue to acquire land and allot it as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>We did not hear anything from the Minister &mdash; I thought we would &mdash; about measures to stop non-farmers and non-nationals buying land.  It was a very wise suggestion in the Government's land policy paper that a surcharge or a premium should be imposed on non-farmers, or farmers with big holdings, or persons who are not dependent on farming for their livelihood.  The surcharge or premium mentioned referred to specified land valuations. The whole land valuation question will have to be looked at in view of the recent High Court decision.  The Land Commission are well able to adjust farmers' holdings to the good acres they have.  Instead of a valuation system they could use adjusted acreage as the basis for the sale of land.  It is most important <Col N="1475" /> that the Land Commission should monitor these sales and be able to give or refuse consent when a purchase like this is attempted by a non-farmer or a non-national.</P>
    <P>I always felt it would be better to purchase land for cash rather than land bonds.  One of the features of the farm retirement scheme was that land could be purchased for cash.  I realise this would involve making more money available and, as Deputy Noonan said, the Land Commission are short of money at the moment.  People have felt, and rightly so, that in general land bonds have been unacceptable.  I hope the Minister will look at the possibility of getting more money to provide cash to replace land bonds.</P>
    <P>Commonages are a particular feature of the west of Ireland.  I read in the land policy white paper that something like one million acres of land are held in commonages. I hope the Minister will make a determined effort with the Land Commission to get those commonages divided.  They would be a very useful addition to farmers living in congested areas.  I support Deputy Kenny's point that all steps be taken to prevent diseases on commonages.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have been in existence for 100 years.  They have done very good work in transferring land and also in transferring farmers from the west of Ireland to the better land in the midlands. I think their main concern should be to relieve congestion and I hope they will make a determined effort in this matter, particularly along the western seaboard. Land in the possession of the Land Commission could be used to help ventures such as the Tuam Sugar Company who have been looking for a greater acreage of beet.  As the Minister knows, last year was one of their best years and I hope they will have even better years in the future.  The Land Commission could help by making land available and thus encourage more beet growing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill in so far as it will help to relieve congestion.  I hope the Minister will reply to some of the points <Col N="1476" /> I made and to the questions we asked.  I hope that he will tell us very shortly that a new land policy will be announced by him and that that policy will implement many of the suggestions in this White Paper.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>The influence of Michael Davitt is still very strong with regard to land.  The House has listened to three speakers from the west of Ireland and presumably Deputy Noonan will contribute also.  We have had one Deputy from Mayo and two Deputies from Galway contributing this morning.  This brings home the importance of land and the depth of feeling that exists about it. Smallholdings and family farms are dear to the people of Ireland and this morning the House has reflected that feeling.</P>
      <P>In past centuries many people dreamt of setting up an Irish Land Commission. We might ask the question, if some of the famous people of the past who made such noble sacrifices for the country would be satisfied with the work of the Land Commission. I should think that many of them would have been satisfied with the good work done by the commission.  Various Ministers for Agriculture and the people in the Land Commission have done valuable work during the years and countless farmers would have had to go to Liverpool, London, Manchester, New York and Australia were it not for the work of the commission.</P>
      <P>At times the staff in the Land Commission may be regarded as faceless men. If Solomon himself were asked to divide estates I am sure he would have made many mistakes and blunders.  The Land Commission are no wiser than Solomon. They have made many mistakes and blunders but overall they have done excellent work.  We should proceed very slowly in phasing out the Land Commission. As an Irishman in an Irish Parliament I am saddened that the commission are being slowly but surely phased out. During the years they have helped thousands of farmers who were living at starvation level, whose existence was meagre and who were struggling to survive.</P>

      <P>The Land Commission succeeded in raising their incomes. During the past few years there has been a change of emphasis with regard to the Land Commission and there has been a gradual slowing down of their operations and financing.  This is regrettable.  Nowadays people seem to think that if improvements are to be carried out there must be major changes overall.  The attitude is that there must be a major leap into the dark to achieve any goal but in nine out of ten cases what happens is that we are left in an even darker condition.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission needs overhauling and it is necessary that changes be made.  That can be done.  This morning the Minister spoke about land reform and land policy and on a recent radio interview Deputy Noonan also spoke about these items.  Every Minister for Agriculture and shadow spokesman talk about land policy and all the parties have their views on this matter.  When a Minister is appointed to this post we are told that further study is required, that the matter will be given deep consideration, that special study groups or interdepartmental committees will be set up.  All this waffle is a recipe for inaction.  Let there be a positive approach to try to improve the Land Commission and the structures which are in existence.  If there is a positive effort made there could be genuine improvement and the Land Commission could be modernised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appreciate that there is a problem in relation to finance.  If the Land Commission is phased out we will have huge farms and estates with high walls all round them.  We had many of these in different counties in the past but they are now family farms being worked by local farmers. Instead of foreign people owning our land we now have Irish people with estates of 500 acres or 1,000 acres.  This is of no benefit to the country.  We hear many different statistics from An Foras Talúntais, the Central Bank and so on and there are many different comments <Col N="1478" /> made about farm incomes.  However, small and medium sized farms are the most efficient.  The people who work these farms are better farmers than those with 300 and 500 acre farms.  The small intensive farmers who, in most cases, the Land Commission helped, are the people who make our agriculture tick over.  If the Land Commission is phased out they will not be given any opportunity to improve their farms.  I earnestly request the Minister not to phase out the Land Commission.</P>
    <P>Many farmers have sad and bitter memories of purchasing land and now finding they cannot meet interest repayments. They have serious problems and are in severe financial difficulty.  There is little sympathy for many of these people. Part of the reason is because many speculators purchased land and fired money away.  They shoved up the price of land and because of that little effort is made to help them out of their difficulty.</P>
    <P>The Minister is very interested in the group approach, where a group of farmers come to the Land Commission and express their interest in purchasing some farm near them.  The Minister has extended every facility to them and I congratulate him on his approach.  The Land Commission have helped in the division of land, securing title and with the provision of rights of way and so on. This is to be recommended and encouraged. I have discussed a situation with the Minister where a group of farmers interested in purchasing a farm are able to put up quite a sizeable proportion of the purchase price.  They want the Land Commission to pay the remainder and spread it on annuity basis over 20 or 30 year period.  There would be a sizeable capital input by the farmers concerned in the purchase of the estate.  I have made representations to the Minister about this and he knows the estate which is involved.  If people are prepared to use their own savings and cash this would be of benefit to the country.  Many estates have been divided entirely on an annuity basis without a cash contribution from the people concerned.  I strongly urge the Minister to consider this suggestion as it would be a positive recommendation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1479" /> The Minister, Deputies Noonan and Kitt made many references to the farm retirement scheme.  As far as I can remember, it was Deputy Nealon who said it was not a success.  The Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Fitzpatrick, was one of the people involved with this scheme. Each Minister for Agriculture had an input into it.  Lack of finance interfered with the scheme.  It is a understatement to say &ldquo;it was not a success&rdquo;.  It was one of the most dismal failures of any scheme I have ever seen.  While there was a good intention behind this scheme it was a complete disaster.  We were fooling ourselves with the scheme.  People handed over estates but some of the pensions were mere pittances and the premiums paid were very small.  The scheme might have worked if a farmer had been allowed to have his pension rights brought in in conjunction with his contributory old age pension as distinct from non-contributory pensions which are means tested.  If there had been a reasoned approach to the scheme and a farmer was given credits for his contribution to agriculture which would have been regarded as coming under a contributory pension added to the farm retirement pension, the scheme might have been a success.</P>
    <P>When farmers realised they had given away their farms and that their pensions were barely in line with the non-contributory old age pension, it sounded the death knell for that scheme.  As Deputy Kitt pointed out in regard to the farm retirement scheme, it had scope and could have been worked through the pensions and cash premiums.  Even at this stage there should be a further examination of that scheme to see if it could be revitalised to make sure it would work on this occasion.  Otherwise, people will not be prepared to retire from farming and they will remain on holdings which are unproductive and, in some cases, lying fallow.  The farm retirement scheme offers some scope in this direction and I ask the Minister to have a closer look at it.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to see that there is a further £75 million provided for land bonds.  That is a sizeable contribution <Col N="1480" /> during a difficult financial period.  Let us hope there will be a further approach made by the new Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture with responsibility for the Land Commission.  The experience he has had as a farmer and a public representative in a congested area can be put to practical effect working in conjunction with his advisers.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to long term leasing.  It is an historical matter going back generations and there are practical difficulties because of our history.  It is an emotive issue and arouses strong feelings in many people when it is discussed.  At present, bogland is being leased and perhaps there will be a break in the mould which has persisted for so long with regard to leasing.  It is a very practical, positive approach and holds out great scope if the Minister and his Department can work in conjunction with Macra na Feirme, IFA and other farming bodies to develop some type of leasing body.  There must be a change from the old style leasing.</P>
    <P>With regard to earlier inheritance, I think it was Deputy John Bruton who originally introduced the removal of stamp duties for a limited period for people under 35 years of age who had done an ACOT course.  It was a tremendous assistance, even though I think the scheme closes at the end of this year.  It has encouraged more earlier transfers of family farms from fathers to sons than any other scheme of which I am aware. It has been a tremendous success and has certainly assisted in encouraging many parents to transfer their farms to their families.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Land Commission have, unfortunately, <Col N="1481" /> worked a little too much in isolation. I regret to say there has not been sufficient liaison between the Land Commission, the farm development services and the county committees of agriculture. The Minister should ensure that there is more co-operation between them and actively encourage it.  Meetings should be held between all these organisations so that they will be working in unison.</P>
    <P>I would like to take this opportunity of wishing Deputy Connaughton well on his appointment and I wish him many happy years in his Department.  I believe he will make a strong impression on it and I wish him every success.  Deputy Noonan is the spokesman for agriculture on the other side and I also wish him every success as I know he takes an active interest in agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, especially the fact that the limit has been raised from £105 million to £130 million. Like Deputy Kenny, when I heard the Minister deliver his address this morning, I wondered could it possibly be Deputy Connaughton's own script, but I quickly concluded it was not, for two reasons: firstly because I have the pleasure of knowing the Minister quite well, having worked with him in Macra na Feirme circles and also one of his comments in particular led me to believe he did not prepare it.  He said he was conscious that structural changes, of their nature, are a slow process and that it is best to hasten slowly in deciding finally as to what direction policies might take.  I suggest that was never one of the Minister's attributes. The other reason is that the Minister gave an intensive and excellent interview to <i>The Farmers' Journal</i> on 26 February 1983.  The script today and the interview in the journal bear little resemblance to one another, and I am very disappointed at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am asking the Minister who reprimanded him.  Who changed his ideas? Was it the Minister for Finance or the officials in his Department?  I believe, and I said previously when congratulating the Minister and wishing him well, that he was excellent while in Macra na <Col N="1482" /> Feirme and he has carried all the attributes through since then.  I would like him to be his own man in his Ministry because his ideas are right.  Having said so much, I would like to put a question to him which has been put but maybe not as directly as I would put it.  How many acres does he believe this increase will buy?  Also, within what period of time will this money be used up?  Will we have new acquisitions by the Land Commission within the next year?  From many representations made to me, and I can say to all Members of the House particularly the farming Members, all over the country acquisition has almost stopped. I am most anxious to know if new acquisitions are being or will be made by the Land Commission within the next year.</P>
    <P>Everyone knows that the purpose of the Land Commission is to ensure that as far as possible every acre will be used to the best possible advantage.  Everybody here knows from listening to all the speakers this morning that that is not the case and many acres are being misused for many reasons.  Both sides of the House have been speaking for quite a while about getting rid of the Land Commission or changing it and calling it by a new name.  We have many ideas about what should be put forward by whatever agency will evolve.  I do not know what agency that might be.  I do not see any great necessity for changing the Land Commission as such, but change their ideas, attitudes and policies.  The paper this morning says rightly that changing a name does not necessarily mean that we will improve the situation.  We must improve the situation within the framework of the Land Commission as it is, as surely many improvements could be carried out.  I was disappointed with the debate this morning in that I heard very few improvements suggested.  In the main we were talking about whether we should have a new agency.  Let us improve what we have and if it is necessary to change it let us go on and change it, but in the meantime hold on to what we have and make improvements.</P>
    <P>The first improvement that I would suggest, speaking from experience of County Wexford, is in the length of time <Col N="1483" /> that the Land Commission will hold on to their pool of land before allocation, in some instances ten years.  If an estate comes on the market or a group of farmers ask the Land Commission to take over a section of land which is not being used, the Land Commission sometimes will react.  They purchase the land and then for some reason for a number of years they will let the land to various farmers around the area.  In the past few years there has been some improvement as to the selection of candidates for letting, but I am complaining most about the length of time it takes the Land Commission to decide who should get the land eventually.  In this process the fertility of the land goes down.  This is one major disastrous mistake that the Land Commission from time to time seem to ignore. When a person then is successful in getting the land it will take him three or four years to build up fertility.  All of this is a loss to the economy, and I think that this is the first mention of loss to the economy here this morning.  It is a great loss to the economy to have land not worked to its fullest advantage for those ten years, or whatever the period is.</P>
    <P>The second important point in respect of the length of time before allocation is fencing.  Fences deteriorate in that time. A farmer who has land on the conacre system for 11 months will not provide any worthwhile fencing.  He will resort to the old-fashioned way of getting a slash hook and cutting down the nearest bush to place it in the hole and the fence gets worse year by year.  This means a consequent loss to the economy.</P>
    <P>Another area where the Land Commission can be improved is in the selection of candidates for land.  This has been the bone of contention in all parts of the country.  In most instances &mdash; by that I mean more than 50 per cent and I will not go further than that &mdash; the selection of candidates by the Land Commission is probably good.  In other instances it has been nothing short of disastrous.  I want to quote one instance that came recently to my notice.  In south Wexford two people with addresses in Dublin, far removed from the farming scene, were <Col N="1484" /> chosen for parcels of land.  That might be considered all right if other personnel or candidates had not been interested, but I know of a man who for the last 20 years has rented 60 to 80 acres on conacre. Unfortunately, he does not own any land himself.  He was ruled out.  I cannot for the life of me understand why this should be the case.  Of course, we know that many farmers who got parcels of land from time to time held on to the land for a year and then made efforts to sell it or, if not to sell, to rent it.  This kind of thing is most definitely a loss to the economy. It is on such considerations that land should be allocated in the first instance.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Enright that the Land Commission should have some consultation with the advisory services.  Of course, if they have consultation with them today it will cost them £20 a time. The advisory services and the farm development service must know very well, in most instances better than most of us, which farmers are best entitled to the land or will make best use of it.  Only very recently I asked whether the farm advisers and the farm development services were consulted by the Land Commission and I was told that it occurs in very few instances.  This is terribly wrong.  It is not making use of the services which are provided for us.  Up to now, at any rate, there would not have been charges for the advisers talking to Land Commission people.  It is nothing short of stupid that the Land Commission will not consult with people who would be in a position to give very valuable information.</P>
    <P>The concept of viable holdings is something that we must look at again.  A viable holding is rated by the Land Commission as somewhere in the region of 45 adjusted acres.  Adjusted acreage, unfortunately, is not a standard thing.  It varies from county to county, area to area, almost from parish to parish.  We must have something more definite with regard to viable holdings.  Being a practising farmer, I would think that the number of acres required now for a viable holding must go beyond that.  The Land Commission, as they are the body now responsible, will have to give this consideration <Col N="1485" /> in the very near future and will have to change their view on what is a viable holding.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the retirement scheme has not been successful.  I will be more blunt and say it has been an absolute failure from several points of view. Very few people have participated in the scheme and many of us know people who are anxious to retire but have decided against doing so because of the way the scheme works.  Macra na Feirme were probably the first people to highlight the problem of inheritance.  Older farmers hold on to their land because they are afraid that the new occupant would not give them fair treatment if they handed it over and, secondly, land ownership is in a person's blood.  The Department of Agriculture must make it more attractive for people who are not making use of their land to step aside and leave it to people who would make better use of it. This would be good for the economy. That may seem too blunt but if the retirement scheme were made far more attractive people could certainly be encouraged to step aside.  The failure of the scheme so far is not a reason to drop it.  Instead we should improve it and lessen the inheritance problem.</P>
    <P>Land bonds have undoubtedly been a contributory factor in the lack of success of the Land Commission.  I never met anybody who was anxious to be paid for his land in land bonds.  While I understand that land bonds may from time to time be cashed at greater than par, this happens only rarely.  Some consideration should be given to this matter because attractiveness is the name of the game.  If the Minister were to give some thought to this issue I am sure he would come forward with some new ideas to improve it.</P>
    <P>Land ownership is in a person's blood and this is an historical fact.  Many of our court cases will show that a farmer will hold on to his land with his life.  These attitudes will not change easily and the Minister must take this fact into account. The idea is also prevalent that in order to work land a person must own it.  This is not the case, as has been clearly shown in many European countries, particularly <Col N="1486" /> those within the EEC.  There are many very successful instances of land leasing and renting and it is time to get away from the idea that a person must own land in order to work it efficiently.  An attractive leasing system would be a great advance.  There is, however, an enormous amount of suspicion about leasing and renting and an incentive must be given to people to adopt new ideas which would be for the betterment of the economy.</P>
    <P>I would also encourage the Minister to consider greater liaison between the Land Commission and other bodies. There is an instance in south Wexford where the Land Commission have been asked by the Office of Public Works for some land.  The land in question is not agricultural and might be used for amenity purposes but I believe the Land Commission are slow to react in this instance. They have a sizeable amount of land in that area which can never be used for agricultural purposes and they should give the proposal some consideration. The Land Commission should consult with other bodies.</P>
    <P>There was little indication in the Minister's speech this morning of any commitment by the Government to improvements in the structure of the Land Commission.  The Minister stated:</P>
    <P>The additional £25 million provided for in the Bill represents an estimate of what is likely to be required for the commitments that will have to be met during the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>This actually means that the amount provided will dictate what will be bought during the next couple of years; it does not represent an estimate.  If the Land Commission were to purchase even half the available land I know is required by farmers in Wexford, then £25 million would be a ridiculous figure.  The Minister also said he was conscious that structural change is of its nature a slow process and that it is best to hasten slowly in deciding finally on what new direction policies might take.  Hastening slowly in Department terms can be very slow indeed and it is obvious there is no commitment to getting down to the job.  The <Col N="1487" /> Minister went on to say that policy changes are necessary but that their formulation and direction will require calm and careful thought.  This suggests that the Government had given little or no thought to this matter before coming to power.  On the one hand we have the Minister's proposals for land reform.  I know this is not as easy as giving an interview to <i>The Farmers Journal</i> but I would like to see some of the ideas contained in that interview appearing also in the Minister's speech.  I am very disappointed. It is obvious that the Minister has had little or no input.</P>
    <P>It has been clearly shown that the Government have little or no commitment to farming.  In recent weeks I have had many representations from farmers who say there is little attraction now for anybody going into farming.  The Land Commission will find it difficult to get candidates unless there is some improvements.</P>
    <P>The price of land on offer is high.  I understand that recently the Land Commission asked for £100 an acre.  I know that if you go beyond £45 an acre for grain there is no profit in it.  Will the Minister show a little more commitment to farming?  I know it is not his fault but he must let his commitment to farming be seen within the Government and not have any anti-farming people dictating to him.  I ask the Minister to improve the structure of the Land Commission.  It does not necessarily mean that, because the Land Commission have got into a rut, things must remain as they are.  It is the Minister's responsibility to see that this is changed.  I hope the Minister is successful in his efforts.  The Land Commission are a very important body.  Their purpose is to ensure that the best use is made of every acre of land.  If that happens there will be a great improvement in our economy.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Deputy who comes from a constituency where a major part of the land acreage is in a congested area I know only too well the serious implications land acquisition and land division can have in south-west Cork.  The Land <Col N="1488" /> Commission over the years have only been skimming the surface of the problem. They have been muzzled for years because of the lack of finance.  While our young farmers are starved for land the Land Commission are completely tied down because they cannot go into the public market and buy land for cash. Land bonds are ugly words to any farmer who is retiring or thinking of selling his land.</P>
      <P>We must face up to this problem. There must be a major revision of the policies of the Land Commission.  We all know that land is our greatest resource and that every acre should be fully utilised. We must ask ourselves, given the need for greater productivity and more employment, how we can justify leaving so much of our most valuable asset producing so little for so long.  I believe a sensible taxation policy could help to encourage those who own land, but who are unable or unwilling to work it, either to sell it or lease it to developing farmers. We have an excellent young population who are unemployed.  Thousands of them are anxious to get into farming but at present have no means of doing so. Long-term leasing could help to rectify this to everybody's benefit.</P>
      <P>We all know that land is a precious commodity.  There is only a certain amount of it available.  We must bear in mind that we have one of the finest climates in the world for agricultural production and land development.  However, thousands of acres of land are lying dormant.  Thousands of acres of good mountain pasture that could rear thousands more sheep, which would play a very vital role in our economy, are completely neglected because this major problem exists throughout the country and particularly on the western seaboard from Donegal to Mizen Head.  There are mountain commonages in those areas which remain undivided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have spent large sums of money over the years on the eradication of bovine TB but I believe commonages are a barrier to the eradication of that disease. When herds are intermingling with each other on lowland pasture where commonages exist, the disease is given <Col N="1489" /> an opportunity to spread instead of being eliminated.  There is also the problem of sheep scab which has seriously affected our sheep production for years.  Great Britain got rid of sheep scab in four years of intensive eradication but we seem to have recurrences of the disease emanating from areas where sheep have not been treated, particularly in mountain pastures. This is because commonages prevail.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission have failed hopelessly in some cases to acquire land because legal phraseology bedevilled their work.  I have seen farmers crying out to get nearby estates acquired.  I have even seen the Land Commission investing in those estates but dilly-dallying so long with acquiring particular estates that people came in behind their backs, paid cash and the adjoining farmers were denied the right to have those estates divided among them.  We were told that the reason the land could not be acquired and divided among the farmers was because of legal entanglements in the titles.  The Land Commission should have a right to sort out any kind of legal entanglement as far as land sales are concerned.</P>
    <P>We all know that 23 per cent of our farmers are over 65 years of age as against 7.6 per cent of Dutch farmers.  According to statistics this figure will increase to 25 per cent of our farmers over 65 years of age in 1986.  On farms of 50 acres and less, the percentage of males over 65 years of age who are unmarried has more than doubled between 1931 and 1981.  No wonder ACOT give astonishing figures categorising farmers as follows: (a) progressive and development farmers, 20 per cent of the nation's farmers; (b) farmers with potential for development, 50 per cent and (c) farmers with no future in the country, 30 per cent.  This is surely an alarming state of affairs.</P>
    <P>The percentage of land that changed ownership through sale is extremely low. We must, in order to get land for the younger and more energetic farmers, have (a) a sensible retirement policy and (b) a system of long-term leasing.  Farmers' sons are being described as landless men by the Land Commission.  I fail to <Col N="1490" /> see how you can describe any farmer's son as a landless man.  All farmers' sons have been reared on farms and have helped their fathers to farm the land intensively.  Many of those had several brothers and those who are described as landless men may have been far down the line and the farms could not be handed over to them.  However, when these estates are being divided by the Land Commission no recognition is given to those young men who are described as landless men.  Surely there should be some other categorisation for those young farmers besides calling them landless men?  They are not landowners because of any fault of theirs.</P>
    <P>Land bonds, as everybody knows, are not an attractive proposition to farmers who are thinking of selling or retiring. Farmers who are thinking of selling or retiring like to get paid in cash.  Farmers have great doubts about land bonds.  As far as I am concerned, the farm retirement scheme never got off the ground. Farmers who participated found that when their farm retirement pension increased their old age pension decreased.  What attraction is there for a farmer to give up his farm when he finds that every time his farm retirement pension is increased by index his old age pension is reduced?  That is a sad reflection on successive Ministers who have allowed this situation to happen.  The farm retirement scheme should be scrapped completely and replaced with a more effective scheme.  I hope the new Minister of State will do everything in his power to ensure that this happens in the near future.  I hope he will ensure that any farmer who has the foresight to participate in a retirement scheme and allows his farm to be divided among adjoining smallholders should not be penalised by having his old age pension reduced the minute his farm retirement pension increases.  That sort of codology should not be tolerated in any new Land Bill.  Indeed, those farmers who have participated in the retirement scheme should not be subject to that sort of reduction in their old age pensions in the future.  Such a change would go a long way towards making the scheme attractive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1491" /> I agree with the Minister that too much of our land is not being used productively. The promotion of the more efficient use of land must be paramount in any new land policy.  It is acknowledged widely that the removal of stamp duty in respect of the transfer of holdings from farmers to their sons, daughters or other near relatives was a major step forward. However, it is unfortunate that many of these younger people inheriting farms in this way are denied the right to attend the related 100-hour course that was initiated by the EEC.  This is because there are not enough courses to meet demand. As Chairman of the Cork County Committee of Agriculture I had the privilege of presiding at the opening in Schull of one of the first courses to be conducted under that scheme.  Since then the courses have developed to a great extent but the waiting list of from two to three years is not reasonable.  In order to come to terms with this situation I suggest that until such time as there are adequate courses to cater for the demand, those men and women who cannot be accommodated be entitled to benefit under the scheme provided they give an assurance to attend the course within two to three years.  This would go a long way towards alleviating the backlog until such time as there are sufficient funds available to provide a greater number of these courses. So as not to discriminate against those people who have applied for the courses but who have not been facilitated, I hope that my suggestion will be taken up without delay.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should think twice before deciding to acquire an estate that has been farmed effectively by a tenant occupier.  In any walk of life, efficiency is the keynote to success and that should be recognised by the Land Commission in the area I am speaking of.  If a tenant farmer cares for and cultivates to the utmost the land he has been farming for a period of perhaps ten or 15 years, it is most unfair that when the time comes for him to purchase it from the aged owner, the Land Commission become involved and set about acquiring it.  That is neither fair nor just.  Indeed, it <Col N="1492" /> is a grievous insult to the intelligence of any developing farmer.  In any such case that may be in the process of being dealt with, I suggest that the Land Commission cease interfering and leave the land in the hands of the farmer who has nutured it so well down through the years.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should step in only in cases where land is not being utilised and in such cases the land should be put into production as quickly as possible. It is regrettable, though, that the Land Commission are the major culprits in terms of the running down of land. This happens by their acquiring farms and then letting them by way of public auction.  It results in a situation of neighbour bidding against neighbour, perhaps of neighbours not talking to each other for years because of some bidding prices that are much higher than the land is worth.  Land let in this way is very often allowed to run down.  I know of estates in south-west Cork that have been let by the commission for the past eight to ten years without any step being taken to divide the lands.  Long leasing to adjoining farmers results only in tearing the grass from the roots by way of grazing thereby reducing considerably the fertility of the soil.</P>
    <P>The Land Commission should act before it is too late in acquiring land and bringing it quickly up to a high standard. There is at all times a huge land bank to be divided.  This land should be distributed among the many young and developing farmers who need it so badly. There should not be delays of more than two to three years in any case in this respect.  There is something wrong with a policy that permits the commission to hold up the division of land for up to 12 years.</P>
    <P>A new land policy is vitally needed as far as farmers and the Land Commission are concerned.  The Land Commission played a good part through the years, but it is high time that we had a new land policy, 20 years having elapsed since the last was formulated.  That is far too long in view of the immense changes which have taken place in the agricultural sphere since our accession to the EEC.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Our Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, coming like myself from a constituency which includes many congested areas, knows the problems as well as anyone.  I hope that he will spare no effort and time in formulating a new policy. Over one-third of the world is non-productive because of the barren nature of its soil, but we are blessed with one of the best climates in the world for agricultural production and should fully utilise every available acre and rood of agricultural land.  Remember, when the last litre of gas is drained from the Kinsale gasfield, agriculture potential will be the same, or perhaps double what it is now.  We should develop that natural resource.</P>
    <P>The Minister should expedite the division of commonages all over the country. The sooner that is done, the sooner will fertility be restored to the highlands and lowlands represented in those commonages and the economy will benefit considerably. The Minister should proceed immediately with the new Land Bill, making sure that the new land agency works favourably on behalf of our farmers. They are as good as any farmers in Europe, but have not been given enough opportunity down through the years. They should be given the go-ahead. There should be a streamlined scheme for farm retirement making it attractive for farmers when they retire to sell their holdings to adjoining farmers or to the land agency.  They must be given an inducement.  They must have a decent pension which will not interfere with their old age pension and the land must be given to young farmers.  We must act sharply.  Successive Ministers dragged their feet in allowing the Land Commission to be answerable to no one for their decisions.  None of us is infallible and I know that the Land Commission are not. At certain times they may not have taken correct decisions, although some of their decisions were of benefit, as everyone knows.  However, those who make no mistakes never make anything and by our mistakes we learn.  The Minister must play his part in seeing that justice is done as far as division of our land is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I congratulate the Minister <Col N="1494" /> of State on his appointment and hope that he will bring the required drive and imagination to the restructuring of an immensely important area &mdash; land usage and land wastage.  The Minister mentions the provision of £25 million for land bonds to buy land, but, as a previous speaker stated, that would buy very little land.  Had the Minister said that that allocation was for the year 1983 it would have been a better proposition, instead of which it is for the next couple of years. Certainly, that is a dismal picture and very few section 40's will be in evidence on farms for the next couple of years.  I agree that the Land Commission activity of acquiring land for redistribution to smallholders cannot make any dramatic impact in future and that that traditional activity is not appropriate in the present day.  There must be a major change in attitudes to land allocation and the securing of land generally.  The Minister talks about proceeding slowly in the new direction of land policy, but there must be an aggressive policy now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the Minister to draw up the Land Bill in consultation with the Minister for the Environment.  The amount of land wasted at present is causing great concern. This week, on my way to the House, I noticed a number of houses being built on the best farmland in County Louth, half-acre sites being given over to housing. This is demanded by the local authorities because of the position of septic tanks.  Land is not renewable.  Once concrete is poured on it, or loads of stones, it takes a long time to get it back into condition.  The amount of land wasted like that over the last few years gives great cause for concern.  The planning authorities must examine this situation. Towns and villages have many derelict sites but industrialists and builders of large housing estates move out on to virgin soil because the towns and villages do not have the necessary services.  These builders ignore the gaping scars in those towns and villages.  This matter must be examined.  One only has to drive northwards through this city, what is now a derelict city, to see massive housing developments ten miles out and from which it costs so many people so much to <Col N="1495" /> commute to their jobs.  All of that must be examined.</P>
    <P>Many speakers referred to the delay in the allocation of land.  This is a very serious matter and something to which I drew the Minister's attention recently by way of supplementary questions.  Indeed one of the first representations I made when I came into this House in February 1973 was in regard to a farm in my constituency listed in this document showing the lands acquired by the Land Commission in the years 1972 to 1980.  That farm about which I made representations still has not been allocated to the small farmers who have been looking over their hedges at that land being allowed run down.  Indeed I agree with previous speakers who maintained that no land takes such a buffeting or is allowed run down at such a rate as that let by public auction by the Land Commission.  The reason for that is farmers renting that land on the conacre system. If those farmers thought they would have that land for the next five or six years probably they would use fertilisers on it but they take the best out of it in the belief that probably this will be the last year they will have it.  I have witnessed that deterioration on a number of farms, recently in my constituency.  It is regrettable that this should happen.</P>
    <P>I agree also with previous speakers who have said that the Land Commission should have worked in closer co-operation with ACOT and the other agricultural services.  I believe one of our real problems at present is the fragmentation of services in the agricultural sector, with offices scattered over many counties.  We have no land office in Monaghan.  There should be a Land Commission office in each county.  Part of the land of County Monaghan, for example, is covered by Cavan and the remainder by a supervisor in Navan.  That is not a workable arrangement. We should aim to have ACOT and the various veterinary and other offices housed in one complex, all of them coordinating their efforts.  The time will come when we will not be able to afford to have those agencies operating independently.</P>
    <P>The point might also be made about <Col N="1496" /> the staff of the Land Commission spending so much time on sub-division applications; where there is an application in excess by a few acres it must be sent to the local office.  Half of the time of those Land Commission inspectors is spent on subdivision applications.  Indeed the legal formalities could be reduced also, particularly when one bears in mind the voluminous files Land Commission inspectors will have with regard to the subdivision of perhaps ten, twelve or fifteen acres of land.  There must be some way devised of short-circuiting this formality.  There must be some way it could be programmed, in conjunction with ACOT advisers, or some system devised in individual areas rather than, say, letting a farm in one area and spending so much time examining applications.  Such a system would do away with a lot of the present cumbersome documentation.</P>
    <P>Criticism has been levelled at the farm retirement scheme.  I would contend that that scheme is worthy of any criticism it receives because there have been only 600 applications dealt with in the eight years since its inception.  The Ceann Comhairle, as Minister for Lands, in 1974 announced the introduction of that scheme.  On that very day I telephoned his Department seeking application forms in respect of two people who had indicated to me their intention of going into farming.  That scheme will have been in operation nine years in May next.  Yet neither of those farms has been divided. I saw one of those farms recently and it has been allowed run down completely in that period.  Indeed one farmer who sold the land has long since gone to his grave. Still that land remains undivided.</P>
    <P>It would be very interesting to know the view of the EEC Commission of a scheme which they have been funding fairly extensively and which was approved in Brussels.  I should like to know their views on that scheme nine years later.  At the time of its establishment we were told that that scheme would not be tied up in the red tape involved in the normal acquisition, where there might have been a compulsory acquisition with very lengthy Land Commission court cases.  We were told that <Col N="1497" /> this land would be handed over voluntarily, on application, reducing all the former red tape.  The present Government have withdrawn that scheme and the farm modernisation scheme in order to have a look at them.  There should have been a continuous examination of those schemes.  Certainly with only 600 applications being received under the farm retirement scheme that should have been examined in depth before now.  Those schemes should not have to be suspended in order to be re-examined.  A completely different approach must be adopted.</P>
    <P>I believe also that the co-operatives could play a large part in this regard. They have been the leaders in effectively developing many channels of agriculture and so far have kept out of the acquisition of land for their suppliers and farmers in their areas.  I hope the Minister will recognise the possibilities in this area. For example, if individual farmers, working to a farm plan, have less than the required acreage for a viable operation the Land Commission should be able to pass such applicants thereby enabling speedy transfer of the land involved.</P>
    <P>Another bone of contention is the method of payment for land.  Land bonds present a real problem.  They tend to scare off people who might be thinking of disposing of land, and many old people, particularly, believe they are not redeemable.  The reality is that if a person gives up his land by agreement with the Land Commission land bonds can be taxed in a few months.  I cannot see the need for land bonds when people are willing to hand up their land at reasonable prices.  The commission should look closely at the system.</P>
    <P>The greatest problem in agriculture today is the under utilisation of land.  In some areas we have had the collapse of manufacturing industry and more people will have to live from our land resource if the country is to be taken out of the mess it is in.  If one looks at the amount of money coming to agriculture from the EEC in the last ten years one will see that we benefited considerably and it is regrettable that we have not made better use of that money to ensure proper land usage and restructuring.  A recent report <Col N="1498" /> by An Foras Talúntais stated that 50 per cent of our farmers are older than 55 years and hold five million acres.  The report gave very interesting figures in relation to land movement.  Only 3 per cent of land was in pasture and crops and only .06 per cent changed hands each year by way of gifts, inheritance and normal transfers &mdash; about 64,000 acres changed hands per year.  That alone must indicate to the Minister that he must approach the matter of land restructure very quickly.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil White Paper on land usage was referred to during the debate. I ask the Minister to examine it closely because the farming members of Fianna Fáil spent considerable time examining ways and means which we thought were the best approach to land usage generally. We put our views to the Minister at the time and the Minister now in the House should not have any qualms of conscience about using our proposals in his Land Bill.</P>
    <P>We proposed a surcharge on farmers above the £70 valuation figure, the money to be used to subsidise farmers in the £20 to £40 PLV bracket, though I do not think we should be using that term these days.  The Minister may be inclined to put his own damper on some of the proposals but he would be doing a good day's work if he used that White Paper <i>in toto</i> because it is a well-researched document containing desirable proposals.</P>
    <P>In February An Foras Talúntais issued a report containing an interesting article about how land is being misused.  It is by Mr. Gerry Boyle.  He showed that an examination of growth performance on a sample of farms between 1973 and 1977 indicated that a small group of farmers, 24 per cent, achieved impressive growth, but about 50 per cent showed very poor growth levels.  About 46 per cent of farms achieved either no growth or a decline in real terms in 1977.</P>
    <P>Therefore, as I have said, how to achieve better use of land is the most important job for any Minister or Department. The civil service have their own way of doing things but it is my opinion that this requires an approach similar to Posts and Telegraphs and telecommunications. <Col N="1499" /> A person should be put in charge of the Land Commission who as a matter of urgency would restructure the organisation to try to ensure that the land that is being wasted at the moment would be put to work.  It is generally accepted that about 25 per cent of Irish farmers are totally efficient, making maximum use of their land.  They put a reasonably good gloss on the average, but if we look at the other 75 per cent we will find their performance is pathetic.</P>
    <P>We must approach land utilisation as a matter of urgency.  Money will have to be provided and we must look to the coops. In the next ten years we must get our land into production, our cattle numbers up, because our national herd is our biggest investment in the future.  We must get the land into proper hands and we must get the land for young farmers.</P>

      <P>What was intended to be an enabling Bill for the provision of additional money for land bonds has developed into a major discussion on the whole area of land acquisition and redistribution.  It is appropriate that that should be the case. Much has been said about the operations of the Land Commission, their usefulness and how they might be changed, updated and improved.  We all agree with the fundamental concept that agriculture is a vital national resource, that no matter what other resources may be developed and exhausted, agriculture will remain the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is equally a matter of great concern that so much agricultural land, not only here but throughout the world, is being concreted over, and due thought is not being given to the type of land that should be used for building purposes.  That was referred to earlier today.  The possibility of a land policy was talked about by successive <Col N="1500" /> Governments but little has been achieved.</P>

      <P>The Final Act of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) signed in Helsinki in 1975 contains measures for confidence-building between States.  These include provision for prior notification of major military manoeuvres and for participating States to issue invitations for observers from other participating States to attend military manoeuvres.  On foot of such invitations <Col N="1501" /> Irish diplomatic officers have attended as observers at NATO exercises. Such exercises have been attended by observers from both East and West, including neutral and non-aligned States which are signatories to the Final Act.</P>
      <P>Confidence-building measures of the kind provided for in the Helsinki Final Act are designed to enhance the security of all parties through bringing about increased transparency in regard to military intentions, and attendance at military manoeuvres in this context has no implications for our neutrality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will, in accordance with the unanimous resolution passed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on 27 January 1983 make representations to the Soviet Union to cease the diffusion of anti-Jewish propaganda and harassments of <Col N="1503" /> Hebrew teachers and to release those who have been imprisoned or exiled because of their efforts to exercise their rights to emigrate and their freedom of cultural expression and to allow them to emigrate and/or to be reunited with their families, which items are in direct contravention of the Helsinki Final Act; and if he proposes to have these matters raised by the Irish delegation at the resumption of the Madrid conference.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The Resolution adopted unanimously by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe highlights widespread international concern at harassment of members of the Jewish community in the USSR and at the dramatic drop in the number of exit visas granted to Soviet Jews in recent years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments have expressed concern about the Soviet Government's treatment of its Jewish citizens, which is contrary to the letter and spirit of the Helsinki Final Act.  The harassments suffered by members of the Jewish community in the Soviet Union are well documented, not least in the report on the situation of the Jewish community in the Soviet Union which forms the basis for the resolution adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to which the Deputy's question refers.  Difficulties faced by Soviet Jews include the increasing reluctance of the Soviet authorities to grant <Col N="1504" /> exit visas, harassment and possible imprisonment of would-be emigrants, concerted moves against cultural seminars organised in Jewish circles and restrictive official attitudes to the teaching of Hebrew.</P>
    <P>The Government will express their concern about this situation on all appropriate occasions and will continue to press for the full implementation of all the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act by all States participating in the CSCE. The Irish Delegation at the CSCE Review Meeting in Madrid have in numerous statements called attention to violations of the humanitarian provisions of the Final Act by the Soviet Union and, together with our partners in the European Community, has criticised the restrictive attitude of the Soviet Union towards the granting of exit visas.  The delegation will continue to press for the full discharge by participating States of responsibilities undertaken in signing the Final Act.  In line with this approach the Irish Delegation have co-sponsored amendments to a draft concluding document at present under discussion at Madrid, which aim at the incorporation in the concluding document of a commitment by participating States to encourage all efforts to implement the Final Act and to ensure the freedom of individuals and groups to express their views concerning the respect shown by Governments, including their own, in law and practice, for the Final Act.</P>
    <P>As regards representations to the Soviet Union, we are ready to convey our views bilaterally in circumstances where this would seem appropriate and effective. It is my view, however, that bilateral representations are best used sparingly if they are to be effective and that, in general, our concerns are most effectively conveyed through multilateral channels like the CSCE.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider making representations bilaterally on this issue, having regard to the fact that the Soviet Union, is a signatory of many international conventions and agreements, as well as the Helsinki Final Act, which guarantee freedom of emigration <Col N="1505" /> and of cultural expression which have been denied to minority citizens as given in his report?  In those special circumstances, and having regard to the multiple breaches by the Soviet Union of many agreements, would he consider doing that?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <P>During the discussions which led to the establishment of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental <Col N="1506" /> Council on 6 November 1981, the Irish Government clearly made known their view that this anomaly was one of those anomalies which should be tackled in the context of measures to improve mutual understanding.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will consider transferring authority for the issuing of passports to county, borough and corporation managers, thereby making it more convenient for people to apply while at the same time making it virtually impossible for false applications to succeed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, Irish passports are issued in this country only by the Passport Office in Dublin.  It has not been my Department's experience in recent years that members of the public have suffered delay or inconvenience in obtaining application forms direct from the Passport Office or in the case of applicants who live outside Dublin from the Garda Síochána, returning the completed forms in the same way, or in receiving their passports when issued.</P>
      <P>I do not feel that it would serve a useful purpose to follow the Deputy's suggestion that local authority officials be empowered to issue passports.  I do not see how it would speed up the process. In terms of security, staffing and the keeping of records, it is desirable to have this function carried out in one central office.  I am also satisfied that having passports issued on a local basis would have no effect on the making of fraudulent applications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider it fair that people in his constituency or in my constituency are obliged to come to Dublin to have a passport if it is needed in a hurry?  In many countries the local clergyman issues passports.  The identification of the person can be better checked out at local level than at a central location.  Because bureaucracy says so, people have to travel from the north, <Col N="1511" /> west and south to Dublin and have to queue for three or four hours to have a passport issued.  Does the Minister consider this fair?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think that people had actually to come to Dublin to collect a passport.  If the relevant forms are sent in I understand the passport is issued without requiring the personal attendance of the person at the Passport Office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickDHarte" hpid="Mr. Harte Mr. Harte">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harte</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not the point.  In many cases emergencies arise and people have to apply for passports in a hurry.  Is it beyond the Department to agree that someone in a responsible position such as a county manager or a city manager would be in a much better position to establish the identity of the person applying and make it easier for that person to get a passport in a hurry?  Why should we not try to make it easier for the people, rather than sticking rigidly to the rules of the Department of Foreign Affairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not necessarily to make it easier for the Department of Foreign Affairs.  A number of points have to be taken into consideration, including the increase in the number of fraudulent passports in circulation.  There is a greater chance of eliminating that possibility when there is one central authority for issuing passports.  That is the primary concern in this case.</P>

      <P>The draft strategic plan submitted by the IDA is the subject of close scrutiny and discussion by my Department and the IDA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the approval of the Government I am now putting in hand the drafting of a White Paper on industrial policy which will take account of the foregoing recommendations and plans.  This work will be completed under my supervision and in consultation with the Government task force on employment so that the promotion and development programmes for industry which will emerge will be appropriately integrated with the Government's general economic policies.  As I have indicated, the IDA strategic plan, the departmental examination of which is not yet completed, will be a major element in the formulation of the White Paper to be published.  It is not <Col N="1514" /> my intention at present to have the IDA strategic plan published separately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that little work has been done in this area which is a most important one as far as economic and industrial development is concerned.  There has never been a White Paper published in this area in the history of the State.  What have they been doing for the past three months?  The work was well advanced on that White Paper.  Is it taking second place to Dáil reform in the Department?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the last part of the question is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The previous Government carried out certain preparatory work on a White Paper.  This had to be reviewed and a decision taken to proceed with the preparation of a White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that this Government are only in office for ten weeks.  The strategic plan is under scrutiny and discussions are ongoing in relation to it.  The report of the interdepartmental committee on industrial policy together with the NESC and Telesis Reports have been the basis of recommendations which have recently been submitted to the Government.  I do not accept what the Deputy said that the total work had been done on a White Paper.  That is exaggerating his own importance in this matter.</P>

      <P>I did not say the total work was done.  I said it was progressing well.  When does the Minister expect to publish the White Paper or to publish the strategic plan of the IDA?

      <P>Consideration is being given to the statutory framework for the National Development Corporation.  I should point out that State companies have their own funding arrangements in the capital budget.  The NEA, the brainchild <Col N="1519" /> of the last Government, only succeeded in spending £82,500 in 1982 of their approved grant-in-aid of £¼ million in that year.  There was no capital expenditure incurred by the NEA out of their approved grant-in-aid of £3 million.  I am sure the Deputy is aware that there is a need for a statutory framework for the National Development Corporation, that it will take some time to ensure that the framework is correct and the best based one for the corporation.  I assure the Deputy that no worthwhile project will not be initiated because of lack of funds during this year.</P>

      <P>It was not my fault that the Deputy did not hear the reply.  The Deputy should ask her colleagues to be more orderly at Question Time.</P>
      <P>The present position in relation to the National Film Studios is that the Government are now considering the implications of the cancellation of the contract with the only serious potential purchaser who was prepared to maintain the film facilities.</P>

      <P>What decision did the Government reach in regard to the National Film Studios?  Is it their intention to retain the studios as film studios or not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The studios were put into liquidation in April 1982 and a deal to purchase the studios fell through in November 1982.  That is the position.  I am not prepared to anticipate what the Government will decide.  Obviously, it would be desirable to maintain a film-making facility but if there is not a buyer the Government will be placed in a difficult position.  The Government are considering the matter and I hope a satisfactory outcome will be arrived at.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a most unsatisfactory answer to my question.  Fine Gael and Labour when in Opposition were totally committed to retaining the studios for film-making.  That was stated by them during a debate on a Private Members' motion some months ago.  Is the Minister aware that independent film-makers must go to England to get cameras although the equipment is lying unused <Col N="1527" /> at Ardmore?  Is the Minister aware of the unemployment caused as a result of the closing of the studios?  The Minister should commit the Government to reopening the studios in line with the view expressed by Fine Gael and Labour.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the developments in this area.  I should like to point out that the position with regard to the liquidation is that all funds will be made available to meet the legal liabilities of the company by 18 April, namely within one year of the commencement of the liquidation as envisaged in the declaration of sovereignty signed by the company. The Government are considering the matter.  I do not think any Member would advocate that the studios be maintained regardless of the implications for the taxpayer.  The absence of a purchaser, who would maintain the studios and to pay a reasonable price for the property is of considerable significance.</P>

      <P>The question of redundancies at the Verolme Cork Dockyard is primarily a matter for the company. With regard to B &amp; I repair work going to Liverpool, this again is a matter for decision by that company, which is an independent trading company, and I am sure that their decision will be based on tenders and price comparisons.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>To keep the record straight, the last Government placed the order for the Panamax carrier, in case the Minister does not know that.  Would he accept that the State is a 49 per cent shareholder in Verolme Cork Dockyard and as such has an interest in what is happening to the workforce in the company, despite what he has just said in reply to Deputy Ahern?  The State is a 49 per cent shareholder and surely the Minister has an interest in what happens to the workforce.  To say that it is a matter for the company is a bit too bland.</P>

      <P>I was making the case last week for proceeding in the immediate future with the pro-life amendment, giving the people the opportunity to voice their opinion on this matter.  I outlined the need for constitutional change in this area and also the need for positive wording such as that used in the other sections of the Constitution.  I pointed out the undeniable right of the population to express their point of view by way of referendum on this very important subject. I further dealt with the dangers of changes coming about in the current position in relation to abortion, either through legislative processes or through a judicial ruling from the Supreme Court by a majority decision.  I concluded then by stating the need to reinforce existing law as outlined in the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1576" /> The amendment proposed by this Bill would mean that abortion could not be made legal either through legislation or by a judicial decision of the Supreme Court.  Such an amendment is most desirable. We are all aware that abortion is prohibited under the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861, but we also know that this can be changed at any time by the Oireachtas and by any Government who would choose to have a majority in favour of such a change.  If it were changed by the courts, this would take place without any consultation.  At least a proposed change in legislation would be debated in this House.  We are all aware that three of the five Supreme Court judges can overturn existing law if they take a certain view as to its interpretation.</P>
    <P>It is well to bear in mind the pertinent example of the United States where abortion became legal through a decision of their Supreme Court in 1973.  The whole question of legalising abortion in America started off on the question of marital privacy and led some time afterwards to the concept of procreative privacy.  We must recognise that marital privacy has also been accepted in Ireland and there is no reason to expect that things would be any different here after a certain passage of time.  That is one of the fundamental reasons for the initiation of the pro-life amendment campaign.  To delay now would be to make uncertain the protection of the right to life and it is for that simple reason that I take the stand I do.</P>
    <P>The referendum to bring about an amendment to the Constitution will not stop abortions.  Many people have been trying to confuse the issue by suggesting that it might do so but there is no doubt that this will not be the case.  We must be realistic and admit that it is not likely to happen.  The onus of responsibility will certainly be on the Government and the powers that be to provide support for those with unwanted pregnancies.  Subsequent to the inclusion of this amendment in the Constitution, there would be a strong onus of responsibility on the State to do everything humanly and legislatively possible to provide the necessary support for those who are unfortunate <Col N="1577" /> enough to see abortion as the solution to their problem.</P>
    <P>We will have to take great notice of the influence being exercised by certain agencies in relation to what is regarded as the abortion trail from this country to Britain. I have no doubt that the abortion referral agencies &mdash; apparently operating without any interference in this country, despite the fact that I believe they are operating outside the law &mdash; are creating a demand for abortion.  They are doing nothing to provide the kind of support or the kind of alternatives that might help to find a solution to this problem.  Many of the abortion referral clinics in their attitude towards abortion, and in the attitude they are selling to their clients, would have people believe that it is fashionable and acceptable in modern times to have abortion made freely available and that referring people to clinics outside the State is the proper and most fashionable thing to do at this time.</P>
    <P>I regard the campaign being pursued by those people as a policy of stealth.  It is certainly an erosion of the traditional standards and concepts we have come to accept as part of the normal situation here.  It is a clever tactic and it is very easy to see the reason for their vociferous reaction to this Bill.  When the pro-life amendment becomes part of our Constitution it literally slams the door before their strategy of gradualism, which I referred to on the last occasion we discussed the Bill.  That strategy is as evident in our society as it ever has been in promoting a particular concept.  In this instance it is the acceptability of abortion. By easing it along and instilling it in the minds of those who come to seek their aid, these agencies and clinics are bringing about a situation where they would like to feel that abortion is acceptable. But they know that if this amendment becomes part of the Constitution it denies them, as is stated in their anti-amendment literature, the opportunity of pressing on with their campaign to have legalised abortion here.</P>
    <P>We speak of human life.  As far as I am concerned, human life exists from the time of conception or, as one likes to call <Col N="1578" /> it, from the time of fertilisation.  I believe it to be a scientific proven fact.  The fundamental right of human life is the right to life itself.  I do not believe the fundamental right to life is the preserve of any particular denomination or religious group in our society.  It is mischievous to suggest that only the Roman Catholic Church support the amendment to the Constitution we are now discussing.  It is well known that the usual tactic in other latitudes &mdash; some of them close to home &mdash; is to use the anti-Catholicism trick as a subtle but very productive tactic of liberalism. The attempt to label Roman Catholicism as the last bastion of conservatism against social progress is not new.  It has been used over the centuries, and with great effect in one particular democracy, the USA.  If you can get the anti-Catholic label attached to something then it is a great help towards promoting liberalism in any particular social change one might like to introduce.</P>
    <P>We have to recognise the very considerable influence of the mass media.  I have no doubt that the pro-abortionist lobby have been very assiduous in courting that favouritism from the media.  That is why it is so important in something as fundamental as this that a proper balance is maintained as far as discussion is concerned. Our mass media have been very fair in their attitude to date in dealing with this matter.  That has not been the case in other democracies.  In America you virtually have to have the media on your side if you wish to promote any particular change in any walk of life whatsoever. That is not the position here and, hopefully, it will never be the case.  The liberalism that is sometimes expressed in some of the promotions sold for public consumption does not necessarily reflect the attitude of a lot of the readers of those publications.  I do not want to refer to the USA <i>ad nauseam</i> but there is no doubt that if you wish to have a particular point of view sucessfully sold and legislated for in America then you must have a very big propaganda machine to court the support of the mass media.  It would be a pity if liberalism had that kind of support from the media here.</P>
    <P>There has been quite a lot of talk about <Col N="1579" /> the desire to have a pluralist society here. A pluralist society must have a basic respect for life.  This is a basic requirement for all communities.  If the State seeks to gurantee the basic right of life, how can it offend pluralism?  The two things cannot be separated.  How can respect for the other rights be achieved if respect for human life is absent?  The anti-amendment lobby are simply trying to impale the Taoiseach and his Government on the pluralist hook.  That was very evident in one of their publications.  I am referring again to a small pamphlet which has been circulated by the anti-amendment campaign operating from a post office box somewhere in the city.  This document states:</P>
    <P>We believe Dr. FitzGerald has no choice but to oppose this sectarian amendment.</P>
    <P>It also states:</P>
    <P>Dr. Fitzgerald and his party must vote against it in the light of his publicly declared concern to initiate Constitutional pre-conditions for a pluralist State for the whole of Ireland.</P>
    <P>It states at the end of this particular paragraph:</P>
    <P>His personal integrity and credibility must surely be in question.</P>
    <P>I regard that kind of publication as being devious, to use a polite word, because it is attempting to suggest that the attitude of pluralism as expressed by the Taoiseach last year cannot be accommodated by allowing him to support an amendment to the Constitution in isolation. That is now stated publicly by the Taoiseach and it is what I refer to when I say that he is now on the pluralist hook. However, I do not think that the bar of the hook is encased in the Taoiseach to such extent that he has not the capacity to disengage himself from it by saying simply that the proposed amendment does not offend pluralism.  Surely, the concept of a pluralist society is not <Col N="1580" /> offended by the guaranteeing of what we regard as a fundamental right &mdash; the right to life.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the Taoiseach's role last year in all this business.  It is important to put on record just a few instances of utterances from the Taoiseach concerning his position on the amendment as he saw it at that time.  The first and most important letter from the Taoiseach that we must take careful note of is the one of 6 November 1982 when he wrote to the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign people and stated that it was as a result of a unanimous decision of Fine Gael that they were committed to introducing the amendment in Government and having it put to the people before 31 March.  He went on to say that the referendum would not be delayed by any another consideration. That little snippet from the Taoiseach's letter is self-evident &mdash; that he was acting virtually on the instructions of a commitment that had been entered into on the basis of a unanimous decision of Fine Gael out of Government but which indicated clearly what their position would be in Government.</P>
    <P>On the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme of 4 November last the Taoiseach said that before endorsing the wording of the Fianna Fáil proposal he had taken legal advice and that he thought the amendment was the best we could get.  There is nothing ambiguous in that kind of wording. It states simply that the Taoiseach, before giving the commitment in writing of the unanimous decision of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party had taken legal advice on the wording that the Fianna Fáil Government had brought forward. The Taoiseach was still in a position to say then that the amendment was the best we could get and that Fine Gael were committing themselves totally to it. Therefore, we had not merely a promise but a solid commitment from the Taoiseach. Being the astute politician that he is in his own way, the Taoiseach does not make commitments lightly in any circumstance and certainly not in a matter of a constitutional amendment and in a matter of such enormous consequence.  Consequently, we can assume that when the <Col N="1581" /> Taoiseach said he had taken legal advice, that advice was taken at the highest level.</P>
    <P>We might ask what legal advice did the Taoiseach seek at that time.  It is hardly credible that Fine Gael as a party would not have sought the advice of their former legal adviser who is now their Attorney General and who had been their Attorney General also while they were in office on the previous occasion.  I would find it hard to accept that Mr. Sunderland had no input into advising the Taoiseach on the wording of the amendment in November last particularly since the present Attorney General had been in office also when the matter was discussed by the previous Coalition.  It would be normal to expect that the Leader of Fine Gael, after a considerable length of time, having got the wording that had been expected and that had been looked forward to by so many people, though obviously not by certain elements, would have made his arrangements well in advance to have the matter considered carefully by the best legal advice he could obtain.  What better legal advice might the Taoiseach seek than the advice of a man to whom he had entrusted the responsibilities of Attorney General on a previous occasion and whom obviously he had in mind to put into office again in the event of a return to office of the Coalition?  Because at that time in November, the Taoiseach was so able to give a quick response to the wording as outlined by Fianna Fáil, it seems to me that his arrangements were made in advance.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to pose the question of how many Deputies in Fine Gael are happy with the wording proposed. It is believed by some of us that the vast majority of those Deputies would have been happy with it just as the Taoiseach was happy up to recently about it.  Might it be the far-leftish wing of Fine Gael who disagree?  These are people who would be anti the amendment anyway.  The services of a journalistic commentator or observer are not required for the purpose of pointing out to me who would form that hard leftish wing of the Fine Gael <Col N="1582" /> Party.  They can be quite vociferous on occasions.  They are playing a very significant role in trying to scuttle this amendment, despite the best efforts of the Taoiseach, as he has so often stated.  If Mr. Sutherland has stated that he had not an opportunity of looking at the wording at that time, I find it difficult, the words having been printed in the public press, to believe that he would not have been very anxious to communicate his observations to his leader.  However, it certainly does not excuse one other person from his involvement at that time and I refer to the intervention of the Director of Public Prosecutions in this matter at this time.  That would be regarded as unusual, to put it mildly.  He is a very talented, exceptional and competent person in his job, but it must be remembered that he was appointed as an independent civil servant.  Good civil servants, especially those who have reached the higher echelons of the establishment, are not often expected to make public comments, especially about highly sensitive political matters which are, in actual fact, going to be decided upon by the population as a whole.  It was with some regret that I noted the involvement of the DPP on this occasion.  As I understand it, he brings prosecutions under existing statutes and certainly does not prosecute under the provisions of the Constitution, <i>per se.</i> That would be somewhat outside the ambit of his writ.  The timing of his intervention suggests that he was prompted to intervene to influence the matter in a certain direction, which would certainly be unfortunate.  I would have put much more credence on his intervention had it taken place &mdash; I personally believe it should not have taken place at all &mdash; at another time, in another place.</P>
    <P>The anti-amendment campaign, as it is working its way through the system, is no more and no less than &mdash; in fact, virtually the same as &mdash; the pro-abortion lobby. One can see that readily in the sponsoring bodies who include all the abortion-campaigning organisations as listed and registered in this country.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting small, but nevertheless <Col N="1583" /> significant point, that the Pro-life Amendment Campaign headquarters are openly listed as 21, Merrion Square. There is no difficulty at all about its being readily recognised as coming from a particular location in this city.  It is not quite so easy, however, to know where the anti-amendment campaign has its headquarters, or the location from which it is operating.  The quickest way one could establish that is by reference to this document to which I have referred and which is on the record in which it has itself listed under post office box 1285 in this city. While one would have to have a knowledge of the location of the post office boxes &mdash; and I certainly have not &mdash; it is suggested that the headquarters of the anti-amendment campaign are located in an establishment where abortion referrals are the order of the day.  That campaign is being orchestrated from the premises well known to the Minister and others as being foremost in promoting abortion as an acceptable and fashionable means of dealing with unwanted pregnancies here.  Can the Minister and the Government not see the strategy being employed by the anti-amendment campaigners? They want to divide the Government and it seems that they have succeeded somewhat there.  They want to divide the Fine Gael Party and it would also seem that they have been reasonably successful in that area of activity, as well. They have certainly divided the Labour Party.  This is all in the hope of confusing the electorate so that that electorate might tire of the efforts in support of having this amendment inserted into the Constitution.  Their dearest wishes would be realised if, with that now obvious division in the various parties making up the Government, they had this enabling legislation dropped altogether, if a situation could be devised whereby a certain <i>modus operandi</i> of voting on this and perhaps other legislation which might come before us in the near future could bring about a situation where the legislation could be shelved for the foreseeable future.  While I note the Minister of State wagging his head negatively, in a few minutes &mdash; if he stays here that long <Col N="1584" />&mdash; I will be pointing out to the Minister for the record what some of his senior Ministers, or at least one, has to say about that very matter.</P>

      <P>However, in seeking so to confuse the electorate that they would tire of it or that it would no longer be possible to promote the legislation properly here, they have it wrong.  It is only steeling the minds of the amendment campaigners.  They are not going to allow themselves to be sidetracked in any way from having recorded what they wish to have recorded in the amendment, as far as the Constitution is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another piece of propaganda is going about on behalf of the anti-amendment people and it is as well to nail this down, too.  One must remember that any future Supreme Court, no matter how liberal some of its judges might be, will have to recognise, once this amendment becomes part of the Constitution, that the result was brought about by a single-minded decision of the Irish people as a whole. They will have no difficulty whatsoever in interpreting that wish.  It will act as a magnificent, massive deterrent to passing down a decision that they will know, by referendum result, does not reflect the minds and the wishes of the majority of our people.  It will not be possible then to read abortion into the Constitution, as might be done now, if a certain set of circumstances and positions could be brought about.  There will be no induced abortion in this country once this matter is decided irrespective of the political circumstances that might exist at any given time or the pressures that might be brought about either inside or outside this House.  That surely will accommodate the vast majority of our people; in effect that is what the amendment seeks to do.  One must remember that certain individuals, or even certain groups, have been suggesting &mdash; and they put it honestly to the electorate at this time &mdash; that abortion could never happen here.  They say it can never happen here legally.  I <Col N="1585" /> regard that as a device on the part of certain individuals perhaps to comfort some small number of constituents but certainly it is not in accordance with the facts.</P>
    <P>It is an interesting exercise to look at some of the statistics, both here and worldwide in so far as that particular device is concerned &mdash; trying to suggest that it can never happen here.  We must remember that 75 per cent of the population of this world now lives legally under abortion laws.  We have only to see the progression over the years during which it has been regularised in so many different countries, not just in England in 1967, the USA in 1973, France in 1975, Germany in 1976, Italy in 1978 and Holland in 1981 but there are many other countries as well.  It is interesting that the cry in each one of those countries I have mentioned was that abortion would never be available on demand in any circumstances. That historical fact is there to disprove that claim, just as it is being stated here now, that it will never happen legally here.</P>
    <P>Experience has shown that it has happened in other places in the self same way.  One must remember especially the way it was brought about in America, by a Supreme Court ruling there.  Now the USA are fighting to have a pro-life amendment inserted in their Constitution, abortion having been imposed on them by a Supreme Court ruling.  They are finding it extraordinarily difficult to have such an amendment inserted in their Constitution despite the support of many people right at the very top in America in favour of abortion.  It was stated that it would never happen there.  It did and it is so infinitely more difficult to alter it when it has become legalised than to take the step we are asking be taken now.</P>
    <P>I want to pose the question: is it wrong for us to be out of step on this issue and give testimony to the value we place on human life in our society?  While most of the world now labours and lives under abortion laws it is a fairly frightening statistic &mdash; and the source is the United States Statistics Office &mdash; that there are <Col N="1586" /> 55 million unborn killed by surgical operation every year in this world now.  I had to check that figure twice to ensure that it was correct.  That amounts to 150,000 per day.  I am not at all unmindful of the number of abortions that have been performed because of referrals from this country since abortion became legalised in Britain in 1967.  I understand the figure is approximately 35,000.  I do not know what great pressures were placed on those unfortunates who felt that that constituted the solution to their problem. Certainly I would have been much happier had those 35,000 Irish souls been added to our total population at this time irrespective of how difficult our economic situation may be.  I daresay that had a lot of the people who begot those children had the right support, the right kind of help to enable them to allow those lives come into being and remain alive, they would now form part of our present population.</P>
    <P>The Government must now accept a certain amount of responsibility for what amounts to bungling in the handling of this legislation.  No really clear view has been expressed by the present Government of their position.  It was disappointing that the Minister for Justice, on the Second Reading, told us that he approved of the wording in principle but not in detail.  It is difficult to understand what was the rush in his coming in if he was not satisfied with the wording as outlined by the previous Government in this regard.  It is also difficult to understand &mdash; having spent two months in office, considering the position, knowing that they had to live up to the solemn commitment of the Taoiseach &mdash; why they could not have decided whether they were for or against the wording.  To suggest that they agreed in principle was misleading.  Certainly it does nothing for the credibility of the Government that they would promote such a misleading kind of Second Stage speech.  That episode in the House on the part of the Minister for Justice was compounded very shortly afterwards by the Taoiseach, and the chaos widened further in so far as there was talk then of postponement of the whole business, talk that there <Col N="1587" /> might be word changes, as was reported from the Taoiseach's references to this in Galway in the recent past.</P>
    <P>The one thing we did not want to happen was that this whole question might degenerate into a political battle.  That view has been expressed by my Leader on more than one occasion.  The Government of the day will have to take some responsibility now for the confusion surrounding this whole business.</P>
    <P>In that regard, to fulfil my promise to the Minister of State &mdash; and I see he is getting edgy &mdash; I must refer to a statement issued by a former Minister for Justice, now Deputy Jim Mitchell.  I refer to <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 18 October 1982, with the heading &ldquo;Abortion Issue Enlivens A Cautious Fine Gael Ard Fheis&rdquo;. The correspondent is well known and the accuracy of his reporting is beyond doubt.  The report states:&mdash;</P>
    <P>Fine Gael's Spokesman on Justice, Mr. James Mitchell, made it clear that the Party now favours delaying any referendum for another year at least, or until a set of Constitutional changes can be put to the electorate.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is not true to say that there is this degree of unanimity in the higher echelons of Fine Gael, even at that time last October.  The report continues &mdash; it is still quoting Deputy Mitchell:&mdash;</P>
    <P>There should be no rushing and there must be no sectarianism and there must be no fanaticism.  There must be calm and collective consideration of all the complexities involved.</P>
    <P>If that was not putting it up to his leader on that occasion to step back I do not know what it was.  But undaunted, the present Taoiseach was unremitting in his decision and he subsequently wrote the letter I referred to earlier.  It was clear from the discussion that Sunday in October last year that at least one of the front bench members of the present Government did not want this amendment put at that time in isolation.  The next paragraph in <i>The Irish Times</i> report, which is quite casual, is interesting:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1588" /> Dr. FitzGerald was clearly embarrassed by the passion of some of the speakers&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>this part of it is relevant:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; and by the attempts of the more vociferous supporters of the anti-abortion amendment to identify him personally with their campaign.</P>
    <P>Subsequently, the famous letter was written by Deputy FitzGerald saying that there was unanimous support by the Fine Gael Party.</P>

      <P>Trying to sidetrack me in that way will come to the same bad result as has come to anybody else on that side, whoever tried it.  It is significant that the splits in this divided Coalition were evident long before the Minister, Deputy Noonan, made his confusing Second Stage speech in the House.  It is obvious there are people who do not wish Deputy FitzGerald to honour the commitment solemnly given to the pro-life amendment campaign in the letter of November last and subsequently reiterated by him in public on more than one occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the wording in the Bill is ambiguous and unsatisfactory. I am sure that the suggestion that it is unsatisfactory is the personal view of the man who made it.  It certainly does not represent the majority view in this House or of the electorate.  The question of ambiguity is an entirely different matter. Although I will not deal with it at any <Col N="1589" /> great length, I will make some reference to it.  In recent reports there has been reference to the word &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; in the recommended version.  It has been said it is not totally satisfactory.  To my mind the interpretation of that word does not depend on any scientific or theological considerations.  Everyone will accept that it is primarily a matter of usage of words in legal terms as we know them.  It is very much in line with the way the words &ldquo;infirm&rdquo; and &ldquo;aged&rdquo; are used in Articles 40 and 45 of the Constitution.  &ldquo;Unborn&rdquo; must be interpreted in the same way as &ldquo;unborn child&rdquo; or &ldquo;unborn children&rdquo;.  It is a matter of usage.  It is used here as a noun and I say it would have the same stance in legal terms as &ldquo;infirm&rdquo; and &ldquo;aged&rdquo; in later Articles of the Constitution. I cannot see the difficulty.  People might suggest that there is, but to my mind we can accept that &ldquo;unborn&rdquo; can only refer to &ldquo;unborn child&rdquo;.  It is a noun and I cannot see it being elaborated on further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is used as a noun here and it would be used as other words are used in other Articles of the Constitution. The use of the word as we had it is accepted by the vast majority of Deputies on all sides.  It is well accepted scientifically that the fertilised ovum has all the genetics of human life and therefore it must be a human being and, as any human being, it must be entitled to the protection of law.  That is what the amendment would seek to achieve.  I cannot see any difficulty or ambiguity, although people have been trying to suggest such for the purpose of delaying or to further the confusion that I am afraid the Government will have to take some <Col N="1590" /> responsibility for, although others, too, have played an important role.  The Government have the major responsibility in this matter.  They had months to consider this business and could have taken a different attitude than merely asking us to approve something in principle on the appropriate day.</P>
      <P>Existing law on abortion, and this includes the law as it would have been promulgated in Britain and in the US, is clearly understood as being applicable from the time of fertilisation.  That has been understood clearly in many judgments handed down in those jurisdictions. It is clearly understood in all their laws concerning abortion that it is from the time of fertilisation, so I do not see any conflict there.  There cannot be ambiguity.  The right to life of the unborn clearly recognises the right to life at all stages of development once you establish that that is the time involved, which has been clearly established in other jurisdictions. That being the case, the need for protection at all stages of development is recognised.  I do not think there can be any ambiguity there.</P>
      <P>On the question of the equal right to life of the mother, it is guaranteed that you cannot kill the mother to save the child, or kill the child to save the mother in the case of a conflict.  Both lives must be equally protected.  It is very important to have that absolutely clear in everybody's mind.  There is no criminality in the termination of a pregnancy which is the incidental and unintended consequence of the removal, say, of a cancerous womb in order to preserve the mother's life, since nothing would have been done with intent to procure a miscarriage. It is very important that we should understand that as well.  There is a lot of loose talk about what might or might not be the situation.  It should be understood by all and sundry that, under this amendment when it is incorporated in the Constitution, no woman will be denied medical or surgical treatment because she is pregnant.  Those are the types of scare stories which are put around to lead astray even those who are favourably disposed to the amendment. That is not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1591" /> We all know it is quite acceptable to perform a hysterectomy to save the life of a pregnant women with a cancerous womb, for example.  The removal of an abnormal tube is also acceptable.  This is known as an ectopic pregnancy.  There is also some question about radiation treatment. It is clearly stated, even by those who support the existing legislation on abortion, that this is not an abortion in medical or legal terms.  This must be clearly understood.  It is the unsought result of necessary and appropriate treatment. That cannot and will not be denied to a female in the circumstances I have stated.  These are quite legitimate medical procedures.  When you hear people talk about them you ask the respective disciplines what number of cases can be counted in these areas.  Then you realise how rare they are.  It almost makes medical history now when some of these things take place.  These operations are legal and in no way interfere with the right of the pregnant woman to have the surgical or radiation treatment necessary to protect her life.</P>
    <P>To suggest that this is sectarianism or that the proposal might be regarded as sectarian is blatantly dishonest.  It is blatantly dishonest for those who are against this amendment to seek to cause confusion by accusing people of sectarianism if they hold a particular point of view. Why should it matter if the vast majority of the people support a point of view and that point of view happens to coincide with the teaching of the majority Church? Are we being eased into a situation in which it is wrong to support the basic beliefs of the majority religion in case it offends some tiny group of vocal concept pushers as they are now appearing in this land?  Must the vast silent majority of people be denied the right to say what they believe in?  That is the essence of this legislation: to allow the people to voice their opinions.</P>
    <P>Why should we be ashamed?  Why should anybody be ashamed that public opinion should reflect the religious views of the vast majority of the population? We must not soft pedal on our principles for the sake of popularity in the short-term, <Col N="1592" /> or so-called sophistication, or worse still, for harmony's sake, in the hope that this will somehow enhance the universal view taken of us as a people.  I do not see it in that way at all.  The greatest gesture we can make to other groups, both close by and far away, is to show the depths of our beliefs and standards, and our determination as a people to display them as the hallmark of our society.  That is what the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign is all about.</P>
    <P>I do not know who is gagging certain people, as suggested, in fact, gagging the Taoiseach.  What is the reason for the deafening silence on the part of certain groups on the Government benches? Why is the Taoiseach playing this low profile role in all this business of late? Today in his first intervention he suggested to us and to the nation that a set of words will be suggested to us in about two weeks, I presume by way of an amendment.</P>
    <P>I found that an extraordinary strange statement for the Taoiseach to make. Either he has the words now, or he has not.  How can he say he will have them in two weeks, or two days, or two months? Is he telling us he has the words today, but he has to circulate them among people, or friends, or groups, or organisations, to see if they find favour with them, and when they come back, perhaps inside two weeks, they can be promoted here?  Is he suggesting that, if he has a set of words which find favour with them, having put them out for circulation they may be on their way back in a couple of weeks, unaltered and acceptable to all the people he would like to please, he will then introduce them here?  He does not give us any detail.  He just mentions two weeks, or about two weeks.  I have not got the exact wording.</P>
    <P>That seems very strange to me.  If he had said: &ldquo;We are working on it; new wording will be put forward; we hope we can get everybody to agree; this will happen soon&rdquo;, I would accept that and leave it at that.  To say that in two weeks a set of words will be put forward in the House by way of amendment or otherwise is asking us to accept too much.  If he is as <Col N="1593" /> sure as that today, he has the wording today.  Why not circulate it to us if that is the case?</P>
    <P>I am sorry somebody did not question him on whether the Cabinet had discussed the remarks he made today.  It would be interesting to know that.  Is it a fact that he has in his own mind the words he intends to offer to the Irish people by way of alternative to the wording we believe is acceptable across the board, and some time inside the next two weeks he will float them to the Cabinet and ask for their support?  It was a strange intervention to say the least.  It did not suggest to me anything other than muddled thinking, further adding to the confusion for which the Government will have to accept some responsibility.</P>
    <P>With regard to the intervention today, is the Taoiseach trying to protect the Labour partners in Government or is he trying to prevent a sizeable number of his own front and backbenchers from deserting his commitment?  Are the Labour Party putting the Government on notice that they do not want the wording changed for fear of being caught offside? I would not like to speculate about that but I am quite sure there will be a lot of speculation about what is happening in the corridors of power.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party said they wanted a free vote.  That was before they went into Government but if a new wording is decided upon by the Government then the Labour Party will be part of that decision.  They were not party to the decision taken by us collectively when we decided on the wording last year.  If, as the Taoiseach has suggested today, a new wording might be forthcoming within two weeks, it would have to be cleared by the Government, and the Labour Party element in that Government would have to be part of that decision.  How then can they opt out of supporting something collectively framed by them?  How can that thinking be reconciled with a statement publicly made by at least one, if not more, of the members serving in that Government that he would not support any amendment?</P>
    <P>That is some dilemma for the Labour Party, although I am not too concerned <Col N="1594" /> about that.  They would have been better advised to have taken the option put to them and which had the support of the vast majority both inside and outside the House, namely, the wording we put forward. Instead, they created difficulties for themselves.  I am not so sure the Labour Party want a change.  While there is no change in the wording they can shirk their responsibility.  They can always say they did not promise their support for that wording.  However, if there is new wording they will have been part of the decision to bring it before the House.  It is well known politically that when a Cabinet Minister cannot or will not accept responsibility for a decision collectively taken he has no place at the table where decisions are taken.</P>
    <P>The constitutional amendment is very important and it demands a better response than the washing of hands posturing we have had from certain elements of the Government.  I ask the Labour Party to stop their political gymnastics, to stop hiding behind the pseudo legalistic arguments they have put forward.  It simply means that there is a pro-abortion pressure building up somewhere in their system which is exercising undue influence. Certainly it is flying in the face of the vast majority of opinion in the country.</P>
    <P>The credibility of the Government has been badly dented by their handling of this legislation.  If there is any redemption to be found for them it lies only in their honouring the commitment solemnly given by their leader.  They must allow the electorate the democratic right to express their view and to cease further confusing the people by bringing in alternatives that are not necessary.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liomsa labhairt ar an mBille tábhactach seo atá os comhair na Dála.  Cuidím go hiomlán leis an mBille seo atá tugtha isteach ag an Aire Dlí agus Cirt ó thaobh prionsabail de.  Is é mo thuairimse gurb é seo ceann de na Billí is tábhachtaí a tháinig os comhair na Dála ó bunaíodh an Stát.  Dá bhrí sin tá sé ana-thábhachtach ar fad go dtabharfaimís, Teachtaí Dála, breithiúnas ceart, cruinn agus géar ar an mBille seo.</P>
      <P>I support absolutely the principles of this Bill, which is the first step towards holding a referendum on an amendment to the Constitution to safeguard the right to life of the unborn.  Let me state clearly and categorically, despite personal reservations that might have been expressed by some of my party colleagues both inside and outside the House, that Fine Gael stand totally committed to holding the referendum.  We recognise the need to take the steps that are necessary to ensure that the right to life of the unborn child will be protected, clearly and unequivocally. We recognise that the best and surest way of achieving this objective is to amend the Constitution to include in it specifically this right to life.</P>
      <P>The reasons for taking this course of action are straightforward.  Unfortunately the issues have been clouded in what has developed into a public controversy, loaded with legal jargon and medical terminology.  The arguments in favour of an amendment to the Constitution and to the holding of a referendum are straightforward and absolutely defensible. I do not speak as a lawyer or as a doctor but as an elected representative of the people, with no medical or legal qualifications to pronounce scientifically on the issues before the House.  As a layman I regard the arguments as clear and straightforward.  First, the Constitution as it stands does not contain an explicit protection of the right to life of the unborn child.  This is a fact that cannot be contradicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, there are the views <Col N="1596" /> expressed by Mr. Justice Walsh some years ago arising from a famous case in the Supreme Court and they had been referred to by many people, particularly outside this House.  The views expressed by Mr. Justice Walsh were what is known in legal terminology as <i>obiter dictum.</i> They are not binding either on himself or other Supreme Court judges in deciding any future Supreme Court cases. Although some people might think to the contrary, unanimity by the Supreme Court would not be required for a decision declaring the 1861 Act unconstitutional. A simple majority is all that is necessary.  Legalised abortion could be made possible by a majority decision of the Supreme Court on a technical legal point.  This would not involve consultation with or mandate from the people.  It is worth observing, as many commentators have done, that if the Supreme Court followed the precedent set by the US Supreme Court they could find the 1861 Act unconstitutional.</P>
    <P>Despite the controversy surrounding the issue the truth is that the overwhelming majority of the medical and legal profession support the argument for amending the Constitution and holding a referendum.  The overwhelming majority of the people when given an opportunity in the referendum will also support the proposed amendment.  The best medical and legal brains have given careful thought to the question of holding a referendum to protect the life of the unborn. They have openly supported the campaign to secure a constitutional amendment. Unfortunately, the matter has become the subject of controversy and doubts have been expressed about the wording proposed by the previous Government.  The Minister for Justice, the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions have expressed doubts and reservations.  The majority of my colleagues and Members of the House and the majority of the people want to see a referendum held as quickly as possible but we would be failing in our duty as public representatives if we did not give due consideration to the doubts expressed by the Attorney General.  If a <Col N="1597" /> better wording than the formula proposed by the previous Government can be found, then everything will be happy.</P>
    <P>I wish to make my position crystal clear.  When I speak about an alternative formula or wording I mean a wording which will express more clearly and precisely the objective we wish to achieve.  Any side-stepping or backtracking from the basic fundamental objective of this proposed amendment will have to be rejected.  If we get a better wording, so much the better.  If we do not, let us proceed with the wording we have and give the people an opportunity to exercise their democratic right and make a decision on this important matter. There has been much talk about a wording which will allay the fears and doubts expressed by the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. What is important is that the amendment being put to the people must clearly and unambiguously set down the inalienable right to life of the unborn.  No loophole must be left which would enable the basic fundamental right to life of the unborn to be interfered with either by the Oireachtas or by the Supreme Court.  This is what I want to see achieved in the amendment.</P>
    <P>As I say, doubts have been expressed by the legal authorities about the proposed wording and whether it will achieve the objective we all desire.  Any kind of new wording which will weaken this basic objective is unacceptable. There can be no backtracking from the objective to which we have committed ourselves.  The Constitution must be amended.  A referendum must be held as soon as possible and the best form of wording must be found which will copperfasten in the Constitution a clear and unambiguous provision protecting the unborn child from conception to birth. No other form of amendment can be accepted.  It would not be acceptable to me and I will vote accordingly when the time comes in this House.</P>
    <P>I wish to refuse certain allegations which have been made in relation to the pro-life amendment.  It has been suggested inside and outside the House and in the media that the pro-life movement <Col N="1598" /> was initiated by a band of cranks and fanatics who are conservative, ultra-traditional and shooting the traditional Roman Catholic line.  I have taken time to look into the origin of the pro-life movement and I utterly refute this.  I have looked at the credentials and professional standing of the people who lent their names to the movement.  I am not being pressurised by the pro-life movement or any other movement to take a particular stand in this House.  I have been a Member of the House for 22 years and have always been my own man.  I make up my own mind on issues.  I am incensed at the attempt made to discredit a group of caring people, reputable citizens of this State with international reputations in the medical and legal field.  In the pro-life amendment document there is a list of the main patrons of the movement.  In the medical profession there is a list of the most eminent people in the field of gynaecology obstetrics, including four university professors of gynaecology and obstetrics.  Can they be described as a small vocal pressure group shooting the traditional line?  From the beginning the campaign for an amendment to the Constitution to protect the right of the unborn was supported by a reputable organisation. I was very impressed by the speech made by Deputy Rory O'Hanlon who is a medical doctor.  He referred to the fact that the Irish Medical Association and the Irish Medical Union at their annual general meeting unanimously passed resolutions condemning abortion.  Eminent medical patrons have lent their names to the pro-life movement.  It is also supported by the Irish Nurses' Organisation, Muintir na Tíre, Lawyers in Defence of the Unborn and so on.  I totally reject any suggestion, made inside or outside this House that the people who are trying to secure an amendment to the Constitution are irresponsible, narrow-minded, conservative, traditional and solely concerned with promoting the dogma of one religion.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, let us look at the anti-amendment movement.  What weight do the people who have lent their names to this campaign carry, professionally or otherwise?  I have here the anti-amendment <Col N="1599" /> campaign leaflet in which they have set out their objectives, one of which is that the amendment will impede further public discussion and possible legalisation of abortion.  That is what they are concerned about.  The organisations mentioned here are The Communist Party of Ireland, Dublin Well Woman's Centre, The Democratic Socialist Party and the right-to-choose group.  There is a long list of individuals, two of whom were Members of this House when the campaign was started but who, strangely enough, are no longer Members.  I have studied the leaflet and objectives of the Pro-Life Amendment Campaign and those of their opponents.  I have no doubt whatsoever in arriving at a balanced judgment on this matter.  The people who initiated a campaign to secure an amendment to the Constitution have rendered a very valuable national service and our gratitude should be extended to them. Because of their deep concern arising from their professional expertise and their lifelong work, especially in the medical profession, they recognise the danger and have called on their elected representatives to ensure that we will stand out as a country with a caring society who care for the under-privileged.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health had a right to express his personal views on this matter when he said that an amendment to the Constitution will not stop people going to the UK for abortions and that we should be more concerned about the unmarried mother and so on.  The Minister is now in an ideal position to do something positive to help the unmarried mother.  I am very proud to be associated with CURA, which has as its special objectives the care of unmarried mothers.  The work of this organisation is impeded through lack of financial support and most of their excellent work is supported through voluntary donations and subscriptions.  If the State and the Government are concerned about this situation let us put our money where our mouths are and ensure that these organisations will get adequate finance.  We are doing it out of our own pockets in Limerick and I am proud of that.  Let us <Col N="1600" /> show that we care about our under-privileged people and unmarried mothers. Let us ensure that local authorities will put an unmarried mother and her child on a special priority list for housing.  Let us not be talking about ideology or liberalism but let us do something practical to help these unfortunate people.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that medical arguments are overwhelmingly in favour of an amendment to the Constitution to protect the right to life of the unborn from conception to birth.  While doubts have been expressed by the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and by individual lawyers, we must not lose sight of the fact that there is an organisation of lawyers supporting the pro-life campaign.  The Irish Association of Lawyers have a membership of over 300.  At a recent meeting in Killarney they fully endorsed the campaign for securing an amendment to the Constitution.  It has also been stated by those who are opposed to the amendment that it is sectarian and will demonstrate to the world that we are a sectarian State dominated by Rome and its teachings.  There is propaganda in the media that the non-Catholic Churches are united and unanimous in their opposition to the amendment.  I have looked into this and I was very impressed and pleased to find a public statement read on 8 February 1983 by the Rev. Sydney Garland, on behalf of Ministers of four Protestant denominations, at a news conference in Dublin.  He said</P>
    <P>We` do not accept that the proposed Amendment is sectarian.  Abortion is not an exclusively Roman Catholic issue.  It is a matter of basic human rights.  The right to life of the unborn is based on the indisputable scientific fact that human life begins at fertilisation.... There is nothing sectarian about these facts.  The medical evidence concerning the beginning of human life does not change whether you are a Catholic or Protestant....  The Amendment is entirely in accord with our Protestant view of abortion. ...Clearly there are differences among Protestants on the issue of abortion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1601" /> ...However, we believe that the majority of Protestants will support the proposed Amendment.</P>
    <P>He went on to say &mdash; I presume he was referring to the Churches he had mentioned &mdash; that:</P>
    <P>The Church statements are out of step with grass-roots opinion on this issue.  They are also out of step [this is the important point] with the other Protestant denominations which are not part of the Irish Council of Churches.  Furthermore, they are out of step, not only with the whole Christian tradition which has unanimously condemned abortion, but also with their own Protestant heritage on the issue.</P>
    <P>We then had allegations that the proposed amendment was sectarian.  We have been told that to proceed with it would worsen our relations with the non-Catholic community in Northern Ireland.  Reverend Garland in the course of that statement also adverted to that aspect.  He said:</P>
    <P>We do not accept that a Pro-Life Amendment to the Republic's Constitution would worsen relations with the Protestants of Northern Ireland.  In fact, this is one area where there is opportunity for agreement and a common approach.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that Protestants have been in the forefront of LIFE, a pro-life organisation which is growing rapidly in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>Reverend Garland concluded by saying that:</P>
    <P>If the Pro-Life Amendment is passed, then many in Northern Ireland and throughout the world will rejoice and will be encouraged to fight for an end to the silent and sinister holocaust of abortion, and the universal recognition of the right to be born.</P>
    <P>That answers the suggestion being projected in the media that the proposed amendment is sectarian.  In recent times the media have adopted an unbalanced aproach.  If one examines the coverage in <Col N="1602" /> the media one will find that the balance is very much behind the anti-amendment campaign.  In recent months I issued three public statements on the Pro-Life Amendment but not one word was published. However, when some of my colleagues expressed reservations about the issue they received headlines in all newspapers and in RTE.  I sent three scripts to RTE supporting the Pro-Life Amendment but they did not use one word.  The statement by Reverend Sydney Garland must be taken carefully.</P>
    <P>In connection with suggestions that the proposed amendment is sectarian I should like to quote from the Report of the Public Morals Committee of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church entitled, Abortion, A Matter of Life and Death.  The preface to that report states:</P>
    <P>The purpose of this report is to place before the members and friends of the Evangelical Presbyterian Church both the facts relating to abortion and the Christian case against it.</P>
    <P>Today, in many circumstances, the unborn child is on trial.  He is charged with a variety of offences; his presence is inconvenient, he is liable to disclose the promiscuity, sexual laxity or extra-marital infidelity of his parents, he is accused of placing undue stress on his mother, father and other brothers and sisters.  For these and other &lsquo;crimes&rsquo; he is condemned to death.</P>
    <P>The pro-life movement seeks to ensure that the life of the unborn from conception or fertilisation to birth is safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The Supreme Court at some future date by a simple majority may find the 1861 Act unconstitutional.  I have referred to the danger that would occur if the Supreme Court followed the US precedent, and it has been known to do that.  The fundamental aspect of the debate is, when does life begin.  In regard to this I came across an interesting book &mdash; one of the many I came across dealing with this issue, not all pro or anti-amendment &mdash; entitled, <i>Abortion: The Silent Holocaust</i> by John Powell.  That book is relevant to the discussion that is taking place here and outside.  Under the heading <Col N="1603" /> of &ldquo;Congressional Hearings&rdquo; Mr. Powell stated:</P>
    <P>On April 23 and 24, 1981, the US Congress took the historic step of holding hearings on &ldquo;The question of when human life begins&rdquo;.  In its decision legalising abortion-on-demand, the Supreme Court asserted that it could not resolve &ldquo;the difficult question of when human life begins,&rdquo; and so the Court proceeded to legalise abortion throughout the full nine months of pregnancy.  One medical school professor, Dr. Eugene Diamond, has said [in referring to this decision] that &ldquo;either the justices were fed a backwoods biology or they were pretending ignorance about a scientific certainty&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is &ldquo;a curious avoidance of the scientific fact, which everyone really knows, that human life begins at conception&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At that Senate hearing a long line of the most eminent geneticists, gynaecologists, obstreticians and experts on various fields of medicine and biology gave evidence. Their testimony before the hearing was unanimous.  Dr. Harold W. Manner, Chairman of the Department of Biology at Loyola University of Chicago summed it up as follows:</P>
    <P>When a human sperm fertilises a human egg, the result is a human being &mdash; from the moment of conception.</P>
    <P>His final sentence is very relevant to the motivation and <i>raison d'etre</i> of the proposed amendment:</P>
    <P>The killing of this living human being must be considered homicide.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that from the scientific evidence available &mdash; one does not have to be a scientist, a biologist, a geneticist, a gynaecologist or an obstretician to interpret the evidence &mdash; life begins at conception.  What is being sought in the amendment is a clear and unambiguous statement protecting the unborn from conception to birth so that the matter will not be subject to the whims of the Oireachtas or decisions of the Supreme Court.  This matter must be decided by <Col N="1604" /> our people in a referendum.  Some of the literature I have read on this matter in recent weeks is horrifying.  There is a body of opinion now which talks of handicaps to the foetus that can be detected by the use of modern scanning equipment and suggests that a foetus that may be handicapped at birth should now be destroyed.  This is appalling.  It must be apparent to everybody in this country, because, irrespective of political philosophy, we subscribe to a Christian philosophy of life and a concept of a just society to which, unfortunately, only lip service is paid very often, that, the handicapped should be a source of great pride and joy to us.  Over the past decade or two a new awareness of the handicapped has grown up in this country.  Thousands of people give practically all their spare time in a voluntary effort to provide accommodation, facilities and training for the handicapped.  We have such organisations in my constituency and I am sure in other constituencies throughout the country.</P>
    <P>This debate has gone on for quite a long time.  Perhaps it is good that an issue of this gravity, probably one of the most important Bills ever to come before the House for several years, should be debated at length.  To sum up, I suppose in the final analysis one must be guided by the dictates of one's own conscience, but there is such a thing as an informed conscience.  I have looked at this objectively. I have discussed it with many people.  I have tried to interpret a case for and against the amendment.  I am satisfied beyond year or nay that the arguments in favour of the amendment are absolutely overwhelming.  Secondly, having agreed to hold the referendum, we must be careful to ensure that the best possible wording is formulated which will ensure that the right to life of the unborn will be safeguarded independently of the Oireachtas, independently of the Supreme Court and independently of any international institution, be it the Court of Human Rights, the EEC Court of Justice or any other court.</P>
    <P>In conclusion I emphasise what I have said.  If the alternative amendment is to be available then I hope it will be available <Col N="1605" /> in the very near future.  It is undesirable that there be any undue delay and I hope that the alternative amendment, the alternative wording for which we have been waiting for three or four weeks now, will be available very shortly.  As I said at the very beginning, I re-emphasise with all due deliberation that if the alternative wording which will be available to us will copperfasten the objective that we want to achieve, then we will have done a good day's work.  On the other hand, and I want to state my position clearly, if a hotch-potch of words or a new formula comes in which will not achieve the objective of safeguarding the right to life of the unborn from conception to birth independently of the Dáil and the Supreme Court, then I will vote against it.  I make that quite clear.  I am perfectly honest about these things.  If the alternative wording is not to my satisfaction and better than the wording already before the House I will vote for what is already before the House.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I want to address myself to international institutions, international courts and so forth.  I am proud to be a member of the Fine Gael Party and affiliated to the European Christian Democrats.  During the course of the European election campaign in 1979 &mdash; this has not been adverted to by anybody &mdash; a fundamental principle of the European election manifesto which was put before the people of Europe and which we put before the people of this country was a commitment to the basic concept of the right to life of the unborn.  This is written in black and white, unambiguously and clearly, into the Christian Democrat election manifesto of 1979.  I want to say in the context of the EEC which has been referred to here by a number of speakers and referred to outside the House also, that there was a major debate in the European Parliament in November 1981 at Luxembourg when a very substantial, significant and thoroughly researched report was presented to the Parliament on all aspects of women's rights.  There were pro-abortion advocates there who were MEPs and the debate was pretty acrimonious.  Commissioner Richard, Commissioner for Social <Col N="1606" /> Affairs, if I remember correctly, stated clearly and emphatically that the EEC could not force this country or any member country to introduce abortion legislation. There was nothing in the Treaty of Rome which would force the EEC, the Commission, the Parliament, the Courts of Justice or any other EEC institution to do so.  However, if we do our job properly in this amendment and in this referendum we will be ensuring that such a fundamental case as the inalienable right to life of the unborn will not be subject to interference from any international institution or any court of justice in Ireland, Europe or otherwise or will not be interfered with by the Oireachtas either except with expressed consent of the Irish people in a referendum.</P>

      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom ar an gcéad dul síos a chur in iúl duit féin agus do mhuintir an Taoisigh go bhfuilim-se leis na daoine siúd atá ag moladh leasú ar an mBunreacht.  Creidim go bhfuil géarghá le seo.  Is trua nach bhfuilimid ag brath ar an bhfoclaíocht mar a bhíodh sé as Gaeilge mar tá seisean i bhfad níos soiléire as Gaeilge ná mar atá sé as Béarla. Tá focal ann sa Laidinis <i>jus,</i> the right as Béarla, agus níl aon fhocal in aon theanga an domhain go bhfuil aithne agamsa uirthi a thagann chomh gar don fhocal sin <i>jus</i> agus a thagann an focal &ldquo;ceart&rdquo; as Gaeilge.  &ldquo;Tá an ceart agam. It is my right.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In rising to support those people who wish to have the amendment to the Constitution I do so conscious of the fact that, following my own election campaign, I was subjected to a most unfair, unfounded, unwarranted, well-orchestrated campaign of vilification.  I invited those people who commented adversely on our election campaign to conduct a public inquiry into the manner of that campaign.  Nobody did so.  Statements were made in several areas of the media which were utterly without foundation and I was offered the opportunity to explain our position only on John Bowman's programme &ldquo;Day By Day&rdquo;. Unfortunately I could not avail of that opportunity because at the same time I <Col N="1607" /> was involved in a one-and-a-half hour programme on Radio na Gaeltachta. Some people in the press made statements which were downright untrue and when my director of elections supplied them with all the material they refused to publish it.  I deliberately kept silent because I agree with the seanfhocal, binn béal ina thost.  Some of the people who publicly made these comments came to me privately afterwards and admitted that they were wrong.  At least they had the good grace to do so, but they did not make that admission publicly.  Conscious of that, I will try to be as dispassionate as possible in my comments during this debate.</P>
    <P>I should like to address myself to some of the aspects of the argument against the need to amend the Constitution.  There is a faulty argument put forward by those opposed to the referendum.  The fundamental question under discussion, that of abortion, is not a religious or a political question but one of ethics and morals concerning <i>ipso facto</i> the type of society we wish to create for ourselves and to hand on to those who will come after us. Even if we were a uniformly denominational people, whether Catholic, Protestant, Christian, Jewish or Moslem, even if we were uniformly atheist, we would still have mixed views on social issues such as this.  At present we have differing views within every denomination and within the medical and legal professions who will be most directly involved in this issue in their working lives.  The fundamental issue is whether or not we are for or against abortion.  We must allow for the sincerity of those who profess themselves opposed to abortion but equally opposed to the amendment.  However, they are <i>de facto</i> giving refuge to those who are in favour of abortion and accuse the pro-life people of being devious.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from comments on both sides of the debate that the vast majority of the people in this country oppose abortion. Others would have it allowed in certain circumstances such as rape, incest or malformation of the foetus.  I wonder on the latter reckoning whether Aesop would have got through, one of the finest <Col N="1608" /> minds ever.  I understand that he was a dwarf and might not have qualified on the latter count.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of regret that this has been projected as a sectarian issue.  I believe that view is misguided but it could be more sinister.  There could be uisce faoi thalamh.  Last week I read a letter in The <i>Irish Independent</i> from a lady who described herself as the secretary of the life movement in England.  She said a deliberate decision had been taken by the pro-abortion people there to have the debate here on a sectarian level on the grounds that we would be most sensitive to that type of allegation.</P>
    <P>Hugh Leonard said &mdash; and I think he is right &mdash; that nobody in Ireland will ever die of a swelled head.  That is certainly true of us as a people.  We give first place to no other nation in highlighting our shortcomings.  God knows we have plenty of critics, and I suppose that is not without reason, but I believe not even our most trenchant critics could honestly describe us as a sectarian people.  In 1972 I was one of 720,000 people who voted in a referendum on the basis of five to one to delete from the Constitution the special position accorded to the Catholic Church to which the vast majority of people here belong.  In any objective analysis of us as a people that should be remembered.  I reject any suggestion that we are a sectarian people.  It was the people who made that change in the Constitution and I believe they were correct. It is important to remember that it was not the legislators who made the change.</P>
    <P>There is bound to be a polarisation of views on this issue, as in the case of the vast majority of democratic issues.  It is the very essence of the democratic principle that there is a majority and a minority. It is the glory and weakness of the democratic system.  There is what we call the tyranny of democracy.  In eighteenth century France the opponents of the political philosophy of democracy used the academic argument that if the majority said something it could be true on a democratic basis but factually incorrect. If 30 Members here were asked to add two and two and 20 of us said five and the other ten said four, democratically 20 <Col N="1609" /> Members would be correct but mathematically they would be wrong.  The majority could say that today was Friday, 9 August; again that would be democratically true but factually wrong.  The tradition in the social democracies has been that by and large, with some dishonourable exceptions, the majority have acted in fairness and in deference to the wishes of the political minority.  This is true in most Western democracies but sometimes the minority deliberately use the taunt of oppression, bigotry or sectarianism.</P>
    <P>It has to be remembered that if the majority are favourable, well-disposed and sensitive to the views of the minority that is done by generous consensus.  If a minority deliberately try to project a situation &mdash; it would be a legitimate democratic position on a democratic vote &mdash; as sectarian that could unfairly reflect on the authors of that taunt because that type of thing can often be a reflex of the inverse.  You can have bigotry from some of the authors in a minority situation the same as you can have inverted snobbery. I am not saying that anybody who opposes the amendment is a bigot; I am only saying that it could be construed unintentionally that this is what they are trying to do.</P>
    <P>I believe there is another type of false argument which came from some members of my party.  I am speaking here from my own deeply held conscientious views on this issue.  I know I reflect the viewpoint of the vast majority of the people who sent me here when I say that I support the principles enshrined in the amendment campaign.  I have no connection with any group on either side of this issue.  I have formed my opinions from having read and listened to the debate.  It has been said that there has been faulty argumentation but there is a certain amount of what I would call sophistry as well.</P>
    <P>I know that people are sincere when they say that if this referendum is passed it will not change the number of abortions taking place at the moment.  I accept that fully and completely.  I believe, regrettably, that that is true.  But those things are not contingent one upon the other.  To <Col N="1610" /> say that that is the reason why we should not hold the referendum is sophistry.  At its best it is naive and at its worst it is disingenuous because it is the type of argument which says that a horse has four legs, a table has four legs, therefore the table is a horse.  It is trying to convolute two independent truths that have nothing to do with each other.  Somebody on one side of the divide said if you buy an egg timer you do not expect the BBC home service from the egg timer.  The two things are quite separate.  I wish to endorse the sentiments of Deputy Tom O'Donnell and others that we should be doing everything in our power to help the people who get themselves into a lonely and unfortunate situation because of some of the attitudes we have here.</P>
    <P>I would like to give another example. Somebody may say that London is the capital of England or that today is 2 March.  Both things are equally true but it does not affect the actual position that there is a fundamental need to ensure that there is no loophole in our laws which would permit the introduction of abortion.  With regard to the second part of the premise that we should be seeking to create a society where conditions are such that abortion would not be necessary, while I subscribe absolutely and unequivocally to this principle &mdash; I do not know anybody who would not subscribe to it &mdash; I would not accept it as a device for delaying the referendum.</P>
    <P>Where has there ever been in the world a State or society that would be so perfect in the eyes of the promoters of that line of argument that somebody would not want to have an abortion?  When we are going into the future where social need, social want and deprivation will, we hope, be things of the past I believe there will still be people who will want to have abortions for no other reason than the inconvenience, however justified it may be, of having children.  I doubt if we will ever reach the level of civilisation where somebody will not be looking for an abortion. I would welcome the situation where nobody would seek an abortion but I do not honestly believe I will see it in my lifetime.</P>
    <P>When I was in Moscow two years ago <Col N="1611" /> the figures there for abortion were among the highest in the world.  The same is true of the State of California.  Those are two different types of society which are totally opposite in their political, social and religious viewpoints.  I believe that for anybody to argue that we should be more concerned with bringing about the state of society which would not require an abortion rather than have a referendum is sophistry of the worst kind, naive at its best and dishonest at its worst.  I do not want to accuse anybody of being dishonest. I believe in all social issues we should establish the hierarchy of values.  If I might use an industrial analogy, I believe it is socially wrong where some people are holding down two or three jobs which could be done by others who have not a job and who need a job, or people working excessive overtime which could be shared with no great loss with others who have not any job at all.  Surely the first right in that context is the right of every person to have a job.  That is one social issue.  In the context of this debate on abortion surely the most fundamental and inalienable of all human rights is the right to be born.</P>
    <P>It is a pity we could not confine ourselves to the wording in Irish put forward by the previous Government because Irish being a more juridical language and more precise in its meaning than English spells out clearly the right of the unborn to be born.  The Latin word <i>jus</i> is the basis of everything to do with justice, the Judiciary and everything to do with the law and I am told by linguists that there is no other word in any language so near or so precise in meaning as the word <i>ceart</i> in Irish.  Tá an ceart agam, I have the right.  I believe that the most transcendental right of all other rights &mdash; all other rights follow this one and do not come into being if this one does not &mdash; is the right to be born.  It must always be the great transcendental for all civilisation. That nation can only be called great which opens its doors to all mankind.  I believe that to deny the right of life today is to vindicate Hitler's policy of selective breeding.  I believe those things need to be said.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1612" /> Another area in which I consider there is faulty argument on the part of those who oppose the referendum is the question of the cost involved.  Like the toad with the jewel in its head, democracy has its weaknesses; but as a reflection of the principle of government of the people, by the people and for the people it is the greatest political system ever devised by human society.  The referendum is the highest expression of the principle of democracy.  The Swiss have shown the way in that regard.  We do not have enough referenda.  To speak about the cost of the referendum is to gratuitously insult those of us who argue in favour of the need to amend the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Some months ago I read in the columns of <i>The Irish Times</i> that a son of the horse Nijinsky had been sold for £2 million. That represents two-and-a-half times the cost of the referendum we are talking of and we are now watching the farce, or at least it would be a farce if it were not so serious, whereby the syndicate who own Shergar are claiming £20 million from the Irish people for the abduction of that animal.  I doubt if even the most vociferous of those who oppose the holding of the referendum would suggest that all the Shergars that might ever be born would be more valuable than the life of one child.  I suggest that not even £10 million would be too much to pay to save the life of someone whose life was in danger by, perhaps, being trapped down a mountain in Wicklow or halfway down the face of the Cliffs of Mother.</P>
    <P>As to the wording of the amendment, my main concern is that any present difficulty would not be used deliberately to have the amendment delayed or postponed; though from the point of view of debate of the issues involved, I do not mind how long it takes because the proposal has done a good deal to make people aware of the issues involved.  I read recently that an American, a distinguished member of the medical profession, spoke here and said that he had been part of the campaign for the introduction of abortion in America.  He said that the people involved in that campaign had set out deliberately to address themselves to the intellectuals and to the media in <Col N="1613" /> America and that they set out also to project as being backward anyone who opposed abortion.  This is the usual sort of contempt that is invoked whenever we want to dismiss someone as being reactionary or fascist merely because he is traditional in his sense of values.</P>
    <P>I gather that in America 99 per cent of the people were against abortion but because the decision to provide for abortion was a judicial one, the views of that 99 per cent of people were flouted.  That danger is here, too.  We are relying on the Offences against the Person Act, but that would not be sufficient to protect the life of the unborn in the face of a judicial decision on the lines of that taken in the US.  That Act, which was introduced here by a Protestant Ascendancy, was never questioned on the grounds of being sectarian. It reflected the sentiments of the legislature in England, while the appropriate Act in America reflected the sentiments of the legislature of that country. But that was the Act that was deemed by members of the US Supreme Court to be unconstitutional, a decision which resulted in opening the floodgates for abortion despite the manifest opposition in principle and in conscience of the vast majority of the American people.</P>
    <P>It has been said that the devil can cite scripture to suit his purpose.  Wolfe Tone is often cited in his very laudable dictum of replacing the words, &ldquo;Catholic, Protestant and Dissenter&rdquo; with the common name of Irishmen.  I am confident that what Tone had in mind was that those three words should be divested of their pejorative content, of their divisive nature.  I do not think he was talking about a purely secular society because above all else, and regardless of whether we be Catholic, Protestant, Jewish or of any other faith, we are by nature a people who believe in a hereafter.  We are largely of the Judeo-Christian ethic which believes in a life hereafter.  Tone also was the one who said that the only people he could rely on were people of no property. I suggest that it was precisely because they had no property that he could rely on them.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat disturbed to hear some people say that if the amendment were to <Col N="1614" /> be accepted it would have the unfortunate effect of creating artificial barriers between ourselves and the people in Northern Ireland.  Anyone who knows me is well aware of my views in regard to Northern Ireland.  I am trenchantly opposed to any suggestion of coercing anyone on this island into becoming part of our system against his wishes.  I have been the subject of threats as a result of making known my position on that matter. But I regarded it as the ultimate in cynicism when some of those who promoted that line of argument at certain fora at which I was present were the very people who only last year were passing votes of sympathy with people in the North who were murdering and shooting the very people whose sensitivities these other people are anxious to protect in this situation.</P>
    <P>I have no wish to adopt an argumentative or pejorative stance on this issue. I wish only to be as fair and objective as possible.  But, as George Bernard Shaw admonished, we should always emphasise the positive.  We should have regard to our heritage.  Within the context of democracy it may very well be that in time our successors will decide we were wrong.  Being facetious for the moment, if I may, I do not know how true it is but I am told &mdash; and am open to correction on this &mdash; that a council of the Church decided by a majority of two votes that women had souls.  If true, it was a good job that three of them had not gone to the toilet when the vote was taken or we might find ourselves in a very difficult situation.  We should positively enshrine within our Constitution the protection of the unborn.  It should be taken out of the hands of the theologians and the lawyers &mdash; two categories which have been notably fallible in the past.  We should allow the people to make the decision.  Nobody should be afraid of the decision of the people.  That is the only way forward on this issue.  I cannot understand the argument of those who proclaim themselves democratics, and indeed socialists, and at the same time seek to prevent or upstage the holding of a referendum.  Whatever form of words is put to the people they <Col N="1615" /> should copperfasten the principle that because abortion is intrinsically evil it should not be legally possible within the jurisdiction of this State to introduce something intrinsically evil and manifestly against the wishes of the people.  It is interesting that nearly everybody on both sides of this argument who has spoken on this issue has prefaced his or her remarks by saying &ldquo;I am against abortion&rdquo;. Then they continue to say whether they are for or against the referendum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>This Eighth Amendment Bill is one of the most important ever to come before this House.  For that reason, it is incumbent upon me to put on record my views on the subject.  The organised and very well-orchestrated campaign against the amendment must raise doubts and suspicions in the minds of many as to the true and real motives of these objectors.  Many have to go to extreme lengths to explain that, while supporting the anti-amendment campaign, nonetheless they abhor and would never countenance abortion under any circumstances.  The true and real reasons for their objections are that the amendment in their view is totally unnecessary, that it promotes sectarianism, or that, when introduced, it could render some methods used under the Family Planning Bill illegal because they could be regarded as abortifacients.  All these objections are ill-founded and totally groundless.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vast majority of those who oppose the amendment are not pro-abortionists, <i>per se.</i> However, the fears and doubts created in their minds, in some cases at least, have been fostered and developed by extreme anti-moralists and pro-abortionists on the fringe of the anti-amendment group.  Others who belong to the anti-amendment groups can be described <Col N="1616" /> as the professional protesters or classical opposers of this life.  They are against everything and basically for nothing, opposing for the sake of opposing, thriving on controversy and could be regarded as reactionaries in every way.</P>
    <P>I will briefly analyse the reasons given by some of the objectors for their objections.  To suggest that the constitutional amendment is sectarian, or might increase sectarianism is inaccurate and unreal.  Admittedly, the word &ldquo;sectarianism&rdquo; has gained a new emphasis in this island of ours in recent times; and is it any wonder when we have some people, even in high places in this House, obsessed with the concept of sectarianism? It is no wonder that that term is bandied about so much, quite unnecessarily, when the Taoiseach, just over a year ago, described this sovereign State as a sectarian State, when he embarked on what has now become his infamous constitutional crusade, in an effort to create a puralist society.  Such utterances by the leaders of our society, and in particular by the leaders of our political parties, are fraught with danger.  They give credence to our most bigoted opponents &mdash; the Paisleys and others of this life.  I am not suggesting that the Reverend Paisley is anti-amendment or pro-abortion &mdash; he certainly is anti-abortion &mdash; but I am speaking of him as being a bigoted opponent of our sovereign State.  This unnecessary talk about sectarianism gives food to our bigoted opponents who despise the traditions which we have established here and which we all intend to continue.  They create confusion and worry in the minds of many ordinary, decent people who are genuinely concerned about what is happening here.  I hope that the Taoiseach will contain himself in future, or allow his friends to contain him, so that he will not run off at tangents and create more controversy over the next few months or years.</P>
    <P>The preservation of life of the unborn is an intrinsic component of natural moral law.  It antecedes Christianity in all its forms.  It is reinforced by the Judeo-Christian tradition which states the command of God, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo;.  In Christian thinking all life is given by God <Col N="1617" /> and He is the Sole Master.  In human life men are regarded purely as the administrators of God's law.  At conception God infuses a spiritual soul into each person. That is why we speak of human beings procreating and of animals reproducing. For this reason to suggest that the enshrinement of the right to life of the unborn in our Constitution would promote sectarianism is totally illogical and quite simply exemplifies the total nonsense being propounded by many of these in the anti-amendment group.</P>
    <P>To those who fear that, when introduced, as I have no doubt it will be, there will be a real danger of some of the present methods being used under the Family Planning Act being rendered illegal &mdash; because then they could be regarded as abortifacients &mdash; I would say they need have no fears on that ground.  There is not one iota of evidence to substantiate the belief that either the intra-uterine contraceptive device, some of the low oestrogen cycle regulators, or the use of oestrogen following rape prevent pregnancy by interfering solely with the implantation of the fertilised ovum.  In fact most experts believe that pregnancy is prevented by either inhibiting the fertilisation of the ovum by the sperm or by inhibiting ovulation.  This is not the way an abortifacient works.  I would suggest that one can safely and reasonably conclude that these are not abortifacients and do not perform that function.  Therefore there can be no real danger of any subsequent changes in the methods used under the Family Planning Act; there can be no real danger that any of these methods can be regarded as illegal in the future.</P>
    <P>To suggest that the amendment is unnecessary because the ban on abortion is covered already by the Offences Against the Person Act, 1861 is, to put it mildly, an expression of faith, hope and innocence.  This expression of faith hope and innocence was clearly exemplified in other countries over the last ten to 15 years.  To suggest that the Supreme Court could not or would not ever create legislation which would introduce abortion, even on a limited scale, has been disproved by what happened in so many <Col N="1618" /> countries.  I believe we have here an opportunity to take warning from those events.  The protection of the life of the unborn should be absolutely copperfastened in our Constitution once and for all so that no legislation, no legislature can change it in the future, so that the protection of the life of the unborn cannot be changed by anyone for ever more in this country.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt &mdash; and many speakers have referred to this &mdash; that there have been several juridicial precedents in relation to the allowing of abortion, initially always on a very limited scale but finally always ending up with abortion on demand being available in other countries. For example, the termination of pregnancy, or the introduction of abortion, was legalised by the United States Supreme Court in 1973 on the basis of personal and marital privacy.  Essentially their Supreme Court ruled, in a series of decisions, that the foetus in the first trimester of pregnancy is not a person and that the State may not interfere with the personal decision of a mother to terminate pregnancy, a decision reached by her in consultation with her doctor.</P>
    <P>The Irish Supreme Court, in the case of McGee <i>versus</i> the Attorney General in 1973, established the legal right to contraception on the basis of marital privacy. Some legal experts have raised already the very strong possibility of this ruling providing a juridicial basis for legislation for the termination of pregnancy or for allowing abortion in this country in the future.</P>
    <P>As we are all aware, an increasing number of countries have introduced legislation permitting the termination of pregnancy in recent years.  Rather interestingly, initially the proponents of legislation advanced their cause primarily on medical grounds.  It was argued that certain pregnancies constituted a serious danger to the mother's life and health and that termination, or abortion, was an essential, indeed, life-saving therapeutic procedure.  Most responsible medical experts now agree there is no need or justification for termination of pregnancy or for abortion on medical grounds.  Most medical experts agree that most of them <Col N="1619" /> have never encountered a case in which it was justified to procure a termination of pregnancy in order to save the mother's life.  As a medical practitioner I can say without any reservation that I have never, nor has any of my colleagues, had occasion to deal with a case in which it would or should have been necessary to procure an abortion to save the mother's life.  As a result of this medical controversy the direction of legislation on termination of pregnancy has moved from what one might call medical to ideological issues, to questions of social justice and personal rights as interpreted by the Judiciaries in various countries. Gradually the emphasis on termination of pregnancy for medical and medico-social reasons has shifted.  Two new important ideas have come to the forefront. First, there is the idea of a woman's absolute right to control her individual pregnancy without reference to the father of the child or to her other children and without reference to the community at large.  Second, there is the concept of personal and marital privacy as legalised by the US Supreme Court in 1973.  I do not think any of us in this debate should ignore the tragedy of what can happen when abortion is legalised.  Abortion, to put it simply, is the wilful deliberate murder of the unborn, and it does not matter one iota whether the unborn foetus is normal or abnormal &mdash; every unborn foetus has the right to life.</P>
    <P>In the UK, an average of 450 abortions, or murders of the defenceless, are carried out every day; two million abortions took place in the United Kingdom since 1967 and it is estimated that 19 million abortions took place last year in the US.  In other words, more Americans were killed by abortion in the US last year than were killed in the number of wars in which the US was involved.  I feel sad to say that most of these abortions were performed by qualified medical practitioners who seem to have forgotten totally the Hippocratic oath, or certainly hold no allegiance to it.</P>
    <P>Last year throughout the world 55 million people were killed by abortion.  What a frightening statistic this is.  Only <Col N="1620" /> recently, President Reagan said that the anti-abortion movement in the US is a national effort to redress a great national wrong.  The figures quoted are absolutely horrifying, and the amazing thing is how few headlines they seem to have got.  It makes one wonder about the basic acceptance of certain so-called sensitive areas &mdash; that is a delightful description by some people of certain things &mdash; of man's inhumanity to man by allowing these terrifying statistics to pass virtually unnoticed. It seriously questions the credibility and humanity of all of us.  If 450 murders a day took place in any country other than the murders of the innocents, if 55 million murders took place throughout the world other than murders of the innocents I have no doubt that the media of the world would show it in banner headlines, yet the minimal amount of publicity given to these figures is something we should all be ashamed of.</P>
    <P>It is well to realise and to inform ourselves of the fact that termination of pregnancy, or abortion, is not without hazards of mortality and morbidity for the mothers.  For example, in England and Wales between 1970 and 1972, 37 maternal deaths occurred from legal abortions. As regards morbidity, the psychic trauma which can affect the woman on whom an abortion has been performed can have very serious consequences.  Ekbed in Sweden studied the cases of 479 women who had abortions performed and 25 per cent of them had immediate feelings of guilt.  Rather interestingly, it was noticed that one third of that group became pregnant again immediately in the follow-up period.  This was referred to by medical experts as the so-called atonement child, often interpreted by the medical profession as being an attempt to undo the guilt created in the mother's mind.  It can also be regarded as a creative attempt to recreate life.</P>
    <P>However, it is not always possible for a mother to respond to loss in a creative fashion.  Many women who have had abortions are not consciously aware of psychic trauma but they may have somatic or organic reactions to abortions. Some women who have had abortions develop depression or other psychosomatic <Col N="1621" /> symptoms subsequently, at the time when the baby would have been delivered had it been allowed to survive, or on the anniversary of the abortion. These are well established medical facts. There appears to be no doubt that a rather unique biophyschological and biophysical relationship, a unique attachment or bonding process, develops between the mother and the foetus at a very early stage of pregnancy.  The acute grief reaction observed in mothers who give birth to stillborn babies or whose babies die shortly after birth strongly suggests that significant bonding has occurred.  We have also seen this acute grief reaction in unmarried mothers who give up their babies for adoption, and this points in the same direction, exemplifying that this special bond has occurred in these cases also.</P>
    <P>Abortion can then be defined and regarded as a very important and traumatic interruption of a range of deep seated biopsychological and biophysical and social processes that commence at conception and continue to delivery and afterwards.  This traumatic interruption can cause many physchic, many physchosomatic and many somatic and organic illnesses all directly related to abortion. The concept of psychic numbing has been introduced to describe the closing off of feeling following a traumatic experience such as abortion.  Again, this psychic numbing as it has been called can give rise to many and varied symptoms at a later stage.</P>
    <P>The question of whether the foetus is a person became a very serious issue in the juridicial decision of the US Supreme Court in 1973.  There is no doubt that modern molecular biology regards the foetus as a genetically unique and dynamic human life.  At conception, the maternal and paternal chromosomes fuse and a new cell, the zygote, is formed. This is a unique and individual being. Jean Le Joune, Professor of Fundamental Genetics in the University of Paris, says that if a fertilised oocyte is not by itself a full human being, it can never become a man because something would have to be added to it, and we know this does not happen.  Science has surely <Col N="1622" /> answered the question of whether or not the fertilised ovum is a person.  Clearly the answer is that it is.</P>
    <P>We are living in an age when we are witnessing the decline of western civilisation, when the population of every western country is dying primarily because of abortion, the increasing use of contraceptives and, in most cases, the death rate exceeds the birth rate except here.  We have to ask ourselves do we want to see Ireland join a death queue with the rest of the countries in the western world.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are committed to supporting this amendment in a referendum.  I appeal to all the other parties in this House to stop vacillating on this important issue, to let us proceed with the adequate wording we have, and to stop confusing the public.</P>

      <P>I rise to speak against this amendment for a number of reasons.  I trust that my current 'flu and cold will not cause me to grate on the ears of the House.  Perhaps the two doctors seated across from me might offer me some medical advice as distinct from the unacceptable political advice I had to listen to for the past half hour from my friend and colleague, Deputy McCarthy.</P>
      <P>The task which faces this generation of politicians on this island on both sides of the divide confronted no previous generation of politicians.  At no time in our history has a generation had thrust upon itself such a responsibility and found itself without the kind of answers which were available in previous times.  It is truly frightening to be a politician in these times.  There seems to be a direct relationship between the increase in the level of the problem and the decrease in the range of solutions on the other hand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All of us in this House share one common bond, that is, our commitment to the democratic process.  All people outside this House are looking to us to solve democratically and peacefully the problems of which we are so painfully aware. We know that in all our constituencies in an invisible line standing behind us &mdash; and we have had to confront them and meet them at different times &mdash; is an <Col N="1623" /> array of people who put themselves forward as being capable of solving the problem in a non-democratic fashion to an increasingly growing audience of young people, and not so young people, and not confined to the Six Counties of this island.</P>
    <P>The House may ask: what has this got to do with the amendment?  I thank the Chair for his indulgence in allowing me to develop the argument.  I make that point to set the context within which we are currently debating this rushed and panic measure to change the Constitution in a most substantial way.  For what purpose? I would argue, as I have argued on different occasions in this House from different sides, that since 1921 the central problem at the root of all difficulties which the island of Ireland has experienced has been the unnatural division within this country.  It has prevented the evolution of what might be regarded as more normal or balanced politics.  In the South it has given us the legacy of a bitter civil war which still sputters and fires from time to time in a most unacceptable manner within the confines of this House.  North of the Border it has produced a narrow, tight, sectarian State which has had to repress 30 per cent to 40 per cent of its population simply to survive.</P>
    <P>The current difficulty of Partition is well known to Members of the House.  It has riven the Fianna Fáil Party from top to bottom since the arms crisis.  It has caused great dissension within my own party.  The Workers' Party are a product of a split on Northern Ireland and the Irish question.  For every hour of energy which we as politicians and democratic organisations give to trying to resolve that problem, an hour of energy is taken away from addressing ourselves to the real problems of health, education, housing and jobs.  It is doing more than that. It is costing us a fortune in terms of security, in terms of taxation raised to finance that security, in terms of the forfeiting of tourism and industrial development. This is the effect violence North and South, but particular North of the Border, has had upon our image abroad.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1624" /> That is the overall context within which a very small group of people were able to propose to an unsuspecting body of politicians the idea that somehow it would be very good to have a referendum to change the Constitution to copperfasten a bar on any legislation which would make abortion legal.  I have no doubt that they are sincere people, and that they are well motivated and highly moralistic. They were not politicians if they thought any political party, if they were a serious political party, were remotely capable of proposing to change the legislation governing abortion.</P>
    <P>They managed to blackmail &mdash; and I use the word advisedly &mdash; the vast majority of politicians and the two major political parties into signing the consent on their forms.  The timing of those forms was related to election time, and we all get nervous at election time.  Suddenly we find that the Constitution is to be amended hurriedly, with a clear commitment from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael most injudiciously given in my view and in the view of many people in the Fine Gael Party, notably Deputy Kelly.  After the most recent change of Government, in December of last year the Executive Council of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions issued the following statement in relation to the proposed amendment:</P>
    <P>The Executive Council has considered the proposal to amend the Constitution in respect to the right to life of the unborn and, in particular, the amendment proposed in the Bill issued by the last Government.</P>
    <P>The Executive Council believes that such an amendment is unnecessary and that it would be unwise and undesirable to proceed with it.</P>
    <P>The amendment to the Constitution is undesirable in that matters of this kind should be the concern of elected representatives in Parliament, and, in that statute law is the proper means of dealing with them as is the case in all democratic countries.</P>
    <P>It is unwise in that the rigidity and inflexibility of constitutional directives on social and moral issues is inappropriate in a democracy.  Indeed grave <Col N="1625" /> doubt about the wisdom of using constitutional prohibitions as a means of dealing with complex moral and social problems has already been expresed by one of the main Churches in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The amendment is unnecessary in that the position is covered by existing law and there is no compelling reason why it should now be dealt with by altering the Constitution.</P>
    <P>The wording of any constitutional amendment on this matter must inevitably be vague, uncertain and imprecise, something which is undesirable in a Constitution which purports to lay down basic rights.  It is particularly inappropriate that such an important matter should be the subject of arcane argument by constitutional lawyers construing language when it can be adequately dealt with by legislation under the Constitution as it stands.</P>
    <P>Congress has been disturbed at the emotional and at times hysterical manner in which the constitutional amendment has been approached in public discussion and particularly at the hypocritical way in which the two main parties have attempted to take advantage of the genuine concern of people with the grave issues that are involved. Political cant has been abundantly evident in the controversy.</P>
    <P>There is a pressing need for radical reforms in family law, particularly as regards marital breakdown and the rights of children.  These are matters that must be given priority attention. Legislative action here would make a significant contribution to human welfare and well-being and go some way towards ensuring that all our children are cherished equally.  Amending the Constitution in the way proposed will contribute nothing to improving the human situation nor will it help to resolve the dilemma faced by many thousands of women annually in this sensitive matter.</P>
    <P>I want to stress that what we are talking about is the reason and the argument for amending the Constitution.  It is easy for the proponents of this amendment to say that they are against abortion, and that that is the reason they are supporting the <Col N="1626" /> amendment.  Abortion is not the issue in this legislative debate, although I know that most people in favour of the amendment like to make out that case.  Deputy McCarthy devoted the major proportion of his speech attempting to make, as the statement from Congress said, a somewhat hysterical speech in relation to statistics of abortion throughout the world.</P>
    <P>Since abortion is illegal in this State, since there are no proposals to bring in any form of relaxed law in relation to abortion and since the vast majority of people are against abortion, it is most unlikely and most improbable that abortion will be democratically legalised here. I will return in a moment to the alternative fear expressed by some pro-life Members regarding the Supreme Court.</P>
    <P>I want clearly to lay down the first marker.  This debate is not about abortion. It is about using the Constitution in a particular way which reflects the private moral view of what happens in this instance to be the view of the vast majority of people on this island but doing it in what is clearly a sectarian way because a number of minority Churches have said clearly that they would prefer if the Constitution were not amended in this way.</P>
    <P>For that reason and because of my opening comments setting out the background in which all politicians have to work, I am opposed totally to this amendment or to any other similar amendment that will make the central task of politicians on this island more difficult than it is at present.  Rather than providing secondary evidence for recalcitrant Unionists in the North, as this undoubtedly will be so used, we should slowly and surely be dismantling any such evidence that would make it impossible for them to enter into discussions that would ultimately result in a new Ireland.  We have seen what the past the years have done north and south of the Border.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to any amendment. Therefore, for me, the discussion as to the formula of words is a secondary one and is not relevant to the central argument. Many talented and respected legal people have tried to work out a formula of words that would square the fine lines of precision embodied in judicial judgments <Col N="1627" /> with the vagueness and openness that surrounds the circle of moral views and they have found the reconciliation of both virtually impossible from the legal point of view.  That is the dilemma of the present Attorney General and clearly it was the dilemma of previous Attornies General.  Senior legal and medical experts have expressed the view, irrespective of their own views on abortion &mdash; the vast majority of them are against abortion as I am myself &mdash; that it is inappropriate and virtually impossible to use the Constitution as the instrument for copperfastening a ban on legal abortion. Let us be quite precise on this point, we are talking about legal abortion.</P>
    <P>Fear has been expressed by a number of people &mdash; Deputy McCarthy referred to it &mdash; that this amendment, if enacted in its present form, could seriously or totally interfere with certain forms of contraceptives in use in Ireland.  I am not a lawyer or a doctor and I do not have the expertise to express a technical view on the matter but I have listened to and I have seen the names of those who have expressed serious reservations about the implications from the point of view of health and family planning and also the legal point of view.  Their views should be taken into account but today I have not heard a sufficiently strong counter-argument from the other side nor have I read such a counter-argument in the debates that have taken place so far.  We have heard a lot of emotional speech-making on the horror of abortion.  This country, perhaps more so than any other in Europe, does not have an indigenous position on abortion &mdash; unlike Eastern Europe where it is regarded as a normal form of family planning, however brutal and appalling that may be to Members of the House.  That is the norm in Greece and Yugoslavia and parts of central Europe with strong Christian and Moslem traditions.  Since we have no great tradition of abortion culturally or historically, even going back to Celtic times, why is it that so many Irish women travel to England to have abortions?  Would it not be worth while to undertake research into this phenomenon?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1628" /> Most people recognise that abortion is a terrible decision for anyone to make and in a sense is an admission of a mistake. The best way to eliminate the problem is to eliminate the cause.  The way to elminate the cause is to develop proper comprehensive family planning measures in our society.  Despite the fact that we spend £1,000 million of taxpayers' money on health services, approximately 25 per cent of the total tax take by the Government in any one year, and more <i>per capita</i> on health and health care than any other European state, as Deputy O'Hanlon will agree, we spend little or nothing on family planning or research into what is happening.  We frequently boast that we have the highest rate of population growth among EEC countries.  We boast about it until the children who are the products of such boasts reach the age of six or seven years and have to go to school.  We then find we do not have the political will to raise the wealth necessary to provide schools, houses and jobs for them.</P>
    <P>Any change in the Constitution should be entered into slowly after much discussion and consultation having regard to the situation on this island and the difficult relations between North and South and Dublin and London.  I find it appalling that the former Taoiseach in what was manifestly a political ploy, should give a commitment on the dissolution of the Dáil last November to hold this referendum by 31 March 1983 and, equally so, that Leader fo Fine Gael should give an undertaking to match that commitment and say he would go along with it as would his party.  As a politician I can understand the motivation for that.  However, I thought that as a nation we were trying to get away from that kind of politics. As a ploy it did not work on either side.  We should honestly say to the people that in our heart of hearts this referendum is something about which no political party is very happy.  For reasons which they would prefer not to go into, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael were trapped or blackmailed into a position where they gave an undertaking which in a different time and a different island they would like to take back.  That is not to say either <Col N="1629" /> party is soft on the question of abortion.</P>
    <P>Of all the things that need changing in the Constitution &mdash; this House will agree on a few of them &mdash; this does not rank high in the list or priorities because there is no proposal to change the law.  Changing the Constitution will not change the reality of thousands of women travelling to England each year to have an abortion. Politicians on all sides have bowed to a certain devaluation of the democratic process because of this blackmail procedure. As recently as two weeks ago coming into the House, having indicated that I was against the amendment but also against abortion and saw a distinction between the two, I was accosted by someone who said: &ldquo;You cannot adopt the two positions and in any case we know you and you are not saying what you believe&rdquo;.  It is that kind of argument which has put many politicians reluctantly into a position of having to play safe on this issue.  As the argument unfolds and step by step is distanced from the separate issue of abortion and seen for what it is &mdash; an amendment on its own, independent of any other issue, to amend the Constitution to achieve a function for a particular purpose on behalf of a group at this time in our history &mdash; it is seen by many young people as further evidence of the increasing irrelevance of Irish politics and how much out of touch with reality the Legislature has become.</P>
    <P>I fear this House will again be tempted to take the safe, easy option and go for an Irish solution to an Irish problem. Like history which repeats itself in tragedy and in farce, this time the irony is that there is not even a problem.  It is an Irish solution to an Irish mirage brought about by a skilful group of people.  I admire the skill with which they lobbied politicians, not the methods they used. The effect they achieved must be admired.  I fear the damage they will do to our Constitution if they are successful as, regrettably, I fear they will be.  I also fear the damage they will do to the democratic process upon which we are dependent.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote from some of the speeches made on this subject to date.  I <Col N="1630" /> shall start with perhaps the most eminent constitutional lawyer in the House and in the State.  At column 1396 of the Official Report Deputy Kelly said in relation to Deputy Woods's speech:</P>
    <P>Where was there any reference in his speech to the legal emergency in this country ... which calls for this constitutional fire brigade action we are witnessing here today?</P>
    <P>Further down, at column 1400, he stated <i>vis-à-vis</i> the argument put forward regarding the claim that the Supreme Court would overnight somehow or other legalise abortion&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Leyden on Tuesday, 1 March 1983:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to ensure that, in accordance with the Broadcasting Authority (Amendment) Act, 1976 the broadcast treatment of current affairs by Radio Telefís Éireann, including matters which are either of public controversy or the subject of current public debate, is fair to all interests concerned and that the broadcast matter is presented in an objective and impartial manner.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As I was saying last night, the wording of this motion calls on the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in very specific and absolute terms to intervene in the programme making process of RTE.  There can be no other interpretation because however you analyse, dissect or parse the wording of Deputy Leyden's motion that is what it means.  Yet Deputy Leyden in the Dáil last night devoted practically all his speech to criticising my appointment because I might intervene.  Here we have the Dáil debating a motion calling for intervention and we have the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Leyden, boasting to the Dáil that once or twice since his appointment to the Front Bench he has intervened.  Then he goes on to criticise my appointment because I might intervene.  He uses as the basis of his argument my professional association in the past with RTE and my knowledge of that general area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised to find that knowledge of any subject is described by Deputy Leyden as a reason why one should not be appointed in that area.  This is a time of great chance in broadcasting and wireless telegraphy, the responsibilities which I have.  It is the most exciting and the time of greatest change in the last 21 years since our television station came on the air.  We have the necessary legislation to set up local radio and we must, simultaneously, <Col N="1632" /> end the pirate stations.  We have direct satellite broadcasting which has enormous and exciting potential for information-based industries here.  We also have massive new developments in cable television.  These are the reasons which motivated the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Mitchell, to seek the assistance of a Minister of State.  He cannot do it himself but he has the authority of the Taoiseach to do so.  To say that a person with certain specific qualifications should be ruled out is ridiculous. One might as well say that an architect should not have any responsibility for the planning of a housing estate because he knew something about it, or to suggest that Deputy Andrews could not be a Minister or a Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs because he has excellent specific knowledge of the area of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>With regard to interference, I believe that whatever knowledge I have acquired in this area, through my service in RTE, is a very good reason why I would be the last Deputy, with the possible exception of Deputy Niall Andrews, who also served in RTE, to attempt to interfere with programme making.  There are Deputies on all sides of the House who get a sudden rush of blood to the head about RTE programmes.  They believe there are presenters and producers there who spend their time plotting how they can help one party and demolish another party.  This judgment is often made after seeing one programme or even a bit of a programme.  The fact remains that anyone who has worked in RTE knows that the preoccupation of the presenters and producers is trying to devise the best possible television and radio programmes with constant and total unremitting regard to their obligations of objectivity and impartiality.  They have done a very good job.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden, as the basis for this motion, or perhaps as the excuse for it, has mentioned two programmes recently where there was no appearance by Fianna Fáil.  It is not a total bonus to appear on your own.  Perhaps it is if your material is good and if you have good <Col N="1633" /> presentation but it can also be an unmitigated disaster where your votes can evaporate through the microphone.</P>
    <P>I do not know why RTE did not have a Fianna Fáil representative on those programmes and I am not going to inquire because that is not my duty.  Nor would I inquire either if Deputy Leyden started popping up all over the place making as many appearances as Charles Mitchel.  I would not inquire because I have the utmost confidence in RTE to carry out their obligations in an objective and impartial manner.  I have confidence because of the constitution of the Authority and the excellent, distinguished people who are there but, mostly, because of the track record of RTE.  We have, as the Deputy knows, an official Broadcasting Complaints Commission set up in March 1977 and in all that time only 14 complaints were brought to this commission set up specifically and staffed for that purpose.  This is an excellent commission.  I have the honour of knowing one member, a very good friend of mine and a very distinguished public relations officer, Mr. Eoin Patton, and I know the value of the commission. In 12 of the 14 cases the commission found that the complaints were not justified.  In only two cases did the commission find against RTE.  One referred to the inclusion in the &ldquo;Gay Byrne Hour&rdquo; of grocery prices in supermarket chains and the other dealt with television coverage of a record produced by a commercial recording company on the Papal visit.  In five years, the commission found against RTE in only two instances.  That is not bad considering that the five years were probably the most volatile in politics in the recent history of the State.</P>

      <P>Deputy Leyden, in the course of his speech last night, referred to me as the Goebbels of the Coalition.  Fair enough. I have to hand it to Deputy Leyden that it was a very catchy line.  If it was fair enough for him to so refer to me then it is equally fair for me to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is in the vital interest of us all that the impartiality of RTE should be maintained at all times.  The statutory custodian of its objectivity and impartiality is the RTE Authority.  That Authority has done an excellent job under extremely difficult circumstances.  That job is made much more difficult by a fact that was not adverted to previously in the debate, the fact that it is in a monopoly situation. One can imagine the situation we would have here if there was only one newspaper. We can imagine the difficulties that would create.  Competition is perhaps the greatest of all guarantors of fair play all round.  That has been proved in Britain with the introduction of the second, third and fourth channels.  RTE have to contend with the monopoly situation as well, and that was an added burden as far as impartiality was concerned or the criticism of its impartiality. RTE have done well with the result that only 14 complaints were made to the complaints commission since 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The greatest threat to RTE is its own self-censorship, over reaction to criticism, <Col N="1636" /> perhaps of the type that may be expressed in the House.  RTE may try to balance everything to such an extent that we may get a totally mathematically balanced programme but an utterly boring one which would result in a switch-off situation where nobody could take offence because they would not be watching. RTE have an obligation to impartiality but Members on all sides have an obligation to ensure we do not in any way dampen the courage of the station to push out the frontiers, the parameters of programmes to make good programmes and good viewing.  In any respect, as a Member of the House or in any other way, they have my total backing in that.</P>
    <P>Last night Deputy Leyden sought to prove by his usual method of repetition rather than by fact or argument that somehow broadcasting had been moved to the Taoiseach's Department.  That is something that the Taoiseach deliberately ensured would not be the case.  The same goes for myself.  As a general principle it would not be a desirable thing that the person answerable at Cabinet level for what is of its very nature a very sensitive issue should be the Taoiseach. There is no problem with the Taoiseach and I am sure that there would not be any problem with the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party but, as a general principle, I am sure Deputies opposite will agree with my view on this.</P>
    <P>I am answerable in this capacity to the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, remains in charge.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have outlined it.  This will be the busiest period in broadcasting, in wireless telegraphy, in the last 21 years with the inaugurating of the legislation for local radio and the setting up of the independent local radio authority.  That may be worrying Deputy Andrews.  We must deal with satellite broadcasting also. The Minister does not have any function in regard to the content of programmes. That is totally the statutory obligation of the RTE Authority.  I cannot interfere <Col N="1637" /> and I have no right to interfere.  If there are any complaints they can be sent to the complaints commission.  I do not have any function in that area but perhaps Deputies opposite instigated a line in the past.</P>
      <P>I am clear as to what my approach should be and will be.  It is to exercise the functions of a Minister under the Broadcasting Authority Acts, as delegated to me, and to allow the RTE Authority to exercise its functions and fulfil its duties in accordance with the Acts.  The Minister has already spelt out those functions and duties in his speech and indicated the manner in which they should be handled. The statutory position on objectivity and impartiality and on fairness and balance can be stated quite simply: the RTE Authority, and it alone, is responsible for these matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have no reason to believe that the Minister's approach, which will also be mine, is any different from that of any of his predecessors.  I believe that the specific terms of the Act allow very little room for confusion or fudging of responsibilities. It is only the illogical contortions of Deputies opposite which enable them to display such confusion in their contributions to the debate and in their contradictory demands for involvement without interference in RTE's activities. During my days in broadcasting I was paid what I regarded as a pretty good compliment by a very fine lady who was partisan as far as party politics are concerned. That lady told me that she liked me because I was equally offensive to all sides.  I hope that with the passing of years and my maturing I have lost that offensiveness, but I have certainly not lost my impartiality.  I can guarantee Deputy Leyden, his party and the House of my total commitment as far as noninterference with the programme-making of RTE is concerned.  I am buttressed in that by my own experience there and the knowledge that if there is any stray, if by any chance a programme appears that is not balanced, it is not done deliberately. It is the kind of thing that happens in any human endeavour.  The statutory obligation as far as impartiality and objectivity is concerned is totally in the hands of the <Col N="1638" /> RTE Authority.  I am delighted to say that it is my belief that overall RTE have an excellent record and are doing a fine job.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I find the Minister's reply completely unsatisfactory.  It is quite incredible that he should come into the House and reply in the fashion he did.  He, like I, worked in RTE and he and I were colleagues in different areas of RTE, nonetheless with special interest in that area.  I worked in the field of journalism at one stage and for a brief period we worked together.  He was very successful as a journalist and broadcaster. The explanation he has now given does not befit his qualifications as a broadcaster and communicator.  I do not think he really believes that we on this side of the House would accept what he has said at its face value.  Perhaps in time we will be able to prove the point we are making now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of this appointment we might rename Radio Telefis Éireann &ldquo;Radio Telefís Neylon&rdquo;.  That seems a more appropriate title for them now as the Coalition Government take total control of this very important element of the media.  Probably one of the most dangerous decisions made by this Government to date is the appointment of Minister Neylon to the portfolio which he in a convoluted way has gone around telling us has to do with satellites, cable television and all the other developments.  In this delicate area at the best of times we need a man who is a professional in the area, who has experience of that area and to that extent Minister Neylon has those qualifications.  I am not in any way surprised that the Taoiseach should see fit to take responsibility from the great albatross he has around his neck, Minister Mitchell, who has not distinguished himself in previous portfolios.  Deputy Mitchell has shown himself to be insensitive <Col N="1639" /> and in some ways bloody-minded in his approach, particularly to people in the public service, a thing that I deeply resent.  To that extent I have no objection to the transfer of these powers to Deputy Neylon.  I have no doubt that the transfer simply indicates a lack of confidence on the part of the Taoiseach in his Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Mitchell.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt in my mind that while Fine Gael were in Opposition they concentrated much of their time, energy and money in propagating and developing a very good media-orientated machine in 51 Upper Mount Street, the Fine Gael headquarters.  There they had a propaganda unit of astonishing proportions and it was costly at that.  I admit freely that they brought into that unit some of the best PR and journalistic brains in the country, some of the best administrative people here, and they have used them to excellent effect.  However, we cannot lose sight of the fact that it was set up deliberately and these people were brought in and are now transferred at public expense to the Taoiseach's office.</P>
    <P>Let me explain.  Since the Government resumed office Deputy Nealon, the professional journalist and broadcaster, one of the finest in his day in that field, was initially given responsibility for the arts.  The former general secretary was appointed Government information secretary. To top it all, Minister Fennell was appointed Minister for Women's Affairs, and we all know what happened to her last week.  The icing on the cake was the ultimate appointment of Minister Nealon to take control of radio and television. Let us finish out what has happened with Fine Gael once out of office and now into office, with all these splendid, highly professional PR people.  It was not enough to have a former Government press and information officer and a close friend of the Minister publicly announcing in the press that he is interested in the vacant office of controller of programmes in RTE television.  I believe his intention is to use this office as a stepping-stone to his ultimate ambition to be Director General <Col N="1640" /> of RTE.  There you have the total connection in the media.  I have outlined it from the very beginning of the Taoiseach's interest in that area to his advisors who were previously in Fine Gael headquarters having now transferred to Government Buildings as a total propaganda unit.</P>
    <P>A Cheann Comhairle, let me come to the explanation you asked for and the withdrawal you sought of a remark by Deputy Leyden.  I do not want to enter into that controversy or into any name-calling across the floor at a former much-respected colleague of mine, Minister Nealon, but I believe that Deputy Leyden was talking about the magnificence of the machine that Dr. Goebbels had for propagating his party's information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>It succeeded in deceiving the German people and my fear is that the system now being developed in the GIS will ultimately have the same effect.  This is why I said at the beginning that the decision now taken by the Taoiseach to form this nucleus of a propaganda outfit calling itself Minister for Arts, Minister for Women's Affairs, Government Information Services and the RTE connection as I said earlier&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This is very satisfactory to those who defended General Eoin O'Duffy in the thirties and have written books praising them.  Deputy Manning knows all about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>What about Deputy Andrews himself?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Manning has no problem in reconciling these with his own political ideological viewpoint.  I know that and so does the House.  Those matters are on record.  This arrangement suits Deputy Manning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Thus you have absolute control of every future appointment that would be <Col N="1641" /> made to RTE directly approved by the Taoiseach's office itself.  Not since the President of France brought radio and television under his personal control in the Elyseé Palace has there been such a naked grab of control of such an important area of the media and ultimately an attack of major significance on the independence of broadcasting in Ireland.  In France the President has the last say and even the lowliest employee must have his approval before taking up an appointment.</P>
    <P>Now apparently we here are about to neutralise independent broadcasting in Ireland.  That is extremely dangerous.  I want once again to make it absolutely clear that I cast no aspersions on the professionalism of Minister Nealon, who has proved himself in every field of journalism he has ever undertaken to be a success.  That very professionalism and success are bound to cause fears on his appointment to the office of the Taoiseach in his capacity with responsibility for radio and television.  Deputy Leyden, quite rightly, pointed out these fears last night.</P>
    <P>There was some controversy in the House when the appointment was announced.  It smacked of someone pulling the wool over our eyes but discussion on the announcement was precluded by Standing Orders, as the Ceann Comhairle quite rightly indicated.  I welcome the initiative taken by Deputy Leyden in tabling this motion.  This appointment will alert politicians and the public generally to the dangers of totalitarianism and unfair influences in broadcasting.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State referred to the occasion when a Fianna Fáil Minister thought it necessary to ask for the resignations of members of the RTE authority. There is nothing to prevent the Minister of State doing the same thing and appointing a separate authority.  The initiatives taken by the Taoiseach and the Minister of State are extremely dangerous and the public and Members of this House would do well to monitor them carefully in the future.  We have been alerted and we must ensure that we <Col N="1642" /> inform ourselves of the facts about broadcasting.</P>
    <P>During the term of the infamous Coalition Government between 1973 and 1977 the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Dr. Conor Cruise-O'Brien, concentrated all his time and effort in trying to control broadcasting and extended his efforts to attempts to censor newspapers and letters from readers.  The editor of <i>The Irish Press</i> deserves great credit for his exposure of those attempts.  Dr. O'Brien now spends his time in <i>The Observer</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i> devoting his column almost exclusively to a rather ill-judged analysis of the Fianna Fáil Party, its members and its Leader.  Dr. Cruise-O'Brien is like the upas tree. Everything that falls in its shadow collapses and dies and nothing can grow there.</P>
    <P>We find ourselves in an untenable position, being asked to approve the new capacity being given to Deputy Nealon. We have been given no reasonable explanation for this change.  I find myself in the position of having to explain to the House what has happened at Fine Gael headquarters and how they have transferred at taxpayers' expense to the GIS. Newspaper commentators, reporters and editors have a special responsibility to expose the abuses that may occur in the future as a result of this appointment and viewers and listeners have an equal responsibility to ensure that the broadcasting service is impartial.  I have no doubt that the vast majority of producers and broadcasters will not allow indiscretions or diktats from the Taoiseach's office to go without note and protest.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay tribute to the very high level of professionalism shown by RTE over the years.  We as politicians are prone to be over-sensitive and overcritical of the contents of programmes which may not reflect our views.  This is only natural but it is of the utmost importance that politicians be informed rather than running off with the wrong impression. We must become more aware of the crucial need for the independence of broadcasting.  This discussion will make us more aware of the need for that independence. <Col N="1643" /> A review of section 31 of the Broadcasting Act is also long overdue.</P>
    <P>RTE are continuing to provide a first-class service of which we as a nation may rightly be proud.  They are doing so with the minimum financial support from the community.  The Minister of State might consider taking out of the hands of politicians decisions regarding requests by RTE for licence increases.  Perhaps that is just another form of control he and the people in the Taoiseach's Office would welcome.  I put the suggestion to him in any case.  RTE are in some financial difficulty but in spite of financial constraints they have provided in their drama department some of the most popular television programmes.  I instance &ldquo;The Year of the French&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Irish R.M.&rdquo;  They are now in a position where they cannot afford to produce more programmes of this kind and this is regrettable at a time of deep recession.  The arts are the only means by which we can relieve the bad news which seems to come daily from the Government benches.  I do not blame the Government for all the bad things or the tough decisions they have to take but we should support to a greater extent than ever the arts, the theatre, television, radio and entertainment for our people. Dublin Corporation intend to have a summer festival in the inner city and I congratulate them on their initiative.  I attended one such festival some time ago and it was a tremendous success.</P>
    <P>I warn this House of the dangers of putting RTE under the control of the Taoiseach's Department.  I regret this move and recoil in horror at its implications for the future independence of public broadcasting.  The Taoiseach would have been better advised to insist on legislation to deal with illegal broadcasting. Assuming this House will approve this amended motion, with the extraordinary turnabout by the Labour Party, I can only say that it is infinitely preferable that Deputy Nealon be given this responsibility rather than the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Deputy Mitchell.  I should be glad if the Minister would indicate exactly what his responsibilities are.  During the time of this Dáil we will have to find out <Col N="1644" /> exactly how many advisers have been brought into the Taoiseach's Office.  I do not believe they are known to the public.</P>

      <P>I do not believe what is happening in the House is desirable.  It is a retrograde step.  It is the first step to stifling independent broadcasting.  I know the difficulties of independent broadcasting and I know that politicians from time to time have been angered at different things.  I remember the RTE programme on money-lending and the inquiry we had into it subsequently.  I do not know if the Minister of State was a participant in the &ldquo;7 Days&rdquo; programme at that time but I believe that inquiry should not have taken place.  It did and we know the results.  Broadcasting has never been the same since then.  I hope that in due course the Government will reconsider the advisability of this.  I also hope that the alarm bells have sounded to the public about what is happening to public broadcasting and the independence of broadcasting generally.  I appeal to the Minister and the Government to bring in legislation quickly to deal with illegal broadcasting in this country and to improve relations between this House and RTE generally.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to understand why valuable parliamentary time is being taken up with the motion, which can only be described as mean, petty and paranoid.  It is a motion which has behind it a certain measure of cunning and foresight. It is a motion which was presented yesterday evening in terms which can only be described as offensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will take the last point first and get it <Col N="1645" /> out of the way.  Yesterday evening a Deputy whom I regard as a friend of mine more than once referred to the Minister of State as the Goebbels of the new regime.  Does the Deputy know the first thing about the history and personality of the Third Reich?  Does he know the first thing about Goebbels, a man whose name is synonomous with evil, mass murder, gross perversion of truth and brainwashing on a grotesque and unprecedented scale?  No matter what the Deputy feels, no matter what precedent he quotes, it was an appallingly and utterly untruthful parallel.  It does not do the Deputy any credit whatsoever in his efforts to fill the vacuum so recently created in the political life of his native county.  I know the Deputy, being the gentleman he is, will have the grace to withdraw that charge before the debate is over.</P>
    <P>What exactly is the basis of this frivolous and totally irrelevant motion?  What are we wasting the taxpayers' money on this evening?  As far as I can see, two weeks after the Minister of State took this job on the basis of three totally threadbare and totally incredible isolated incidents we have this enormous indictment so eloquently made by Deputy Niall Andrews of the beginning of the deprivation of all the rights of freedom of speech, the subversion of the independence of RTE and so forth.  It is all a load of ridiculous nonsense.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Was Herr Goebbels not also a director of propaganda and broadcasting?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There are three threadbare allegations.  First of all, that the Minister of State is ensconced in Government Buildings directly under the control of the Taoiseach to supervise the day-to-day operations of RTE.  He is there to ensure that a pro-Government slant is given to every news bulletin and every news item. This is the first part of the strong indictment which has been laid from the far side.  The second is on the basis of a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme dealing with school transport and the third is on the basis of a &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme <Col N="1646" /> dealing with the youth employment agency.  Those are the three legs on which this indictment is laid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>In one week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>It is an extraordinarily threadbare series of allegations.  Let us look at them in detail.  First of all, there is the allegation that big brother has taken over RTE &mdash; this is ludicrous &mdash; that the Taoiseach has taken over the running of the national broadcasting service.  Deputy Leyden spoke in sinister terms of the empty office in the GPO where there was only a token presence. He saw this as sinister and significant. How does Deputy Leyden know the office in the GPO is empty?  Has he a spy in there or has he some other means of surveillance?  It would not be the first time this sort of thing happened.  How does he know the office is empty?  Perhaps he will give us the source for saying that the office is empty.  Has he a 24-hour cover on the Minister of State to see where he works?  This is all ludicrous.</P>
      <P>When the Taoiseach was Leader of the Opposition and he named his shadow cabinet nine months ago he clearly signalled what his intentions were.  He clearly said then that broadcasting was a major matter, that it had been neglected and that there were major questions of broadcasting policy coming up for discussion. At that stage he nominated as his spokesperson on arts, culture and broadcasting Deputy Gemma Hussey.  He made it very clear that broadcasting would be associated with arts and culture when he came back into Government. That was not seen at that stage as sinister. There were people from the far side who saw it as the normal place for broadcasting away from the obsession with detail in an already overloaded Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  If, at that stage, those who were then in Government saw that as sinister why did they not speak out and voice their reservations?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was no comment whatsoever from the Government at that time.  It was not seen as sinister.  In fact, Deputy FitzGerald was then enhancing the status of broadcasting.  He was telling the House <Col N="1647" /> and the nation that broadcasting was sufficiently important to warrant a senior Minister with much more direct responsibility for the overall direction of broadcasting policy, of giving it really serious treatment rather than having it as an appendage to an already overburdened Department.  Somebody on the far side may say this was wrong in terms of political judgment or a wrong sense of priorities. The most that can be said about the transfer of the Department is that it represents an error of political judgment. That is the view of the people opposite. Our view is that it is sufficiently important to be given a special place with a highly competent senior Minister of State to direct the overall control of broadcasting policy.  The exercise of political judgment is what Governments are there to do and are paid to do.  As far as this side of the House is concerned the future of broadcasting is sufficiently important to be taken seriously, to be treated in a serious way, no more or no less.</P>
    <P>Let us look at some of the other programmes that were mentioned.  There was an attack on the programme on the Youth Employment Agency.  It was said that there was no spokesman for Fianna Fáil.  I also saw that programme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, you corrected me some time ago and asked me to keep to the substance of the motion.  We are on the Youth Employment Agency now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is referring to a programme on RTE dealing with youth employment.  If the Deputy was listening perhaps he would have heard it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The second prong was the Youth Employment Agency programme. I saw that programme and it was a very severe and very critical look at the Youth Employment Agency. There were economists on the programme who were highly critical.  The general thrust of the programme was critical and they did not need other politicians on it.  It most certainly was not a <Col N="1648" /> Government programme.  There was no Government stance whatsoever and I know those most involved were most unhappy with the severity of their treatment. There was no way in which that programme could be seen as being slanted or pro-Government.</P>
      <P>With regard to the programme on educational cuts and the fact that there was no Fianna Fáil spokesman on it, surely Deputy Leyden knows enough about his own post and about broadcasting to know that the whole question of balance in broadcasting can be achieved over a time, that you do not have to have a spokesman from every party on every programme.  With the same criteria as the Deputy outlined last night, we could have expected to have had a spokesman commenting on that matter of great national importance which obsessed the media and the airwaves in the past couple of months.  I refer to the troubles in Fianna Fáil.  Although Fianna Fáil were dominating the airwaves we did not seek to have someone appearing to put our point of view on the issue.  Deputy Leyden knows that the question of balance is one that can be achieved over a number of programmes by, for instance, one party having spokesman on the air a week or two after the other party had had a spokesman giving his views.  The question of balance is best left to the professional integrity and judgment of the broadcasters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>If the people opposite were to try to remove the Taoiseach they would get all the publicity they want.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leyden must know that a Minister or any other spokesman faced with interviewers of the calibre of Brian Farrell, John Bowman or Gerry Barry, for instance, will not be given an easy journey through his interview.  The Deputy must know that any such interviewee would be grilled by broadcasters of such calibre and grilled even more so perhaps than if an Opposition spokesman were present.  The attack on the two programmes mentioned was damaging to the integrity of the broadcasters involved.  By any standard, both programmes were <Col N="1649" /> objective and to suggest otherwise is both untrue and unjust.  There was no evidence in these instances of any kind of political interference.</P>
      <P>Last evening Deputy Leyden spoke, presumably with conviction and sincerity, of the professionalism of the broadcasting staff in RTE.  Deputy Andrews who had an extremely honoured career in RTE spoke also of the high standards and the professionalism of the station's broadcasters.  I agree that for a country of this size RTE has one of the best current affairs broadcasting teams in the world.  In terms of integrity, competence and ability people such as John Bowman, Kevin Healy, Gerry Barry, Mike Burns or Brian Farrell could walk into any broadcasting outlet in the world and take top jobs.  We are lucky as a country to have such people but despite this Deputy Leyden insinuates that the two programmes concerned were open to political pressure.  He as much as said that the programmes were influenced directly by pressure from the Minister for State. Everything Deputy Leyden said last evening flies in the face of what he said about the professionalism of the RTE staff.  Do Deputies Leyden and Andrews not think that a telephone call to RTE from the Minister of State or that any attempt by him to implant a stooge in any of these programmes would result in a situation in which within five minutes the phones would be hopping in every newsroom in Dublin and buzzing with the news of what was being tried?  Such interference would not be tolerated.  One thing that both the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party and RTE have in common is that they leak like sieves and within minutes the news would be out that an attempt was being made to implant someone for a programme.</P>

      <P>Even in the event of an innocent telephone call, the newsrooms of Dublin would be hopping with stories of the alleged interference.  I almost said the <i>&ldquo;ad lib&rdquo;</i> column but that would not be fair because it would mean the news <Col N="1650" /> would be accurate.  I am sure, too, that if an Opposition spokesman phoned RTE in an attempt to interfere in any programme, the news of that interference would be around Dublin within seconds and that within days questions would be asked in the House about the matter.  The Minister of State may have some faults but he is not so native as to think that he could interfere directly in the day-to-day operations of programmes.</P>

It is a blatant attempt to instil doubts about the impartiality of RTE.  It is an attempt to find a bogeyman in this administration and to nail him from the beginning.  This is on the basis that regardless of whether something is true, if it is repeated often enough and loud enough at least some of the mud will stick.</P>

In other words, you implant the big lie, tell lies about the man in charge, and in that way hope to create public unease and suspicion so that gradually people might begin to believe that RTE were not carrying out their statutory duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are witnessing by way of this motion is the beginning of a concerted anti-media campaign by Fianna Fáil arising out of the experience of that party during the past number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1651" /> To return to the question posed by Deputy Leyden: why should there be a Minister with special responsibility for broadcasting?  The answer must be very clear.  In the first place, this Government are extremely lucky in having one who has such wide experience and expertise in the area of the workings of broadcasting, both in a technical sense and in terms of the philosophy of broadcasting.  For that reason that person is placed in a position in which he can do most for the common good and in the interest of better broadcasting.  Much more important though than the qualifications of the Minister of State who is in charge of broadcasting is the fact that the range of problems facing the Irish broadcasting service in the next number of years is greater than at any time since the station's inception. Deputy Andrews has referred to some of these problems.  For example, there are the questions of pirate radio stations and of the sorting out of community radio.  There is the equally important question of the future financing of Irish broadcasting, of how we are to ensure that RTE do not continue to be a financial albatross.  We are faced with the problem of how the finances of RTE which were so shamefully neglected by the last administration can be straightened out so that the authority can be given back some measure of financial self respect.  In addition there is the very big problem of the future of cable television, a concept that has enormous implications for broadcasting here.  These are three areas that will keep the Minister busy full-time apart altogether from his additional responsibility for arts and culture and these are the reasons for our having a highly qualified, highly competent and experienced Minister in charge of this range of responsibility.</P>
    <P>Both Deputies Andrews and Leyden shed some crocodile tears about the impartiality of RTE but the facts are that there are statutory controls to ensure the impartiality of the authority regardless of what Government are in power. <Col N="1652" /> These statutory controls have worked extremely well in the past.</P>
    <P>Any infringements on RTE, such as under section 31, have been voted in by the elected representatives in this House, otherwise there are no infringements on RTE.  The controls to ensure impartiality are working well.  There are adequate means of redress for the public who feel that public taste has been outraged or that an injury has been done to them.</P>
    <P>Everybody could feel much more sure of redress and of having the truth broadcast by RTE, if something erroneous was said about him or her, than if it happened in certain newspapers &mdash; not all newspapers by a long shot, but certain newspapers. Anyone feeling that he or she has been wronged by RTE will get a fair hearing and if wrong has been done, redress will be made, and made quickly. We all know that.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are all sorts of internal control in RTE to ensure balance and fairness.  A point made by Deputy Leyden last evening was that there was a sense of professionalism.  There is no greater guarantee of impartiality and balance than the innate professionalism of the real broadcaster and real journalist in RTE.  They would be outraged at the thought of being used wilfully to propagate a party point of view, or put across the point of view of a Minister in Government.</P>
    <P>Secondly, those who work in RTE know that if they breach the regulations or push a particular party line, they may do it once, or perhaps twice, but certainly not three times.  The sheer pressure, firstly of the statutory controls and secondly of their peer group, those who work with them, will ensure that this will not continue and they know that very well.</P>
    <P>There may be groups, from time to time, who are said to have undue influence within RTE.  From time to time it is said that The Workers' Party have been over-represented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I am certain that any flash-in-the-pan appearance of political influence will very quickly be eradicated by the natural forces at work in RTE.</P>
      <P>We come to the question of proper supervision.  I feel a certain sympathy for the point of view that perhaps RTE are not sufficiently accessible to those who feel that they have a grievance and that standards of public taste or decency may have been breached.  I would like a more public and more accessible appeals and complaints procedure.  That could be worked out very easily.  I would like a far greater degree of competition between radio stations.  As a purely personal view, I would like to see RTE 1 and RTE 2 in real competition, rather than complementing each other.  That would sharpen up the quality of service.  It would not, in any sense, ensure any greater degree of accuracy or objectivity because they could not be improved upon at present.</P>
      <P>I genuinely deeply regret that this motion was brought in here last evening. It can only cast doubts over a service which has struggled well to do its very best to provide the highest possible standards at times of great financial difficulty. When we look at our broadcasting service, we can say certain very clear things about it.  We can say that it is credible.  If something is broadcast on RTE, it is believed.  That is the first and most important criterion of any broadcasting service.  Deputy Andrews referred correctly to the encroachments made upon French broadcasting.  French radio and television very often could not be believed, but that could never be said about our broadcasting service.</P>

      <P>Nobody could say that RTE have not a sense of balance. Nobody complained during the elections that there was not absolute balance as far as the parties were concerned and nobody has complained since then.  I defy any of the Deputies opposite to prove even one instance of imbalance over the last few months.  Maybe they will not be all Fianna Fáil in one programme and all Fine Gael in the next, but, by and large, balance is there.  Balance is seen to be there, which is what counts as far as broadcasting is concerned.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the statutory controls work and have been seen to work.  If there are doubts or worries about statutory controls over RTE, it is up to the Opposition to point them out, and the Minister, if he feels changes are necessary, can make these changes.  However, we do that here in this House, not by party sniping or trying to undermine the personal integrity and record of the man who is charged with the future of our broadcasting service.</P>
      <P>This motion is mischievous and in many ways has not been truthful.  There has been talk of the Minister having control over individual appointments.  No such situation exists, or ever will.  I can guarantee that this Minister will never once lift a telephone to call RTE, or make an internal appointment with RTE.</P>

      <P>The present motion is mischievous and irrelevant to any of the major problems facing Irish broadcasting today.  It has far more to do with the <Col N="1655" /> present internal politics of Fianna Fáil than with broadcasting or public policy. It has resulted in the time of this House being frittered away on issues which do not exist and on charges which are frivolous and imaginary.  It is difficult to see the purpose of this inept motion.</P>
      <P>I regret that a Minister of State who was successful in charge of the telephone service, who is so impartial, fair and helpful to people on all sides of the House, should begin his new role facing a motion like this, which will only cast doubts on the professionalism and integrity of Irish broadcasting.  It will initiate mud-throwing at a competent and honest Minister of State who is better qualified than was any predecessor coming to this job to help Irish broadcasting at its most difficult time.  If this is an indication of the destructive attitude we are going to see from the Opposition over the coming months and years, I can only regret it.  I hope that Deputy Leyden will recover from this aberration of judgment and that in future we will see him as he really is.</P>

      <P>I thank the Chair.  I want to congratulate the Minister on his appointment.  It is a good thing that somebody is taking charge of what is a great democratic art form of this century &mdash; television and radio.  In Ireland, television and radio have a very crucial role to play in the formation of a pluralist and tolerant society.  The different traditions in the island have a right to be cherished in art as well as in life.  Television and <Col N="1656" /> radio have a very important role to play in binding these traditions together.  In saying that I want to make the point that there is much more to balanced programming than political balance.  Although Deputy Manning believes that there is some sinister influence of The Workers' party inside RTE, if they are there I wish they would give us some time on RTE&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is true I wish they would come to the surface and give us a bit of help in there.  The staff of RTE do a top-class job in very difficult circumstances. It is essential that the new Minister ensure that there is neither direct political interference nor interference from the political appointees on the RTE Authority.  He should ensure also that the Chairman of the RTE Authority, who is a political appointee, does not interfere in programming, or in the day-to-day running of RTE.  It would be most unprecedented for the Chairman of the RTE Authority to influence directly any programming over the heads of the staff of RTE.  It must be remembered that if they go outside a certain code there is available a complaints procedure to ensure that they step in line.  Therefore, they should not be interfered with and censorship, either of the section 31 type or of the type at present being used by the RTE Authority, should not be tolerated. That is one major issue to which the Minister will have to devote attention, ensuring that those who have a high level of professionalism should be allowed to utilise that professionalism in the best interests of programmes and the general policy put before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to make two points in regard to the balancing of programmes which the Minister might also examine. I believe that the programmes on RTE <Col N="1657" /> are unbalanced.  There are two major types of bias in RTE programming, that is a class bias and a cultural bias.  The class bias is evident from the inordinate amount of time given to, say, farming, in programmes over the years.  Wherever we live we all know about green £s, MCAs, marts, the white scar and so on in regard to farming.  It has become almost a tradition, an acceptance that the farmers point of view must be put forward to the detriment of any other.  Generally speaking, there is a middle-class bias, a bias towards the self-employed and a business bias in RTE.  Is it not about time that time was given to trade unions to put the point of view of workers on RTE?  How about the environment in which they live and work?  Who knows about that?  It is never presented on RTE. For example, what do farmers know about the lifestyle and the working conditions of the ordinary worker?  What do they know about the dangers confronting them in their daily work, about accidents at work, about those who are killed at work, indeed about the conditions under which they work?  The farmer does not know and this creates a bias and counter-arguments in regard to urban and rural society, in regard to farmers and workers.  There is no opportunity afforded workers to put forward their point of view on RTE, their problems encountered at work or in their environment.</P>
    <P>The other bias I see on RTE is the cultural bias.  It has been a major matter of concern for a number of years that the number of programmes in Irish is declining. There is only one all-Irish programme on television, that is &ldquo;Feach&rdquo;. There are other programmes like &ldquo;Trom agus Eadrom&rdquo;, &ldquo;SBB ina Shuí&rdquo; and so on, but they are not all in Irish.  There is no all-Irish programme for children on RTE.  I do not particularly blame RTE for this at present because this reflects the attitude of Government, the attitude of Government to all-Irish schools: they do not want them, they do not want to assist them in any way.  This is shown in every attempt to set up all-Irish schools. If that is reflected in RTE by there not <Col N="1658" /> being any all-Irish programmes then it constitutes a major defect in the RTE policy and in the whole policy of the State and of our Constitution which dictate that Irish programmes should get full treatment on RTE.  I would ask the Minister to examine the attitude of RTE programmers and of the RTE Authority towards the Irish language.</P>

      <P>I just want to ask the Minister where this appointment leaves my friend and constituency colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan. Will he be reduced to the spectacle of performing the official opening of telephone kiosks and so on?  In my view this area of broadcasting was the most important function he fulfilled in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wonder who will have responsibility for the very controversial question of rebroadcasting British television signals to the west.  Who will have responsibility for satellite broadcasting? As the Minister may or may not be aware there is the ridiculous situation in which this new Department allows the rebroadcasting of British signals in the west despite the fact that the Minister informs us it is illegal to do so.  In fact there is the most ridiculous situation in which the Minister of State, Deputy Donnellan, receives BBC and UTV in his own home despite the fact that his Department say it is illegal to do so.  I have been following this question since coming into this House.  I have put down a series of questions to which I have received a series of most unusual replies.  For that reason I am now quite satisfied that the Department have not attached the importance they should have to this crucial question, that research is not being undertaken in the Department and that Department are way behind modern technology now available in the areas of rebroadcasting and satellite broadcasting.  I asked on numerous occasions in the House why this rebroadcasting was not being allowed.  I have been informed that it <Col N="1659" /> would be in contravention of copyright laws as laid down in international broadcasting, in particular that the BBC would have an objection.  However, in my most recent question, put down on 8 February, I asked when did the last discussion take place in order to sort out this problem. The reply was: &ldquo;My Department has had no discussions with the British broadcasting authorities on this matter in recent years.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>To me, that sums up the quandary the Department are in in relation to this matter. They say there have not been any discussions with the BBC in recent years, according to the reply of 8 February, yet I and many Deputies from the west of Ireland are being told that the system now in widespread use in the west cannot be given a proper licence.  I had a question on the Order Paper today asking the Minister if he is aware of discussions taking place between broadcasting authorities in regard to copyright procedures as a result of the development of satellite broadcasting.  I was informed by the Ceann Comhairle that this is a matter for RTE, that the Minister has no official responsibility in relation to it.  Perhaps it was the Ceann Comhairle who made the mistake but it is about time somebody sorted it out and that we were told who exactly has responsibility for negotiating on this question of copyright &mdash; is it the Minister and the Department of Posts and Telegraphs or is it RTE?  I had a question on satellite broadcasting yesterday. I asked what consideration the Department are giving to the possibility of proceeding with satellite broadcasting and when he is likely to make a decision on the matter.  The first line of the reply reads as follows:</P>
      <P>Broadcasting is only one of the services for which satellites can be used.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is an insult to my intelligence.  He went on to inform me that a committee will be set up to look into the matter.  The fact is that four countries in the EEC have already decided to proceed with satellite broadcasting.  Due to the efforts of Deputy Reynolds when he was Minister, <Col N="1660" /> Ireland made important progress in this regard when, at a Geneva conference some years ago, Ireland was given what was termed &ldquo;a footprint&rdquo; for satellite broadcasting covering Ireland and taking in parts of Britian and France.  Yet the Department have not been able to proceed as quickly as we would like them to do in relation to this very important service.  I want a clear indication as to whether rebroadcasting in the west of Ireland will be the responsibility of the Minister of State or if it is to be left to Deputy Mitchell or Deputy Donnellan.</P>

      <P>Contrary to what Deputy Manning has said about this debate I regard it as having been somewhat useful though it has not provided the replies I had sought.  This debate will be carried further in the days and months ahead because I have not been given satisfactory replies by either the Minister or the Minister of State in relation to the exact delegation of authority.  I have not been informed about the kind of authority that has been delegated to Deputy Nealon.</P>
      <P>I will refer briefly to the statements of Deputy Mac Giolla in relation to the alleged bias towards the farming community. It is a coincidence that we have constituents of mine in the Visitors' Gallery from the Castleplunkett area of Ballintubber who were involved in a recent programme on RTE dealing with the serious situation regarding brucellosis and bovine TB.</P>

Deputy Mac Giolla, representing a Dublin constituency, should try to appreciate the major contribution our farmers are making to the country.  If it were not for the farmers our situation would be far worse than it is.  Unfortunately they are not getting the fair slice of the cake they deserve.  I support fully any benefits given to farmers.  I support fully the right of RTE to give farmers and farming the <Col N="1661" /> place they are entitled to in the national broadcasting service.</P>

      <P>I should like to see the Minister going back to them but not in his role as Minister of State.  The Minister, Deputy Mitchell, came in here last night to comment on my contribution. He said my remarks were disgraceful. The Chair did not protect me but maybe the Chair did not hear the word &ldquo;disgraceful&rdquo;. That remark did not come well from the whiter than white, lily pink Deputy Mitchell.  When he spoke about interference in RTE he had a very short memory because he was one of the first Ministers to call the civil servants in his Department to his office and interfered directly in the day-to-day management of the Garda Síochána.  We cannot have great faith in his impartiality in the matter of RTE.  Before he begins to cast aspersions on any Member of the House he should look into his own heart from the point of view of his past performances, which he fully admitted.  I am warning him that as Fianna Fáil spokesman on Posts and Telegraphs I will not tolerate his interference in the management of RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will come to Deputy Nealon.  Here the mystery deepens all the time.  He has informed the House that he has been delegated responsibility and that he is in charge of RTE and broadcasting generally. On 18 February when the Taoiseach announced to the Dáil that he had appointed Deputy Nealon he told us he would have special responsibility for radio and television.  We all know we have but one broadcasting organisation, Radio Telefis Éireann.  Can we take it that until other responsibilities come under his wing, Deputy Nealon will have that responsibility?  When it comes to wondering about these situations we in the west of Ireland are not innocents. Deputy Nealon has very little work to do in regard to Arts and Culture because they are not well founded.  Therefore he will have full time to devote to RTE. Deputy Manning gave assurances to the <Col N="1662" /> House tonight on Deputy Nealon's behalf &mdash; I wonder how Deputy Manning can be so categoric; he is a very brave Deputy to give such assurances.  I do not know if Deputy Nealon has been out to RTE since his appointment, or whether he has dined with the RTE Authority, or the producers, or the Director-General. There are many ways to influence events in RTE.  He is an expert propagandist.</P>
    <P>In fairness to Deputy Nealon he did not take the offence others took to my passing good humoured reference to a certain notorious gentleman, broadcaster, propagandist.  Deputy Nealon has become used to cut and thrust of politics. He does not take offence at that kind of remark because he knows they were not made to cast personal aspersions on him. I would not compare Deputy Nealon to that gentleman except in so far as he has been a broadcaster and he has responsibility for propaganda.  As an expert on Eoin O'Duffy and the Blueshirts I am sure Deputy Manning also knows about Dr. Goebbels.  I know a bit about him as well.  As a Minister of State from the west of Ireland Deputy Nealon knows well that I was not casting aspersions on him. Deputy Nealon takes it in the spirit in which I put it to him.  Indeed I am sure he feels a bit complimented.</P>
    <P>Deputy Nealon has come to this position in a most unfortunate way.  The Taoiseach denied to our Leader, Deputy Haughey, that he had any intention of transferring responsibility for RTE to his own Department.  Instead, he went the other way and sent Deputy Nealon over to the GPO and an office is being prepared there at the moment.  The Taoiseach said it is a lovely office and it will be provided with lovely paintings.  I wish the Minister and his paintings every success &mdash; he has got more than I got when I was over there.  When the Minister of State gets his paintings over there in due course, I assume he will journey over and occupy the GPO as Minister of State in charge of broadcasting.  He is still attached to the Taoiseach's office.  If the Minister divests himself of that role we may take a different approach to the whole issue.</P>
    <P>My basic reason for putting down this <Col N="1663" /> motion was to try to clarify the position. No clarification has been given to me and, in those circumstances, I have no option but to call for a vote.  We demand total impartiality from RTE at all times. I have been impartial in relation to the participation by Deputy Mac Giolla in this debate.  We want fair play.  We have great confidence in the integrity of RTE but we have not the same confidence in the integrity of certain members of the Fine Gael Party who are experts in propaganda and who came up with the idea of putting one of the most brilliant broadcasters in Ireland in charge of this Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Chair for giving me permission to raise this very important matter on the Adjournment. As it is the first time I have faced the Minister across the House, I should like to congratulate her on her appointment as Minister for Education.  I hope that during her period in office, whether it be long or short &mdash; and I hope it will be short &mdash; she will get the job fulfilment she expects to get from her position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter I am raising refers to a small rural national school situated approximately two miles from Ballina.  It is a timber prefab building, possibly the only full prefab timber school in the country. It was started in 1967, when two rooms were built, and a further room was added in 1975.  It was constructed on a <Col N="1667" /> very damp site, despite the best efforts of the parents, who have put in a considerable amount of time and money during the years in an effort to make the ground and building suitable as a premises in which to educate their children.</P>
    <P>The parents are angry, frustrated and annoyed at the delay in completing the school or in getting information regarding the present position.  There was a meeting last Monday night and the parents decided reluctantly, after a long discussion, to withdraw their children from the school until they get some definite information on the situation.  They were influenced in this decision by the fact that one of the parents discovered that the roof of the building is no longer safe. They are going to put struts on the roof to make certain it does not fall in while classes are going on.</P>
    <P>This building actually creaks when there is a strong wind.  The INTO have found the building to be substandard. Toilets are completely inadequate and Rentokil are at the school on a regular basis because the whole area is infested with rats.  It is a common sight for teachers to have to bury dead rats.  There has also been an outbreak of gastro-enteritis in the school.  I am asking the Minister, although I know she has a very full schedule, to meet the parents to reassure them as to what the present position of the school is and when it will be possible to have contract documents drawn up.  I am asking the Minister to put pressure on the Board of Works to have these contract documents drawn up within ten to 12 weeks so that tenders can be invited at the end of June and work on the construction of the school could start at the end of October.  I am asking her if she can give a guarantee that this will be done because the expertise is available in the Board of Works, especially since the decentralisation programme has been cancelled and there are a number of architectural teams in the Board of Works at present.</P>
    <P>The parents are particularly incensed at the wrong information they got at the meeting on Monday night last.  They were assured that the sketch plans had been <Col N="1668" /> prepared by the Board of Works and had been sent to the Department of Education, but inquiries made by me on Tuesday proved that this was not so.  I do not know if the Minister has any up-to-date information.  These sketch plans were to be forwarded to the Department of Education today and I do not know whether that was done.  I am sure the Minister, as a parent, understands the anguish, fears and frustration that parents of children attending this very dilapidated school are experiencing.  I am sure she will also understand their annoyance. If she has the political will, she can pressurise the Board of Works to put the expertise that is available to work so that building on this school can start this year. I would be grateful if she would meet the parents so that she could assure them that work will go ahead as quickly as possible. I would like to thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me the opportunity of raising this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised that Deputy Calleary wished to raise the matter of Culleens national school on the Adjournment.  I know that the Deputy has given careful attention to this problem and that he is very well aware of the background attending the replacement of this school. The need for its replacement was considered in the early sixties.  At that stage there was a question of replacing three schools, one of which was Culleens, with a central school.  It was considered that this would take some time to bring about so it was decided in 1966 to replace the old Culleens national school with a two-roomed prefabricated unit.  A further prefabricated room was added in 1973 for use as a general purposes room, but this became a classroom in 1978 when a third teacher was appointed.  Culleens school is on the outskirts of Ballina and the question of its replacement had to have regard to the future development of Ballina in the Culleens direction.  Following the receipt of reports from the Inspector, the Department agreed to the replacement of the prefabricated schools by a permanent building in 1979 and the chairman of the board of management was <Col N="1669" /> informed of this decision on 26 June 1979 With the minimum of delay, the chairman responded by offering three sites for consideration on 23 August 1979.  From that date until 25 November 1982 there was a protracted dispute involving various local interests, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, about the site.  There were problems encountered by the reverend chairman and the local parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 25 November 1982 the reverend chairman advised the Department that he had completed the purchase of the approved site.  Sketch plans have been completed by the Commissioners of Public Works.  They are on their way to my Department and I can assure the Deputy that I will do everything in my power to have those sketch plans urgently cleared and approved by my Department.  The Deputy, being an engineer, will understand that you cannot plan a school until you know where you are going to build <Col N="1670" /> it and that various planning and other stages are required before a school can be brought to a point where construction work may commence.  I am glad to say that the question of a site has been resolved at local level.  There is nothing to prevent this project from making normal progress towards completion.  I again assure the Deputy that all urgency will be insisted upon at my level in the matter.</P>
    <P>I am advised that parents have kept their children at home in protest at an alleged long delay between offering of a site and preparations for plans.  Now that I have made the facts quite clear, I trust they will be aware that there has been no undue delay on our part and that they will return their children to school because I am sure that the parents of County Mayo are very sensible and responsible and will do that.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 3 March 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health if he will confirm that the maternity unit at Trim Hospital, County Meath has been closed; and, if so, the reasons for its closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I conveyed my consent to the proposal of the North-Eastern Health Board to close the maternity hospital in Trim on 20 January last.  I did so because I found the case for closure to be compelling.</P>
      <P>First of all, the number of births in the hospital has been declining steadily, for example, from 222 births in 1979 to 116 in 1982.  There were only seven births in the hospital in January last.  By contrast the number of births to mothers from County Meath averages between 2,100 and 2,200 each year and for the most part these are delivered in the maternity units in Drogheda and Dublin.</P>
      <P>Secondly, it is generally medically accepted that it is safer to have babies delivered in a consultant staffed unit.  The hospital in Trim is served by a part-time medical practitioner only and does not have the support facilities such as paediatric, medical, surgical, pathological and radiological services of a consultant staffed unit which nowadays have come to be regarded as essential for the wellbeing of mothers and babies.  As a result of this serious concern has been expressed about the safety of patients in the hospital at Trim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, I am concerned at present in a situation of extreme financial stringency that non-viable services be discontinued and the resources deployed to provide services for which there is a greater need.  The closure of the maternity hospital in Trim will enable a much needed geriatric facility to be opened in the nearby geriatric hospital.  In addition the Health Board is proceeding to provide improved out-patient consultant staffed clinics in Trim for maternity patients.  In fact I have made available a grant of £15,000 for this purpose to which the board is adding up to £20,000.  I understand that the health board have <Col N="1537" /> ceased to take in new patients to the unit with effect from 1 March and it is expected that the patients already in the unit will be discharged by 4 March.</P>
    <P>I should emphasise that there will be no job losses as a result of the closure and the staff have willingly co-operated in their transfer to work in the extension to the geriatric hospital.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to pay-related with unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that the sum of flat-rate unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax rebate may not exceed 85 per cent of the claimant's average net weekly earnings.</P>
      <P>The 85 per cent limit of the person concerned amounts to £61.14.  As the amount of flat-rate unemployment benefit payable to him exceeds this sum pay-related benefit is not payable to him.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed under the general maternity benefit scheme in respect of her confinement expected on 26 January 1983 and she was awarded maternity allowance from 20 December 1982.  The first payment issued on 4 January 1983 and payments are continuing at regular weekly intervals.  She is entitled to pay-related benefit at the weekly rate of £2.15 from 3 January 1983, the 13th day of the claim, and all pay-related benefit due to date has been issued.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pay-related benefit is calculated on a person's reckonable earnings in the last complete income tax year before the beginning of the benefit year in which the claim commences.  The maternity benefit claim commenced in the 1982 benefit year and the relevant income tax year was accordingly the 1980-81 year.  Under the <Col N="1539" /> regulations that year is the relevant year for the full duration of the person's claim.</P>
    <P>The claimant's average reckonable weekly earnings in the 1980-81 income tax year were £33.80.  The flat rate allowance payable to her is £31.65 per week and her pay-related benefit is £2.15 per week which is the difference between £31.65 and £33.80.  The regulations provide that the amount of pay-related benefit may not exceed the amount needed to bring total weekly entitlements up to the reckonable weekly earnings figure.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will accede to the request of Galway County Council which was made in November 1981 to proceed with the preparation of contract drawings for zone 3 of the mid-Galway regional supply scheme which will provide a proper water supply for Athenry town, County Galway.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>Preliminary proposals for zone 3 of the mid-Galway regional water supply scheme which included provision for serving the town of Athenry, were submitted to my Department in November and December 1981.  In a letter to Galway County Council dated 9 March 1982, my Department recommended that contract documents should not be prepared for the scheme in view of the lack of major group water scheme demand and the long-term nature of the proposals to augment the water supply to Athenry. This position remains unchanged.</P>
      <P>As an interim measure to improve the water supply in Athenry, Galway County Council have now submitted a proposal, under the 1983 small schemes programme, to develop a new borehole at Athenry at a cost of £15,000.  I hope to determine the council's small schemes capital allocation for sanitary services shortly.  It will then be a matter for the council to decide whether to proceed with the borehole development at Athenry this year.</P>

      <P>The total capital provision for sanitary services for 1983 represents an increase of 17 per cent on the corresponding provision for 1982.  I hope to be in a position shortly to determine the allocations for individual authorities including Galway County Council.  The allocation for Galway County Council will include provision for the funding of the Athenry sewerage scheme for which a loan was sanctioned on 11 January 1983.</P>

The preparation and submission of contract documents, together with completion of legal formalities, is a matter for Galway County Council.  The question of a financial commitment does not arise at this stage.</P>
      <P>Proposals to improve the water supplies to Athenry, Craughwell, and Kinvara have been included in Galway County Council's small water and sewerage schemes programme for 1983.  I hope to issue a capital allocation for small schemes shortly.  It will then be a matter for Galway County Council to decide whether or not to go ahead with the schemes for Athenry, Craughwell and Kinvara within their small schemes allocation for the current year.</P>

      <P>On the basis of a review of the proposals for arterial drainage in 1983, it has been decided that a provision will be made in the Vote for Public Works and Buildings to allow work on the Boyle and Bonet schemes to proceed.  In addition specialist studies already in hands, which are required in connection with the design of the Dunkellin scheme and to which the Commissioners of Public Works have contractual commitments, will continue. In the circumstances the saving of £2 million will be achieved by reapportioning the funds available for arterial drainage among the various drainage projects. I am not yet in a position to give precise details as to how these funds will be reapportioned.</P>

      <P>The outcome of the second national review of the boundaries of the disadvantaged areas was announced early in 1981 and it is assumed that the Deputy's inquiry relates to any negotiations which might have taken place since then about further adjustments to the disadvantaged areas, including the more severely handicapped parts of those areas.</P>
      <P>Informal discussions were held with commission officials on this subject early in 1982 and on a number of occasions subsequently, but more formal negotiations will have to await the outcome of the boundary review which is at present being carried out.  In the latter connection I would refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave on 15 February to a question on this subject.</P>

For a number of reasons I am not prepared to name any particular date for the transfer of the prisoners from the Curragh.</P>

      <P>As the statement received little or no publicity I now have under consideration other means of drawing public attention to the situation.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that in these circumstances it would not be helpful for me to make any comment at the moment about the possibility of legislation being introduced to allow for some extension of the scheme.  I should like to urge all ground rent lessees who wish to buy out their ground rents to set matters in motion while the scheme as provided for in the 1978 Act &mdash; with its nominal fees &mdash; is in operation.</P>

      <P>The number of applications received for grants under the audio-visual aids scheme in 1982 far exceeded the total funds available. It was necessary, accordingly, to give priority to schools which had not received a grant under the scheme in 1980 or 1981.  Loreto school, Foxrock, received such a grant in each of those years and it was not possible to offer a further grant in 1982.</P>
