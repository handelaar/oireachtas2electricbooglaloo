    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews.</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if, in view of the controversy following the participation of our Defence Forces in the British Legion Memorial Day Services, the Government will consider nominating a given bank holiday as a national commemoration day, remembering all those Irish men and women who gave their lives in times of war and conflict, both at home and abroad, in defence of their convictions; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This was done in 1974 when the Government decided to nominate Saint Patrick's Day for the purpose. It was not taken up generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I should explain that Deputy Niall Andrews is abroad on party business and that no discourtesy is intended by his not being here.  Would the Taoiseach accept that for many people who intend no disrespect to anyone the Poppy Day ceremonies, as they are popularly known, have unacceptable associations and connotations and would he now consider an approach to this question <Col N="3" /> on an all-party basis, taking the initiative to endeavour to arrange some new ceremonies on a different day at a different time of the year, ceremonies to which all Irish men and women could subscribe?  In this way we could honour the memory of all those who died for any cause in which they believed sincerely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>This is precisely what the then Government did in March 1974 when the Taoiseach of the day wrote to the Church leaders referring to a decision for a day of national commemoration and suggesting that services on that day might include special prayers followed by silence for all who lost their lives as a result of war or civil strife.  He also notified them that the President would be broadcasting a message on radio and television. That message was broadcast and included the statement that for that year and for the future they would be asked to make Saint Patrick's Day a day of national commemoration, a day on which we would remember all those who died for Ireland and all victims of civil strife in Ireland.  Unfortunately, the matter was taken up by the then Opposition and although a Minister in the then Government, the former Deputy Donegan, said in the Dáil at the time that in his view the people of the country were very satisfied that we had set aside one day as a day of national commemoration, Deputy Molloy, on behalf of his party, said that this was not acceptable to the people at all. That is where we stand.  Where we go from there is a matter for further consideration, but it is in the light of these circumstances and the fact that these ceremonies have continued with representation from both Governments and in an improved form this year that we have the present situation.  I do not accept that the improved ceremonies this year which took a different form, one that was less redolent of one particular tradition, were objectionable.  On the contrary, I consider it to have been a step forward and I do not understand how the Deputy's party, having rejected the idea of a national day of commemoration, having ensured attendance in Saint Patrick's <Col N="4" /> Cathedral in different circumstances and under different flags and emblems, have any difficulty about agreeing that the Government be represented there under the flag of the United Nations.  Therefore, I find the attitude of the party opposite to be inconsistent and very far from being in the spirit I would hope we would all show in seeking a genuine reconciliation of the two traditions on this island.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Taoiseach has been partisan about this matter which I approached in a non-partisan way.  I would ask him to accept that for some of us, rightly or wrongly, the Remembrance Day ceremonies under the auspices of the Royal British Legion do hold connotations which are unacceptable to us.  Would he accept also that the events he is talking of are now more than a decade past and in a totally open-minded and non-partisan way would he, as head of the Government, be prepared to enter into consultations with the other parties with a view to finding out if some new development can be initiated?  In that connection I would remind him that on a number of occasions different heads of Government, certainly one or two, attempted to initiate a system of awards for distinguished service to the nation but that unfortunately these initiatives fell on stony ground.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not raising that issue.  I merely wish to remind the Taoiseach that the initiative was tried a few times but that, perhaps through no one's fault, it did not succeed.  However, in matters such as these we should try again and that is why I am asking the Taoiseach to consider seriously the proposal I am making.  He will find a broad degree of acceptance, I am sure, in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not being partisan, but we are in the situation we are in because of historic events.  We endeavoured to have one national day of commemoration <Col N="5" /> but, unfortunately, for the reasons I have given, we did not succeed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of recent events, of the attitude shown to and of some things that have been said about the ecumenical services in St. Patrick's Cathedral, I do not consider this to be the best moment at which to seek to reopen the matter in this way because in seeking to do so and by responding to the Deputy, I could appear to be reflecting on the arrangements that were made for this ecumenical service and I would fear that in approaching it in this way at this time the damage which I believe has been done in relation to the two traditions could be aggravated.  I do not exclude the question of looking at it again in the future, but it would be better if we let it lie without controversy for a few months before we come back to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he will arrange for the attaching to the next official printing of the Constitution containing amendments made since the last such printing, of an appendix containing the Transitory Provisions Articles 51-63, last officially printed in 1938.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am arranging to have the matter considered in my Department and I will communicate with the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach ask his Department to confirm that one of his predecessors, the former Deputy Lynch, gave a similar undertaking some four years ago?  This is a very small matter measured against the very prodigal use of printing by the State in every other context, but the Taoiseach might agree it is strange that part of what was enacted as the Constitution &mdash; even though transitory and a very small part &mdash; is not officially available in print, nor has it been for a generation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="6" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Starting from scratch and knowing nothing about this, I must say I would have shared the Deputy's puzzlement over this.  The reason why there is a problem is because the Constitution provides that the transitory provisions must be omitted from all official texts of the Constitution which are published. The Deputy's question related to attaching to the next official printing of the Constitution containing amendments made, an appendix containing the transitory provisions, but there is some doubt as to whether attaching them in any appendix to the Constitution would or would not constitute its inclusion in an official text of the Constitution.  Therefore, the question arises as to whether they might not best be published separately. I would like to be clear which is the best way to proceed constitutionally before taking a final decision, but I can assure the Deputy that one way or the other they will be published.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach consider that this might be overcome and any possible legal difficulties surmounted by printing these few provisions, even as a separate leaflet which might be offered to the public side by side with the official text, even if not actually included?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be perfectly agreeable to that.  The only hesitation is that I would like to establish more clearly whether there is a real inhibition against their inclusion as appendix as suggested by the Deputy before I take the alternative and, from a practical point of view, less preferable course of printing them separately.  A decision will be taken in the near future and one way or the other they will be printed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach feel that he would be justified in spending public money printing transitory provisions which are now of no effect whatsoever and, while they may be of interest to professors of jurisprudence in Academe, surely these learned institutions should go to the expense of publishing them themselves because at this stage <Col N="7" /> they are of interest only to professors and their students?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand they are of interest to the courts.  From the information supplied to me they have been involved in a number of cases up to and as late as 1973, or possibly even later. There were seven cases in all where these transitory provisions have arisen.  It seems most unsatisfactory that this material is needed for the hearing of constitutional actions right across the decades, and up to relatively recent times, they could be required again, and they are not available in print.  The small cost involved is, I think justified in view of the importance from a continuing point of view of these transitory provisions.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated to the House on 10 May 1983, when a similar question was asked by the Deputy, I propose to leave to one side the question of the constitutional review until the New Ireland Forum has completed its work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to the constitutional crusade which the Taoiseach said in September 1981 he intended to pursue.  The question of a constitutional review is slightly different. Has the Forum as yet discussed the question of the Constitution?  If not, when does it intend to discuss it?</P>

      <P>Questions on the Forum are not appropriate for discussion in this House.  The debates to which the Deputy is referring are being held in private at present and we will be producing a report in due course.  I am not sure that I understand his distinction between the words &ldquo;constitutional crusade&rdquo; in his question and &ldquo;constitutional review&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;crusade&rdquo; came in because when I was interviewed on this subject on a radio programme the interviewer referred back to the use of the word &ldquo;crusade&rdquo; in a different context with Deputy Lenihan a few days earlier.  I used it consequently in an ironical or self-deprecating sense which may not have been publicly understood.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I am simply making the point that, in view of the issues which arose in the referendum campaign, the <Col N="10" /> degree of sectarian feeling that emerged at that time, and the unfortunate, unspeakable atrocity which occurred at the weekend which arose from sectarian feeling, there is a need for parties in this part of the country to engage in a crusade of some kind to overcome the sectarianism which exists in Northern Ireland and in the Republic.  Regardless of what the Forum is doing, will the Taoiseach engage in some form of crusade to encourage people to think of politics in a non-sectarian way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand and sympathise, in a general way, with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy and in anything I say or do, I will endeavour to diminish the sectarianism which exists in our country and which has had such appalling consequences over the last decade or so.  At a time when in the Forum three parties in this House and the SDLP in Northern Ireland are considering together the whole question of how we secure peace and stability in this island it is right that I refrain from particular proposals or initiatives or even speeches which might be in any way divisive or make it more difficult for the parties to reach a consensus which I hope they will reach.  If they can reach a consensus the proposals for peace and stability in this island would necessarily involve facing up to the issue of sectarianism.  The benefits would be very great and I would do nothing that would endanger any such outcome.</P>

      <P>(<i>Dublin North-West</i>): Is the Minister aware of the increase in the number of persons who have been diagnosed as coeliacs?  Is he aware of the hardship this has caused to those people because gluten-free bread and bread products cost 50 per cent more than ordinary bread and bread products?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>While not seeking to diminish in any way the Deputy's concern for people who fall into the category he is interested in, I would point out that the bread subsidy is such as to provide for <Col N="13" /> the consumption of ordinary batch and pan bread.  If, as I understand is the case, the gluten-free bread is for medical purposes it would be a matter for the Minister for Health, not for the bread subsidy.</P>

      <P>and <b>Mr. Molony</b> asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will introduce a new system of price control for the retail sale of petrol and petroleum products, the principle of which would be to align the maximum Irish price with the average EEC price allowing for valid currency exchange differences, or to align the maximum Irish price with the price in any particular competitive market; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies will be aware that the National Prices Commission have at my request undertaken a review of the price control arrangements for petroleum products.  I understand that in the course of this review the commission have been examining alternatives to the present cost-related system of price control which include those suggested in <Col N="14" /> the question.  When the commission make their report to me I will consider carefully their recommendations on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that the NPC have had quite an amount of time within which to come up with the report?  When does he expect the report?  He told us some months ago that he expected the report shortly.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a question of a report.  At the moment consultations are taking place with the various oil companies, the NPC and the appropriate companies. At the end of that series of discussions, which are of an inquiry nature, the recommendation will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of his answer to my last question, can the Minister indicate whether the review that was taking place in the NPC on price control in relation to petrol prices has been abandoned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I do not know how the Deputy can come to that conclusion. In fact, some short while ago I agreed to allowing a price increase to the oil companies only in respect of fluctuations in international currency, and any other increase which they have made application for was deferred and, I indicated clearly to them, would be deferred until the outcome of the NPC investigation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that in the prices published in Brussels on 17 November of this year the price of petrol in this country is still away above the EEC average and is by far the highest in the EEC?  Is the Minister aware that the CII in the September issue of <i>The Irish Banking Review</i> have asked for a review of the present system of price control and for a review of the scheme which Deputy Manning and I proposed in the question? Finally, is he satisfied that the NPC are the appropriate body to review those procedures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of questions have been raised.  First, I am satisfied that <Col N="15" /> they are the appropriate body.  They have done an effective job taking all factors into consideration.  The question raised by the Deputy about the EEC figures was raised repeatedly in the past.  Repeatedly I pointed out that Deputies are not comparing like with like.  A number of factors which are applicable in this country are not necessarily applicable in other countries. For instance, there is the margin for the retailer which is somewhat higher because of the isloation of some of our retailers and their distribution costs which are not applicable in other countries. There is the question of Whitegate. A number of other matters enter into it. Despite my advice to the Deputy and his colleagues that they should be aware of the fact that they are not comparing like with like, and that they are distorting the actual situation, the same question continues to be posed.  My answer is the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  Whatever circumstances may justify a higher price for petrol here than in other EEC countries can the Minister explain why the difference in price over the past few months has varied from a high of 33 per cent to a low of about 12 per cent or 13 per cent?  The difference has varied by that much.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickPower" hpid="Mr. Power Mr. Power">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Power</NameTxt>

      <P>In answer to both supplementary <Col N="16" /> questions I can assure the House, as I have done previously, that every aspect of the pricing of oil produce is taken into consideration by the Prices Commission.  They are finalising an inquiry into the price of oil produce.  They have not excluded any approach including that suggested in the question.  When this question was being pursued some months ago, a detailed statement of all aspects of oil pricing and the approach to it was supplied to Deputies.  The criteria have not been departed from, but some people are excluding a number of factors, some of which I have mentioned, which are applicable here and are not applicable in other EEC countries.</P>

Copies of the orders referred to in the schedule are available in the Dáil Library.  Notice of the making of these orders and, as appropriate, details of the maximum prices are advertised in the national daily newspapers.  In addition, details of the maximum prices are readily available to the public if they contact their local Priceline Office.

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for telling us where notice of these maximum pricing orders may be obtained.  At the same time, the number and the details of the maximum pricing orders made by him and his Department are not available to the general public.  I do not regard a small notice on the back page of a Saturday newspaper as a satisfactory means of informing the public. The Minister might have special notices printed showing all the maximum pricing orders and displayed in post offices and social welfare offices.  Would he agree that this would be desirable?</P>

      <P>A magazine called <i>Inform</i> prints these maximum retail pricing orders and charges a little fee.  I do not think it should be necessary for the general public to have to purchase a document such as this to be made aware of maximum pricing orders on some 20 to 24 items.  Because of the fluctuations in prices in various retail outlets, the Minister should consider taking steps to have printed for distribution a document such as the one to which I referred.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware of the views which have been expressed in recent times by organisations representing wholesalers and independent retailers in the grocery trade concerning difficulties being experienced by them and suggesting that measures should be taken to limit the development of supermarket multiple groups.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="20" /> I have had discussions and meetings with the various interests involved in the grocery trade including retailers, distributors, multiples and manufacturers and expect to be in a position to make a statement on the matter shortly.  I wish to make it clear that in coming to conclusions on these matters my mind will be influenced primarily by the interests of the ordinary consumer whose welfare depends so much on the maintenance of an efficient distribution system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that four multiples control about 80 per cent of the total food retail trade in the city and about 50 per cent of the national food trade.  Is the Minister aware that, since 1966, about 6,500 independent small retailers have gone out of business? Is he aware that some 10,000 jobs were lost because of the increased potential of the multiples to take control of the trade? Will he give us an immediate assurance that he will take the necessary legislative steps to deal with this?</P>

Will the Minister take immediate steps to rectify the situation?</P>

While there is, and has been for some time past, a difficulty for small business people in the grocery trade, I have met all the interested parties concerned.  I have had discussions with them and, on the basis of these discussions and with the overriding consideration of the interests of the consumer, I shall be making a decision in the near future regarding this matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume the Deputy is referring in the question to the insolvency of companies, rather than of individuals. As regards company insolvency, I will be seeking Government approval shortly to an outline set of proposals which will form the main response to the commitment given in the Joint Programme for Government to curb abuses in the field of company law.  The proposals involved will inevitably include attention to the question of company insolvency.</P>
      <P>Deputies will be aware that the question of dealing legislatively with insolvent individuals, as opposed to corporate bodies, is one for the Minister for Justice.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister assumes properly.  I was referring to the question of insolvency of companies to which he had referred.  He has stated that he will be bringing forward legislation.  Would he give an indication when he might be in a position to bring it before the House? There are quite a number of people at the moment who feel that the legislation might very well penalise those whose actions, though imprudent, were not fraudulent and would he consider not taking a strong line in that area?  I ask the Minister not to involve companies in additional administrative costs which they might not be able to bear and to keep that in mind when framing the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy that all factors in relation to the subject will be borne in mind in drafting the legislation.  Unfortunately, a large number of companies have gone into liquidation and the main sufferers in that have been the employees of the companies and small creditors.  This has also had the effect of putting some of their own businesses in jeopardy.  The most serious view must and will be taken, in my approach to company law, with respect to any act of the people who are responsible for the running of and the policy decisions of the company to ensure that it will not occur, as has happened in the past, that they can walk unscathed away from the wake of human disaster which they leave behind them.  It would be my determined approach in the Company Law Bill to ensure that it has that effect.  Naturally, I shall also take into consideration situations where, through no fault of their own, companies can and do go into liquidation and that no blame could be attached to the directors or the management of such companies.  I accept that there has to be a distinction made between the two.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>Recommendations of committees in their totality are rarely accepted by any Government.  There is no substantial reason to believe that legislation along the lines proposed by the Deputy would be effective.  Experience in other countries where such legislation has been tried has proved to be wholly ineffective.  The best solution is one that was suggested by Deputy Burke, when this question was raised before by Deputy Flynn some time ago, that the industry should have a self-regulatory system, which could operate very effectively indeed and has so operated in respect of other industries.  With regard to the brokers seeking a particular approach by any Government, it is reasonable to say that they are usually in the situation of any vested interest group seeking a particular approach by a Government in that they are not always as objective as one would <Col N="29" /> wish them to be.  I do not believe there is any good sound reason for introducing legislation of the nature proposed by the Deputy because I do not believe it would be effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not strictly accurate to say that this is not a practice in other jurisdictions.  Virtually all have a licensing or regulatory system dealing with brokerage.  Is the Minister satisfied that the existing system works satisfactorily in all cases, even where a broker does not have professional idemnity insurance to cover his clients?  Is the Minister stating that to be a fact?</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am stating that a self-regulatory system by the industry is the most effective way to deal with it.  We have a number of insurance companies operating throughout the country who are dealing with very substantial sums of money.  I have repeatedly told them that they also have a responsibility in this matter.  Surely the Deputy appreciates that a broker cannot remain or even get into business unless insurance companies are prepared to do business with him and that there is an obligation on any company, particularly a company like an insurance company dealing with substantial sums of money, to ascertain to their complete satisfaction the bona fides of companies they wish to do business with or channel business through.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism the estimated amount of the reduction in a full <Col N="30" /> year in motor insurance claims arising from the reduction from 23 per cent to 5 per cent in the rate of VAT applied to vehicle repairs; and if he will confirm that the benefit of this reduction will be passed on to the motorist in the form of lower premium rates.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department estimate that the reduction in the cost of motor insurance claims arising from the reduction from 23 per cent to 5 per cent in the rate of VAT applied to vehicle repairs, would, if there were no inflation in the underlying costs associated with motor insurance, result in a saving of £2.4 million in claims in 1983, a further £5 million in 1984 and approximately £11 million in a full year.  However, given that the various elements associated with motor insurance &mdash; including the costs of parts and repairs themselves, even with the VAT reduction &mdash; have been increasing in cost, I am unable to assure the Deputy that these savings will be reflected in lower motor insurance premium rates. But the VAT reduction is obviously a matter to be taken into account, together with all other relevant factors, in examining motor insurance price increase applications.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankCluskey" hpid="Mr. Cluskey Mr. Cluskey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cluskey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to ensure that there will be a reduction in premiums but I can give the Deputy an assurance that in any application for price increases by motor insurers the fact that VAT on repair costs has been reduced from 23 per cent to 5 per cent will be taken fully into consideration in the allowance of any increase that might be applicable.  I assure the Deputy of that.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is probably aware, in any application for a price increase all aspects of that increase are taken into consideration.  It is the aggregate of the different considerations that determines the final increase.  I assure the Deputy and the House that that aspect in relation to the reduction from 23 per cent to 5 per cent on repairs will be taken fully into account in any price application coming before the National Prices Commission and submitted to me for approval.</P>

To take it in isolation and apply it to perhaps in excess of 600,000 people insured for motor insurance would constitute a very considerable figure indeed.  But the Deputy can be assured that any application coming before the National Prices Commission, or which comes to me for approval from them, will incorporate this fact, that there has been this reduction from 23 per cent to 5 per cent for car repairs, and the reduction will be reflected in any such consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the danger to health, he has examined as a matter or extreme urgency the position of the domestic water supply in North Dublin which has been adulterated and polluted by the chemical phenol; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am assured by the Dublin County Council that the traces of phenol found recently in the North Dublin water supply did not pose a danger to public health.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council are, by law, responsible for ensuring that public water supplies in North County Dublin are pure and wholesome.  In response to inquiries my Department have been informed as follows:</P>
      <P>Following complaints from consumers, traces of phenol were detected at Leixlip Treatment Works at about 5 p.m. on Saturday, 19 November 1983.  Phenol reacts in chlorine, which is used in the treatment of water at Leixlip.  This reaction gave rise to a medicinal taste and disinfectant odour in the drinking water and did not pose a danger to public health.</P>
      <P>Dublin County Council eliminated the effects of phenol contamination by initiating an activated carbon treatment process to remove the taste and odour from North Dublin water supplies.  The level of phenol in treated water leaving the Leixlip Works had fallen to an acceptable level by 9 p.m. on Saturday 19 November 1983.  I understand the problem should be completely cleared up within the next few days &mdash; when any water containing phenol traces still in the Leixlip distribution system should be fully used up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tests on water from the River Liffey indicate that the phenol pollution has ceased.  Dublin County Council have not, as yet, been able to trace the source of the phenol contamination.  Phenol is a <Col N="33" /> compound used in road tar, creosote, in certain industrial processes and in fungicides sprayed on vegetable crops.  I am assured that the local authority is using its best endeavours to trace the contamination source involved and prevent a recurrence.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that this is the second occasion on which the presence of such a chemical has been noticed or observed in the water supply, that about a year and a half ago there was a similar presence of some creosotebased chemical in the water supply?  Can the Minister assure the House that he will keep in touch with Dublin County Council so as to ensure that they have taken precautions: (1) to discover the origin of the chemical and (2) to guard against its reappearance?</P>

      <P>The position here is that the Nuclear Energy Board, which is under the aegis of my Department, is concerned with safety in these areas within our jurisdiction.  As to the long-term effects of radioactivity on human health, that is a matter I would be happy to discuss with my colleague, the Minister for Health, with a view to ascertaining whether the Nuclear Energy Board could usefully co-operate with the various authorities such as the Medico-Social Research Board operating under the aegis of the Minister for Health, with a view to carrying out the type of inquiry about which the Deputy is concerned.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Deputy is concerned about this matter, although he is not the first to raise it.  I remember raising the subject when I was on his side of the House.  I am glad that action is being taken by the authorities in the United Kingdom in regard to this matter.  Perhaps the Deputy knows that a major effluent plant has already been installed at a cost of £80 million sterling at Windcale which will be fully operational next year.  I understand that the level of discharge will be improved by a factor of ten as a result of this initiative.  However, as I said in my original reply, I am concerned about the matter and I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Eddie Collins, who has been dealing more directly with this matter, is communicating directly with the British authorities in the very near future after certain interdepartmental consultations have taken place so that the best possible case will be made.</P>

      <P>My question is to ask the Minister for Labour if he is aware that staff in PMPA garages are being laid off by the administrator and that the staff concerned will not be receiving redundancy payments and other lawful moneys due to them; if he is aware that the notices of staff lay-offs take effect from Friday next, November 25, and if he will have discussions with the administrator to ensure that the staff involved are paid redundancy money.</P>

      <P>My Department are not responsible for formal notification of lay-offs.  Notification of lay-offs is not required under the legislation administered by my Department but if the employees are declared redundant they will be eligible for statutory redundancy payments.  Should it be the case that the administrator has not got the funds to meet these payments, payments from the redundancy fund would follow.  There is provision in the Redundancy Payments Acts for claiming redundancy payments when lay-offs continue beyond certain specified periods.</P>
      <P>Regarding the other statutory entitlements of the employees, I have no information at this stage to suggest that payments will not be made.  However, the Department will be in touch with Mr. Kelly for the purpose of having the situation clarified.</P>

      <P>I regret that this question has been transferred from the Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism because the administrator, who was appointed by way of legislation of this House, is presumably responsible to that Minister.  Therefore, I would expect him to be in a position to know more about the situation than the junior Minister at the Department of Labour would know about it.  Is the Minister aware that there is a widespread feeling among these employees who are to be laid off on Friday&mdash;and this stretches across a large number of companies&mdash;that they are to be laid off by way of what amounts to a device to deny them redundancy payments? I assure the Minister that this is a cause of very real consternation and dismay throughout the city and in many parts of the country where there are PMPA garages.</P>

Section 11 of the 1967 Redundancy Act, which was amended by the 1971 Schedule, provides clearly that after lay-offs have continued for four <Col N="42" /> weeks the employees are entitled statutorily to redundancy payments.</P>

At this stage nobody has been made redundant; but if people are made redundant or if some choose to exercise their rights under the 1970 Act, as amended, to claim redundancy in the first instance the question of the making of those payments would be one for the administrator.  But if he should find that the funds are not available to him to make the payments, the employees concerned would be entitled to look to the redundancy fund.</P>

      <P>I am fully aware of the possible consequences which a closure of Chipboard Products Limited factory in Scariff would have on employment in the East Clare region.  At the moment the company is in receivership and I would not presume to anticipate the outcome of the receiver's efforts.  For the timber industry as a whole I would not regard the consequences as a major problem in the short term.  Most of the company's supplies come from the State forests direct to the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With the intake of timber supplies by the other major pulpwood user expected <Col N="49" /> almost to double in 1984 any effects on the State forest management in the immediate future would be of minor dimensions.

In reply to the second question, the question of additional moneys for the receiver to continue is a matter for the receiver.

Will the Minister ensure that they will be allowed to carry on until the receiver has an opportunity to look at the whole operation?  Is the Minister aware that the estimated amount of money, not strictly to be provided but to be assured, which would be available per week to keep the operation in being is as low as £170,000, in order to have a proper examination of the viability of this operation which is the only kind we have?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the action he now proposes to take to protect public health bearing in mind: (a) the urgent concern arising out of the recent controversy surrounding the publication of the Southern Health Board survey showing a dangerous incidence of antibiotic residues in milk; and (b) the publicly stated anxiety by leading members of the medical profession as to the increased failure of antibiotics in treating hospital patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take both questions together.  The existence of any antibiotic residue in milk is most unsatisfactory from a public health viewpoint.  The aim must be to eliminate all such residues. <Col N="56" /> The Minister for Agriculture and I are taking action to achieve that objective.</P>
      <P>The main concern is with antibiotic residues in milk.  Returns to the Department of Agriculture at the end of last year suggested that up to 19 per cent of liquid milk contained antibiotic residues. Incidence of residues in milk for manufacturing purposes is significantly lower due to the more extensive use of testing and penalties.  Earlier this year the western health region analyst for three health board areas reported that up to seven of every ten samples of liquid milk contained residues.  The Southern Health Board decided to undertake a similar survey. Their findings on pasteurised milk were 25 per cent in north Cork, 20 per cent in Kerry, 17 per cent in the north Lee, 8 per cent in west Cork and 3 per cent in the south Lee.</P>
      <P>As a consequence, the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health established a representative group of both Departments and the different interests in the liquid milk industry. Arrangements were made to deal with the problem of excessive residues in milk.  Since the establishment of the group there has been a greater awareness in the liquid milk trade of the dangers, and a considerable improvement has now been achieved.</P>
      <P>For example, in the western region only one in every ten samples of milk analysed now contains antibiotic residues compared with seven out of every ten last year.  In Kerry an educational campaign on the use of antibiotics on milch cows is considered to have contributed to a marked reduction in the levels of residues from 20 per cent in 1982 to 3 per cent in the first half of 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture intends to introduce other measures.  Recent reports from the Southern Health Board are being examined.  I expect to receive a report in the near future from a subcommittee of the Food Advisory Committee who have been examining the whole question of antibiotic residues.  I understand they will be making specific recommendations to me and, in due course, I shall have them examined and, <Col N="57" /> where appropriate, implemented as a matter of urgency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure whether the Minister said it constitutes a health hazard.  I should like the Minister to say whether it constitutes a health hazard and, if so, is he satisfied to await the report?  Will he not take action in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>On the basis of the medical and expert advice available to me I am satisfied that without question it is highly undesirable that there should be any antibiotic residues in milk and dairy products from a public health point of view.  There are problems and, as a medical doctor, I am sure the Deputy is aware of them.  We aim to eliminate all such residues as quickly as possible.  I regard the situation in 1983 as highly unsatisfactory. A strong statement issued in the past few days by the Minister for Agriculture indicates his concern.  There are other areas to be considered such as residues of hormonal growth factors in other products about which we will have to take more stringent action particularly in hormonal areas relating to pigs, poultry, beef, and so on.  There is a need for more definite action.</P>

Whatever became of the EEC directives in this whole area which were to be implemented in Ireland by the end of September 1983 to deal comprehensively and fully with this whole area of contamination in milk?  Those directives have not been met by this Government.  There is no control and no legislation in this area. Rather than waiting for more reports, the Minister should reassure the public and introduce legislation now.</P>

There are currently three draft regulations on hand, the animal remedies regulation, the Poisons Act and the Agricultural Produce Act of 1930.  Under these Acts the controls will restrict the sale of hormones and certain antibiotics to prescription sale only.  Under the Poisons Act I have already taken action in certain areas.  Secondly, they would ensure that those who administer those products do so in a responsible manner and observe withdrawal periods.  Thirdly, the regulations will empower veterinary examiners in export plants to check the residues, take samples and reject carcases if necessary. These regulations are coming into force in January and I can assure Deputies that, although our EEC colleagues may have some concern in that regard, as regards dairy products the antibiotic residues are no problem in the manufacturing milk side.  In the national interest, that should be made very clear.  We are talking here about the other liquid milk areas and the beef, pig and poultry areas where we are acting jointly and quite speedily in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>When I spoke last week on this Bill I referred to the lack of involvement of the Garda in the community. The policy a number of years ago of replacing the garda on the beat was a major error.  While at that time it might have appeared to be the correct course of action, unfortunately time has proved it was not the correct action to take.  We all know that the Garda need squad cars and all the sophisticated equipment they can get to help to combat crime.  However, with the removal of the garda from the beat a great sense of communication was lost with the community where the garda carries out his duties.  This area must be looked at in the very near future to see what role the Garda have to play in the community.</P>
      <P>I am in favour of giving the Garda more powers to carry out their job in an effective way on behalf of the community. However, I believe that goodwill must be created and there must be a new approach by the garda in relation to his role in the community.  The Minister should take a serious look at this to see if we can come back to the situation where the garda can get involved with community associations, youth clubs and all the relevant areas in the community who are very happy to work with the Garda.  I know there is a percentage of people who have no time for the Garda but the vast majority are quite willing to have the Garda integrate in the community, to everybody's benefit.  I will elaborate on this on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all anxious to tackle crime in a forceful and determined way.  A criminal should realise that this is the purpose of this Bill.  The Bill must be seen to be working effectively.  It is right that a Bill such as this should be looked at in relation to every aspect of crime so that people will come to realise that the accusations made against the Bill of creating a police state are not true.  I do not accept that. The people are entitled to protection, but <Col N="163" /> as of now they are not getting that.  Some of the comments regarding the Bill are most unfair.  It must be clear to any fair-minded person that the present situation cannot be allowed continue.  The legislators have a duty to protect the law-abiding citizens, but that is not happening at the moment.</P>
    <P>The people who go about their business in an orderly fashion, behave themselves and obey the law are entitled to the protection of the law.  It must also be seen that the people who do not obey our laws suffer the consequences.  If you obey the law you have not anything to fear, but if you do not obey it is your own lookout.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the people who are so concerned about the rights of criminals expressing the same concern about the rights of the victims.  There is only a passing reference to the victims of crime.  I have met many people who have been assaulted, mugged, robbed and terrorised by the criminals in our society.  The reasons people commit crime are continually referred to.  The armchair experts, who have all the answers but who are not making decisions, tell us that unemployment and housing are contributory factors to the increase in crime.  We all accept that and that we have a lot of work to do in the creation of employment, better housing and a better society for our people to live in.  But I do not accept that bad housing and unemployment give a person the right to go out and intimidate neighbours and the community.</P>
    <P>I have not heard the media referred to so far in this debate.  I believe the effects of the media, especially of television and particularly on our young people, cannot be overemphasised.  We see a lot of unnecessary violence on television. Crime and gangsterism are glorified on our television screens.  We might have to take a look at the control we have in relation to what is portrayed on our TV screens.  The people in the media are very vocal in criticising our institutions when we are tackling difficult problems, but those people do not use the avenues open to them to get the good message across. We are always being told about the bad <Col N="164" /> things of life.  I believe there is an obligation on the media to highlight the good things.  Recognition should be taken of the marvellous work carried on by community associations, youth clubs, youth groups and all the voluntary people who are working so hard to make society a better place for everybody to live in.</P>
    <P>The age of the video is here now and there is no control whatsoever in relation to it.  Videos should come under the censorship laws.  The Minister should take a look at this.  It is very clearly seen in the courts that some of the very serious crimes committed are carbon copies of what the criminals have seen on television. The people who are most vocal about what is happening in society have a responsibility to play their part in this matter.</P>
    <P>Many of our old values are being attacked.  We are told they are out of date and should be done away with.  We are told that it is a free society and what people think is good for them is all right. This is a myth and must be rejected.  The legislators are here to protect the people and bring in laws on behalf of the people.</P>
    <P>There is also a problem in relation to the crime committed while people are on bail.  This is a very serious problem.  Criminals know well that their cases might not come before the courts for a long time and they continue to commit crime because they know that when they are brought to court all the crimes they have committed will be lumped together, they will get concurrent sentences and will be sent away for the same length of time whether it is one or 30 crimes they have committed.  We must look at this.  There is nothing worse than people being brought into court, given bail, breaking it and getting off scot free.  The attitude of criminals today is to commit as many crimes as they can while they are out on bail because they will get the same sentence in the end.  The Minister should look at this area.  Abolition of bail does not constitute an answer.  That is the right of everybody; one is innocent until proved guilty.  I am not suggesting for a moment, therefore, that bail should be abolished but certainly its conditions must be tightened up so that offenders <Col N="165" /> will know they cannot continue to break the law while on bail.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problems encountered is the delay in bringing cases before the courts.  The present administration of the District and Circuit Courts is most unsatisfactory and the long delay occasioned in having cases heard does not improve the overall situation.  Indeed, even giving the Garda additional powers will not improve the situation because there is no point on the one hand in shortening the list and on the other lengthening it.</P>
    <P>It can take up to two years at present to have cases heard in the Cork Criminal Court, leading to a most unsatisfactory situation.  In the Cork area the number of sittings is 36 in four eight-day sessions in the year.  The session which commenced on 8 November has just finished with almost 100 cases still awaiting hearing. Yet that court will not sit until February with another three months of accumulated cases over that period to be heard. I am convinced there is need for a second Circuit Criminal Court judge in the Cork area and also in the District Court because cases awaiting appeal in the Circuit Court are mounting.  There is no point in giving the Garda additional powers if all the other aspects do not fall into line.  The Minister might let us know what plans he has in mind in order to deal with that situation.  Some months ago a district justice in Cork asked if there were any gardaí on the streets of Cork.  This question was prompted by the fact that there were so many gardaí in the courtroom and its environs.  Everybody assembles at 10.30 in the morning and people cannot get in and out of the building.  Surely in this day and age some other system could be devised to ensure that the gardaí are on our streets carrying out the duties assigned to them.</P>
    <P>We, the public and all other interested people, must be satisfied that the provisions of this Bill will be in the interests of all concerned and of the community at large.  The attempt being made here is to correct injustices perpetrated for far too long to law-abiding citizens.  On Committee Stage I will be asking the Minister to accept amendments on the different <Col N="166" /> sections and subsections.  It should not be open to a member of the Garda to interpret the law as he or she thinks; it should be very clearly defined for them.  There has been a lot of criticism of certain sections of this Bill.  I hope it will be very clearly spelled out where the Garda stand in the implementation of its provisions. They should be clear in their minds, without any fear of accusation from anybody, that they are correctly interpreting its provisions.  That is our responsibility as legislators.  Therefore, on Committee Stage, I hope we can tease out those sections and subsections at present causing public concern.</P>
    <P>There has been concern expressed about its provisions by many genuine and sincere people and I believe the Minister is anxious to accommodate their concerns. However, there are certain sections and subsections not sufficiently defined and which may leave the Garda open to accusations.  There are people who would be only too glad of an opportunity to attack the Establishment and highlight the deficiencies of legislation.  It would be helpful if such people were fairminded and highlighted the difficulties on the other side of the coin, being mindful of all the difficulties involved in this whole process.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on all Members of this House to tease out those problems causing public concern.  Indeed, I think the Minister would agree that there are certain aspects warranting amendment. I am in full agreement with the complaints procedure, another matter causing much public concern.  We do not know where we stand with regard to the complaints procedure.  We do not know what is involved here.  We do not know when it is intended to bring the complaints procedure Bill before the House. Will this be dealt with on Committee Stage of this Bill?  If all of these aspects were cleared up it would be of great help to everybody concerned.  We should all be very clear as to what exactly is involved.  There is no point in passing legislation if the complaints procedure proves unacceptable afterwards because that would hold up the whole process.</P>
    <P>We have far too many criminals, <Col N="167" /> particularly young ones, some of whose behaviour is often so bad it could not even be encompassed in the term &ldquo;delinquency&rdquo;. Some of this type of crime is often downright psychopathic and must be put to an end by the Garda.  In so doing, they must be given every encouragement and have a back-up system. Here I refer specifically to our courts because there is no point in giving the Garda additional powers while the courts continue to fall down on their job.</P>
    <P>Some recent court decisions of the Judiciary have caused grave concern amongst members of the community, particularly in regard to inconsistencies. These are people for whom we have all had the highest esteem for such a long time.  However, some of their recent decisions have been called into question. It must be remembered that they carry a very grave responsibility on behalf of us all.</P>

    <Title>Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill, 1983: Second Stage</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan) Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. Donnellan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for implementation by Ireland of the protocol amending the international convention relating to co-operation for the safety of air navigation, commonly known as the &ldquo;Eurocontrol Convention&rdquo;, together with the multilateral agreement on route charges.  The amending protocol and the multilateral agreement on route charges as well as the Final Act of the diplomatic conference on the protocol were signed, subject to ratification, on behalf of Ireland in Brussels on 12 February, 1981.</P>
      <P>The Eurocontrol International Convention relating to co-operation for the safety of air navigation was signed on 13 December 1960.  The convention was brought into effect in Ireland by the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1963.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="168" /> The main reason for the establishment of the Eurocontrol Organisation was to maintain, in co-operation with other States concerned, the safe, orderly and efficient flow of aircraft particularly the newer jet aircraft which fly not only at very great speeds but also at very great altitudes.  Practical experience had shown that it is only through common action by the states concerned that the economic utilisation of their upper airspace could be achieved.</P>
    <P>Owing to the high speeds of jet aircraft flying above 20,000 feet, other modern aids are required, in addition to the crew maintaining visual watch from the aircraft, to avoid collisions.  As a result air traffic must be controlled from the ground.  Jet aircraft fly quickly from an area under one control centre to another and from one national boundary to another, sometimes in a matter of minutes, and this necessitates quick transfers from one control centre to another.</P>
    <P>In addition to the increases in the numbers and speed of aircraft, there had been a significant growth in the volume of complexity of radio and electronic equipment designed to extend the reliability and use of aircraft in varying weather and other flying conditions.  The provision of these aids assisted the rationalisation of demands on available radio frequencies, and other communication media.</P>
    <P>The problems arising from the use of jet aircraft were compounded in the airspace over the Western European countries because of the high density of air traffic and this led to the establishment of Eurocontrol in December 1960.</P>
    <P>The Eurocontrol Organisation initially consisted of six members &mdash; Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, the Federal Republic of Germany and the United Kingdom.  Ireland became the seventh member in January 1965.  On ratification of the amending protocol, Portugal will become the eighth member state of Eurocontrol.  Technical or co-operation agreements have been concluded with a number of non-member states including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Italy, Portugal, Austria, Canada and the United States Federal Aviation Administration.  The <Col N="169" /> organisation have their headquarters in Brussels.  They employ about 1,100 staff of which about 1 per cent are Irish.</P>
    <P>Eurocontrol is composed of two bodies: the Permanent Commission, which is a deliberative body, and the Air Traffic Services Agency, an executive body.  The commission have a dual role, firstly to formulate common policies on certain matters relating to air traffic control, and secondly, to exercise the power of general supervision of the agency's activities.</P>
    <P>The Eurocontrol Convention defines in Article 6, the aims and functions of the Permanent Commission as follows:</P>
    <P>The aims of the commission shall be to promote the adoption of measures and the installation and operation of facilities designed to:</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensure the safety of air navigation;</P>
    <P>&mdash; ensure an orderly and rapid flow of air traffic,</P>
    <P>within defined airspace under the sovereignty of the contracting parties or in respect of which the air traffic services have been entrusted to those parties under international agreements.</P>
    <P>For this purpose the commission shall be responsible for:</P>
    <P>(a)  the study, on the basis of the Standards and Recommended Practices of the International Civil Aviation Organisation, of the standardisation of the operation of the services responsible for ensuring the safety and regulation of air traffic:</P>
    <P>(b)  the promotion of a common policy to be followed in respect of radio aids, telecommunications and corresponding airborne equipment, designed to ensure the safety of aircraft;</P>
    <P>(c)  the promotion and co-ordination of studies relating to air navigation services and installations in order to take account of technical developments, and, if necessary, the study of amendments to the Regional Air Navigation Plans to be submitted to the <Col N="170" /> International Civil Aviation Organisation;</P>
    <P>(d)  the determination of the configuration of the airspace in respect of which air traffic services are entrusted to the agency;</P>
    <P>(e)  the determination of the policy to be followed by the agency in respect of remuneration for services rendered to users, and, where applicable, the approval of the tariffs and conditions of application of charges established by the agency;</P>
    <P>(f)  the study of measures designed to facilitate the financing of investments required for the functioning of the agency or more generally of the services of the contracting parties which participate in the work of ensuring the safety of air navigation;</P>
    <P>(g)  the exercise of the power of general supervision of the activities of the agency.</P>
    <P>The Permanent Commission acts through recommendations, decisions, directives and conclusions on the following basis:</P>
    <P>(i)  Recommendations to member states relate to the standardisation of national regulations governing air traffic, or the promotion of a common policy in respect of radio aids, telecommunications and airborne equipment. Recommendations are formulated by majority vote.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Decisions concern important matters of general policy such as the determination of the configuration of the upper airspace in respect of which the air traffic services are entrusted to the agency.  Decisions are taken by the commission acting unanimously, and are binding on the member states.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Directives issued to the agency cover various fields, in particular the financing of investments.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Conclusions are formulated in respect of deliberations concerning the powers of general supervision of the <Col N="171" /> agency and the reference of appeals to the arbitration tribunal.</P>
    <P>The voting system adopted for directives and conclusions is notable for the balance it achieves among the member states.  On the one hand, it was necessary to give greater weight to states making the heaviest financial contributions and this was done by taking the objective economic criterion of the gross national produce (GNP), but on the other hand, the interests of states having a low GNP weighting factor had to be safeguarded. For these reasons, it was stipulated that an absolute majority of weighted votes would be valid only if the proposal were accepted by more than half the member states.</P>
    <P>To sum up, the commission's directives to the agency and their acts in the exercise of their power of general supervision are valid only if they satisfy the following two conditions: an absolute majority of weighted votes and an absolute majority of the member states.</P>
    <P>A unanimous vote is sometimes required for certain matters covered by specific provisions of the convention or the statute of the agency.</P>
    <P>Member states are generally represented on the commission by the Ministers responsible for civil aviation.  The office of the President of the Permanent Commission is assumed by the representatives of the member states in turn for a period of one year.  The Irish Minister has held office of President of the Permanent Commission for two periods, that is from July 1969 to June 1970 and from July 1976 to June 1977.  The present Minister for Transport, Deputy Jim Mitchell, has been appointed as president for the year beginning 1 January 1984.</P>
    <P>The role of the agency is to provide air traffic services in the airspace defined by the Commission &mdash; upper airspace, generally the airspace above 20,000 feet &mdash; and to install facilities required to ensure efficient and smooth operation of such services.  To this end, the agency cooperate closely with the national authorities in order to satisfy as efficiently and economically as possible the needs of the <Col N="172" /> air traffic under their control.  The agency are administered by a committee of management and a director general.</P>
    <P>The committee of management are composed of high-ranking officials of the member states with responsibility for air navigation.  Each state has two representatives, only one of whom has the right to vote.</P>
    <P>The committee, <i>inter alia,</i> take decisions on the technical organisation of the agency, prepare the budgetary estimates for each financial year, draw up the investment and operating programmes, the service regulations and the contract regulations and submit an annual report to the commission on the activities and financial position of the organisation.</P>
    <P>The director general is at the head of all the agency's services and, in conjunction with the committee of management, is responsible for the general administration of the agency.  The director general represents the organisation in legal proceedings and for all civil purposes.  Within certain limits specified in the agency's regulations, he may appoint officials and terminate their services, contract loans and enter into agreements.  He keeps the committee informed of all measures taken in the exercise of the powers conferred on him.</P>
    <P>The present Director General, Mr. Horst Flentje of the Federal Republic of Germany, took up his appointment on 1 July 1983 for a five-year period.  He had previously been the director in charge of engineering activities.</P>

      <P>Eurocontrol thus has manifold functions.  The organisation bear responsibility for the development of common operational methods and procedures and for the co-ordination of control systems for the upper airspace of the various parties to the convention.  They have to establish and implement plans for the organisation of air traffic services in the upper airspace of the member states. Their responsibilities further extend to framing and carrying out a programme of <Col N="173" /> trials and simulations and co-ordinating this programme with similar activities carried out by the member states, and to determining whether it is feasible and desirable to standardise and centralise the purchase of equipment required by more than one state.  In addition, Eurocontrol co-ordinate the proposals submitted on behalf of the member states to the International Civil Aviation Organisation in respect of Eurocontrol's activities, and provide basic and advance training for air traffic services staff both operational and technical.</P>
      <P>The tasks which the Permanent Commission have assigned to Eurocontrol have corollaries in areas such as operational research, statistics, planning in respect of the automation of control centres and in air traffic control procedures, the definition and production of the relevant software, the study and technical assessment of navigation systems, research into the use of a common computer language and studies on the use of satellites for air traffic purposes.  Eurocontrol are also responsible for the operation of the route charges system.</P>
      <P>The preparation of these programmes requires the establishment of inter-governmental working groups whose role is to formulate standpoints common to the national administrations and the organisation.</P>
      <P>In Ireland's case, major new operational facilities were communally financed through Eurocontrol's budget and the Department of Transport provide the staff to operate and maintain these facilities under a bilateral agreement with Eurocontrol.  Certain other member states &mdash; the UK, France and the Netherlands &mdash; also operate services in their respective jurisdictions on behalf of Eurocontrol through bilateral agreements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The facilities that were provided in Ireland under the Eurocontrol financing system were the Shannon Upper Airspace Control Centre, the Mount Gabriel, County Cork, and Woodcock Hill, County Clare, secondary surveillance radar stations.  We were obliged to provide these facilities by virtue of our <Col N="174" /> membership of the International Civil Aviation Organisation</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present.</i>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>At this point I wish to provide background information on the en-route charges system.  Since 1971 Ireland has participated in an international scheme under the aegis of Eurocontrol to collect charges from airlines for the use by them of Irish en-route air navigation services provided by us.  The Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1971, provided for the payment of a single charge by aircraft operators for en-route air navigation facilities, other than aerodromes navigation services.  The charges are made payable by the airlines in US dollars to Eurocontrol, and by virtue of a bilateral agreement Eurocontrol refund to this country the amount of the charges collected in respect of the services made available in Irish airspace, less the cost of collection.  Similar agreements exist with the other states in the route charges system which are the seven member states of Eurocontrol plus Austria, Portugal, Spain and Switzerland.</P>
      <P>I should explain the situation pertaining to the introduction of these route charges.  The provision of air navigation services to aircraft on the en-route phase of flight was for a long time regarded as a sovereign activity falling within the exclusive competence of individual States, which were bound to ensure the safety of air traffic over their territory and in airspace entrusted to them by international agreement.  Consequently, services were provided to the airlines free of charge, which meant at the taxpayers' expense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This situation persisted for two decades after the Second World War.  However, air traffic control was to an increasing extent providing an economic service to airlines operators by enabling them to conduct their flights under optimum conditions from the angle of regularity, safety and efficiency.  It was, therefore, becoming increasingly justified to charge airlines for the service supplied to them <Col N="175" /> direct, and governments envisaged a change of policy accordingly.</P>
    <P>In 1958 an initial conference convened by the International Civil Aviation Organisation was devoted almost exclusively to airport charges, only touching on the problem of en-route charges.  However, some states, particularly the developing countries were beginning to levy route charges.  In March 1967, ICAO organised a conference at its headquarters in Montreal to study, in particular, the problem of financing en-route air navigation facilities and services.  After this conference, the ICAO Council issued recommendations in anticipation of the introduction of route charges systems and it was these recommendations which were to guide the Eurocontrol member states.  Furthermore, in 1969, a panel of experts from ICAO and from Eurocontrol member states carried out an economic study of the problems connected with the introduction of route charges.  In the meantime, the Eurocontrol member states had decided in 16 November 1966 to set up an inter-governmental working group, assisted by Eurocontrol experts, to study the conditions under which a common route charges system could be introduced with a view to covering part of the costs incurred by the member states and Eurocontrol in implementing en route air navigation facilities and services in their airspaces.</P>
    <P>The group completed this task in 1969 and set up several specialised sub-groups, namely, a financial sub-group, to consider the financial problems involved in the establishment of a route facility charging system and in particular the basis of assessment of the charges; a technical sub-group, entrusted with the task of finding solutions to the technical problems involved in the collection and transmission of basic data for the calculation of charges; a simulation exercises sub-group, to process the results of simulation carried out by Eurocontrol on 12 different possible ways of assessing the route charges; and &mdash; at a subsequent date &mdash; a legal sub-group, for the purpose of defining the legal basis of the charges <Col N="176" /> system to be applied in the airspace of various states.</P>
    <P>On 3 July 1969, the Eurocontrol Permanent Commission adopted the basic principles of a harmonised regional en-route facility charging system involving a single overall charge for flights in upper and lower airspace, and directed the agency and the inter-governmental working group to prepare for the introduction of the system.  Three months later the Permanent Commission decided to implement the common route charges system and to set up a central route charges office administered by the organisation.</P>
    <P>The Eurocontrol member states signed on 8 September 1970 a multilateral agreement whereby they undertook to introduce the common system and, under bilateral agreements, entrusted Eurocontrol with the collection on their behalf of route charges incurred in the airspace falling within their competence.  The individual member states drafted and published national regulations authorising the collection of route charges.  They approved the tariffs and conditions of application of the charges, which were published by the agency and incorporated into the national regulations.</P>
    <P>In line with the International Civil Aviation Organisation recommendations advocating implementation of the charging system on a regional scale, the Eurocontrol member states invited the other states of the Europe-Mediterranean region to participate in the charging system and to entrust Eurocontrol with the collection of the charges.  The invitation was accepted in 1971 by Switzerland, Austria, Spain and Portugal.  The system is accordingly, applied by 11 states.  It remains open to any other state wishing to participate.</P>
    <P>The system was put into operation on 1 November 1971.  The cost recovery rate for the initial two-year period was 15 per cent of historic costs.  It was agreed that the rate would be raised progressively to reach 100 per cent, that is, total cost recovery, in ten years without any abrupt shift of the cost burden onto operators. Since 1982 the recovery rate is 100 per cent of current costs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="177" /> At this stage I would like to explain how the amending protocol came about, The present Eurocontrol Convention which was signed in 1960 was ratified in 1963 for 20 years.  During the mid seventies the position of Eurocontrol after 1983 was taken up by the Permanent Commission.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, certain member states had continued to provide air traffic control services in their upper airspaces on behalf of Eurocontrol while others such as Belgium, Luxembourg and part of Germany had handed over this function to Eurocontrol.</P>
    <P>Additionally, some new facilities were financed directly through the Eurocontrol budget while other facilities were first financed through national budgets and the costs were recovered from Eurocontrol over a number of years &mdash; eight years in the case of equipment, 20 in the case of buildings.  The upper-lower airspace boundary was becoming increasingly difficult to justify in the context of financing new services where these services had functions in both airspaces.</P>
    <P>The following subsequent events found agreement among the member states to ensure the continuation of Eurocontrol after 1983.  At its 43rd session in November 1974 the Permanent Commission of Eurocontrol requested its alternates to continue with the study undertaken on the future activities of Eurocontrol; agreed that the study should examine the financial, administrative, technical and operational consequences of the various alternatives envisaged; and requested its alternates to submit a final report at a commission session to be held in June 1975 at the latest.  This decision followed on one taken at the preceding session that now would be an appropriate time for the governments of the member states to define the lines along which the organisation's activities might proceed for the 1980's and beyond.</P>
    <P>In a letter dated 15 October 1975 the then President of the Commission &mdash; Mr. Westerterp of the Netherlands &mdash; reported that, as decided by the commission at its session on 15 May 1975, he had approached the governments of the member states in order to assess the <Col N="178" /> political implication of alternatives for the future organisation of Eurocontrol in the current European context.  In pursuance of this decision he had consulted the competent Ministers and Secretaries of State of the member states on their governments' viewpoints concerning the future of Eurocontrol.  In executing this task he had based himself expressly on the assumption that continued and, where possible, increased co-operation within the framework of Eurocontrol would be in the interests of both the European policy of the member states and future air traffic safety requirements. Nevertheless, he adopted as far as possible a practical approach to this matter since the interests referred to above were, in his opinion, best served by the certainty of continued co-operation in a wide field, making allowance if necessary for views which might diverge on some points.  This approach offered the best possible chance of avoiding further theoretical discussion of alternatives whose implementation would involve innumerable uncertainties.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present,</i>
    </P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>His aim was to:</P>
      <P>&mdash;establish the areas of maximum agreement among the member states regarding Eurocontrol's tasks beyond 1983;</P>
      <P>&mdash;explore possible ways of further strengthening Eurocontrol and of entrusting it with fresh tasks;</P>
      <P>&mdash;avoid, with respect to the points on which the member states were not unanimous, the risk of any breakdown, while at the same time keeping the way open for co-operation and integration on these points.</P>
      <P>He had started out from the assumption that Eurocontrol would continue to function up to 1983 in pursuance of the provision of the present convention.</P>
      <P>He found a large measure of agreement on this approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="179" /> He summed up this agreement in the following ten principles:</P>
    <P>(i)  It is the member states' view that Eurocontrol must continue to exist beyond 1983 and that the basis of a new convention should be established well in advance of that time.  They believe that in the longer term also, in the context of increasing European co-operation, it must be continuously assessed whether certain air traffic control tasks, including the execution of control, could not be performed more efficiently and, in particular, more economically, on a joint basis.</P>
    <P>(ii)  The member states are of the opinion that Eurocontrol's central tasks should be maintained and, if necessary, extended.  This means that the headquarters in Brussels, the experimental centre at Bretigny, the institute at Luxembourg and the route charges office in Brussels should continue to function within the framework of Eurocontrol under the joint responsibility of new member states.</P>
    <P>(iii)  The member states wish to see, within the framework of Eurocontrol, closer co-ordination of air traffic control policies and greater emphasis on both joint planning and the cost-effectiveness of air traffic control systems, even where the organisation does not perform operational tasks itself.  To this end the new convention, which is to enter into force in 1983, must make provision for the necessary procedures to be followed.</P>
    <P>(iv)  The member states wish a thorough study to be made to determine what new requirements calling for joint action may arise in the field of air navigation safety in Europe and to what extent Eurocontrol might contribute towards these.</P>
    <P>(v)  The member states are convinced that considerable simplification of Eurocontrol's financial machinery in the form in which this has developed from application of the present convention, is both necessary and feasible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="180" /> (vi)  The member states are agreed that Eurocontrol must be organised and managed with a high degree of efficiency in order to justify the route charges levied on the users.  They are to consider further what possible measures might be taken in that connection.</P>
    <P>(vii)  The member states are in agreement that full membership of Eurocontrol does not necessarily entail the transfer of control of all or part of a state's airspace.</P>
    <P>(viii)  The states which have already entrusted Eurocontrol's Maastrict Centre with air traffic control responsibilities wish this centre to be retained. Consultations are accordingly to take place between all the states concerned regarding the retention and further development of this centre beyond 1983 for the benefit of the Benelux States and the Federal Republic of Germany.</P>
    <P>(ix)  Transfer of air traffic control to Eurocontrol by member states will depend on considerations of a political, operational, technical, economic and social nature and must be compatible with the overall aim of ensuring on a permanent basis, the safest and most efficient air traffic control possible in the member states' airspace.</P>
    <P>(x)  The member states consider that the new convention to enter into force in 1983 should be framed in such a way as to foster the accession of new member states.</P>
    <P>These ten principles were accepted by the Commission and formed the basis for further work in preparation for the post-1983 era and from which the amended Protocol has emerged.</P>
    <P>Regarding the multilateral agreement relating to the collection of route charges it was agreed that:</P>
    <P>1.  the multilateral agreement, which is co-terminous with the present convention, should be extended in time with suitable modifications to become co-terminous with the &ldquo;new convention&rdquo;;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="181" /> 2.  the multilateral agreement should be annexed to the &ldquo;new convention&rdquo; and the latter should contain an article empowering Eurocontrol to continue to operate the central route charges office for the benefit of the signatories of the multilateral agreement;</P>
    <P>3.  all member states of Eurocontrol should be required to be signatories of the multilateral agreement also;</P>
    <P>4.  States not wishing to become members of Eurocontrol could nevertheless become signatories of the multilateral agreement alone &mdash; that is, in conformity with existing arrangements; and</P>
    <P>5.  it might be necessary to give new signatories to the multilateral agreement a period of grace &mdash; for example, five years &mdash; to bring their cost recovery levels up to any agreed levels.</P>
    <P>36.  The principal changes in the role and activities of Eurocontrol proposed in the amending protocol are as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  The organisation's responsibilities for the planning of air traffic services will be extended to the whole airspace, not just the upper airspace &mdash; above 20-25,000 feet &mdash; as at present. The primary task of Eurocontrol will thus become the development of the air traffic control system in the member states according to a common basic concept which takes account of requirements and in such a way that the national plans are effectively co-ordinated in the medium and long term.</P>
    <P>(b)  There will no longer be any obligation on the part of member states to transfer responsibilities of air traffic services to the organisation.  This has no direct implication for Ireland as we had not handed over executive functions under the old convention.</P>
    <P>(c)  The current programme for the communal financing of capital expenditure on operational facilities in the member states will be discontinued.  It is considered that the implementation <Col N="182" /> of this communal finance system has proved to be extremely complex and the effort devoted to it has hampered concentration on the organisation's real role in the development of air traffic services.</P>
    <P>(d)  Eurocontrol will play a key role in the development and operation of a European system of air traffic flow management, in collaboration with the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</P>
    <P>(e).  The Eurocontrol route charges system will continue on its present lines.  The new Multilateral Agreement on Route Charges will be signed by the seven member states and the four non-member states now associated with the system &mdash; Austria, Portugal, Switzerland and Spain.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at the moment. We shall have that information later.  One of the major differences between the present and the amended convention is that all air traffic control facilities and services will be national instead of communal. At the transition date each member state will take over ownership of direct investments, for example upper airspace control centres and secondary surveillance radar stations, sited on their territories.  It was agreed that the host country would &ldquo;buy in&rdquo; these facilites at their unamortised value at the transition date and that the fund thus created would be distributed among all member states in GNP proportions.  However, there was sympathetic recognition on the part of all other member states of the need for special treatment for Ireland because of our important location for trans-Atlantic civil aviation and as the Eurocontrol facilities in Ireland are more elaborate than those required for Ireland's own needs.  The cost of installing the facilities in Ireland was £9 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our case it was agreed that Shannon Upper Airspace Control Centre, together with the Mount Gabriel, County Cork and Woodcock Hill, County Clare, <Col N="183" /> Secondary Surveillance Radar Stations would become the property of Ireland on the entry into force of the amending protocol. As these facilities were financed by the seven member states, transitional financial arrangements have been agreed to the effect that Ireland's route charges receipts will be reduced over a period of four years after 1984 in respect of the amortisation element only of the capital cost of these facilities up to a maximum of £2.5 million.</P>
    <P>During their 24 years of existence, Eurocontrol have established an experimental centre at Bretigny near Paris which undertakes studies, tests and simulations on behalf of Eurocontrol to improve efficiency of ATC, and the Institute of Air Navigation in Luxembourg which undertakes the training of air traffic controllers and assistant controllers and technical personnel employed in connection with data handling, information, analysis, programming and maintenance.  Air Traffic control centres and secondary survillance radar stations have been set up at Shannon, Maastricht in Holland and Karlsruhe in Germany. The Maastricht Air Traffic Control Centre which at present controls the upper airspace of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Hanover area of Northern Germany will in the next few years assume control of total air traffic control above flight level 10,000 feet in the states of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Northern Germany.  Germany will take over ownership of the Karlsruhe centre.</P>
    <P>The amending protocol will enable Eurocontrol to expand and strengthen its role in the development and operation of a co-ordinated European air traffic control system.  While Ireland may be one of the smaller member states of the organisation, we have always been conscious that because of our geographical location we can contribute to the development of the organisation and will continue to play a significant role in all matters relating to the organisation's future aims.</P>
    <P>Under the amending protocol, various powers which were vested in Eurocontrol revert to national control.  In our case <Col N="184" /> these powers related to the provision of land by the Minister for the organisation, the obligations for aircraft operating in the upper airspace of member states to comply with authorisations to proceed issued by Eurocontrol and penalties for non-compliance with an authorisation to proceed issued by that organisation.  The powers also referred to the acquisition of land and of water rights by the Minister at the request of the organisation.</P>
    <P>This Bill effectively removes the supranational authority vested in Eurocontrol by virtue of the 1960 Convention and the Act of 1963.  As I have stated already, this supranational authority was never given full effect in Ireland and the facilities provided and owned by Eurocontrol were operated by the Minister under bilateral agreement.  Provision is also made in this Bill to give effect to Articles 18 and 23 of the protocol which relate to the inviolability of persons and documents in the course of their duties connected with Eurocontrol and to Article 227 which makes special provisions in relation to the position of the director general of the agency.</P>
    <P>Article 36 of the protocol provides that states which accede to the convention shall also become parties to the Multilateral Agreement on Route Charges.  This agreement continues in force a system &mdash;introduced in a multilateral agreement of 1971 &mdash; under which Eurocontrol act as agent in the collection of route charges for navigational aids.</P>
    <P>The new multilateral agreement introduces provisions stating that a legal decision taken in a contracting state against a user of the system who has defaulted in the payment of route charges shall be recognisable and enforceable in other contracting states.</P>
    <P>Provision is made in the Bill to amend the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Act, 1971 so as to implement Articles 12, 13, 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 which contain the provisions on recognition and enforcement.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is also being taken to update the level of penalties provided for in the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol Act 1963, and the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) <Col N="185" /> Act, 1971.  The remaining amendments are editorial in nature.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend this Bill to the Dáil.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>This House should welcome any Bill which comes before it the prime objective of which is co-operation between countries into which and out of which there are air services to improve the safety of air navigation.  That is the prime objective of this Bill, as it was of the convention and also of the amending protocol and of the amendment to the amending protocol which we have had already.  The objective is a worthy one and it is no harm to refer in passing to our national airline which has a splendid record in looking after their passengers.</P>
      <P>Admittedly, accidents are not always 100 per cent avoidable by care and skill, but it is true to say that our national airline have been exceptionally good in this regard.  We pride ourselves on a respect for human life and human values more than for the purely commercial. Certain things happen here which make us doubt that, but taken all in all, we could maintain that position.  Aer Lingus have maintained the most rigorous standards with regard to safety in air navigation. It is no surprise, then, to learn that when international co-operation became inevitable for reasons outlined by the Minister and when six countries &mdash; Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg, West Germany and the United Kingdom &mdash; came together in 1960 to put together this convention, not too long afterwards Ireland was the seventh member and has maintained that membership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one puzzling thing from the administrative point of view which I would like to mention.  Why is there this separate organisation for air navigation safety?  Ireland could not have joined in 1965 if it was a European economic grouping and organisation because Ireland did not join the EEC until 1973, the same year as Britain joined.  The founder member countries of Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Luxembourg and West Germany could have elaborated their policy within an EEC context. <Col N="186" /> We are continually told that the only policy which the EEC have succeeded in making a Community policy is the agricultural one.  That is now under heavy strain.  The reason I mention this is because there is a proliferation of international organisations and it seems to me that the member countries could apply themselves to the principle of nationalisation in this regard.  As the Minister outlined in his speech, there are far more countries involved now than originally and some of the countries mentioned are not members of the EEC.</P>
    <P>As well as the Council of Ministers of the EEC there is a European conference of Ministers of Transport, to which the USA and Japan are loosely connected.  The European Community of Ministers of Transport has its own organisation. We have in this particular grouping of Eurocontrol another grouping. Each of those has its own president, its commission, agencies, all layers of a bureaucracy.  It would be worth our Ministers while having a look at the possibility of bringing this under either ECMT or under the EEC Council of Ministers. Whoever the Irish Minister for Transport may be on 1 January 1984 he will be the incoming President.</P>

        <i>De dicho al hecho hay mucho trecho</i>.  There are so many layers of bureaucracy that it would not be any harm to stand back from them, have a look at them and see if there could be simplification and an elimination of some of them.</P>
      <P>The multilateral agreement of 12 February 1981, includes Germany, Austria, which is a member of the ECMT but not a member of the EEC, Spain, which is a candidate for membership of the EEC, Belgium, France, the UK, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Switzerland.  Switzerland is another outsider, but, as far as I remember, Switzerland is a member of the European Conference of the Ministers of Transport although she does not belong to the EEC and is not a full member of Eurocontrol.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="187" /> There is a point which I would like to make and I am sorry Deputy Kelly is not here to hear me.  In the Bill there are a number of technical terms used and Deputy Kelly is very keen that legal technical terms should be simplified.  I see that the word &ldquo;determination&rdquo; is used in the Bill and it is defined as a decision.  If &ldquo;determination&rdquo; is a decision by definition then, if I may quote Deputy John Kelly, why not call it &ldquo;a decision&rdquo; and leave out the word &ldquo;determination&rdquo;?  In the 1963 Act there are a number of safeguards mentioned in section 3.  I am puzzled about section 2 of this Bill which states:</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Act of 1963 is hereby amended by the insertion after subsection (6) of the following subsections:</P>
    <P>(7)  Persons employed by the Organisation shall enjoy inviolability for all their official papers and documents.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tease out the reason for that.  I would like him to give an exact explanation why that is so.  The section continues:</P>
    <P>(8)  The Director-General of the Agency shall enjoy immunity from jurisdiction in respect of acts, other than acts which would constitute a road traffic offence or acts whereby damage is caused by a motor vehicle belonging to, or driven by him, but including words spoken or written.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to tease out the reason for that very elaborate safeguard written into the Bill.  The last part of the section states:</P>
    <P>(9)  Representatives of Member States of the Organisation shall, whilst exercising their functions, and in the course of any journey to or from a meeting of the Organisation, enjoy inviolability for their official papers and documents.</P>
    <P>This introduces a cloak and dagger element. On Committee Stage we will deal with this in more detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that.  I felt it was appropriate to make a few general remarks which struck me on reading the Bill.  One thing which would have had a very happy effect on a notorious incident in the Far East recently is in relation to section 8 of the 1963 Act which states:</P>
      <P>Where a person is charged with an offence under this section, it shall be a defence for the person to prove that the contravention of section 7 of this Act in respect of which he is charged was due to stress of weather or other unavoidable cause or that the contravention took place without his knowledge or without his actual default or privity.</P>
      <P>I am making the general point that the rule of law is important and that civilised canons for the application of that law would have avoided the incident in Korea when the Korean airliner was shot down without having any chance to explain why it was off course.  If it were guilty it could have been brought into land and the people responsible could have been charged.  Section 8 (2) of the 1963 Act, the Principal Act being amended by this one, would have overcome that difficulty. Section 11 about the retention of aircraft applies in that way also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On reading up some of the background to this Bill &mdash; reading Statutory Instrument No. 82 of 1983, dated 25 March 1983 &mdash; I was rather shocked with regard to charges.  Admittedly the charges which the Minister was talking about were &ldquo;en route&rdquo; charges which are somewhat different. I wonder if the Minister would explain in his reply some of the anomalies in these charges and let me know if there are any such anomalies in the charges applicable to the &ldquo;en route&rdquo; business he mentioned and explained in some detail in the course of his remarks.  I might refer to the charges imposed at Dublin and Shannon airports.  For example, when aircraft depart from zone two &mdash; that is between 30 degrees west and 110 degrees <Col N="189" /> west and 28 degrees north and 55 degrees north latitude, the Belfast charge is $176, the Dublin charge $185 and the Shannon charge $132.  The Glasgow charge is $267 and the London charge $470.  Why the service in, say, Glasgow should be able to earn so much more than the one in Belfast, Dublin or Shannon I do not know.  The charges in respect of zone three, that is 110 degrees west and between 28 degrees north and 55 degrees north latitude are London $683 and Shannon $127.64.  I know there is greater service of aircraft at London, more connections, it being a bigger airport and so on, but the difference seems to me to be very wide indeed.  I know that Shannon has experienced some difficulties with regard to clientele and that Aeroflot has to some extent restored finances there.  But there is room there also for making extra profit on the basis of a charge of $683 at London and $127 at Shannon.  In respect of zone four west of 30 degrees west and between the Equator and 28 degrees north, again the charge at London is $421 and at Shannon $142; Madeira and Rabat only being cheaper than Shannon.  I presume it is advantageous to have these charges denominated in dollars.  Unlike the purchase of oil it would be to our advantage to be paid for these services in dollars.  I should like to know whether what we are recouped by Eurocontrol is done in dollars, whether it is earned in dollars and recouped to us in dollars, in Irish punts, or in what currency. The figures given by the Minister in the course of his remarks were very impressive.  I would like to probe the earnings a little.  They seem to be very good.  I should like to know a little more of their background.</P>
    <P>With regard to the provision for air navigation I might refer in passing to the Book of Estimates for this year and indicate to the House that in 1980 the provision for equipment for the Air Navigation Services Office was £834,000.  In 1981 it was £1,265,000, in 1982 the provisional outturn was £3,458,400 and the estimate for 1983 is £3,100,000.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on those.  For example, is the expenditure on these navigational electronic aids adequate?  Also are <Col N="190" /> the people operating the system &mdash; and I know there was some trouble out there when I was Minister &mdash; satisfied with the capital investment in electronic aids?  Are Eurocontrol satisfied that what we are providing &mdash; admittedly I am talking about airport facilities &mdash; is adequate for the job in hand?</P>
    <P>In replying perhaps the Minister would also let us know about Mount Gabriel. There was a problem there.  Has the facility there been restored to its full potential? In view of what the Minister said in the course of his remarks it is highly relevant that Shannon, Mount Gabriel and the other station in County Clare are being given back fully to the Irish Government and that the amount of money to be refunded from Eurocontrol, for four years, would be less than the full amount until about £2.5 million had been paid for these facilities despite the fact that they cost a great deal more.  I congratulate the Minister and his officers for having achieved this in negotiation with the respective states.  I know that the Minister's words indicated that Ireland had been regarded as a special case and that consequently we got off rather lightly in this regard.  I do not believe that for one moment.  There is not any sentiment with regard to such matters at all in Europe.  Therefore I am convinced this was achieved only by hard work on the part of the Minister, his Department and officials and I congratulate them thereon. There is not any sentiment in Europe when it comes to hard cash, and this constituted a considerable achievement.</P>
    <P>I should like to deviate my comments to the background of the suggestion I made, that the Department of Transport &mdash; for which I have very high regard &mdash; should examine the scene across the board of a Council of Ministers of Transport, a European Conference of Ministers of Transport and now Eurocontrol, different structures.  I cannot see how they could not be rationalised to eliminate some of what I might call existing layers of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>Am I right in thinking that we are coming in rather late in the day with this Bill, because a good deal of the Minister's speech was devoted to a new protocol?  I <Col N="191" /> interrupted him &mdash; and I apologise for doing so &mdash; to ask when this new one will be signed.  Are we just a little ahead of the posse doing something which refers to a convention and a protocol which will be replaced very shortly?</P>
    <P>The Minister went through the workings of the commission and the Air Traffic Services Agency in some detail, each serviced by their own officials.  I should like to make a point, which I indicated to the senior officers in the Department of Transport when I was there, that when positions become vacant for directors general in the various international organisations, we should be pitching in there and trying to get our people placed.  As many of them have only a five-year period in office, an official from this country who had that experience would be of great advantage to Ireland when he or she returned to work in his or her respective Department in Dublin.  I know that there are contra arguments.  Some people say we need all the brain power we have to service our own Departments.  There is also the danger that when an official spends some time on the Continent, perhaps in receipt of a much higher salary, he or she will not come home.  These are risks worth taking because, even if they do decide to leave the Irish service, they are still available at centres of influence and power, are contactable by Irish Ministers and officials and can be very helpful on the international scene.</P>
    <P>The voting system has been formulated with considerable sensitivity to the dangers of allowing the GNP to decide everything.  In many instances the GNP will prevail but the system of balancing the vote seems to be an admirable one. In a part of this country we had, for a period, votes allocated on the weight of a person's wallet and this does not make for peace in any community, let alone in an international organisation.</P>
    <P>The Minister made it clear that there is a fundamental change and that Eurocontrol is only dealing with the upper airspace, 20,000 to 25,000 feet and above, but that in the new protocol altitudes below that would be covered.  This will <Col N="192" /> make for easier reorganisation and the point was made that the demarcation between the lower and upper airspace was becoming more difficult to maintain and establish.</P>
    <P>The post of director general will probably become vacant in 1988.  Perhaps the Minister of State should report to his Minister that he should start grooming somebody for the vacancy now.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland's decision to participate on the basis of the bilateral agreement seems to have been best and the change which the Minister foreshadowed in his speech of national rather than supra-national control in this area is welcome. Although the Minister did not say so, I gather that the military air navigation are also involved and, for that reason, Ireland displayed wisdom when they conducted the operations by way of bilateral agreement rather than handing over the control to Eurocontrol originally. If I interpret what the Minister said correctly, all the other countries are going to operate on their own rather than handing over any part of the air navigation control to a supra-national Eurocontrol.</P>
      <P>I have already mentioned the Shannon Upper Airspace Control Centres, Mount Gabriel in Cork and Woodcock Hill in County Clare.  I said I would come back to Mount Gabriel: if we are buying it back, as the Minister indicated we would, it would be to our advantage if it had been fully rebuilt, restored and fully operational.  I know that repairs had not got under way when I left office and if we have to do the work ourselves it will cost the Exchequer a lot of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister gave a long, historical disquisition on the development of Eurocontrol and the work that was put into putting it together.  It is heartwarming to see the punctilious, careful and hardworking effort that was put into this operation which is basically to make air travel safe.  We hear far too much, at home and abroad, of efforts being made to wipe out our civilisation, and the thesis <Col N="193" /> put forward by the Minister this evening will help to restore our faith in the potential of governments and their officials to make travel safer and life easier for everyone.</P>
    <P>Mr. Westerterp of the Netherlands who reported to Eurocontrol on the continuation of the present arrangement after the 20-year period was up, deserves our thanks and congratulations.  The blueprint, as it were, that he outlined for his own activity is one that could be taken as a headline for other diplomatic activities. First, his aim is to establish the areas of maximum agreement among the member states regarding Eurocontrol's tasks, and then to explore possible ways of strengthening Eurocontrol and of giving that body fresh tasks, but perhaps the last of those aims is the most important, that is, to avoid the risk of any breakdown while at the same time keeping the way open for co-operation and integration on the points on which the member states were not unaminous.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred then to the summing up of the agreement in ten principles. He told us that Mr. Westerterp was of the view that Eurocontrol must continue to exist beyond 1983.  I expect that the House would be in full agreement with that but I would draw attention to the possibility that Eurocontrol need not necessarily be dismantled but should perhaps be incorporated in one of the other agencies.  This other agency could not be the EEC because of the needs of Austria and Switzerland, and while Spain and Portugal have not yet become members, they are at least very strong applicants for EEC membership.  In these circumstances the European Conference of Ministers of Transport should be able to take Eurocontrol under their wing. According to Mr. Westerterp, the headquarters in Brussels, the experimental centre at Bretigny, the Institute at Luxembourg and the route charges office in Brussels should continue to function within the framework of Eurocontrol.  At times one gets the impression that in some of these recommendations, that one particularly, he is anxious to defend the <i>status quo</i> in the institution.  However, I believe there are too many agencies <Col N="194" /> dealing with transport on the European scene and that there is a possibility of simplifying the activity.  The fifth principle, as the Minister has told us, is that member states are convinved that considerable simplification of Eurocontrol's financial machinery in the form in which it has developed from application of the present convention is both necessary and feasible.  I understand there were difficulties with regard to connection and disbursement and that it was a case of one country passing to Eurocontrol with Eurocontrol passing back to individual members, thereby creating some difficulties. I draw attention particularly to number (vi) which is that:</P>
    <P>The member states are agreed that Eurocontrol must be organised and managed with a high degree of efficiency in order to justify the route charges levied on the users....</P>
    <P>There is to be further consideration of what possible measures might be taken in that connection.  I expect that as a general and first principle the House will accept that, since there are so many layers of administration in respect of transport in Europe but no great progress being made in terms of an overall European transport policy if the customer is paying for a service the maximum efficiency should be achieved.</P>
    <P>I have commented already on principle No. (vii) which states that:</P>
    <P>The member states are in agreement that full membership of Eurocontrol does not necessarily entail the transfer of control of all or part of a state's airspace.</P>
    <P>I emphasise again that this is important in the context of the military side and also to us who have stoutly maintained a neutral position.  There is some evidence at least that in various areas that position may be subjected to pressure, gentle or otherwise, with regard to European conventions and so on.</P>
    <P>The idea that the multilateral agreement should continue is co-terminous with the present convention.  This means that it will have to be given a new lease of life in the context of the new convention. <Col N="195" /> The Minister has told us that it was agreed also that the multilateral agreement should be annexed to the new convention and that the latter should contain an article empowering Eurocontrol to continue to operate the central route charges office for the benefit of the signatories of the multilateral agreement. Again we are left in the dark in that respect, so perhaps the Minister will clarify the position.  A large part of his speech refers to the new convention, but as of now I have no information as to when that new convention will be ready for signature.  The recommendation is that all member states of Eurocontrol should be required to be signatories of the multilateral agreement also.  It is indicated also that the multilateral agreement will be available for signature to states not wishing to become members of Eurocontrol. From reading the multilateral agreement I find that the members who signed on 12 February 1981 were the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Austria, the Kingdom of Belgium, Spain the French Republic, the United Kingdom of Great Britain, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Portuguese Republic, the Swiss Confederation and Ireland. Those are the ones which are not co-terminous with those that formed Eurocontrol, even the extended Eurocontrol. It was agreed also that it might be necessary to give new signatories to the multilateral agreement a period of grace so as to bring their cost recovery levels up to agreed levels.  The Minister outlined also the principal changes in the activities and in the role of Eurocontrol as proposed in the amending protocol.  There, the reference is to protocol rather than to the new convention.  I am a bit confused about that, so perhaps the Minister could clarify the situation for us.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned that the organisation's responsibilities would cover the whole of airspace above the 20,000-to-25,000 level as well as anything below that.  Therefore, we will now have Eurocontrol becoming a developmental agency for the whole air traffic system.  In <Col N="196" /> order to have a rational and easily worked-out system, that should be so.</P>
    <P>We are told also that there will be no longer any obligation on the part of member states to transfer responsibilities of air traffic services to the organisation. The Minister pointed out that Ireland never did transfer such responsibilities and that, consequently, this does not affect us.  However, the point I made still holds, that is, that it is better if the individual states have their own responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The current programme for the communal financing of capital expenditure on operational facilities in the member states is to be discontinued.  If we had not reached a stage of development, it could be rather serious for us if we had to provide the capital for building these facilities here.  We already know that the Minister and his officials have worked out a good deal with regard to Clare, Shannon and Mount Gabriel.</P>
    <P>Subparagraph (e) reads:</P>
    <P>The Eurocontrol route charges system will continue on its present lines. The new multilateral agreement on route charges will be signed by the seven member states and the four non-member states now associated with the system, Austria, Portugal, Switzerland and Spain.</P>
    <P>It has been indicated that other countries which do not belong to Eurocontrol may be able to sign, but what I want to know is when will all this happen, both with regard to the new multilateral agreement and the new convention protocol?</P>
    <P>The Minister comes back to the point again &mdash; indicating that he attaches considerable importance to it &mdash; that one of the major differences between the present and the amended convention is that all air traffic control facilities and services will be national instead of communal.  Its appearance several times in the Minister's speech must indicate that he and his Department regard that as an important change.</P>
    <P>Buying in was also mentioned; what could be regarded as an easy payment system was worked out.  I have already congratulated the Minister and his officials <Col N="197" /> on achieving this special treatment. According to the Minister's speech the cost of installation was £9 million.  I would like to see a breakdown of that figure because I presume he means £9 million at today's prices; but if he does not, that £9 million should be upped to a significantly higher figure.  It is not really a four-year easy payments system, but a non-return of moneys to the Irish Exchequer over a four year period to a total value of £2.5 million.  If, for example, we are estimating £10 million of a return this year, we will be well able to cope with a quarter of £2.5 million this year and the next three years.</P>
    <P>Reference was made to the Bretigny centre.  I would like to know what specific benefit we derive from it.  Do we send people to Bretigny for training?  Do they publish the results of their experiments and simulations?  I dare say that for simulation training our officers would have to go to Bretigny itself.</P>
    <P>Recently there was in the news an event that puzzled air navigation people, that was the Viscount disaster off the south-east coast.  The theory has been advanced &mdash; and I hope we will be able to get evidence as to whether this will or will not hold water &mdash; that there was simulated air traffic in the area when inexplicably the Viscount went down. From our scientific personnel or from any investigations since then, have we had a satisfactory explanation of that disaster? When I was in the Department of Transport I examined the file very carefully and was convinced by the proposition put to me, but I would like a more thorough examination of the evidence, particularly the evidence of the statement which I found in the file at that time that there were no such simulated aircraft released into that area on that particular Sunday.</P>
    <P>The Minister continued:</P>
    <P>The amending protocol will enable Eurocontrol to expand and strengthen its control in the development and operation of a co-ordinated European air traffic control system.</P>
    <P>The point has been made that we have services beyond what we need as a nation and those services are made available at <Col N="198" /> a fee to those who use our air space.  I may have digressed a little when I was talking about those charges but I would like to know what are the bases for the allocation of money for the use of our space.  I presume these charges are universal &mdash; in other words, that the criteria that apply to charges we make are the same as those that are applied by other states and that this money is put into the Eurocontrol fund and then dispensed to us.  Under the new régime will the payments be made direct to us or will there still be payments made into Eurocontrol now that each nation controls its own destiny so far as air navigation is concerned?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to national control. He said:</P>
    <P>Under the amending protocol, various powers which were vested in Eurocontrol revert to national control.  ...</P>
    <P>This Bill effectively removes the supranational authority vested in Eurocontrol by virtue of the 1960 Convention and the Act of 1963.</P>
    <P>He reiterates that Ireland never gave full effect to that, using the bilateral system instead.</P>
    <P>With regard to the amendment of the 1963 and 1971 Acts, I made some points in my general remarks at the beginning of my speech.  I am sure the Minister will be able to enlighten me on a number of points.  It seems that the body of the Bill is devoted to how we can make people pay up who have not already done so and how we can avoid people escaping their responsibilities.  Perhaps the Minister could tell the House if there is much of this happening, where people do not actually pay what they owe.</P>
    <P>There is great elaboration with regard to personnel of the organisations, the enforceability of a determination made, the documentation, the proceedings for the recovery of sums due to the organisations &mdash; the High Court is mentioned as our legal agency &mdash; and enforcement of a determination by a court in the State in other contracting states.  I would be interested to know why we should have such a heavy apparatus here to deal with <Col N="199" /> defectors or with &ldquo;decisions&rdquo; forcing people to pay up who have failed to do so.  I know that two major trans-Atlantic companies fell into the ocean, so to speak, at one time, Laker being one and Braniff the other.  In such circumstances if such companies owe you money how can you get it back, particularly if the companies are bankrupt?  Is there any way you can get it back from the home state of the operating company?  Is there any international fund out of which such debts can be paid?</P>
    <P>These are a few thoughts on the draft Bill, the general subject of navigation and the legal aspects of forcing these determinations to produce money for the country to which they owe it.  I would be interested if the Minister would let us know about the new convention, the new protocol and the new multilateral agreement on route charges.</P>
    <P>Other Deputies are anxious to make their contributions on this and I will end by saying, as I said at the beginning, that the objective of Eurocontrol when set up was to bring order into a developing chaos &mdash; one could put it that way &mdash; with the increased air traffic, the increased speed of development in aeronautics and the development generally of fast transport and the opportunities and dangers that it brought.  This Bill in aiding that objective deserves the support of the House.</P>

      <P>It is clear that we are discussing very complicated and technical legislation which is of enormous importance to the everyday functioning of not just Europe but the world.  I would like to compliment the Minister of State on the very clear analysis of the issues which he gave us today and on his very fluent exposition of the very complex matters involved.  He succeeded in so far as is possible in putting the issues into plain, straightforward language and it is clear that he has thought very deeply about this Bill.  I also compliment Deputy Wilson on his very erudite performance.  I did not quite catch the Latin tag which he put on the Minister's intervention but <Col N="200" /> I am sure I will find it in the Official Report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State will probably agree with me that this type of legislation would be better discussed in an Oireachtas committee.  I am sure that he would have liked to join in the discussion and the questions which many of us would like to have put to him during the course of the Bill and I hope we can do this on Committee Stage.</P>
      <P>I preface my remarks on the Bill by bringing to the Minister of State's mind the enormous problems which face the entire aviation industry today and I urge him and the Minister, Deputy Mitchell, to give priority to the development of an overall comprehensive aviation policy and an overall comprehensive airports policy.  Our national airline has been in existence for over 40 years now and it is a symbol of a performance of which we are all justly proud.  However, we have seen in the development of aviation policy over the years a certain haphazardness, a certain amount of stop-go, a certain amount of ill-considered and ill-advised planning.  There is a compelling need for an overall aviation policy into which the development of the next decade or so can be fitted.  I am certain that the Minister will be enthusiastic about that, and in that he will have the full support of what has always been a very effective and good aviation industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As to the need for an overall airports policy &mdash; this is not a party point &mdash; we have only to look at the whole Knock episode to realise that never again must we allow this type of major commitment of capital and major planning of a project to go ahead in this way.  We all agree that there is a growing need for modest, functional regional airports and for a more widespread network of service from these regional airports.  Now is the time, and it is not too late to bring this development about in a rational way which serves our national needs best.  Never again must we trust ourselves to the <i>ad hoc</i> developments or give way to outrageous local demands which can be found in all parts <Col N="201" /> of the country &mdash; these local pressures are not part of just one section of the country.  We must ensure that within the framework of a developed, thought-out airports and aviation policy these pressures can be withstood.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Bill, the Minister has made very well the case for far greater co-ordination.  It is now 23 years since the Eurocontrol International Convention on the Co-operation for the Safety of Air Navigation was signed.  The reasons for that at that time still exist today.  They are: organisation in the requirements of air traffic control, the need to come to grips with the problem, the growing number of aircraft flying at much higher speeds, the pace at which aeronautical sciences are advancing and the greater inter-dependence of all industrialised countries.  In the 23 years since the first convention was signed every one of these reasons has been amplified and extended and so the need today for this legislation was made extremely clear by the Minister.</P>
    <P>I was touched by the confidence which Deputy Wilson had in the lasting effects of this Government.  He hoped that in 1988 the Minister would see the appointment <Col N="202" /> of an Irishman as the next director-general.  I know the Deputy's confidence in the longevity of this Government and the durability of the Minister will be well founded, but I would take issue with him when he insisted that this appointment go to a man.  I hope that at that stage it will be an Irish person.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Energy the arrangements that are being made to ensure that Irish nationals are employed by companies to whom exploration licences are being granted, or have been granted, and by service companies used by present licence holders; if he will stipulate that such companies should employ a minimum number of Irish nationals in view of the present unemployment figures; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been the policy of successive Governments, since oil exploration began in Irish offshore in 1970, to ensure that as many Irish nationals as possible are employed in connection with oil exploration in the Irish area.  This season alone, 190 Irish nationals out of a total of 350 were employed on the three rigs operating offshore.</P>
      <P>All existing exploration licences have been granted under the 1975 Ireland Exclusive Offshore Licencing Terms which require that the licensee shall use Irish goods and services as far as they are competitive in regard to quality, service, delivery period and cost.  It is necessary, however, to apply this policy in a way which does not impair the objective of encouraging the maximum amount of exploration and which takes account of the fact that Irish nationals, possessing the specialised skills needed would not always be available.  If the State were to insist on the oil companies employing a minimum number of Irish nationals, this would be in contravention of EEC Regulations on the free movement of labour within the Community.  The employment of non EEC workers does, however, require in certain circumstances a work permit from the Department of Labour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In past years, as a result of negotiations between the trade unions and the oil companies and despite the seasonal nature of this type of employment, substantial <Col N="75" /> numbers of Irish workers have secured work on rigs, service boats and supply boats.  Many of these workers have subsequently moved with the oil companies to drilling locations in other parts of the world.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 274 and 275 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="76" /> Significant progress has been made with the quota scheme and the number of disabled persons employed in the public service has increased substantially.</P>
    <P>In so far as local authorities, health boards and other State bodies are concerned, the employment of disabled persons is a matter for the individual bodies and the responsible Ministers but they have been urged to take the necessary steps so that the 3 per cent quota will be achieved as quickly as possible.  I am aware that more flexible recruitment procedures have been introduced in some cases to facilitate the recruitment of disabled persons.</P>
    <P>The special programmes for the recruitment of disabled persons to the Civil Service are being continued.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated that the current embargo on recruitment to the public service adversely affects the speed with which the 3 per cent quota can be achieved.  Despite the difficulties, I will continue to encourage the public service generally to do all they can to increase their intake of disabled persons.</P>

      <P>The appliance normally used by a diabetic is a glass syringe with a disposable needle.  However, for children, or adults away from home, the disposable syringe has certain advantages and these have been provided for several years.  Recently consultants in the field of diabetes here and elsewhere have drawn attention to the fact that disposable syringes were introduced originally to avoid the risk of transferring infection from one patient to another.  In the treatment of diabetes at home the diabetic alone uses the appliance, hence the question of transferring infection does not arise.  They suggest that the syringe might be used five times but the Eastern Health Board decision is somewhat more liberal.</P>

      <P>A decision on an application for a hospital services card in any individual case is a matter for the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board.  In making such a decision it is a matter for the chief executive officer to satisfy himself that the income of the applicant conforms to the statutory requirements.  The evidence of income which is normally required in the case of an employed person is the Revenue Commissioners' form P.60 completed by the applicant's employer.  When the income shown on this form needs to be adjusted to take account of arrears of income, this adjustment is made by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>I have made inquiries from the chief executive officer of the Eastern Health Board in the case quoted by the Deputy and I understand that if the income as shown on the from P.60 requires to be adjusted this can be done by the applicant applying to his local inspector of taxes.

In this connection arrangements are being made to have him examined by a medical referee on 8 December 1983.

He was not qualified for benefit at the commencement of his claim as according to the Department's records he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in 1981-82, the contribution year governing his claim.  It was subsequently established that he was employed in Great Britain in 1981-82 and is qualified for benefit on the basis of his British insurance record.

He does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that he had a total of 176 such contributions in this period, which is equal to a yearly average of only five.  Neither will he qualify for old age contributory pension at age 66 for which he would need a yearly average of at least 20 from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1984.</P>
      <P>He also has a record of British employment and in accordance with EEC Regulations on Social Security his entitlement to a <i>pro rate</i> pension under EEC Regulations was also examined.

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 31 October <Col N="124" /> 1978 to 24 January 1983.  Payment was disallowed after that date following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  He appealed against the disallowance but did not submit medical evidence of incapacity from 24 January 1983.</P>
      <P>He again claimed disability benefit from 5 April 1983, showing the same incapacity as his previous claim and the claim was disallowed.  He appealed against the disallowance and he was examined by a medical referee on 14 June 1983 who also considered him to be capable of work.  His case was then referred to an appeals officer.  The appeals officer decided that the claimant was capable of work during the period 5 April 1983 to 5 August 1983, date of latest medical certificate before him, and is not entitled to be paid benefit in respect of that period.</P>
      <P>In July 1983 the person concerned indicated on a medical certificate that his incapacity was due to a work injury.  As a consequence payment was made in error for the period from 29 July to 11 November 1983.  This overpayment is repayable to the social insurance fund and the person concerned has been notified accordingly.</P>

      <P>The discontinuance of the notional method of assessing means for unemployment assistance purposes in the case of smallholders was made necessary following the High Court judgment that the use of the poor law valuation system was unconstitutional in certain respects.</P>
      <P>In consequence in future all applicants for unemployment assistance will have their means, including in the case of smallholders the profits from their holding assessed on a factual basis.  In this way all applicants for unemployment assistance will be similarly treated.

    <P>The new arrangements will in effect mean that the entitlement of all applicants will be determined on the basis of their actual means.

      <P>The investigation of the application of the person concerned revealed that her means, consisting of the value of capital and an annuity, exceed the statutory limit for entitlement to pension. The social welfare officer accordingly recommended that no pension be awarded and referred the matter to the local pension committee for decision.  The committee decided on 8 November 1983 that the person concerned is entitled to a pension at the maximum rate.  The social welfare officer is appealing against this decision and the case has been referred to an appeals officer for determination. The claimant will be notified of the outcome of the appeal.</P>

      <P>Under Community regulations, monetary compensatory amounts (MCAs) are applied to pigmeat and other CAP products to compensate for differences arising where the market rate of a currency differs from the &ldquo;green&rdquo; rate which is used to calculate agricultural support prices.  Member states with revalued currencies apply positive MCAs as levies on imports and subsidies on exports.</P>
      <P>In an attempt to eliminate the problems arising from the operation of MCAs, the EEC Commission have drawn up proposals aimed at the dismantlement of MCAs.  These include proposals for changing the method of calculating MCAs which, in the case of pigmeat, would have the effect of reducing them by about 50 per cent.  The Government have welcomed the Commission's proposals and have indicated their support for them.</P>

      <P>The regulations for the disposal of reactor animals under the bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme have three main objectives, namely, to remove these animals as quickly as possible so as to prevent spread of disease, to control their slaughter and, by ante and post mortem examination, to ensure that only sound meat from the animals leaves the premises where they are slaughtered.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the regulations are achieving these objectives.</P>
      <P>All cattle which are ear-punched as reactors under the scheme must be disposed of direct to a registered beef export premises.  Such premises operate under the full-time supervision of my Department's veterinary inspectors, who carry out ante and post mortem examinations on all reactors and who submit specimens for laboratory examination if this is considered desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="148" /> Under a 1964 EEC Directive, meat from TB reactors may not be released for intra-Community trade.  At the time that directive became law, none of the member states was a major beef exporter.  In most member states sound meat from reactor animals is, in fact, released for consumption on the domestic market.</P>

    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that because of attacks on buses and bus crews serving the Finglas area, the crews <Col N="149" /> have, since last May, been refusing to take buses to Finglas West and South after 9 p.m. each evening.  A number of meetings about the matter have been held between representatives of CIE, union officials and local Garda.  A particular measure which might possibly be taken by bus crews was suggested by the Garda but was not regarded favourably by the unions.  In addition, assurances were given that a substantial amount of Garda assistance would be provided but these assurances were not regarded as adequate by the unions and apparently they hoped for a virtual guarantee that no further attacks would take place. I regret that that is is not feasible.  The Garda will, however, continue to take all practicable steps within the resources available to them to ensure the safe passage of buses serving Finglas.  I might add that I understand that another proposal to resolve the situation has recently been put by CIE to the unions for consideration.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she is satisfied with the school transport service being provided for the children of Derrybrien, Loughrea, County Galway, who are attending second level schools in Gort and who are picked up at 7.45 a.m. and arrive home at 5.30 p.m.; and if she will consider making more reasonable transport arrangements for these children.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The standard of service provided for the Derrybrien pupils is regarded as adequate, with a first pick-up time of 7.50 a.m. and a last set-down time of 5.10 p.m.  I understand that the waiting time at the school is about 25 minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the afternoon. The school bus which caters for the Derrybrien pupils is also required to operate another route to Lough Cutra national school.  The making of alternative arrangements for the Derrybrien pupils would involve additional expenditure which would not be warranted <Col N="153" /> under the terms of the school transport scheme.</P>
