      <P>Every day there are requests for quite a number of items to be raised on the Adjournment and the Chair can understand that.  However, the Chair has to come to a decision between them and he tries to balance fairly the items which will be taken.  It might be a good idea if the Party Whips would consider among themselves what items they will request to have raised on the Adjournment.  There were 20 items mentioned here this morning and they must all be processed at high pressure in Departments during the day and submitted to my office for decision, whether they are in order or not.  That takes time and costs money.  It is a suggestion from me, as Ceann Comhairle, that some thought might be given as to how the number of items which have to be considered might be reduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to prevent owners of Spanish fishing vessels who have resorted to registering their vessels in the United Kingdom and have now been excluded from British waters <Col N="1682" /> and ports from transferring their operations to our waters and using Irish ports as bases for their activities.  Prior to the extension of the fishing limits of EEC member states in 1977, several hundred Spanish vessels fished extensively in the waters around Ireland, Britain and France.  Since then the activities of Spanish vessels have been greatly curtailed under an EEC-Spanish fishing agreement and at present only about 100 Spanish vessels are permitted to fish in the fishery limits of member states.  Spanish fishing in Irish waters can only take place outside a box the limits of which are at least 50 miles from the Irish coast.</P>
    <P>In an attempt to find a way around the EEC-Spanish agreement a number of Spanish companies transferred the registration of some 60 vessels to Britain through the setting up of British companies. Once registered in Britain those vessels enjoyed the same fishing rights as other UK fishing vessels and were at liberty to fish in our waters to the same extent as UK boats &mdash; mainly up to 12 miles from our shores.  In order to stop the practice of transferring registration the British Government enacted legislation whereby British registered vessels could not fish within British limits or land catches in the UK unless their crews consisted of at least 75 per cent of EEC nationals.</P>
    <P>As a result, the operators of the vessels in question have indicated their intention of transferring their fishing activities to Irish waters and using Irish ports as bases from which their vessels' catches would be transported to Spain.  Deputies will no doubt be aware of the recent controversy over the activities of one such operator in County Clare and the hostile reaction from the fishing industry here.  As Minister for Fisheries I cannot tolerate a situation where a fishing fleet which uses the device of re-registering in another Community member state to circumvent EEC regulations should be able to fish in Irish waters while it is not allowed to fish in the waters of the nominal flag state. Apart from considerations of principle, the increased concentration of fishing effort in our waters by such a fleet would undoubtedly harm stocks of fish on which <Col N="1683" /> we ourselves would hope to expand our own fishing in the future.  Claims have been made that landings by such vessels in Ireland would make a significant contribution to the economy in general and to the local economy in the vicinity of the ports concerned in particular but the experience with their operations from ports in Britain in the past few years does not bear out such claims.</P>
    <P>The Government, therefore, are promoting the present Bill to enable me to make regulations which would debar vessels registered in an EEC member state which are not in my view bona fide from fishing, landing or trans-shipping in Irish waters in the same way that the ex-Spanish vessels re-registered in the UK have been excluded from British waters.  At present I would envisage the test of the bona fide status of other member states' vessels to be the nationality of their crews which has been adopted as the criterion in the recent UK measures but the Bill affords me a certain latitude in framing regulations to take account of other developments that may occur in the future.</P>
    <P>In order to ensure that the measures just referred to are not in their turn circumvented by attempts to re-register large numbers of ex-Spanish vessels here, it is proposed to strengthen and extend the present system of licensing of fishing vessels which qualify as Irish fishing vessels and to make the holding of such a licence a prior condition for registration of fishing vessels as Irish registered for the future.  Powers are also being taken to enable the Minister for Transport to revoke the registration of a fishing vessels in respect of which I withhold or cancel a fishing licence and to enable the Government to exclude fishing vessels from the reciprocal registration arrangements currently being operated with a number of countries including the UK. All of those measures that I have just outlined will of course also enable the Government to reserve the benefits of EEC quotas allocated to Ireland under the Common Fisheries Policy to bona fide Irish fishermen and prevent wholesale re-registration here by other member <Col N="1684" /> state vessels merely to take advantage of our quotas.</P>
    <P>The opportunity is being taken of this Bill being before the House to introduce a specific provision which will enable me to copperfasten under our law the access arrangements agreed under the common fisheries policy in January last.  The present position is that the six-and 12-mile limits around our coast provided for under those arrangements are in operation under existing legislative provisions but the Government consider it prudent to spell out more clearly their powers of enforcement and the not inconsiderable penalties for non-compliance with the limits laid down.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, the present wording in the Fisheries Acts which enables me to adopt conservation measures in respect of fisheries is considered unduly restrictive in that it limits such conservation measures to measures of conservation which are also measures of rational exploitation of fisheries.  I am, therefore, proposing a more flexible form of wording in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There is an internationally agreed ban on fishing for salmon beyond the 12-mile limit and there is some doubt at present as to whether we can implement this under our own legislation and whether sea-fisheries protection officers are empowered to enforce it.  I am, therefore, proposing to replace the existing wording in the relevant part of the legislation with a more flexible working which will enable me to provide by order for this.  This new wording will also enable me to apply controls to boats connected with the fishing industry such as transporters and vessels which carry out processing operations on board.  The need for such controls has become evident from recent experience with the expanded mackerel fishery where much of the processing has taken place in floating factories.</P>
    <P>I am sure that Deputies on all sides will share my desire to have the measures outlined enacted into law with all speed and I recommend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House today has been promised for some time and, apart entirely from the recent controversy <Col N="1685" /> which has been raging in regard to landing of catches throughout the country, boats and the threat from the Spanish fleet which has been operating in the south west, there has been concern generally and widespread anxiety in the industry about some of the developments within the Community especially in recent times.  It would appear now that the legislation may well be overtaken by events in the Community and may be a little too late to deal with the situation developing within the Community.  I want to highlight the recent efforts by the Community to bargain away fish from our waters to the Norwegians.  This is a total capitulation on the Common Fisheries Policy; and the agreement on that policy which took so long to reach at such enormous expense of time and energy seems to be broken before the ink on it is dry.  That is a very retrograde step, a fraud for the Community to be interfering already with the agreement on the CFP by granting or attempting to grant rights in our waters to states outside the Community, rights which they never had.  I appeal to the Minister to be vigilant. He will be assured of our support if he stands up to the Community in any efforts which may be made to water down the Common Fisheries Policy agreement which was signed so recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have said at the outset that we will support the Government in legislation which will consolidate the Irish fishing industry, but this legislation has some objectionable features on which we need clarification if we are to give it our total support.  Generally speaking, I find the measure vague, riddled with loopholes and not very specific in a number of key areas.  In all probability quite a few of the big fish will escape unless the sections can be tightened up and made more specific in relation to what form of regulation the Minister proposes to introduce.  In many ways this legislation gives the Minister power to do anything or, indeed, to do nothing.  It would be desirable that many of the regulations which the Minister intends to make &mdash; and I have no doubt of his sincerity when he says that he will make these regulations &mdash; should be written clearly into the Bill, otherwise the <Col N="1686" /> firm basis and firm time limits should be specified within the Bill to ensure that these regulations will be brought in within a specified period or a certain time.</P>
    <P>We have an explanatory memorandum now which we did not have until today, but the Bill can be seen as a complicated measure involving a number of Acts and sections of various Acts which are already in existence.  Section 2 appears to give the Minister authority to license all Irish boats except perhaps the smaller boats. I would like the Minister to identify clearly in his reply how he proposes to classify these and if, for instance, under this legislation it would be necessary to license a boat which might be used by deep sea anglers in angling competitions. I am also concerned at the amount of bureaucracy and red tape likely to be generated as a result of this legislation and the regulations, classifications and whatever may be introduced.  Further complications may arise in that licences may be subject to time limits and must be renewed.  Certain boats can apply for exemptions.  For instance, will there be exemptions for small fishing curraghs such as are used by traditional salmon fisherman?  Must they be licensed under this?  Will rowing boats which are used by bigger boats as an accessory to the activities of the bigger boats be exempt?</P>
    <P>Further, I would object if I felt that there was any suggestion in this new licensing arrangement that the measure would be used as a vehicle for the collection of further revenue for the State.  We would want some assurance from the Minister that it would not be used for that purpose.  If any licence fees are to be attached to the issue of these licences for fishing boats we would require that these would be merely nominal and certainly not used as a method of raising further finances.  The fishing industry is going through pretty difficult times at present with enormous problems in meeting loan repayments and so on and imposition of licence duties would be a further hardship on an already hard hit industry.</P>
    <P>It appears to me that section 3 covers all the boats of every member state and <Col N="1687" /> what is causing most concern is the provision whereby the Minister is seeking the power to establish regulations which will govern the operations of these boats, including the Spanish boats. Anyone who looks at this section will see that it is clearly wide open and dependent entirely on what regulations the Minister makes.  The Minister's recent statement indicated that the legislation itself would specify very clearly the percentage of crew members, who would have to be EEC nationals operating on these fishing boats.  This is not indicated in the Bill. The Minister may well say that the UK brought in legislation similar to this and in that UK legislation something like 75 per cent of the crews of these boats had to be EEC nationals.  There is nothing in the Bill before the House which says that 75 per cent of the crews in our situation must be EEC nationals.  It is important to be specific here.  The legislation on its own will do nothing to avoid the situation which has been developing and which is being highlighted.  The threat from the Norwegian boats which is now emerging and perhaps a further threat of a Danish invasion of the north west mackerel stock leaves us in a very vulnerable position and our industry at risk.  The situation must be amended and strengthened here and at least the regulations should be drafted and introduced with the legislation and shown to us here if the Minister is serious about the situation.  While the Minister's intentions are good, in strict terms the Bill before us at present will do nothing to deal with the situation.  It is important that the regulations be introduced so as to give us an indication of what the Minister has in mind.  If he is not in a position to do that now, at least early on Committee Stage we should get an indication from the Minister that he has a firm date in mind for the introduction of the regulations.  I believe the British regulations were brought in immediately after the passage of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The fine of £100,000 is inadequate.  It should be at least £200,000 and there should be power to order the forfeiture of the boat, the final decision as to how <Col N="1688" /> the boat should be disposed of resting with the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 4 refers to various sections of other Acts and would appear to cover the question of freezer ships.  Would it be possible to license the freezers and will boats which are trans-shipping fish to unlicensed freezers be subject to penalties or apprehension?</P>
    <P>The authority of the Naval Service in relation to salmon protection outside the 12-mile zone is very important and it is useful that the Minister is availing of this opportunity to clear up any doubts which may have arisen on this matter.</P>
    <P>I have always been concerned about the level of fishing activity for salmon, especially in the Faroes by the Norwegians. These are Irish salmon which are being taken and conservation measures are needed to deal with escalation of fishing activity in that general area.  The Faroese are now engaging in salmon fishing to a far greater extent than heretofore. I know that conservation measures have been introduced but I am not satisfied that a sufficient effort is being made to ensure that these measures are being adequately enforced.  What evidence has the Minister of the efforts being made to check on the fishing activities of the Norwegians and the Faroese?  Our stocks are being seriously damaged.  There has been criticism that our own industry is damaging stocks by the use of illegal nets off the west coast generally, but untold damage is being done by the Norwegians and the Faroese.</P>
    <P>Successive Ministers worked out detailed measures in the Community to control the activities of the Faroese but it is not clear that the regulations are being enforced or how they could be enforced to minimise damage.  This is an area which needs close observation and monitoring and I am not satisfied that we can rely totally on the protection services and on the records from other member states to be sure that stocks are not being further damaged and threatened.  We should demand action in regard to the activities of the Norwegians and the Faroese who are now taking Irish salmon and causing further depletion of our stocks, in spite of the fact that they have <Col N="1689" /> no traditional rights in that area.  This must be resisted within the Community and, if necessary, taken up outside the Community.</P>
    <P>Section 6 covers the activities of fishing boats from member states of the Community within the six to 12 mile band. The Minister appears to be empowered to regulate the activities of member states who have traditional rights in this area. I endeavoured when Minister to negotiate with the French Government to get them to withdraw or at least freeze their rights in the six to 12 mile band, especially in the Galway Bay area.  I was disappointed that the present Minister did not hold out against the French in the days leading to the agreement on a Common Fisheries Policy.  I know that the Minister and his officials would have done so and would have been prepared to take a very firm stand against the French authorities had they got the full and wholehearted backing of the Taoiseach and the Government when the policy was being finalised.  Anyone who was following the events during the final days of the discussions on the CFP knows that pressure was put on the Minister to agree to the draft which was before the Council of Ministers. Secret messages were passing from Ministers of member states to the Government here over the head of our own Minister and unnecessary pressure was put on him.  Had he been left to himself, the Minister would have succeeded in getting the French out of Galway Bay or at least in freezing the French rights there.</P>
    <P>I was particularly interested in freezing the prawn fishing by the French off the Aran Islands.  This is a valuable prawn fishing area and the French recognise the fact.  This is the reason they were so adamant in holding on to their rights and establishing them under the CFP.  While the opportunity has been lost of getting the French out of Galway Bay under the CFP, nevertheless if the Norwegians can insist on a quota for blue whiting we can equally insist on getting the French out of the Galway Bay area.  We will certainly support any efforts by the Minister to achieve this.  I know the French have traditional rights and that they are entitled <Col N="1690" /> under various conventions and agreements to retain these rights, but if people who have no rights are getting Community backing to establish such rights we can argue for Community support in freezing or minimising activity within our six to 12 mile band.</P>
    <P>I have always been more interested in the prevention of illegal fishing activities rather than the imposition of fines. Imposing fines after the damage has been done is not a solution.  In relation to foreign trawlers, fines are certainly not a deterrent because they have a pool to pay the fines so that there is no special hardship on individual boats.  This should be watched carefully by the Minister and he should investigate whether this pool system is in operation with the support of governments' financial backing which would enable third country boats to fish illegally knowing that the fines will be paid for them.  We should investigate whether this pool system is being contributed to by the fleets.  If there is any suggestion that third country governments might financially back up such a pool system it should be raised at the highest level in the Community.</P>
    <P>Applying higher penalties in these cases is realistic.  However, I do not think fines are sufficiently high.  I should like to know whether forfeiture of boats provided for in this Bill will apply to all boats of all member countries, including Irish boats.  If it applies to Irish boats the Minister should look carefully to make provision for exemptions to ensure that he will have the final say in forfeiture proceedings:</P>
    <P>They are some of the objections we have to this measure.  It is no use passing the Bill today or tomorrow unless essential regulations are made.  When the British Government brought in their legislation they made their regulations the next day.  In relation to the regulations proposed here, we would need information from the Minister about how soon the regulations will be brought into effect. Under this section I think the Eirenova operation in Castletownbere will now be illegal.  What are the Minister's intentions in relation to that?  Is it his intention to close down that operation?  Will the regulations <Col N="1691" /> allow the setting up of joint ventures or will the regulations be phased in over a period?  Although we may make provision to cover the situation in Castletownbere, there may be a loophole to allow similar situations to develop elsewhere. We need to be quite clear and specific about this so that we will not have any doubts about it and that we will not be back here in a few weeks to tighten the situation further because it may have begun to get out of control.</P>
    <P>There are some general comments I should like to make about the industry and particularly about salmon, which is covered in the Bill.  No volume of legislation or imposition of penalties in an effort to conserve stocks will be of any use unless there is goodwill and co-operation between the fishermen and the Government and the conservation services.  Conservation measures are an essential part of the future of our salmon fishing, but in relation to recent events and the clashes that have taken place between fishermen and the inspection service, no useful purpose can be served by that type of confrontation.  Order and goodwill must be restored.  I appeal to those involved in the recent clashes on the south-west and north-west coasts to stand back from this type of confrontation and try to work for conservation of stocks in the interests of the fishermen themselves.  This should be done by consultation and communication.  The fishermen have responsibilities but equally the conservation staff must be sensitive to the pressures surrounding the fishermen and ensure there will be co-operation and dialogue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Common Fisheries Policy, the Community are at a crossroads because a Common Fisheries Policy will be the cornerstone of future fishery development in the Community as well as of our fishery development.  However, the actions which the Community have already engaged in are making the Common Fisheries Policy into a Phil the Fluther's Ball over there, with the herring dancing in the middle.  If the Community continue with the stance they are now adopting, becoming involved in trading <Col N="1692" /> and bargaining before the Common Fisheries Policy has been given an opportunity to become established, the whole Community policy in relation to fishing will collapse around the Community's ears.  If that trend is to be allowed to continue we here must be ready with our own national fisheries development plan and if necessary to back that up with our own national measures.</P>
    <P>For many years we have been making speeches here, the Government have backed up the industry financially and otherwise, but now we need clearly defined policy to enable the industry to expand.  We need to link the fish catching sector with the processors and those involved in marketing and selling.  We need to do this fairly soon.  We need investment to enable that development to occur.  Overall fisheries development can make an enormous contribution to the national economy.  We have got tired of repeating this, we have said it so many times.  The Government must provide the financial support, but I do not see any evidence of Government commitment yet.  As I said, if the Community are not prepared to accept their responsibility we must be prepared to go ahead with our own national policy to safeguard our position and to enable our own industry to expand and develop.  I should like to see more specific information before us from the Minister rather than having this loophole measure which can be implemented only if the regulations are there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBegley" hpid="Mr. Begley Mr. Begley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I will confine myself to specific points because many other Deputies are anxious to contribute and many Deputies have remained here on this lovely morning to hear the debate.  I welcome the Bill, but it is a guarded welcome. As Deputy Daly has pointed out, there is too much emphasis on regulations rather than legislation.  We would like to see hard and fast rules written into the Bill so that they will be there for all to see, and if anybody dares to challenge them, on their heads be it.  I thank the Minister for listening to Deputies who raised this on the Order of Business and by way of Private Notice Questions and I am glad the Government had the courage <Col N="1693" /> to introduce this Bill.  I certainly think it was check for Deputy Daly to criticise the Taoiseach's Common Fisheries Policy when he must know that it was Deputy Brian Lenihan who got rid of our 50-mile limit which Deputy Garret FitzGerald secured as Minister for Foreign Affairs. It is cheek on the part of Deputy Daly to come in now and express reservations about the alleged failures of the Taoiseach when the failures lie squarely at the feet of Deputy Lenihan.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed with the Bill on some points.  First, I am disappointed that all United Kingdom registered Spanish vessels are not excluded.  I thought that would be copperfastened in this Bill.  Secondly, I hoped that no new registrations would be permitted.  Thirdly, I hoped Irish registered Spanish vessels would be allowed a phasing out period.  There is a very serious lacuna in the Bill which could perhaps be remedied on Committee Stage.  I refer to the fact that there is no provision that 75 per cent of the crew should be of the EEC.  I realise that could be counter-productive.  We could have 75 per cent of the crew Greeks.  Everyone knows they would work for £70 a month and that could defeat the argument.  At the same time something like that should be included in the Bill.</P>
      <P>This is a national issue.  It is not a parochial issue and I would hate anyone to think that, because of the reservations I have, I am against any part of the country. In view of the fact that Spanish boats were going to use certain ports, such as Caherciveen, Castletownbere, Cappagh, County Clare, and possibly some ports in Donegal, I hope my comments will not be taken as my being against the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a national fish stock.  We are the country in the EEC with the finest fish stock and it should be the intention of every Member to preserve that fish stock for Irish fishermen.  If the fish are caught outside it does not matter under what flag they are caught.  They cannot come in if they are caught outside because they are running a limited amount of fish there.  The issue I am really concerned about is that of the Spanish involvement.  Who is behind these new companies?  Is it the Spanish Government? <Col N="1694" /> Are they subsidising them?  Is it not well known that Spain has applied for membership of the EEC and the minute she gets in her biggest asset will be her fishing fleet?  She has the biggest fishing fleet of all the EEC countries.  If they can get a substantial quota now of fish caught in Irish waters they can demand that same quota.  They can demand even more. Who will suffer?  The Irish fisherman.  He will be deprived of his bread and butter. That is why this issue is so very sensitive. I am wondering about the forces behind this operation and I hope the Minister will carry out a thorough investigation into how those companies are set up and from whence comes the share capital.  Is it from the Westminster Bank, a Swiss Bank or a Spanish Bank?</P>
    <P>I am convinced it is in Spain's national interest to use these flags of convenience. They were kicked out of British waters. The House of Commons sat until 4 o'clock in the morning to get the legislation through because they got wind of what was happening.  They &ldquo;copped on&rdquo;. I have another reservation with regard to the extra powers the Minister intends to give to some fishery interests.  I told the Minister he is now deciding whether Irish fishermen will survive.  Over 70 Spanish boats flying the British flag of convenience were kicked out of Cork.  It is well known now that those 70 trawlers are fishing 70 and 80 miles out off our coast. It is also well known that these boats are now heading for Spain with their catches. That is being monitored as fish caught in Irish territorial waters.  These are the tonnages &mdash; paper tonnages perhaps &mdash; the Spanish Government will present when their membership is being finalised in Brussels.</P>
    <P>Why are those Spanish trawlers allowed to fish at will 70 and 80 miles out off our coast?  Is it because our corvettes are too busy watching Irish fishermen catching a few salmon here and there?  Is it because the Spaniards know the corvettes are only three or four miles out?  Is that the reason these Spaniards have a licence to fish?  By the time the corvette goes out they are gone out of range.  It was very significant last week that in a surprise run by one of the corvettes three <Col N="1695" /> Spanish trawlers were caught 90 miles out.  How many more were further out? Our fishermen will tell you that 12 and 14 miles out they can pick up the Spaniards on their radios and those radios have a range of only 80 or 90 miles which means that those they are picking up are within our territorial waters.  It is disappointing that the Irish Naval Service or the Department of Fisheries do not concentrate as much as they should on those poachers.  The fish these people are after are monk fish and if one looks at the catches of monk fish and hake over the last three years one finds the amount caught by Irish fishermen has doubled. Even if we did not reach our quota and the British did not reach their quota in the last two or three years, it is only a matter of time before Irish fishermen will have a quota of monk fish and hake.  The other fish are not there.  When we had a 50-mile zone in 1975 and 1976 Irish catches of white, prime fish rose out of all proportion, sole, black sole, plaice and so on.  The moment the 50-mile limit was abolished that fish became rarer and rarer.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister with all the sincerity I can command that the extra powers he seeks for fishery officers be defined in this Bill.  I would subscribe to the sentiments expressed by Deputy Daly &mdash; nobody wants a war between Irish fishermen and the Irish navy.  I would take this opportunity of appealing to the fishermen.  I have no time for fishermen who go to the water with guns.  I condemn that unreservedly.  It is not good enough.  There is only one law in this land, that is the law of the land and that covers everything.  At the same time I would ask the Minister to be somewhat compassionate in so far as some of these fishermen are concerned.  Any of us who plays football or hurling knows that if one gets a belt on a field one waits for one's chance to give a belt back.  That is the Irish tradition, one does not turn the other cheek; one waits for one's chance to put the boot in and hopes one is not seen.  That is the reality of the situation. I am advocating some common sense, guidance, some counselling.  Neither do <Col N="1696" /> I think it good enough for officers of the corvettes to give the thumbs-up sign to the fishermen because that amounts to agitation.  That is not good enough.  It is provocative.</P>
    <P>There is much talk at present about illegal nets.  That is why I want the Minister to define for me the extra powers he is seeking in this Bill for fishery officers. Those illegal nets are for sale all over the country; they can be bought in any shop. Those nets are not banned at all in other countries.  One might well make the point: why are not they banned in Scotland, in Norway, in France or in Spain? Have we an Irish solution to an Irish problem?  I would appeal to the Minister to examine the order he made about those nets, take a close, hard look at it and have the same standard here as obtains in the rest of the EEC countries. There is no point in our undertaking all the conservation if suction trawlers can suck in the salmon in the Faroes, if the Norwegians can come in and take them off the Donegal coast.  They do not even use nets; they have suction trawlers.  If we are to have conservation let it apply right across the board.  The fishermen are not criminals, far from it.  Furthermore I hate to see it presented in the media that these fishermen are earning £80,000 a week.  I would love to meet a fisherman who earned £80,000 a week because I know there is no way that they earn that amount.  I do not know from where this mythical figure emanated.  These fishermen have a tough life, out to sea at 5 o'clock in the morning and perhaps not returning until 10 o'clock at night.  Most will have mortgages on their houses and repayments on their boats.  Now, because of the means test for eligibility for the dole, the few shillings they received in bad weather is no longer forthcoming. They are subjected to tremendous pressures.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to take a close, hard look at what is happening around the south west and Donegal coasts.  I am sure that every Member of this House who has spoken on behalf of our fishermen knows what he is talking about.  Probably they will have known their fathers and mothers.  None of them <Col N="1697" /> is a criminal.  It should be remembered that 200 years ago an Irishman was hanged if he took a salmon from the landlord's pool.  Is it to go on record now that the Irish navy will shoot an Irishman for catching the same salmon?  That is why I am worried about the extra powers being conferred under the provisions of this Bill for the Navy.</P>
    <P>Let us examine the history of the Navy. Their history so far as the gun is concerned has not been too good since 1959. They appear to have been trigger-happy. They shot at fishermen in Kerry, in Galway, in Donegal and in Mayo.  If those serious incidents happened on land, if there were 30 or 303 tracer bullets flying into houses there would be an outcry, and rightly so, by all right-thinking people.  At the same time I want to make it quite clear that I have no time for fishermen breaking the law, going out with slash hooks, putting things over their faces, producing rifles and firing shots in the air.  I detest this and I have told them so.  I have told them that I will not stand for violence on their part under any circumstances. However, a balance must be struck.  The Minister is the person who could arrange meetings between the genuine fishermen and the Department of Fisheries.  He could sit down, have a chat with them and tell them the kind of nets they should use.  The Minister made the order banning those micro-film nets at the beginning of the season.  That is what we are led to believe.  The fishermen had no time to get the other type of nets. Some of them had no time to buy the proper nets.  They had not the money to make the repayments.  I notice that Deputy Daly is laughing but his contribution was fairly weak on certain aspects. However, I shall not go into that.  I would appeal to the Minister to have a uniform net used, as is used in every other EEC country.</P>
    <P>I would appeal to the Minister to abolish the regulation and rather have it included in the provisions of this Bill.  I might reiterate the four points I wanted to make.  First, that all United Kingdom registered Spanish vessels should be eliminated immediately.  Secondly, no new registrations should be permitted.  The <Col N="1698" /> Irish registered Spanish vessels there already should be phased out over a period and the Minister should be very cautious in conferring extra powers on fishery officers.  I am not too sure whether the naval officers have the requisite training if a confrontation situation arose.  The Garda Síochána have always been cool under provocation.  I am not too sure that the naval officers would be and I do not think the bullet is the answer.  The situation should not be allowed to continue until there is a death when everybody will ask why was the situation allowed to reach that stage.  I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices to convene meetings in different parts of the country, from Kerry to Donegal, with the fishermen, with the boards of conservators, with the Garda Síochána, establish uniform rules, so that anybody who breaks them will know then what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an mBille agus tá súil agam go mbeidh toradh sásúil le teacht as nuair a rithfear é.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister did not avail of this opportunity to outline for us the future of the fishing industry, as he sees it.  We have had too few opportunities to discuss this important industry. In fact, it is debated only when a controversy arises.  Over the years we should have spent more time discussing policy in relation to the future of the industry.  When the Estimate for the Department is moved the time allotted to Members to put forward their views is limited.  We have tremendous resources along our coast and very valuable fishing areas but our approach to the development of the industry has been slipshod. We are all aware of the necessity to introduce stringent regulations to protect our valuable stocks.  Too many continental companies are adopting back door methods to get in on the act of fishing inside our waters.  I am glad the Minister is taking steps to ensure that the efforts of such fishermen are frustrated so that we do not have a repeat of what occurred in Castletownbere and was tried in the Clare area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The licensing of vessels would be of <Col N="1699" /> benefit to the fishing industry.  It is a matter which should be taken up by all EEC countries so that it will be possible for the Minister and the Department to know exactly the number of boats from member states fishing in our waters and to check on the amount of their catch.  I am aware that a similar scheme works very effectively in Iceland.  In that country all fishing craft are licensed and outsiders can fish in those waters only under licence.  The regulations are applied very stringently and under them the Icelandic fishing authorities have the right to protect their industry.  For instance, a German trawler licensed to fish in those waters may be allowed in for 24 or 48 hours but if it remains for one hour over that limit it is dealt with.  The boat is not brought in or the skipper brought before a court but the licence is suspended or withdrawn entirely.  It is because the regulations are applied so stringently that all boats fishing under licence keep strictly to the terms of the licence.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputies Begley and Daly in regard to the future of the industry.  I am worried that the quotas and the existing system in relation to member states and their rights will mean that our fish stocks will be cleaned out eventually.  I am not satisfied, as a result of replies to questions in the House, that we are in a position to carry out a check on the amount of fish being taken out of our waters by other member states.  Deputy Begley's question in relation to Spanish trawlers is a valid one.  We do not seem to be applying the rules to ensure that our waters inside the 200-mile limit are not over-fished.  We engaged the services of a spotter plane some years ago to keep a closer watch around our coast and I hope the Minister will tell the House how effective the operation has been, how often checks were carried out and what has been happening since the Army were given the task of carrying out those checks on illegal fishing.</P>
    <P>Fishermen are experiencing difficult times and the fishing industry is in jeopardy. Those close to the industry recognise that.  In recent weeks we have heard <Col N="1700" /> of fishermen being accused of all types of illegal activities.  We must admit that they are no angels when it comes to getting extra fish for themselves but because of the difficult season they are frustrated. We must accept that fish is being dumped at present.  Fish is landed, coloured, sprayed and thrown back into the water. Nobody can be happy about that situation. It is morally wrong to dump a valuable food but what is happening supports my views in regard to the whole structure of the industry.  The prices offered to fishermen for the most popular fish are very low when compared with the prices paid at the markets.  The marketing structures are wrong and nothing worthwhile has been done over the years to improve the industry.  I must stress that the co-operatives have been doing a tremendous job in providing assistance for fishermen.  I accept that the Minister, following his tour around the coast, is familiar with what is happening in regard to the co-operatives.  He should assist them in every way.  The Minister has control over two Departments and he should remember that the Department of the Gaeltacht can in many instances assist co-operatives.  He should help them in the area of marketing.</P>
    <P>We may get glossy reports annually from Bord Iascaigh Mhara in regard to this question and on reading them one would imagine that wonders were being worked in this area.  However, fishermen can produce receipts showing that the price for their catch five or ten years ago has not been changed.  They are being paid the same amount although their overheads have increased tremendously. The cost of diesel has gone up as also has the cost of gear and maintenance but the market price has not.</P>
    <P>At EEC level we must be tough in defending the rights of our fishermen and ensuring that we do not give away anything. There has been a lot of controversy over the years about the 50-mile limit.  I have a lot to say about it.  Everybody is aware of what happened before we joined the EEC.  The member states had already decided on the question of equal access and nothing could be done to <Col N="1701" /> guard against that.  It was a terrible ploy by them before we entered the EEC to ensure that they would give themselves rights inside our territorial waters which they did not already have.  It was a dear price for us to pay but we have to make the best use of what is available to us now and try to ensure that the interests of our fishermen are properly guarded.</P>
    <P>It is only by being tough in the EEC that we will get those rights for our fishermen. It is annoying, as Deputy Begley said, to see the Norwegians, who refused to join the EEC because they could not get guarantees in relation to their industry, now trying to come in and claim rights inside our territorial waters.  We have to guard against all those things and our fishermen have to be protected.</P>
    <P>I want to go back again to marketing. Stocks of fish from third countries are constantly being landed in the EEC countries. This is detrimental to marketing for our fishermen.  We all know that it does not matter what industry you are talking about, if the producer is not able to get the price for his product he goes out of business.  This is a serious situation as far as our fishing industry is concerned.  We have to regulate it also inside our territorial waters.  We have to protect the inshore part-time fishermen.  We have the experience of some of the people who have got 120-foot trawlers scraping along the rocks the same as they did when they had smaller boats.  This is not giving a chance to the small inshore fishermen. We should compel some of those fishermen to fish outside the three-mile limit. It is not easy for the Minister to regulate this but those matters have to be looked at in relation to the future of the industry, the protection of stocks and the protection of the whole industry.</P>
    <P>Part-time fishermen are traditional fishermen who depend on the income they get for a few months of the year to sustain them.  They give good employment. They have availed of grants from BIM to buy small boats.  They go to the expense of getting gear.  It is not fair that they should be crowded out by some of the larger boats which can well afford to get out and go into areas where they will have an opportunity to get large stocks of <Col N="1702" /> fish and will not interfere with the smaller inshore fishermen.</P>
    <P>I impress on the Minister the importance of trying to ensure that there is not any illegal fishing by any EEC member states, that our quotas and stocks are protected and that the Minister uses every possible means available to him to guard against overfishing by EEC member states.  The Minister is handicapped at the moment because adequate machinery is not available to him or to the Department to find out exactly what EEC member states are taking out.  I believe the structures can be provided within the EEC to ensure that something positive is done to guard against overfishing.  If there is overfishing our industry collapses and there is no point talking about spending more money or expanding the industry. I warmly accept the Bill before the House.  I hope the Minister will have the necessary regulations introduced as quickly as possible to guard against the illegalities we are witnessing at the moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>As a Member from one of the maritime constituencies, I welcome the Bill.  I believe it is a step in the right direction and one long overdue.  It is not this week, this year or this decade that we have had this injustice to our fishing stocks.  It is well known that for the past 30 years the Spanish fishing fleet have been operating actively off our coasts.  It is also well known that on any night during the fishing season from the Fastnet to the Bull Rock any person living on the seafront along that coastline can see hundreds of foreign vessels marauding our fishing stocks.  The Spanish boats are ably assisted by the Norwegians, the Danes, the Japanese, the Russians and the Koreans.  Their fishing boats are accompanied by their factory ships and their hospital ships.  They have a very upgraded fleet all marauding the livelihood of our fishermen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should have been brought in a long time ago.  There is a lot of talk about our salmon fishermen overfishing our salmon stocks.  The truth is far from that.  Our salmon stocks are swept up by those giant trawlers further out to sea <Col N="1703" /> than our corvettes operate.  The real culprits are the Faroe Islanders, the Danes and the Greenland fishermen who are actually catching most of our salmon stocks.  It is well known fact that salmon which are bred in our rivers emigrate to Greenland and the Faroes.  En route off the Hebrides they are intercepted and hundreds of thousands of them are caught.</P>
    <P>I am amazed that our salmon fishermen are not given an opportunity to earn a living.  What other community making a living would put up with this surveillance over their livelihood?  Surely we need a good common policy between the Department of Fisheries and our fishermen. I know that Deputy O'Toole in his ministerial capacity has brought a new vision, a new life, to fishermen, but I will not be happy until the Minister has proper dialogue with fishermen to ensure that they are given a chance to make a livelihood during the fishing season. There is no need for corvettes to trail our unfortunate fishermen.  There is no need for the water bailiffs to hound them.  The real culprits lie abroad.  They clear up our available fishing stock while the corvettes are watching Irish fishermen.  Why do the corvettes not board the Russian, the Danish, the Korean and the Japanese factory ships?  I have failed to see a Russian trawler prosecuted here.  There is far too much surveillance of Irish fishermen, men who are the salt of the earth.  Their stocks are being marauded and their fishing grounds raped by foreign trawlers.</P>
    <P>I see no reason why narrow filament nets cannot be used by inshore salmon fishermen.  It is well known that these nets are used by every other country.  It costs a fisherman about £1,500 to put a quantity of nets on the water.  The nylon nets allowed will only last half the season whereas the narrow filment nets would last the whole season.  Because of this ban on narrow filament nets it will now cost a fisherman £3,000 to outfit himself for the salmon season.  It is a matter of survival for the small salmon fishermen and on pure economics he must use narrow filament nets.  The Minister should bear <Col N="1704" /> that in mind when making further laws in relation to the conservation of fish stocks. Surely, to have Irishmen being threatened by other Irishmen with guns, pitch forks and slashers is not the way to handle the industry.  There must be something wrong when fishermen are driven to that extremity.</P>
    <P>The fishing grounds along the west coast are abounding with fish.  Almost 80 per cent of our catch is caught within the 12-mile limit leaving fish such as blue whiting and hake reasonably untouched by Irish fishing vessels.  If there is to be a future for our fishing industry the 12-mile limit must be held sacrosanct for Irish fishermen and we must fight for a 50-mile limit around our coast.  We have been told that third country boats are not allowed to fish within the 50-mile limit. It is well known that that law has been broken several times.  Our corvettes have failed to intercept and bring back those boats to port to face charges.</P>
    <P>The Irish nation faces a number of daunting challenges over the next decade. In the year 2000 our population will have increased by at least another million. Up to 75 per cent of the population will live in the urban areas and 40 per cent of the total will live in the eastern region.  What will we do with our western seaboard?  Will this Government and subsequent Governments make it possible for native people to make a decent living along that coastline?  Will they be able to exist where their forefathers existed for generations?  Will we see our youth drifting into the cities where life is neither healthy nor wholesome?

      <P>We must have proper planning in the fishing industry to ensure that the people living along the western seaboard can make a living.  Surely it is not beyond the bounds of reality to build up the fishing industry.  I hope we will not see this area fade into a wilderness frequented only by wild birds.  We need proper planning for the future of the <Col N="1705" /> industry and this Bill is a step in the right direction.</P>

      <P>Successive Governments have treated the fishing industry as a Cinderella industry.  It is well known that a former Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Brian Lenihan, did not care two hoots about the fishing industry and did not even care if the Spanish fishing boats operated up to the bridge of Athlone. We should have made these laws 20 years ago to preserve our stocks.  Had adequate steps been taken then our industry would be tenfold greater today.</P>
      <P>I dislike the back door approach initiated by the Spanish Government a few years ago when they opened up an industry called Eirenova in my constituency in Castletownbere.  They told Irish fishermen on that occasion&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy want to see it closed down?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I want to see it run properly for the benefit of the people in the area.  It is all right for Deputy Gallagher to talk about closing down a factory when the factories in Killybegs are operating satisfactorily.  Does the Deputy want to see all the fish in Castletownbere shipped to Killybegs to be processed there?  I think he does.  That was the policy of the previous Government. There should be proper control over the industry in Castletownbere to ensure maximum employment for Irish people. We do not want a white elephant at Castletownbere to boost the landing catches of the Spanish fishing fleet when they <Col N="1706" /> apply for EEC membership in a few months.  Then they will go cap in hand to the EEC authorities and will talk about their catches which have been boosted by the fish landed in Castletownbere, that is packed in refrigerated containers and transported to Spain.</P>
      <P>The people who made the agreement with that company should be criticised for not ensuring that the fish would be processed on Irish soil.  When the industry was started in Castletownbere we were told that by now they would be employing 200 people but at the moment they employ approximately 20 people.  In fact, they are letting people go already but at the same time they are landing additional catches.  This has been our experience of the Spanish excursion into our fishing industry.  This is what we have experienced in south-east Cork.  I warn Deputies in Clare not to be misled by the rosy promises of some Spanish industrialists. There is not one ounce of sincerity behind all their promises and I know that for far too long.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the job of our Minister to ensure proper inspection of the industry and to ensure that it fulfils the purpose for which it was established, namely, to give employment to people in the area.  There is only one Irish fisherman aboard the Spanish vessels.  They were supposed to operate west of the 12º zone but they are operating much nearer the shore.  Our fishermen in that area are very annoyed at the hospitality shown by previous Governments to these foreign fishermen. If a deal was made it should be brought out into the open.  I was away on other business when the factory was opened but I read in the press what the then Minister for Fisheries said about the benefits it would bring to the area.  To date there has been no sign of any benefit.  I ask the Minister to take a trip to Castletownbere and the surrounding area.  He can be assured of a good reception from the fishermen; in fact, he may be taken out for a day's fishing to see how they have to eke out a livelihood.  It is time we faced reality.  Irish fishermen must get an opportunity to make a decent living. Their rights must be preserved and they <Col N="1707" /> should not be sold out in any EEC agreement.</P>
    <P>Our Minister should insist that proper conservation measures be taken to ensure the preservation of fishing stocks. Fishing trawls should be designed to enable young fish to pass through and escape capture.  For years our vessels have operated trawls that brought in the small stock as well as the larger fish.  That small stock was dumped off the gunwales of the ships at the piers and harbours.  It was a disgrace.  If the young stock is killed, in time our entire stock will be eliminated.  In addition, there should be certain conservation measures to protect the shellfish industry.  For many years I saw crayfish and lobster in spawn packed in tanks and exported to France.  Any fisherman who did that was sticking a knife in his own back so far as the industry was concerned.  Fish that have not spawned should get the opportunity to spawn and they should be conserved. There are many other points I should like to raise but time will not permit because other Members wish to speak.  There should be a complete revamping and reappraisal of the plans that are needed to ensure that our fishing industry will be of considerable benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>The proposed amendment to section 4 will allow the Minister the option of making orders in relation to the conservation of fish stocks and the rational exploitation of fisheries.  It will also enable him to apply such orders to different classes of boats not necessarily fishing boats, for example freezer vessels and to various forms of fishing such as salmon fishing at sea.  Do I take it the Minister has ideas about banning salmon fishing at sea?  This industry has enabled many small, part-time farmers along the western seaboard to survive during the years.  These people kept the economy of their area going because if they did not live in the area the small shopkeeper or the publican could not survive.  The western seaboard is not blessed with any industrial development other than the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to allay my fears with regard to bringing in measures which will inhibit salmon fishermen from <Col N="1708" /> making a living.  When the season is over I hope the Minister will meet the fishermen who are so enraged at having been apprehended.  If anyone told the Minister he should not do this, that or the other, I am sure he would not be dictated to. Our fishermen should not be dictated to either.  The Minister would not tell the farmers to milk their cows only five days of the week and only once a day.  Factory workers will not be dictated to or there would soon be a strike and perhaps they would picket the gates of Leinster House. The poor salmon fishermen have no leverage.  As soon as they pull into the pier the bailiff is breathing down their necks.  One would imagine they were gun runners.  I am amazed at the treatment meted out ot our fishermen.  They are so enraged they will hardly speak to any Deputy in their area because they are stopped from making a living.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The salmon fishing season will be over then and perhaps a flag of truce will be raised.  The fishermen are only asking for justice.  They are not damaging the salmon fishing industry.  This year a 30 pound salmon was caught; surely that fish was an old timer?  That size fish does not appear overnight and it proves they are not extinct.  They are still swimming from the mouths of our rivers up to Greenland and the Faroes but the culprits up there are far more clever than our fishermen.  They are trapping our stocks and are responsible for the trouble between the Department of Fisheries and Forestry and the Department of Defence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, as a gesture of goodwill, to allow the fishermen to use the monofilament nets.  If they were allowed to use these there would be no illegal nets on board.  They should also have a certain length of net and, if they exceed that length they deserve to be caught.  The 30 mesh net is useless; it is like a silk stocking floating on top of the water.  The tide is so strong from Mizen Head to the Dursey that it is impossible for any fisherman using a 30 mesh net to <Col N="1709" /> make a living or even to pay for the oil to run the boat for his day's fishing.  Fishermen should not be branded as criminals for trying to operate a net which will catch a few salmon.  They are prepared to come to terms with the Minister and even to agree to a four-day week provided they get an opportunity of fishing a 60 mesh net in that area.</P>
    <P>No salmon fisherman operating at the mouth of a river will use a 60 mesh net because it is not necessary and, furthermore, it is completely out of the question to do so.  In the Bull Rock and Mizen Head area where the tide flows very strongly, there is no point in fishing unless they have the 60 mesh net.  I know the Minister is a rational man who will not refuse to talk with the fishermen involved.  I am sure an amicable agreement can be reached whereby, instead of corvettes following our fishermen into the little inlets along the western seaboard, they would be allowed to board the Russian, Japanese, Korean and Norwegian factory ships.  They are the people who are scooping up all our fishing stock and who are doing all the harm to our industry.  The corvettes should also have the special apparatus needed to go into their fishing holds to examine their stock. Then we would have hard evidence of who is ravaging our fishing industry and trying to exterminate the finest industry we have.  We are not blessed with any great industrial developments along the western seaboard.  Next to agriculture, fisheries is our most important industry.</P>
    <P>The Dutch have caught our herrings, marinated them, put them into jars and exported them all over the world.  They are displayed in supermarkets in one and two-pound jars.  Proper development of the industry on shore is also needed.  It is no good introducing this Bill unless it is followed by action.  For far too long we have only paid lip service to the fishing industry.  It has a vast potential as far as employment is concerned.  It has been almost untapped for decades except for what the foreigners got away with.  I appeal to the Minister to adopt a new approach that will put the industry back on its feet.  Our industry is as old as Brian Boru and it was lack of planning and <Col N="1710" /> foresight by various Ministers which is responsible for the situation that exists today.  The Minister should set a headline and start anew.  He should encourage a new spirit in the industry which will yield the accumulation of wealth which is there.</P>
    <P>Our only true fears are for our soil and our seas.  Our climate is the best and the worst in the world.  It is the best in the world for agriculture and fisheries but fisheries need direction.  That direction must come from our Fisheries Minister, Deputy O'Toole, and his Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy.  I have no doubt that that team will tackle the problem and will be seen from this day forward to show leadership as far as the fishing industry is concerned.  They will be responsible for giving Irish fishermen an opportunity of making a living along the western seaboard and will see that our fishing stocks will not be ravaged by the factory ships and huge fishing boats of other countries.  They will give leadership to the rest of the European nations so that Ireland can benefit enormously from a viable fishing industry.  All that is needed is direction from the top and co-operation and dialogue from the fishermen, the men who know the job.  On-the-spot knowledge can be gained by our Minister for Fisheries when he goes out in one of the boats during his summer vacation.  Through the years our fisheries have been under the leadership of TDs who did not know the stem from the stern of a boat.  On a visit to Rossaveal in Galway on a summer vacation one of them saw lobsters and cray fish being packed into cases and asked the fishermen &ldquo;What is this fellow with the long horns?&rdquo;.  Surely to heaven if the industry must depend on a Minister for Fisheries who cannot tell a lobster from a crayfish, a mackerel from a bass or a herring from a squid no wonder it is where it is today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I compliment the Minister.  This is an extremely clever Bill in that he states that it is introduced to curb the activities of Spanish fishing vessels which are being registered in the UK and which eventually, if we do not introduce legislation, will register here.  However, <Col N="1711" /> a study of the Bill will reveal that very little of it is devoted to the Spanish problem.  All of section 2 refers to the registration of Irish boats.  Some time ago we on this side of the House said that we would give full co-operation to this legislation and we pressurised the Government to ensure that it would be introduced as early as possible.  In effect we said that we would give this Bill a speedy passage through the House provided it referred to the Spanish boats and to various problems within the industry.  It is regrettable that the Bill has more reference to Irish boats than to Spanish boats. It is to be hoped that the Minister in his reply will indicate the size of the Irish boats which are obliged to register.</P>
      <P>I said at the debate on the Estimates how important the question of conservation was.  Despite the events of the recent past I insist still that conservation is vital.  The fishing industry is based on renewable resources.  We are fortunate in that we have these renewable resources in the country and we must be certain that we conserve them.  Urgent action must be taken, but it must be the correct action.  The Bill is not unlike what I had expected, another piece of patchy legislation on top of various other patches of legislation.  I believe that as a result of pressure exerted on the Government by the Opposition Party and by various interests in the industry this was introduced rather too hastily and it is only a stop-gap which might make the situation even worse than it is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House will be aware that the enforcement of a sea fisheries policy is contained in sections 222, 223 and 224 of the Fisheries (Consolidation) Act, 1959. Even present legislation regarding these sections is slightly muddled and we should consider new legislation that would be simple and concise.  All of this legislation, going back to the Merchantile Act, 1894, through the decades to 1981 is not as concise as it should be.  The legislation before the House, which we were told was to curb the influx of Spanish boats into our waters, is based on ten Acts which we have already.  If this is legislation introduced to curb the influx <Col N="1712" /> of these boats, then in the next session we should look at legislation in relation to sea fisheries generally and have discussions if necessary in an all-party committee to study legislation in relation to fisheries.</P>
    <P>Our sea fisheries are one of our most prized assets after our land.  The law must be simple, clear and concise.  We must know exactly how we stand.  There is far too much ambiguity in relation to fishery laws.  A naval commander of a fisheries protection vessel must know exactly where he stands.  From the Minister's contribution today we are not certain what the position is in relation to waters inside and outside the 12-mile limit. There should be no shady area; it should be either black or white.  The skippers and crews of trawlers also must know exactly where they stand.  At the moment they are at the disadvantage of not knowing where they stand.  Above all, the courts do not know where they stand in relation to all of this legislation.  It should be a guideline and we must be more specific.  The Minister may &mdash; no doubt he will &mdash; say that this legislation is only a temporary measure to meet an existing need.  We should not allow the Minister or the Government to put any further legislation on the long finger as a result of this stop-gap operation today.  I fully support the conservation measures required because of the importance of this fishery and the fact that it is a renewable resource.</P>
    <P>My contributions in relation to the salmon industry could have been misread but at all times I stressed the importance of conservation.  If the fishermen do not adhere to the rules and regulations there is not future for them or their children. If we take only sufficient salmon each year the fishery can be sustained for centuries. There is a problem because of friction between the Department and the fishermen and it may well be that the fishermen are not abiding by the regulations. However, the Minister must admit that some of the regulations are antiquated and must be updated.  I suggest that at the end of the salmon season the Minister should invite representatives from the organisation representing <Col N="1713" /> inshore fishermen to discuss the problems with them.  Unfortunately they are not as well organised as the Irish Fishermen's Organisation who deal with the larger boats.  However, they could advise the Minister of the reasons for fishing during the day.  We are all aware of the tragedies which have occurred off our coasts and the incidence of such tragedies can be reduced by using a net which can only be used during the day.</P>
    <P>We could also reach agreement with the fishermen that they would stick strictly to a five-day week and would not fish at weekends, as has been the practice for many years.  There is a general consensus among fishermen that if they were to adhere to a five-day week and use an acceptable length of gear the problem would be solved.  Before the monofilament net was introduced fishermen did operate at weekends and this resulted in poor quality fish in the market place.  The Irish salmon was inferior to the Scottish salmon and the Irish processor and smoker had so much difficulty in selling fish that our salmon were labelled as Scottish salmon, this being the only way to sell them.  This was as a result of fishing during closed periods.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to consider meeting these people without any prior commitment and allowing them to put their case.  Natural conservation takes place during very good weather such as we are enjoying today because fishermen cannot use their nets without some breeze.  During extremely poor weather they are also unable to fish.  While we have legislation such as this there will be further battles at sea.  There is an old saying that nothing good comes from fighting at sea and this has been true in past centuries.</P>
    <P>There is no guarantee that salmon fishing by foreign boats is not taking place outside our 12-mile limit.  The Minister says that it is internationally accepted that salmon fishing does not take place beyond the 12-mile limit, but if we implement a 12-mile ban on salmon fishing by our own fishermen, we have no guarantee that foreign boats will not be fishing 50 or 60 miles offshore.  It would be fruitless for fishermen to depend on fish caught <Col N="1714" /> within 12 miles because a very small percentage of our fish are caught within that band.  The enforcement of such a ban would put an end to salmon fishing.  Last year salmon was worth £3.4 million and this gave a tremendous boost to the Exchequer.  The income from salmon comes back to small parishes along the west coast to people who are entirely dependent on it for their livelihood.  The Minister of State suggests that they should take advantage of other types of fishing.  Boats which traditionally fished for salmon cannot be used for any other type of fishing but lobster.</P>

      <P>The Minister suggested that we could take advantage of the Common Fisheries Policy under the heading &ldquo;Structures&rdquo;, that we could avail of assistance for the reconstruction and modernisation of fishing vessels.  It was suggested that that would be an advantage to fishermen, but the condition is that the vessels be between 39 ft. and 100 ft.  The type of boats being used in this instance will not be eligible to take advantage of this aid.  In addition, unless this regulation is changed, I understand the minimum conversion cost must be 65,000 ECUs, something like £45,000.</P>
      <P>It would be impossible for these boats to be converted from one type of fishing to another.  The Minister of State mentioned cray fishing.  There are many parts of the country where crayfish cannot be found, particularly parts of Donegal. Tory was a traditional cray fishing area. To suggest that lobster and cray fishing are a substitute for salmon fishing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be aware that salmon and lobster fishing seasons are not two different seasons, that they largely overlap.  I should like to refer generally to other aspects of the industry because we did not have time to discuss them during the debate on the Estimate.  The general conservation programme must be employed to the fullest, particularly in regard to mackerel and <Col N="1715" /> herring.  Quotas must be uniformly enforced and monitored by the EEC.  All boats from here and other countries should have observers aboard to monitor all catches to ensure that quotas of mackerel and herring will not be exceeded.</P>
      <P>These observers could serve a very useful purpose by making available a bank of scientific knowledge, such as the type of gear being used, water temperatures, the plankton content.  They could detect species of rare fish and I refer specifically to blue whiting.  Blue whiting stocks could be developed, particularly since mackerel stocks began to decline.  If stocks of blue whiting could be developed our fishermen could rely on that fish.</P>
      <P>Our mackerel stocks declined despite recommendations from scientists that there were sufficient mackerel off our west coast.  It was not our fishermen who were to blame for the decline in mackerel fishing, because the Department and the scientists told us there were sufficient stocks of the fish, and of herring, off the coast of Mayo without any need for controls. It is not so many years since thousands of cran of herrings were being landed but now none is available off that coast.</P>
      <P>We should do as much research as possible, as I have said, in relation to blue whiting.  It will be too late to do marketing research when we begin to land blue whiting.  Now is the time to do it.</P>
      <P>We should not make any concessions to Norway along the north west coast or to provide them with what would be an open door.  I have been told that they have been offered a quota of 3,000 tonnes, but once they come in it will be difficult to monitor precisely what they would take unless we have observers on board.</P>
      <P>I am afraid the blue whiting has been used as a red herring to cover up problems in relation to mackerel.  We will be giving away only 3,000 tonnes but, as I have said, the catches should be monitored strictly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of mackerel quotas, I was pleased to note that the proposal by the Commission to reduce our quota from 82,000 tonnes to 55,000 tonnes was <Col N="1716" /> rejected by the Minister.  This proposal is not acceptable to our fishermen, our processors and exporters.  The reduction could have serious consequences for employment in the industry.  I do not think Ireland should have to pay for the sins of the other countries which have been over-fishing.  It has been proposed that the quota throughout the EEC of 275,000 tonnes should be reduced by 25 per cent. That reduction should be across the board because the countries responsible for over-fishing should be penalised for their sins.</P>
    <P>Ireland are not taking the amount of mackerel that would seriously affect our stocks.  Our fishermen could possibly take more than the 82,000 tonnes without affecting stocks and I hope that at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers our Minister will insist on this, pointing out that we depend largely on fishing and that therefore we must obtain some preferential treatment, particularly on the west coast.  The Irish are not causing any damage to stocks and if our quota has to be reduced by roughly 25,000 tonnes, that should be deducted from the quotas of other countries because we are a coastal State with many under-developed regions along the west and north-west coasts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In paragraph (1) to delete all words after &ldquo;life,&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;to examine the problems which follow the breakdown of marriage, to make recommendations on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required, and to report to the Houses of the Oireachtas thereon.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to require the committee to make recommendations on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required and to report to both Houses.  We have a second amendment that would require the committee to report within six months rather than the year which was provided for in the motion.  Both amendments would restore the position to that agreed in the Joint Programme for Government and the position which was outlined by the Taoiseach in reply to a question I had tabled on the matter.  Both of these amendments would restore the position to that agreed in the Joint Programme for Government.  They also restore the position outlined by the Taoiseach to me on 26 January last, in reply to a question on the matter, when he said that an all-party Oireachtas committee would be established which would make recommendations on the protection of marriage in modern conditions, on the problems of marital breakdown and on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required.  It also restores the position of the motion which was moved by the Government parties in the Seanad and passed on 15 June.  That motion stated that it was the proposal of the Government to establish a Joint Oireachtas Committee which would make recommendations on the protection of marriage under modern conditions, on marital breakdown and on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The reason these amendments are moved is that the present motion does <Col N="1731" /> not require the committee to make any recommendations.  In their terms of reference there is no mention of the fact that they should discuss the question of divorce, or of recommendations for legislative proposals on any matter whether constitutional or otherwise.  I am willing to go along with the idea that Members of this House require an all-party committee in order to provide some form of cover for themselves moving in the direction of divorce.  But it would be totally nonsensical to have a committee discuss the whole question of marital breakdown, how marriage can be protected, and ignore the fact that they must, if their work is to have any effect at all, come up with recommendations with regard to the dissolution of marriage.</P>
    <P>It has been estimated that something in the region of 70,000 adults in this State are at present affected by marital breakdown. Indeed, the public are way ahead of the politicians in this House in their attitude to the dissolution of marriage. Furthermore, we have the extraordinary position in which at least one church in this State allows marriages to be dissolved through their own courts.  As a result people are remarrying, which second marriages are not recognised by the State.  There are no procedures whatsoever by which a person can remarry in this State.  It must be remembered that marriages have been breaking down and that people who can afford to do so can go abroad to obtain divorces.  They can also obtain separations in the State through the courts.  It is totally ludicrous for us to continue to ignore these facts. Therefore, I would press the Government to accept the amendments, as proposed, thereby giving this committee some positive role in relation to the matters they will be discussing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Mr. Mac Giolla Mr. Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to support what Deputy De Rossa has said on the need for hardening up the terms of reference of the all-party committee on marital breakdown.  It must be nearly ten years since the last all-party committee on this issue deliberated.  There has been much <Col N="1732" /> talk over the years as to what should or should not be done.  Meanwhile nothing has been done.  Therefore, the committee now being established will constitute a start on the part of this House in giving some leadership on this issue of grave concern to many people.  There are something in the region of 70,000 people &mdash; not just couples, but people generally, including families &mdash; involved in marital breakdowns.  Their position has been almost totally ignored by this House, people who have enormous legal problems both with regard to themselves and their children.</P>
      <P>There are many different types of separations in this State.  There are annulments, divorces <i>a mensa et toro</i>.  There are legal separations.  Then there are separations of no legal character at all, couples who voluntarily and mutually agree to separate.  Then there are people who have obtained divorces outside the jurisdiction.  All of these people encounter different problems.  What we are really talking about are people whose marriages have irretrievably broken down, which is recognised by everybody in the community who has been involved with them &mdash; social workers, clergy, lawyers, solicitors and so on.  They endeavour to reach some settlements within the constitutional provision that they can never remarry.  Of course that leads to further problems, co-habitation, other families and perhaps even another separation. All sorts of legal complications result.  It is very important that we assist them in sorting out these problems and provide some solutions for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason presumably the committee when they sit will examine all of these problems.  It will be vitally important that they make some recommendations to us in this House, giving us some kind of lead on what should be the next line of action.  It is to be hoped that it will be a firm committee, able to make recommendations on which we can then act or not, as the case may be.  It must be seen by the public to have some effect. Otherwise it will be seen by them as an attempt to brush all of these problems under the carpet to be forgotten about for 12 months.  Reports may be issued but <Col N="1733" /> if they do not have recommendations they do not have any effect.  If a recommendation is sent to the House it will be seen that the committee had some purpose and that we are giving a commitment and some leadership on this matter.  It was expected by the public that the committee would be an all-party group that would examine the matter and make recommendations to the House.</P>
    <P>Our first amendment asks that the committee make recommendations on any legislative or constitutional action that may be required and our second amendment seeks to shorten the time from 12 months to six months from the date of the passing of the motion.  I ask the Government, the Government Chief Whip and the Fianna Fáil Chief Whip, to accept our amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a comment on the amendments tabled by The Workers' Party.  I welcome the decision to establish these committees but I do not believe they will commence deliberations until October.  Six months from now will bring us into December and that is not sufficient time for the committee to do all its work.  It would be impossible for the committee to carry out all its work in that time.  I disagree totally with the amendment which seeks to reduce the amount of time from 12 months to six months.  The first part of The Workers' Party amendment is catered for in the motion which states that the committee will report to the Houses of the Oireachtas and I imagine that report will contain recommendations.  I do not think the amendments are relevant.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to refer to the motion in my name, the committee on crime, lawlessness and vandalism.  I should like to thank the Government who in a short period agreed with my party to the terms of reference for this select committee. All the committees being established today are important and I trust they will receive the support and interest of all Members.  The committee I am referring to is probably the most important one to be established.  It may not be for those representing rural areas but it is for Members from city areas.  I gather from my colleagues who represent other cities that the problem of crime, vandalism and lawlessness is second in importance only to the unemployment question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three aspects that must be dealt with by the committee are the administration of justice, the implementation of the criminal law and existing legislation. They will open up a massive area for debate.  Whatever about completing the work of another committee in six months, I know that the committee under discussion now will be able to complete only sections of their brief over a number of years.  It is also expected that the committee <Col N="1736" /> will report back to the House.  The Criminal Law Jurisdiction Bill, which will be circulated shortly, will provoke a lot of discussion; but a lot of the legislation covering crime and vandalism has not been looked at for years.  Most of the rulings have been made under Acts which date back to 1850 or 1890.  Those interested in doing something constructive to overcome the major problems we have in crime and vandalism in Dublin and other cities should work actively on the new committee.  Many Members have legal experience and, consequently, we can bring in reports quickly and get some of the matters which cause problems in the courts dealt with.</P>
    <P>We have the bizarre situation in regard to the drugs scene and the crazy laws in regard to car thefts.  Last year there were 21,894 car thefts in Dublin city but a person apprehended is charged only with not having a driving licence rather than a more serious offence.  We have outdated laws in regard to bail and the difficult position of the Garda who try to implement the law.  Our outdated courts continue to hand down rulings from a different age.  The new committee will be a continuous voice in regard to those problems.  I hope it will meet through the summer with the exception of the month of August.  I am sure people will accept that we are entitled, like everybody else, to four weeks holidays.  I hope to be selected to act on this new committee and, if so, I will be very active.</P>
    <P>If we have a general understanding that Members should attend the meetings without being whipped to them, the committee system will succeed.  It should not be a question of Members paying lip service to them or running away from them.  Our friends in the press should spend whatever time they can covering the meetings of those committees.  The House is too formal for a normal debate and we get caught up too often in party politics and silly issues to the detriment of important issues.  On the Order Paper today there is reference to very important legislation but much of it is far removed from the problems affecting the country. All the committees can contribute in a major way to reform of this House and <Col N="1737" /> this will be acknowledged by people outside the House.  If the committees are effective the press &mdash; they are fair regardless of what some may say &mdash; and the people will realise we are doing our job in a proper manner.</P>
    <P>Even though he is absent I should like to congratulate the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy John Bruton, for his hard work in all this matter.  After Christmas we had a debate on Dáil reform. Even though people criticised us and said we must have nothing to do, we followed up the matter with meetings between the Taoiseach, the leader of my party, the Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Fennell, and others in order to come to final agreement.  I should like to thank the Taoiseach for his co-operation in facilitating our party in the recommendations we put forward.</P>

I have a question down today on the matter and I will pursue it then.  I hope the committee will take power to deal not just with crime but with organised crime and with the Bugsy Malones and the A1 Capones on the north and south side of the city.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise the difficulty with regard to time but, as the Government Chief Whip pointed out, there will be other opportunities to discuss the matter in depth.  I welcome the setting up of the committees.  I have served on committees of this House before now and I join in the appeal made by Deputy Ahern to Members to give of their time.  In the past committees sat during recess and no doubt these committees will do the same.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All the committees are important in their own right but the committee dealing with crime, lawlessness and vandalism is one that I welcome more than any of the others.  I compliment Deputy Ahern for pushing ahead with this committee which I consider is more relevant to the immediate problems not only of cities and urban areas but also of rural areas.  The administration of justice and the implementation of existing legislation dealing with criminal law will be considered by the committee.  I understand that in the <Col N="1739" /> near future we will have the long promised Criminal Justice Bill and this will give us some indication of the Government's proposals.  There is no doubt that the courts system &mdash; this applies certainly in my city &mdash; has been clogged up completely and this is a major concern.  Criminal cases are frequently held up for three years and this means people are aware that the law cannot act against them for a long period.  If people are on bail they can continue to commit offences.</P>
    <P>It is most important for young people in particular that they be given leadership in their community.  They should be proud of their area.  Proper facilities should be provided for them; I am not talking about expensive facilities but minimal facilities.  If young people have a pride in their area it will do more to eliminate vandalism than most other actions.</P>

      <P>For the benefit of Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa I should like to read out the agreed statement on the terms of reference. These terms of reference will enable the committee to consider every aspect of the matter, including whether any legislative or constitutional changes are necessary. There was agreement on the terms of reference in relation to the committee on marital breakdown.  All of us are concerned about this problem.  If the Deputies wish I will send them a copy of the agreed statement.  Having regard to the time limit I do not think it would be doing full justice to the committee if it was restricted with regard to time.</P>
      <P>I pay tribute to the Opposition and to Deputy Haughey for their co-operation, even at the last moment, in agreeing to set up the two committees.  Both of them are very important.  We believed all along that it was desirable to have a consensus and to have agreement.  Since I came into this House in June 1981 there have been discussions and question about the problem of marital breakdown.  I hope the committee will meet as soon as possible. I know many people will be watching the work of the committee with great expectations. Again, I should like to pay tribute to Members on the opposite benches who have helped us to set up the committees.</P>

      <P>I should like to put one question to the Minister.  I should like to know why it was considered necessary to deviate from the normal procedure in establishing committees.  For instance, motion No. 7 talks about the committee making recommendations but motion No. 6 does not.  The reason we put down our amendment was because we considered it necessary to require the committee to make recommendations.  However, the terms of reference do not require the committee to make recommendations and I wish to know if there is some reason for that.  It is a change <Col N="1741" /> from the normal procedure for establishing committees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, it is not customary to disclose details of confidential <Col N="1742" /> discussions with other Heads of Government.</P>
    <P>As I informed the House on 22 June in my statement about the European Council meeting, the Prime Minister and I agreed to a further substantive meeting, which will probably take place before the end of the year.  The precise arrangements for the meeting will be announced shortly in advance, in accordance with the normal practice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Taoiseach says about the position in regard to the confidentiality of these meetings but I must direct his attention to a statement made by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons in which she indicated that she had brief talks on the margins of the European Council with the Taoiseach and that anything that was said would not have troubled the Honourable Gentleman&mdash;the Honourable Gentleman being Dr. Ian Paisley.  She went on to say: &ldquo;We did not discuss the new Ireland Forum and I constantly make it clear, as it is clear at all times the constitutional position of Northern Ireland is for the people of Northern Ireland and for this Parliament. I reaffirm that gladly.&rdquo;  Now the Taoiseach may be reticent and perhaps rightly so, about the contents of that discussion at that meeting, but that reticence apparently does not apply to the British Prime Minister.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would care to comment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not.  I take the view which Deputy Haughey expressed on 31 March 1982 after a European Council meeting that it is not customary to disclose details of conversations of this type and I do not propose to disclose details now for that reason.  It is a matter of speculation anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach must accept now that the British Prime Minister has categorically stated the New Ireland Forum was not discussed, that he is equally at liberty to tell us it was not and, if so, does he not think it is unreal and unnatural that a meeting between himself and the British Prime Minister could take place at this stage without any <Col N="1743" /> discussion on the New Ireland Forum, its work, its objectives and the ambitions we all share with regard to it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Your reticence, through the Chair, does you credit.  May I move then to the question of a future meeting between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister?  May we take it that it was agreed such a meeting would take place this year and, if so, will it be earlier or later?  I am not asking the Taoiseach to disclose any of the details which would affect the security situation but the House and the people would like to know what exactly is intended.  The Taoiseach spoke to the British Prime Minister at some length and I think now he must tell us whether or not there is a specific agreement for this year and, if so, when.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>As was stated after the meeting, a meeting will probably take place before the end of this year.  As to the timing of it I can only repeat what the Deputy stated after the meeting on 22 June 1982 that it is not the custom to say in advance when a summit meeting is likely to be held.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking the Taoiseach to tell me in advance when it is likely to be held.  I am only asking him to confirm, if possible, that it is agreed that such a meeting will take place.  It is of vital significance to many of us whether or not such a meeting will take place before the Forum has reported and I think he should tell us if he can &mdash; if he cannot let him say so &mdash; whether or not it is agreed a meeting will take place this year and, if so, will it be the very end of the year, or earlier in the year, or when? I am not asking for specific weeks or days or anything like that.</P>

The exact arrangements in respect of this meeting have not yet been made but it will probably take place before the end of this year.  The relationship between that and the Forum is that the Forum is to report by the end of the year but, as we have not a date fixed with the British Prime Minister, I cannot relate it to any point in time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>For over a year there has been a scheme <Col N="1745" /> specifically designed to assist farmers in severe financial difficulty.  This is known as the rescue package.  In addition to this scheme, which reduces interest paid on eligible borrowings by as much as 8.75 per cent and is intended to cover £190 million of advances, there are EEC and national 5 per cent interest subsidies schemes in relation to borrowings for farm modernisation.</P>
      <P>My Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, and I, as well as officials of my Department, are having ongoing discussions with the lending institutions about the situation of farmers who are finding difficulty in meeting their commitments. The aim is to ensure a uniform and sympathetic approach and my understanding is that the lending institutions are prepared to be helpful to any farmer in difficulties who goes in and discusses his problems with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell the House the total indebtedness of Irish farmers to lending institutions and, in view of the fact that only £190 million is in the rescue package, does he intend to raise it to a higher level?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that I have not the figure the Deputy is seeking.  I have seen newspaper reports in the last few days to the effect that the sum is in excess of £400 million.  I am just talking off the top of my head because I have not that specific figure.  The scheme is confined because of financial restraints.  As I told the Deputy in reply to a question last week we are committed to spending about £30 million over a five-year period.  We have no intention at the moment of going outside that limitation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>My information is that it is much closer to £2,000 million.  There is £1,350 million for the associated banks alone and a further £400 million for the ACC.  Notwithstanding that, it appears that, in view of the Exchequer payment to the rescue package, at least 10,000 farmers find themselves unable to meet their commitments and that at least 36 seizure orders have been issued by the <Col N="1746" /> ACC alone in recent months.  Has the Minister any plans for asking the lending institutions to at least reduce their rate of interest in view of the inflation rate at the moment and maybe extend the terms of borrowing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not dispute the Deputy's figure as I have not got the exact figure.  As regards approaching the lending institutions, I have already met the ACC and impressed on them my worry that farmers who are making a reasonable attempt to repay their borrowing should be dealt with in a very sympathetic manner.  I understand that orders have been taken out against 36 farmers, as the Deputy stated.  I am also informed that these are cases where the ACC were aware that the people concerned had considerable assets and where they would have expected them to have made some attempt to meet repayments and such an effort was not forthcoming.  It was only in very drastic circumstances, where an honest effort was not made to meet repayments, that the ACC actually moved.  I would not condemn the ACC for doing that.  I believe they are correct if they feel people have assets and are making no attempt to meet repayments. If I felt that they were acting against people who could not reasonably be expected to make repayments I would certainly be very annoyed.  I am happy that the ACC are not doing that.  I intend to meet the associated banks within the next week or two and I will be putting the same point to them.</P>

As I stated here previously this is due to a variety of factors, the main one being the complex nature of this scheme and <Col N="1747" /> the difficulty in getting farmers to prepare plans which will show that they can become viable as a result of partaking in this scheme.  Another great source of difficulty is that a number of the farmers who have not had their applications fully processed are people who have borrowed from two or more lending institutions. That creates difficulties and requires a certain amount of co-ordination between the farmer concerned and the lending institutions involved.  There is a reluctance by certain people who are in trouble to actually go in and speak to the banks and the ACC.  That is another major contributory factor.  People are loath to approach the lending institutions.  I have repeatedly said, as the lending institutions have said, that they are only too willing to discuss these matters with the people involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that there is such a large number of farmers, who have not qualified for aid under the farm rescue package, because they have not been able to come up with plans showing that they can become viable within three years, and that those people appear to be farmers who are in the worst mentioned position of all &mdash; they are gone beyond help &mdash; would the Minister consider it desirable that some scheme of assistance be made available to those farmers as otherwise, as is the case at present&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very well aware of this.  That is the primary reason for my concern.  If we could get the cases, which can be got out of the way, settled fairly quickly, we would be in a position to study in greater detail the type of cases referred to by Deputy Molony.  Each case is individual and differs from any other case.  There is an enormous amount of work involved.  I hope we can wrap up the rescue package, which is the source of the question here today, by the end of this year, enabling us to study in greater detail the type of problem which has been referred to.  That does not mean that we are excluding examination of such problems in the meantime.  That is why I am meeting the lending institutions.  I want to see if we can work out some scheme which will give a sympathetic understanding to their cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree with me that in the first instance, plans were drawn up with the banks and the farmers when the original loan was made?  Would he agree with me that <Col N="1749" /> because of the drastic increase in interest rates we now find ourselves in the position we are in?  Would he not insist that the banks take account of this and in instances where the local bank manager is very anxious that his client gets aid, which the banks at top level are not anxious to give, would the Minister's Department see to it that where the local manager is on the farmer's side this should be reacted to?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the main reasons why we are meeting the lending institutions.  I am concerned that one bank in particular may have centralised its processing of applications.  I consider that to be very unhealthy.  The processing should be done locally at branch level. Some banks may feel that they are losing heavily because of those bad debts but the humane attitude would be to deal with them locally rather than in Dublin. That is a point I will convey to the banks.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that a small percentage of farmers will get little or no benefit from the rescue package?  Is the Minister further aware that the attitude of the lending institutions is that these farmers should dispose of some of their assets?  Another attitude is that they should get planning permission for land along the roadside and sell sites.  Is the Minister further aware that because of the cost of getting the planning permission and due to the capital gains tax situation there will be a very small benefit to the farmers and it will have little or no effect on the amount of money they owe to lending institutions?  Has the Minister any proposals to ensure that young farmers with families will be preserved in agriculture for the good of the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That series of questions covers such a vast area that I could be here for weeks answering them.  I would need a team of officials from my Department to advise me.  Even within the confines of the rescue package some farmers will have to sell off portions of their land; it will not only be farmers outside the scope of the rescue package.  It would be very hard to solve some of the cases without some assets having to be sold off.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department do not have any proposals to change the present system of disposal of reactor cattle.  The system which has been in operation since 1976 is satisfactory from a disease eradication viewpoint.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister tell us the amount of money that would be involved in having the Department dispose of reactors in view of the danger that disease can be spread by infected lorries in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That system was previously <Col N="1751" /> in operation and it was not very successful. The biggest factor is the delay in getting to the factory the animal diagnosed as having TB or brucellosis.  One of the major steps forward in reducing the incidences of bovine TB and brucellosis has been the speed in getting the animal to the factory.  The scheme which we announced recently whereby reactor grants are increased requires, as a condition of the grant, that the beast be moved within 20 rather than the original 30 days.  Ideally the animal should be moved on the day the disease is detected but that would create some difficulties.  I have no intention of going back to the situation which pertained before 1976. The present system is working well as illustrated by the recent figures which show a dramatic drop in the number of cattle suffering from bovine TB.</P>

If Question Time were to continue on those lines it would be far more effective and beneficial to the House.  Questions that do not arise out of the question on the Order Paper are not relevant and the fact that the Minister, has a general knowledge of his Department and he is on his feet, does not <Col N="1752" /> require him to answer any question, as that could lead to all sorts of absurdities.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will, in view of County Kerry being made a special TB status zone from 1 July 1983, give an assurance that he will allow the local veterinary surgeons in private practice to carry out these two tests per annum, as they have done so effectively in the past; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Discussions in relation to the special status zone are taking place with interested parties, and the manner in which a second round of testing in the zone will be carried out figures prominently in those discussions.  No final decision has, however, been taken in this regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister <Col N="1755" /> for having Kerry designated as a special status zone for bovine TB testing.  I am sure my question prompted the Minister to make a quick decision here.  In view of the fact that Kerry has set a headline for the rest of the country and reduced the number of bovine TB cases from 10 per cent to .2 per cent due to the efforts of the veterinary surgeons who are in private practice in Kerry, I would seek an assurance from the Minister that he would allow them to do the two tests for this special area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure if the incidence is as low as the Deputy stated.  The objective of the scheme is to get it down to .2 per cent, but it is relatively low at the moment in Kerry.  I have had discussions with the Irish veterinary union which included some representatives from Kerry.  I have given them an assurance that that matter will be fully discussed with them before any decision is taken. I think they are reasonably happy about that.</P>

      <P>The reduction in State grants to county committees from £290,000 in 1982 to £150,000 this year was decided on by the previous Government in the context of the Estimates for 1983 and endorsed by the present Government.  It is a matter for the committees themselves to decide how best to operate within the limits of the available funds.</P>

      <P>Naturally I am disappointed at the Minister's reply.  In case he is not aware, the area concerned is in South Tipperary.  Due to the local authority not paying their contribution to the committees &mdash; he might look into that area &mdash; the local authority are starving the ACOT committee.  It is very serious because the farmers cannot even discuss their problems and highlight them to the Minister.  It is a sad day for this country and for agriculture&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Will he agree with me that we are at a very low ebb when farmers cannot even meet to discuss their problems which are national problems?

Whether outgoing or incoming a Government are there to govern, not to play around with figures or talk about bringing in Estimates&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no such thing as playing around with figures.  We just cut. We reduced the amount from £290,000 to £150,000.  It was portion of a whole range of reductions and measures that were taken in the 1983 Estimates.  I regret that it has resulted in some committees having difficulties in holding meetings, but some committees have arranged their meetings in such a manner that they can go through the year on the existing Estimate. For instance three counties, Donegal, Mayo and Monaghan, are not having monthly meetings, they are having meetings every two months and in that way overcoming the financial difficulty involved.  I have asked the Minister for the Environment if he will follow up the matter of payments to the county committees of agriculture because that is really within his jurisdiction.  I know the committees are suffering because of failure to meet commitments in that regard.</P>

A considerable quantity of grass seed was grown in the Cavan-Monaghan area but they have been unable to compete with foreign imports.  It is a matter I will look at because we are producing only about 10 to 15 per cent of our requirements.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister feel it is right to penalise people who were trying to improve their holdings by carrying out the instructions of the advisory service?  The Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture.  Deputy Connaughton, said last week that grants for houses were abolished overnight, but that is not true because people were given a couple of months to apply.  Would the Minister agree that the suspension of these grants is causing grave hardship to most of the 4,644 farmers who have been disqualified, some of whom are facing eviction?  For the sake of £5.5 million, would the Minister not reconsider the whole matter and pay the grants?  There will be very little development during the winter months.  It is a national scandal that the Minister for Finance should put the Minister for Agriculture in that position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to headage payments, particularly having regard to the problem in the Cooley peninsula, the small part of our county which is included in the disadvantaged areas.  The off-farm income limit has been decreased from £5,500 to £3,500 if he is a single person. If he is married with five or six children, the limit is £5,500.  The implications are <Col N="1765" /> obvious.  An applicant with £3,500 from off-farm employment would not get any headage for the sheep he would rear on the holding.</P>

An elaborate system for the selection of the jury such as that provided for court purposes would not appear to be necessary in the case of inquests, which are few in number even in Dublin, which serve a very limited purpose, namely to establish the identity of the person on whom the inquest is being held, and how, when and where death occurred: questions of civil or criminal liability are not permitted by law to be considered or investigated at the inquest.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> About 50 per cent of inquests held by the Dublin City Coroner are held with juries.  Normally, the coroner would know only a week or less in advance of the day when he could hold an inquest; on rare occasions he might have two weeks' notice. As soon as the date is fixed for an inquest the coroner's office notify the Garda who investigated the circumstances of the death and inform them that a jury is required.  Under section 43 of the Coroners Act, 1962, it then becomes necessary for the Garda to assemble a jury.  As a rule, the gardaí who investigated the case contact Store Street station and request them to assemble a jury.  Therefore, it is not the investigating gardaí who assemble the jury.  Juries normally consist of office workers, factory workers and shopkeepers from the inner city area.  It seems to <Col N="1768" /> be working well and is appropriate at the moment.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Reported crime in the Castleisland area in the last four years does not bear out the suggestion of a major increase in serious crime.  For example, in 1982 offences against property with violence totalled 51, of which 38 were detected, and last year out of 30, 24 were detected. There was not a major increase.  For example, in 1980 in one instance it was 19 and 12 and in the case of larcenies it was 63 and 53.  There was a significant increase in crime which can be attributed to a spate of larcenies and burglaries which were detected in 1980 but by 1981 the crime had dropped to 56 per cent again.  The back-up service is there but, as the Deputy is aware, where there is a large influx of population to seaside resorts arrangements are made to cover those resorts during the summer season after which the patrol car reverts to its base station for the remainder of the year.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I was the dealing with the competition we are experiencing not alone from third countries&mdash;the legislation before the House is meant to prevent boats from such countries fishing here&mdash; but from EEC countries also.  The Dutch have a quota of 35,000 tons and they had a similar quota last year.  They went to the Commission and said: &ldquo;mea culpa we have landed 1,000 tons over and above; please forgive us&rdquo;.  In fact, they claimed a subsidy from the EEC for £190,000. They appear to be in a position to ignore all rules, regulations and quotas set down by the EEC.  We should expose this and I have no doubt that the Minister will. The Minister should endeavour to ascertain how the Dutch obtained the other 145,000 tons on which they claimed a subsidy from the EEC.  In my view it amounts to a manipulation of figures only.  We are obeying the rules and regulations and playing the game but they are working to our detriment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those involved in the industry should continue to take better care of the fish using the improved facilities which are available to them.  The processors and exporters should be enticed to add greater value to their products thus creating more employment here.  I am realistic enough not to accept the theory that all fish landed should be processed here. I can see valid reasons why cans of fish <Col N="1828" /> produced in other countries are displayed on supermarket shelves here.  It must be remembered that our industry is in its infancy.  We should do our utmost to work our way up the added-value scale until we are able to make such products available here.  We must experience competition but I do not believe finished goods from other countries is the problem at present.  Any business today has high powered marketing and the fishing industry has a marketing problem like any other developing.  We are competing against the professionals and the multinationals. We must strive to improve our methods so that eventually we can produce commodities of the highest standard and we must make every effort to cut down on imports by substituting the home-produced product.</P>
    <P>The Commission should consider a system of price support for the fishing industry, somewhat along the same lines as that given in respect of agriculture.  In the debate on the Estimates for the Department I spoke about the need for greater co-ordination between the various bodies. For far too long the attitude between the fishermen and the processors was &ldquo;us versus them&rdquo;.  Things have changed for the better, but there is need for greater co-ordination and the Department must give the lead.  The Minister should initiate talks between representatives of the fishermen, the processors and those involved in the marketing and service sectors.  A council should be set up with power to deal with matters concerning the industry. Each sector needs the assistance of the others if the industry is to prosper. They should have at their disposal the expert advice of officials in the Department and of BIM.  That organisation have been criticised here on numerous occasions but they have played an important role in the development of the fishing industry.  Possibly BIM are somewhat confined because of their terms of reference and I suggest that the terms should be looked at again.  BIM have the personnel to do the job if the terms of reference are changed.</P>

Even the penalties suggested today by the Minister in relation to third country boats would not be high enough if they related to boats of EEC countries because of the system that operates.  The Dutch are building vessels for the specific purpose of fishing off the west coast.  Their quota of 35,000 tonnes has been reduced by 25 per cent but one has to ask the question why are they building these super boats. It is to fish off our coasts.  Their quota could be caught by two of the Irish refrigerated sea water vessels in a short period. A maximum penalty should be imposed to keep foreign vessels, including the Dutch, from raping our fisheries.  The existing penalties are only a joke.  The Dutch and other countries find it very cheap if a penalty is imposed on them here.  Our laws are not stringent enough and the penalties are not high enough to deter them from coming here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of the Common Fisheries Policy but that is only similar to outline planning permission.  It is useless unless we are prepared to forge ahead with a national fisheries policy.  It is regrettable that steps have not been taken up to now even to discuss the possibility of having such a policy.  The common fisheries policy is only a base.  I hope in the next few months the Minister and his officials will give consideration to a national fisheries policy, which I consider a necessity.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on the Department's management system which will be put into operation irrespective of our quota.  I have had discussions with fishermen, particularly those who are finding the financial strain of repayments too much for them.  Boats over 90 feet will be allowed only 500 tonnes per week.  We cannot accept that system or the quotas to which I referred earlier.</P>
    <P>I did not have an opportunity of speaking in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  There is an important link between that Department and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. We became aware of that last November when it was obvious that boats would have to tie up because of problems in <Col N="1830" /> obtaining money from Nigeria.  It transpired that it would take three or four months before the money came through. The then Minister, Deputy Daly, with Deputy MacSharry in the Department of Finance and Deputy Flynn, in the Department of Trade Commerce and Tourism did an excellent job.  The Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism with the ICC insured that facilities were made available to the processors and they did not have to stop freezing fish.  However, what happened then should be enough warning to ensure that something similar does not happen this year.  Apart from the officials in the Department and the Minister, I do not think anyone here realised the seriousness of the position.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the Government provide credit guarantees to our exporters similar to those provided to our main competitors, particularly the Dutch and the British. This export credit could be provided by the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. The risk involved is minimal.  In so far as Nigeria is concerned, at the end of the day the risk lies with the Central Bank of Nigeria.  The Nigerian market was opened by the then Minister, Deputy Daly, and I have no doubt that this Minister will continue that policy and ensure that we keep the market we have obtained there.  I hope the Minister will go there at the first opportunity to ensure that the work initiated by Deputy Daly is continued and that the market share is increased.  Without the provision of export credit the industry could come to a standstill.  Our fleet would have no outlet for their fish apart from the 25 per cent taken by the freezer vessels and the floating factories that come here each winter.</P>
    <P>The Bill is exceptionally clever.  We asked the Government to introduce it to ensure that the Spanish or any other third country boats would not be allowed to operate the system which they operate in the UK at present.  The UK introduced legislation in March to prevent this.  It is only right and proper that we should also take similar steps but it would be interesting to know how effective this legislation is in the UK and if it has prevented <Col N="1831" /> these boats from continuing to fish there. I believe the UK were more specific at the time, although I am open to contradiction on this.  We are doing this by the Minister making an order stating that a percentage of the crew members must be Irish.  There is no reference to the actual percentage, although it should be the maximum percentage as introduced by the British of at least 75 per cent or more. The Bill refers to a percentage only and that section must be tightened up.</P>
    <P>Section (2) of the Bill proposes that Irish registered fishing vessels can only fish in Irish waters in accordance with the terms of a licence issued by the Minister. This is a very serious matter because by implication&mdash;and I hope the Minister will clarify this&mdash;we are suggesting that Irish boats can only fish inside the 12-mile limit.  I see the Minister shaking his head and I am sure he will place it on the record that it does not refer to Irish boats in Irish waters outside the 12-mile limit.</P>
    <P>Section (3) provides for the Minister to make regulations specifying conditions and the nationality of crew members to which I referred earlier.  There is a loophole in that section.  It is vague and weak and the percentage of the crew members should be stated more clearly.  It is also suggested in that section that the company may register here and operate from this country.  I am anxious for clarification of whether this permits any of the third countries to register a company here and allows them to fish.  If so, that section should be amended.</P>

      <P>Section (4) refers to conservation of fish stocks.  The importance of conservation cannot be overstressed. I said earlier that we were ill advised in relation to herrings.  We were given the clear and distinct impression that there were no difficulties as far as herrings were concerned but we found a few years ago that the stocks were depleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is also important that salmon stocks are conserved to ensure they are there <Col N="1832" /> for generations to come.  The only way to conserve salmon stocks is to allow fishermen to fish during the day and to prohibit them from fishing at night and weekends. They should have a five-day week and control their gear.  It is interesting to note that the Minister said that there are more effective type of nets which could be used, such as the multi-strand and the super nylon.  If the Minister is suggesting that there are more effective and better nets would it not be right and proper to consider using them?  I hope in relation to conservation, especially salmon, that the Minister will invite representatives of fishing organisations to discuss this serious problem.  I am sure the problems could be overcome by discussions, which could take place from August onwards. Fishermen are, and have every right to be, as interested in conservation as the officials and the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 5 allows the Minister to make regulations to give effect to EEC arrangements. It is a straightforward section which gives the Minister more power to enforce penalties and is to be welcomed.</P>
    <P>Section 7 worries me in so far as there are severe penalties envisaged in relation to a second offence, but only if it is the same owner.  It is highly improbable that owners of boats, having been caught once, would return without having changed the owner's name.  We should consider penalising these people on the first offence, confiscating their boat and gear and imposing a very severe fine of as high as £250,000.  A fine of £10,000 is not sufficient where there is an insurance company to pay.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify whether this section, in relation to the second offence, also refers to Irish boats.</P>
    <P>As regards the question of boats having to obtain a licence from the Minister of Fisheries and Forestry before they are registered, is it intended to make all these licences and registrations retrospective? We have heard about the historical rights of other member states in our waters.  But the fishermen also have historical rights, and if this legislation is introduced the Minister should consider having it in operation from a certain date rather than asking all boats which are already operating <Col N="1833" /> here to apply for a licence and to register.  If the Minister decides that this must be done by all boats and that it must be retrospective then the size of the boat should not be under 65 feet.  Perhaps the Minister will consider that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like the Minister to advise us as to the effectiveness of the legislation introduced in Britain at the end of March. This is a cleverly worded Bill and we welcome its repair aspects. Here the Minister is endeavouring to ensure that non-national boats do not continue to plunder our waters.  In a way this is stop-gap legilation and at some time in the future an effort should be made to codify our fishery laws.  We have had a great many Acts since 1884 and there is need for codification.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have an opportunity of speaking on this Bill.  I was delighted to hear the contributions of the Deputies from Cork, Kerry, Mayo and Donegal.  I am awaiting a contribution from Galway and I would be particularly interested in a contribution from my fellow Deputy in Clare.</P>
      <P>Basically the Bill is a good one.  It is designed to preserve our fish stock.  That is commendable and laudable.  However, the rush in which it is presented to us is neither commendable nor laudable. Because of proposed developments in the south-west Clare area by a group of businessmen based in England, with Spanish involvement, the IFO and a number of Deputies created a great deal of fuss and the result was the Department was bullied into a situation in which they were forced to present this Bill as an emergency. That is not the best way in which to present legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions of Deputy Begley, Deputy Sheehan, Deputy Denis Gallagher and Deputy Pat Gallagher were interesting.  In particular, the references to the activities of the navy and the corvettes in recent weeks were very appropriate because I think they are the foundation of the real issue involved.  The navy has been doing its legal duties.  That was something that was not done for <Col N="1834" /> quite a long time and the result is that some salmon fishermen in the Clare area are now better protected than they were in the recent past.  Would it not be better to have the corvettes out 70 and 80 miles attacking the Spanish and the Russian factory ships and let our Irish fishermen fish here and there?  The reality is they have been fishing here and there and many have been illegally fishing in grounds around Clare and many of the Clare people feel the opposition raised to the proposed development in Cappagh-Kilrush was by fishermen who were afraid their illegal fishing activities would be stopped as a result of the Spanish boats coming in and out of the Shannon estuary. That view is held strongly by people in Clare and it is one I want to put on record.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that our fish stocks are protected.  It is also essential that they be used to the maximum national advantage. If that is done employment will be created in an area in which it is badly needed through the economic development of our fisheries.  The Minister has responsibility in that area and he has a duty to ensure greater development of our national resources.  In Clare we have had very little assistance in the past and I ask the Minister to take steps to ensure some major developments in the fishing industry there.  Over the years the Clare coast has been exploited, not just by non-nationals but by Irish fishermen as well.  We must get every assistance from the Department to encourage young people anxious to make fishing a livelihood and who have neither the facilities nor the experience at the moment to follow that particular calling.  The real threat is not just the Spaniards.  The Norwegians and the Danes pose an even greater threat.</P>
    <P>Within the next two years Spain will be a member of the EEC and entitled to the same treatment as the other members.  In the proposed development in south-west Clare the Spaniards were going to deal in hake, mackerel and monk fish.  We have no quotas in that area and so the proposed development would not affect our position within the EEC.  That is something that should be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1835" /> Deputy Begley referred to Spanish boats fishing 70 or 80 miles off our coast. Would it not be a good idea to allow them in?  Surely we could gain some advantage out of their fishing outside our territorial waters.  We should be more open to joint ventures even with those outside the EEC.</P>
    <P>Section 6 provides that a fishing vessel may not be registered in the State unless a fishing licence has been granted by the Minister in respect of the vessel.  I do not know what kind of economic sense that makes.  Unless someone can be assured of obtaining a licence to fish he will naturally not purchase a vessel and so I do not understand how this section will work in practice.  This is something that should be reconsidered.  I welcome the issue of licences and the registering of vessels, because that will make for better order in the industry.  It is the manner of doing it that needs to be considered.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the strong reaction to the proposed venture on the Clare coast from the fishing industry here.  What strong reaction did he get from Clare?  He also said claims had been made that landings by such vessels would make a significant contribution to the economy in general and to the local economy in the vicinity of the ports concerned in particular.  The experience of the ports in Britain over the past few years does not bear out such claims.  That may very well be but that, combined with the experience in Castletownbere, may make the Department very wary of proposals like this.  The reality is that you cannot tar all the people with the same brush.  There are many Irish people whose activities in other countries we may not be very proud of, whether it is business or otherwise, but one cannot assume that the entire people of any nation are automatically of the same standing as one particular group, especially if one has had a bad experience. We should be more open-minded on the issue and should be prepared to consider in a far more open-minded fashion proposals put before us, as a potential for economic development or anything else.</P>
    <P>The Minister has responsibility to <Col N="1836" /> ensure that our fishing industry is developed to its full potential.  As was stated earlier today, the land and the sea of this country are our greatest natural assets. The sea has not been developed at all. There has not been any specific fishing development policy.  The Minister could set up a development task force in his Department to train young people and provide more facilities particularly in the counties where there has not been any great fishing development over the years. There are about five major ports in the country and the amount of fishing activity outside that is very limited.  It is unfortunate that people in those particular counties have had their fishing stocks exploited by people of other counties and have not had the opportunity of availing of those fishing stocks themselves.  If this Bill in some way impedes the development in Kilrush I ask the Minister to make immediate overtures to BIM and the officials of his Department to ensure that some major fishing development takes place in the very near future in the Clare region.  It is absolutely essential that this takes place.  If this Bill is to curb the potential for creating jobs in the region the onus is on the Minister to compensate that region by starting a movement to see that jobs are created for the same natural resource.  I will not delay the House any further because I know there are a number of speakers who wish to contribute.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill particularly because it will tighten up the operations of the Spanish fishing vessels especially off the south west coast with which I am familiar.  I hope, as I said some time ago in the Dáil, that it will not seriously affect the fish processing activity down there, the Eirenova plant, because it employs 28 people.  The Minister should do everything possible to develop the fishing industry.  I hope, for the first time in the history of the State, that the Minister will say that this is a natural resource industry that can be developed.  There are approximately 10,000 people employed in fishing and there are only about 100 people employed in processing that fish.  That is <Col N="1837" /> a very bad ratio.  I believe that, with some effort by the Minister and by the people involved, that figure of 100 people employed in the processing of a food product in which 10,000 people are involved in the fishing operation, could at least be four to one, which would mean jobs for 40,000 people.  That would be a bonus to the whole economy with the difficult job situation we have at the moment.</P>
      <P>I am very concerned about the lack of research and development in the industry. Any industry, particularly a food industry, will not go anywhere without research and development.  There is only one fishing research vessel, the Loch Beltra. After some considerable hesitation £60,000 was spent on it a few months ago. It was about to be laid up a few weeks ago when another £10,000 was given by the National Board of Science and Technology to keep it going for about four weeks.  When we have a native industry employing 10,000 people and we cannot afford even one research vessel, there is something very wrong with the situation. I am glad the Minister for Finance is in the House at the moment.  I hope he will try to get some money under some subhead to keep that fishery research vessel in operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not had a hydrographic survey since 1850.  The old British admiralty charts are out of date.  It is about time the hydrographic charts around our coasts were updated.  Would the Minister please have a look at that particular matter?  I asked him during the debate on the Estimate to have a look at the establishment of a fishery research field station at Kinsale, County Cork.  I have been asking different Ministers since 1977 if they would look seriously at this matter and on each occasion I was told that there is a difficulty with the landowner.  As late as today I got a reply from the Minister stating that there is still a difficulty with the landowner, who is not co-operating. Would the Minister please ask the Land Commission to acquire that little parcel of land in Kinsale for the establishment of a fishery research field station which after the visit of the late President Kennedy to this country 20 years ago, was <Col N="1838" /> recognised as probably one of the most outstanding locations for a fishery research field station in the whole of Europe.  Would the Minister please consult the Land Commission again and ask them to do something about acquiring this land so that this field station can be got off the ground.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned about the importation of fish products.  One has only to go into any chipper in any city or town in the country and one will find imported fish used.  That should not be the case.  I believe about £26 million of such fish products were imported in the last 12 months.  Something radical should be done about that matter.  The officials of the Department of Fisheries should make some contact with the people in Erin Foods who have capitulated regarding the importation of vegetables and other processed food products and ask them to use their technology and some of their unused factories and equipment to process fish products.  There is no great difference between the protein in fish and the protein in other foods.  Surely it is not beyond the ingenuity of the food processers in Erin Foods and in the food industry generally to take a hold of the fish processing sector of the industy and do something radical about it.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters I would like to ask the Minister to do something about.  The first is the old problem of Schull pier.  I am a bit bored at this stage with raising this matter with various Ministers. Prior to my interest in this, the former Deputy Michael Pat Murphy spent 30 years&mdash;28 of them in this House &mdash; raising this matter.  The last I heard about it was that a number of individuals were under water down there surveying the base of the pier.  That is a dangerous occupation and I would ask the Minister to tell those gentlemen to get out and get a bit of work done on the pier.  I regret the cutback in the money for harbour development.  Perhaps before the Minister's term of office ends the project at Schull pier will be started and completed.</P>
    <P>There is a valuable boat building industry in Baltimore, West Cork, where about 80 people are employed full time. The boat building industry is going <Col N="1839" /> through difficult times and I would urge the Minister to see that BIM process the grant applications and make the term payments expeditiously so as to preserve this traditional industry.</P>

      <P>In supporting this Bill I compliment the Minister and the Naval Service for doing a fantastic job in fishery protection.  The success of the action in fish conservation was reflected in the increased numbers of salmon which got up to the spawning beds in the Maigue and the Shannon.  Inshore fishermen in this area have been involved in the salmon industry going back for 800 years. The first charter in my city in 1197 makes reference to the fishing stocks in Limerick city.  Limerick city has been involved in salmon fishing and has been renowned for it throughout the world.  If we are serious about our fishing policy we should not allow the depredation that has been wrought over the last 12 years by home grown pirates.  I sincerely compliment the Minister and the Naval Service for dealing for the first time in years with this blackguardism by our own people.</P>

      <P>Because of the activities of the Naval Service these pirates are now behaving themselves.  My information is that the naval authorities were engaged in a celebration last weekend and while they were thus engaged the pirates were back again at the mouth of the Shannon, as a result of which nothing got up to the inshore fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihood the same as people along the coast.  These inshore fishermen have been involved in fishing for centuries.  That fact is well documented.  There were the battles with the ESB in 1936 of the Abbey fishermen of the Guild of Saint Francis and Peadar O'Donnell.  This is one of the oldest guilds in the country.  The law requires that inshore fishermen be off the river from 6.00 hours on Saturday morning until 6.00 hours on Monday morning. The purpose of that is to allow the fish to the spawning beds.  Through greed we are killing the goose that lays the golden egg.  A famous English economist, killed a couple of years ago, talking about resources said that the fossil recources like coal and fuel would be used up even if we discover oil off our coasts.  That is the law of diminishing returns.  This economist also referred to resources which reproduce themselves such as forests, fisheries, agricultural crops and so on.  We are destroying indigenous resources. Some species of fish are already gone because of short-sighted greed.  I compliment the Minister on the courageous steps he has taken.  I gather that over 20 miles of monofilament net was confiscated from salmon poachers.  Was there a commensurate return of income tax in relation to the fish plundered?  I believe people are now using a type of monofilament net which can change with the colour of the water and this is causing untold damage.  The people who are fishing for these fish inside the forbidden times are traitors to their own.  They are selling the fish to the foreign factory trawlers off our coast.  These people behave themselves when the navy are around and I call on the navy for increased vigilance in that respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all pay lip service to the task of finding employment for our young <Col N="1841" /> people.  We are either crazy or hypocrites. We have at our disposal a great natural resource, a self-perpetuating resources, God-given riches.  We could capitalise on that and turn it into valuable labour intensive employment for our young people along the western sea-board, an area most deficient in terms of turning the rural imbalance of our population. Bord lascaigh Mhara are not doing the job they are supposed to do. We are not using our full potential in research development and marketing. There is a big shortfall there.  We are not even filling the markets we can fill and we talk about research and development.</P>
    <P>These resources are on our doorstep and we are not exploiting them.  I give an example.  The Alcan construction operation has ceased but when I was in that vicininty a couple of months ago on another project the management brought me out to show me a new development. They had built an 800 metre jetty out into the Shannon Estuary and the pylons on which the jetty is raised had already become a breeding ground for mussels or cockles &mdash; I forget which species &mdash; as a result of which four of the people who were made redundant used their redundancy payments to form a company. Alcan were very genorous in helping them on this and now they have gone into the export market.  This is on the mud flats in the Shannon Estuary.</P>
    <P>This human interest story shows what can be done in the area of research in mariculture.  All our Governments have been criminal in their neglect of that area as a means of creating employment, and the best of all types of employment. Telesis in their report criticised our industrial policy.  We were giving too much money to foreign countries and not getting sufficient feedback in terms of research and development here.  We can do it for our own people and keep the money in Irish hands.  We saw what happened a few years ago when a small fishing co-operative in Rossaveal broke into the Danish supermarket chain and got valuable fishing contracts there.  The Government and the Minister involved in this area should examine the matter <Col N="1842" /> seriously with a view to creating valuable employment.  The Third World are screaming for protein from fish offal as a corrective to the vitamin deficiencies which are the basis of many diseases.  We can produce that here for nothing and thereby create valuable jobs and earn money for our economy.  It has not even been looked at.  We should be taken out and shot.  Any other nation having the resources that we have would exploit them.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I ask the Minister to consider seriously extending the fishing season for inshore fishermen.  At present it lasts from June to July and it is often extended from the salmon season.  Fishermen in the Shannon Estuary and around and beyond Limerick agreed to forego their entitlement at the start of the season in February and did not fish then and in return the Minister extended the season.  The same thing happened this year.  I ask that the Minister agree to extend the fishing season to give them some chance.  I have read in the papers &mdash; I do not know whether it is true &mdash; that some boats off the north-west coast have been catching fish to the value of £80,000 a week.  The whole colony of fishermen that I represent along the Shannon river would not catch such an amount between them in the whole season.</P>

      <P>The Minister, according to his statement, introduced this Bill for the purpose of ensuring that the owners of Spanish fishing vessels would not be able to register their vessels here and thereby exploit further the resources which they have been exploiting in our waters for a considerable time.  If the <Col N="1843" /> owners of those fishing vesels came into this debate today and listened to what has been said by speakers on both sides of the House up to the moment, they would be very reassured.  The actions that the Minister is proposing to take with the full support of the House are obviously necessary, but they would equally confirm the view that those ship owners have already: that the best way to protect our resources against them is to develop our capacity to exploit what we have.  It has been acknowledged on both sides of the House that it is perhaps, as Deputy Prendergast said, a national scandal that we have not up to this realised the potential that is there to be realised.</P>
      <P>I want to extract some very telling figures from the Estimates for public expenditure through the years to show exactly where the fishing industry and what it represents to this economy stand in terms of potential for this country.  I do not come in on this debate to offer anything of significance in the fishery area, but I endorse what our spokesman, Deputy Daly, said on the absolute need to have a clearly defined national policy, to identify the immediate opportunities and obligations as well as marketing research and development.  I have heard those views re-echoed generally since I came into the House this afternoon, in particular having regard to the need throughout the world for the protein which fish provide.  We might as well face the fact that some countries suggest that dairy products are not in the best interests of human health for one reason or another.  They might even suggest the same about beef products because of their fat content.  I do not accept those arguments, but everyone accepts that fish is the great protein food and its health value is enormous particularly in relation to developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1979, four years ago, the total Estimate for public expenditure was £2.4 billion and the amount for the Fisheries Vote then was £16 million.  Now the total Estimate for public expenditure is a great source of concern for economists and Ministers for Finance and also spokesmen on Finance.  The Minister for <Col N="1844" /> Finance visited the House for a few moments.  I do not criticise him for not sitting in, but I regret that he is not here for this point.  However, I am sure his colleague will bring it back to him.  The total Estimate has grown from £2.4 billion to what is a matter of concern for all of us, £5.6 billion, a growth of almost 140 per cent over what it was.  In 1983 the Estimate for fishery development is £18.75 million, approximately £2.75 million more than it was four years ago. When the growth in public expenditure has become a matter of great concern, from £2.4 billion to £5.6 billion, the best we can achieve by way of development of our resources in this major area of potential is an increase of £2.5 million or £2.7 million.  In fact, it is worse, because the Estimate for public expenditure for 1983 is almost £1 million less than it was last year, 1982.</P>
    <P>I share the views of all who have spoken so far who know far more than I do about the fishing industry and the impact it has on coastal areas in their constituencies. Coming as I do from a place that would not normally be associated with fishing, this should be of as much relevance for you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and me and someone who represents Athlone in the centre of Ireland as for those from the coastal areas.  The Spaniards, Norwegians and Danes must be laughing at us.  Of course we need to protect ourselves further against them because they can travel thousands of miles to exploit our resources.  The best we can do is make a genuine but not very effective attempt to protect stocks.</P>
    <P>Let us compare the Fisheries Votes for this year and last year.  Deputy Joe Walsh and others have spoken about research and development.  There seems to be a question about whether we can give another £10,000 or £12,000 to keep the research vessel going.  It must figure somewhere as an element in the Estimates. Sea fisheries development is down 13 per cent on last year and the provision for fishery harbour works is down by 14 per cent.  The grant for BIM is reduced by 13 per cent.  There is a story to tell to the Spaniards, Norwegians and Danes <Col N="1845" /> and anybody else who wishes to help themselves to our resources.</P>
    <P>There are areas of growth in the Vote this year.  The provision for Post Office services is up by 96 per cent and salaries are up by 13 per cent.  These figures show how serious we are about trying to develop this extraordinary natural resource which could be exploited not just in the interests of the coastal areas but in the interests of the country in general.</P>
    <P>We are so deficient in this area that we have no idea how to process for the market and we do not begin to look at market strategy.  We are always concerned about preventing the marauding Danes from sweeping the seas.  Their coastline would hardly compare with the coast of Clare but they have a huge processing industry.</P>
    <P>The consensus today is that we must recognise where we have failed and make every effort to ensure our success.  We must begin to look at the huge potential in forestry, fisheries and real agricultural development.  The resources are enormous. It is not enough simply to give the figures and talk about the huge potential contribution these areas can make to our economy; we must motivate by example.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not made any party political points in this connection.  Our party have proposed a committee on maritime resources.  Of the range of committees that have been proposed by all sides I would regard this as being of vital importance because it is an area where we can reach a consensus.  There must be very little between us.  I respect the efforts made by Ministers responsible for fisheries, sometimes without the support of Ministers for Finance.  Fisheries could make a fantastic contribution to our balance of payments but the figures I have given show the failure so far as well as potential.</P>
    <P>Fisheries represent 0.3 per cent of total public expenditure.  Let us put that beside the amount we are providing for agencies of the Department of Labour, something in the region of £130 million.  Next year that figure will be closer to £200 million. These agencies are doing a reasonably good job, but our priorities are on their heads if we continue to set up agencies of <Col N="1846" /> that kind while we neglect the various aspects of the fisheries industry.  If we take the correct action now it is possible that in ten years time the Spaniards will be introducing legislation to protect themselves against what they see as the marauding Irishmen.  We too have a tradition in fishing but anyone looking at the Estimates for this year would never guess it.</P>
    <P>The Minister will have our full support in any plans to develop fisheries.  The challenge is there and if the Government are serious about employment opportunities this is an opportunity to prove it.  I wait to see what they will do in terms of the Fisheries Vote.  Let us hope there will not be a reduction, as was the case last year.  Let us hope it will be a measure of our commitment to an industry that will help to bring improvements not just around the coastal regions but throughout the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FintanACoogan" hpid="Mr. Coogan Mr. Coogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief for two reasons &mdash; first of all, some of my colleagues want to contribute, and, second, many of the points I wish to raise have been made by my more senior colleagues and Members of the Opposition.  I should like to take a different tack, to use a nautical term, from my colleague and constituency neighbour Deputy Taylor-Quinn, the reason being that I was one of the people she mentioned who discussed with the IFO the establishment of a Spanish industry in Clare.  I admit I was against it.  However, I understood my colleague's chagrin because it is based on the same feelings all of us on the west coast have been expressing, the great degree of unemployment there and the other needs of the west.  She saw this industry as an answer to her needs and I firmly did not, simply because I thought it was further exploitation of a resource which we should be exploiting, a resource which has been underutilised, undercapitalised and very inadequately marketed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Each of us here, the Government and every member of the Government, must stand indicted in that respect.  There must be more investment in the fishing industry. Deputy Prendergast pointed out, when talking about fossils and the discovery <Col N="1847" /> of oil, that at some stage that would run out but that our fishing resources, if properly maintained, would not.  I agree wholeheartedly with him, and with many of the other points he raised.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn for a moment to an aspect of the industry in which I have a particular interest, inshore fishing.  I note that the aquaculture industry is worth between 10 and 12 per cent of the fish sales value of the total industry.  Here again there is underutilisation, under exploitation and undercapitalisation. There should be investment in research and development because these are indigeneous industries in the west and are useful to the people there.</P>
    <P>While I was pointing out that the fishing industry is undercapitalised I noticed a piece in <i>The Irish Times</i> which might be the light at the end of the tunnel.  It states that the European Commission have announced grants totalling £5.5 million for agriculture and fish processing projects in Ireland.  There is to be £127,000 for the fishing sector, for modernisation and the provision of fish processing facilities at Midleton in Cork and Finglas in Dublin, and a special grant for the west of Ireland of nearly £1 million for the modernisation of fish processing facilities at Killybegs and Ballina.  I hope this it only the beginning of it.  The only thing I am sorry about is that Galway was not mentioned.  Perhaps the next time it will be, and I intend to put pressure on to see that it will be.</P>
    <P>I agree with many of the things Deputies have said but I should like clarification from the Minister regarding the penalties. Deputy Gallagher spoke about the penalties that should be imposed for second offences.  I agree with him, but I suggest they should be imposed not only on foreign vessels but on our own vessels. We cannot have this type of pirating, this abuse of the law.  It is understandable that people are emotive about the issue, but the law should not be broken and the law should be firm.</P>
    <P>Deputy Taylor-Quinn asked the Minister about Spanish EEC accession and what would happen then.  It may not be next year because of Spain's economic <Col N="1848" /> circumstances, it may be the year after or even a year later, but when Spain accedes we must examine completely the Common Fisheries Policy and we must take a hard line regarding our quotas and our barriers.</P>

We do not intend to put in any more Deputies but if three or four from the opposite side are to speak, then we will put in more Deputies from this side.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time that this Government, more than any government, would give a lead and introduce a national campaign for Ireland.  This is a small island and we must ask ourselves where we have arrived after 60 years of independence. What opportunities and hopes are we offering to our people, particularly our youth, to fulfil their aspirations?  The Minister is from my county and he should play his part to the fullest extent in a national campaign.  We must stand on our own feet and head and shoulders above any effort to drag us down.  In the past we have had Ministers in charge of this Department from various parts of the country &mdash; Deputies Daly, Power, Lenihan, Donegan, and the Ceann Comhairle &mdash; and each of them in his own right wished to make a lasting name for himself.  The present Minister, coming from a maritime county, born and reared in an area where fishing is indigenous, has the opportunity to go out and strike a blow for Ireland in terms of employment, production and conservation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the terms of various EEC <Col N="1849" /> schemes, money is thrown away left, right and centre, for pilot schemes for research into all kinds of developments. There is no reason why we should not be able to get money from some fund in Brussels or Strasbourg to ensure that research will be carried on here.</P>
    <P>On one of the few occasions I went to Brussels on a deputation led by a former Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Clinton, a row broke out about various issues, and Deputy Bermingham, then a Labour backbencher, made the point that EEC legislation was of such a nature that people from many countries could come here to plunder our stocks, whether land, natural resources, or fish, and that we were getting very little in return.  It is time we decided to strike a blow for our country.</P>
    <P>The Minister has an ideal opportunity to do this.  The legislation before us, one of whose purposes is to keep out the Spanish, is contradictory of the Minister's actions, because last week he attended an official opening of a plant in County Mayo which is sponsored by Spaniards and which gives employment to 52 people.  Respect is hard earned, and I know the Minister will do his job properly.</P>
    <P>One of the points I should like to make is that recently the Minister and I were in the Achill area and we saw on the pier between 300 and 400 boxes of fish which had been sprayed and were about to be dumped back into the ocean.  In our part of the country we have heard that the Kerry people have brought the same fish in a few times.  I cannot substantiate that allegation but it appears ridiculous that we have to send our fishermen out to catch such fish and when they are caught they must be inspected by a Department of Fisheries official, sprayed and dumped back into the ocean.  Surely at a time of vitamin deficiency and poverty in many countries something could be done about such fish even though the intervention process works or does not work, as the case may be.</P>
    <P>In regard to legalising of monofilament and the extension of the season, one of the first things the Minister should do is <Col N="1850" /> to have discussions with the fishermen. They are not all pirates as was stated. They are not piranha who prey on our stock.  Most of them are decent people who adhere to the law and are not afraid to be stopped and searched by any naval vessel.  They work in the interest of conservation and abiding by the law.  If the Minister has not had discussions with the fishermen he should do so now.</P>
    <P>With regard to Spanish entry into the EEC I am sure international agreements will apply in that case.  If and when Spain becomes a full member I am sure the Department will have adopted a new high profile in terms of our assets.  Deputy Walsh referred to the necessity to carry out a hydrographic survey and it is appropriate that that should be done.  If Myles na gCopaleen was alive today he would probably write a story to prove that the salmon were being discriminated against because the water was deeper or shallower when their predecessors came to spawn 100 years ago.  If he wrote an article on those lines the fishermen could then make a case that they wanted to keep them out.</P>
    <P>There must be an EEC fund available for research work.  I have seen developments on the west coast such as oyster growing, markets for winkles, mussels and cockles and I am convinced that there is a potential for such fish.  We have the basic raw material and it is necessary only to market it.  If that is done we will be giving our people a decent living.  I should like to refer to the slaughter of seals on the west coast.  Between now and the next seal season the Minister should have the situation monitored and consider the possibility of further licences for culling being issued so that we do not have the carry on and emotional hysteria that was raised in many quarters last year.  I have seen half eaten salmon in many nets and those fish were eaten by seals.  There is no doubt that seals have increased in numbers.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer the Minister to the fact that extensions are needed to many piers on the west coast.  Ballyglass is a fine example of what can be done. Other developments have to take place at Derby's Point in Achill, Carratigue <Col N="1851" /> and Porturlin.  The Department's purchase of the State fisheries at Errif and Galway has provided a new source of income for many people in terms of river fishing.  The vigilance of the people on the outside has allowed more salmon to get up the rivers.  The research centre at Furnace outside Newport has done marvellous work in recent years.  It is now a State owned centre.  It is important that we educate our people in terms of the potential that exists through research for fishing development.  That should be promoted by the Department and I hope the Minister instructs his officials to do this.</P>
    <P>The Minister should strike a blow for his Department and the country by introducing effective legislation to keep the marauders out and promote the conservation of our fish stocks and the marketing of a valuable raw material.  Such development would lead to an increased number of jobs on the ratio of land to sea as we should be doing.  There is no reason why we should fall behind in this area.</P>

      <P>Ar dtús ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Kenny as cúpla nóiméad den a chuid ama a thabhairt dom.  An dara rud ar mhaith liom a dhéanamh ná fáilte a chur roimh an mBille seo mar sílim gur iarracht ionraic atá ann ar chosaint a dhéanamh ar ceann de na hachmhainní nádúrtha is fearr dá bhfuil againn.  Sílim gur maith an rud gur thuig gach cainteoir dá labhair anseo inniu gur ceann de na achmhainní nádúrtha is fearr atá againn, iascaireacht. Ag dul trín Bhille seo sílim go n-éireoidh leis an Bhille é sin a dhéanamh san am i láthair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom cur leis an rud a dúirt na cainteoirí eile agus is é sin, cad a tharlóidh nuair a bheas an Spáinn mar bhall de Chomhphobal Eacnamaíochta na hEorpa?  An gcaithfear deireadh a chur leis an Bhille seo?  Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire nuair a bheas comhráití ar siúl idir an Chomhphobal agus an Spáinn go ndéantar iarracht speisialta an achmainn nádúrtha seo a chosaint, fiú amháin má éiríonn leis an Spáinn a bheith mar bhall den Chomhphobal Eacnamaíochta.  Mar a dúirt mé, <Col N="1852" /> is é an iascaireacht an achmhainn nádúrtha is fearr atá againn agus tá súil agam, fad is a bheas an tAire i mbun dualgais, go dtabharfaidh sé tús áite do thionscal na hiascaireachta a fhorbairt agus go mor mhór an tionscal próiseála. Sílim gur féidir cuid mhór a dhéanamh in iarthar na hÉireann fá choinne fostaíocht a chur ar fáil do na daoine atá dífhostaithe sa cheantar sin má chuirtear ionad próiseála ar fáil.  Tá a fhios againn go léir go bhfuil níos lú daoine i mbun na hoibre sin na sa tír seo ná mar atá in aon tír eile i gComhphobal Eacnamaíochta na hEorpa.  Tá a fhios agam ó na cainteanna a bhí agam leis an Aire gur dócha go ndéanfaidh sé é sin.  Bhí mé ag éisteacht leis an Teachta Prendergast agus na focail a bhí le rá aige mar gheall ar chablach na tíre.</P>
    <P>I agree with him that we all have great respect for the Naval Service as we have for the Army.  It was most unfortunate that the incident occurred off the Donegal coast two weeks ago but the case of the fishermen should be understood and articulated.  Their methods of fishing have been operated for some years and I am afraid they were allowed to carry on over the years.  The gear being used by the vast majority of fishemen along the coast is imported freely.  The Government get their cut from that importation and so also do the wholesalers and retailers but when the fishermen use them they get into trouble.  When the fishing season is over the Minister should sit down with officials of his Department, representatives of the central fisheries board, the regional boards and the fishermen to discuss this matter.  They should try to reach an arrangement so that we do not have a repetition of the unfortunate incident that occurred during the salmon season.</P>
    <P>The Bill represents an attempt to close a loophole and put a stop to back door operators availing of one of our most important natural resources.  It is a good measure and I hope that when Spain is admitted as a full member of the EEC the provisions of the Bill will continue to be enforced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Calleary <Col N="1853" /> wishes to speak, I am prepared to give him a few minutes to speak before me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>When we talk about Dáil reform we should at least come up with a system that will allow people who have been here all day to get in to speak in their turn.  However, I will raise that matter in a more appropriate place.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but, unlike Deputy Taylor, I think it should have been introduced a long time ago.  She said the Bill was introduced because of some activities in Clare but that is not so.  It was introduced because the British saw fit to bring in legislation.  We asked the Government to bring in legislation more quickly than they did.  The Department and the Minister used the occasion to update some necessary provisions but I think it would have been preferable to introduce an enabling Bill and then to have a comprehensive Bill covering all aspects of fisheries and our fisheries policy.</P>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Taylor wanted the Minister to do.  She could come to Killala and see what the community have done in the past few years. In the Killala Bay area fishing has been developed to the extent that it is now one of the five largest ports in terms of landings. The people in Killala have a special interest in this Bill.  In the past few months hake has become an important ingredient in the catches landed in the area.  I welcome the Bill, which has the full support of Deputies on this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been much talk about fishing along the coast.  My one comment on the matter is that monofilament netting should be banned.  Shopkeepers should not be allowed to stock or to sell it.  The blame should not be put on the poor fishermen.  I realise there is a certain difficulty because this kind of net is used extensively in gardening.  We must not forget that the Government are collecting their pound of flesh by way of VAT and I have not heard that the Minister for Finance has refused to accept VAT from the sale of this type of net.  Unless it is banned we have no right to blame fishermen for using what they consider to be a good net.  As the Minister knows, in <Col N="1854" /> certain conditions in Killala Bay that type of net is not worth a damn although it may be satisfactory on the high seas.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look slightly north-west to Killala and the Killala Bay area.  Tremendous development is taking place and it is an example of what can be done in a few years virtually from scratch. The community there have been willing to learn.  For years that area was used by other fishermen who then returned to their various home ports.  However, as a result of the development in the area the fishermen are working and landing their catches in Killala and it is now among the five largest ports in the country.</P>
    <P>Deputy Prendergast spoke about inshore fishermen.  I have some sympathy for him.  He referred to a type of fishing which is carried on in my constituency, particularly in the mouth of the Parmestown river.  There the season runs for three or four weeks.  I ask the Minister to consider extending the fishing for the five or six fishermen who traditionally have fished in this area.  The season should be extended by a few weeks to give them some benefits.</P>
    <P>I have some worries regarding licensing. I can visualise a situation where a boat and crew is ready but the problem is to get registered.  That owner cannot get registered because he cannot get a licence.  Will the Minister let us know how many boats he considers will be licensed?  Will he give us an idea of the size of the boats?  Does he consider that the traditional type boats used by the majority of fishermen along the Mayo coast will have to be licensed?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>I will conclude now.  As I said earlier, I will raise in another place the matter of why I was not able to speak at an earlier stage in the debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies &mdash; Deputy Calleary was the 13th speaker &mdash; who spoke in the four-and-a-half hours debate.  The flexibility which the Chair brought to the debate <Col N="1855" /> ensured a wide-ranging debate and matters were mentioned that had nothing to do with the Bill.  I am glad I had the opportunity of hearing the speakers. Many of them did not have an opportunity to contribute in the debate on the Estimate but they spoke today.</P>
      <P>I realise there is a problem of time but I should like to allay any fears in relation to the Bill and what it intends to do.  It is an enabling Bill giving authority to the Minister to introduce measures to control fishing in our waters.  I think it would be helpful if I outlined briefly what is intended to follow the passage of this enabling Bill.</P>
      <P>The main reason for introducing the Bill at this time was in relation to ex-Spanish fishing boats.  A Bill was introduced in the UK which sought to curb the activities of ex-Spanish boats flying the British flag and they high-tailed it into our waters.  Deputies expressed some concern and disappointment that the Bill did not specify exactly what we intended to do.  When the British legislation was introduced it did not specify the percentage of crew membership and so on which we now know to be the case.  That was done subsequently by regulation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Irish registered sea fishing vessels will require a licence to fish under section 2 of the Bill.  In order to be eligible for a licence, a vessel will have to be owned by an Irish citizen or an Irish corporate body and I will be authorised to attach wide ranging conditions to the licences, including one in regard to the nationality of crews.  These measures will apply to existing vessels registered in Ireland, including nine ex-Spanish boats owned by Irish companies.  This will come into operation immediately.  It is not my intention to include immediately conditions as to nationality in the licences to be issued in respect of existing Irish registered boats. I have no doubt that Deputies will agree that some breathing space ought to be given to enable the owners of these vessels to take steps to deal with the new situation.  I think 12 months would be a reasonable period within which this category of boats would have the provisions of the regulation applied to them.  That <Col N="1856" /> is something that could be looked at but that is the phasing-out time I have in mind.</P>
    <P>The second measure included in the Bill is in section 3 in which I shall be empowered to make regulations concerning fishing.  The landing and trans-shipment of fish by all vessels in Irish waters will be catered for and it is my intention to introduce regulations without delay providing that any vessel registered in the UK, whose crew is comprised of less than 75 per cent of EEC nationals, may not fish within our exclusive fishery limits or land or trans-ship fish which they have caught.  Work is already in progress in framing the regulations and I hope they will be fully processed and in operation within two weeks.  This will effectively exclude legally the 60 or so ex-Spanish vessels now registered in Britain for the purpose of circumventing existing EEC rules.  These regulations can, if necessary, be extended to other EEC registered vessels. The same type of approach applied in the case of the British Bill except that, as Deputies know, our Bill will, I hope, be passed by the Seanad next week.  After the President has signed the Bill, the regulations can be introduced.</P>
    <P>All Irish owned fishing boats are required to be registered and there is also provision for the registration of vessels from reciprocating states.  In order to make it more difficult for foreign fishing vessels to re-register in Ireland &mdash; and there is a strong possibility that attempts will be made to do this by Spanish interests now that the advantage gained by registering in Britain has been removed &mdash; a fishing vessel will, in future, require a licence from me as Minister for Fisheries and Forestry before it can be entered in the fishing boat register.  This measure comes into effect with the passing of this Bill and I assure Deputies that vessels which, in my view, are not bona fide fishing vessels will not be granted licences and will be excluded from registration. To complement this measure there are also provisions for the cancellation of registration in the event of licence regulations being broken and for the exclusion of fishing vessels from the reciprocal arrangements currently being <Col N="1857" /> operated with a number of countries, including Britain.  This latter provision will require a Government order which I expect to be introduced without delay. It is evident, therefore, that when the Bill becomes law the other measures which I have outlined will be brought in as quickly as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">

    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Mr. O'Toole Mr. O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy knows, there is a provision for the registration and licensing of boats over 75 feet.  I see this provision broadening that to reduce the size of boat.  It is a matter for discretion and a sensible approach.  I do not think that very small boats and currachs will need licences.  Different categories of boats will also be exempted.  Somebody mentioned boats for angling competitions. It is a question of tightening up the whole area in order to ensure that any loophole which might arise could be closed.</P>
      <P>Members expressed disappointment at not having specific issues dealt with in the Bill.  It is preferable to have regulations brought in afterwards because if you put something in a Bill it will take a further amending Bill in this House to close a loophole if it arises.  You can close a loophole overnight by regulation.  This Bill is a framework on which we can hang regulations governing the whole area. Members asked if this was a temporary measure: it will be a permanent part of our legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not time to go through all the points raised by the 13 members in this debate.  In relation to conservation of salmon, there is an underlying ambivalence &mdash; I am not pointing the finger at anyone in this regard &mdash; that we should, in some for or other, be prepared to close our eyes to breaches of current regulations in that regard.  I would hate to think that is the case.  I hope it is not because we have a solemn obligation, as Members of this House, to uphold the regulation and the laws which we enact in this House.  I will not condone, in any circumstances, breaches of the law in regard to salmon fishing and I hope that no Member <Col N="1858" /> of the House will seek that kind of concession.  It would be wrong to do so. The Naval Service are doing their job as they see fit.  It is a very difficult job in emotive circumstances and I compliment them on what they are doing.  I regret the circumstances which allow and promote the kind of environment where these incidents occur.  Nobody, least of all the navy, wish to be involved but I will stand behind them in upholding the law.</P>
    <P>Deputy Pat Cope Gallagher asked me if I would meet the fishermen.  I have never yet refused to meet any group of fishermen.  Of course I will meet them.  I will listen to their proposals for changes. The last three weeks have not been happy weeks for me and I am hoping that, with the co-operation of Deputies, the next three weeks will be happier.  The season will then be over and we can sit down and talk together rationally and sensibly to find out how we can best avoid a recurrence of what happened.  The Department, the Naval Service and all concerned would like to see the situation resolved.</P>
    <P>I have not time to reply to all the constructive suggestions and non-political contributions.  In the not too distant future I hope we will have a chance to discuss this matter much more fully and to debate the major issues involved.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to raise from £100 million to £180 million the limitation on the borrowing powers of Bord na Móna for the performance of its functions under the Turf Development Acts.</P>
      <P>The opportunity is also being taken to formalise the control of expenditure by Bord na Móna and to up-date certain aspects of the Turf Development Acts to bring them into line with more modern legislation of a similar type.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna is currently in the process of implementing its third development programme.  This is a major development programme which was formulated in response to the 1973 fuel crisis.  Deputies will remember that this was a time when the high cost of imported energy caused a rise in domestic prices and in the balance of payments deficit. The programme which commenced in 1974 was aimed at expanding peat production for electricity generation and for industrial and domestic use.  This programme was subsequently extended and now covers 78,000 acres, most of which is under development.</P>
      <P>The main development area is located west of the Shannon but operations involved in the programme extend over Counties Tipperary, Laois, Offaly, Kildare, Meath, Westmeath, Galway, Roscommon, Longford and Mayo.</P>
      <P>The programme when fully implemented is expected to produce annually 2.2 million tonnes of milled peat, 80,000 tonnes of sod peat and 1.6 million cubic metres of moss peat in addition to existing production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1860" /> Some of the additional milled peat production was intended by Bord na Móna to be used in two new briquette factories. One of the factories at Littleton, County Tipperary, came into production in September 1981 and is designed to produce 130,000 tonnes of briquettes annually. The second factory was proposed for Ballyforan, County Roscommon, and some site work has already been carried out there.  I should add, however, that because of the high level of borrowings and the need for effective use of capital to ensure a better return to the community, the Minister has initiated a review of all capital investment projects within his area of responsibility, including the Ballyforan briquette factory, to determine whether the projects can be justified on acceptable norms.  The review of the Ballyforan project which was indeed projected in the revised Public Capital Programme for 1983 published by the Government is now at an advanced stage and the Minister hopes to be in a position to put the outcome of the review to the Government within the next few weeks.</P>
    <P>The balance of the production of milled peat under the third development programme will be used to increase the output and to extend the life of the existing electricity generating station at Bellacorick. A 45 megawatt extension to the ESB milled peat station at Shannonbridge, County Offaly, was recently commissioned and a similar extension at Lanesboro, County Longford, will be commissioned next year.  Additional sod peat under the programme will be used to offset to some extent the reduction in output from existing sod peat bogs as they become cut out.  The programme also provides for a major increase in horticultural peat production.  Export sales of horticultural peat of the order of £12 million made a useful contribution to the revenue of Bord na Móna and to our balance of payments last year.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna is a major industry employing 6,234 on average throughout the year.  It is particularly valuable in providing employment in many areas which do not have strong potential for attracting other types of industry.  Apart from providing employment directly, the <Col N="1861" /> programme also generates spin-off employment in engineering construction and allied industries.  The consequent effect of this on the economy in the catchment areas of all the board's enterprises has been substantial.</P>
    <P>Bog development requires considerable expenditure during the development period during which there is no financial return.  The necessarily slow process of land acquisition, drainage and other development work means that new bogs do not contribute anything towards the servicing of advances and loans during the development stages.  Investment must, therefore, take account that up to seven years will elapse from the initiation of a scheme before a bog will be capable of producing peat and yielding revenue. Capital servicing at high interest rates impacts heavily on the board's revenue throughout this period.</P>
    <P>Low prices in the past resulted in the board's not being able to make any significant contribution from its own resources and the servicing of its borrowing places a heavy burden on the board's financial position.  In order to alleviate this problem, a four-phased price increase was approved last year which, when fully implemented, will bring prices for the board's products up to marketrelated level and should ease considerably the strain on the board's cash flow.</P>
    <P>In the early years of the third programme the Exchequer funded by way of repayable advances the bulk of Bord na Móna's capital requirements.  Since 1978, however, the board has had to meet expenditure on its development programme and related capital charges mainly by borrowing.</P>
    <P>The necessity for this Bill arises because the board has almost reached the limit of its statutory borrowing powers. Under the Turf Development Acts the board may not borrow more than £100 million.  The total borrowing to date is approximately £98 million, but commitments to further expenditure will shortly arise and it is necessary, therefore, to increase the statutory limitation to allow the board to undertake further borrowing. I am satisfied that borrowings by the board in excess of the current statutory <Col N="1862" /> limitation are unavoidable and that the proposed new limit will enable the board to continue its work until 1985 when the statutory limit on the board's borrowings will be reviewed again.</P>
    <P>Since the mid-seventies the board has spent £78 million on its expansion and has proposals to spend a further £82 million, at present values, to complete the programme in four years time.  This is a major investment in native energy.  It will reduce our dependence on imported energy significantly, and will have a very beneficial effect, particularly in the areas in which the bog development works are located.</P>
    <P>At the same time, a prudent attitude is called for, not least by the Government, who have ultimate responsibility in the matter, where very large capital expenditure is involved.  Under existing administrative arrangements Bord na Móna's major capital expenditure is subject to ministerial approval.  While this has worked reasonably well in the past, Deputies will appreciate that in the current difficult economic climate more stringent control of such expenditure is desirable.  The provision in section 2 of the Bill now before the House will allow for formal statutory control of the board's expenditure.  It is based on similar provisions in more modern legislation, such as the Gas Act, 1976, in relation to An Bord Gáis.</P>
    <P>Not all bogs, however, are suitable for large-scale mechanised development by Bord na Móna.  There are many small tracts of land which can be economically exploited by private developers.  While the board will continue to be the dominant force in bog development and peat fuel production, there is a welcome revival of interest in private turf production. This revival has been stimulated by two events.  The Turf Development Act, 1981, and the advent of small turf cutting machines.  The Turf Development Act, 1981, provides for capital grants for private turf production, up to 60 per cent of the cost for co-ops and groups and 45 per cent for individuals and private companies.</P>
    <P>The administration of this scheme has been entrusted to Bord na Móna because <Col N="1863" /> of its unique expertise.  To date grants totalling £1.9 million have helped some 4,000 people in carrying out drainage to their bogs, the construction of roads and the purchase of machines.  A number of small enterprising companies are now marketing popular turf cutting and harvesting machinery and taking the drudgery out of the traditional hand-won methods. This development, the grants scheme and the good weather last summer resulted in a very substantial increase in turf production in 1982.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna has over the years built up a fund of information resulting from its experiments and research into bog development.  Much of this information could be of considerable value to private developers.  While the Turf Development Act, 1946, provides at present for the dissemination of such information, as the board thinks fit, the provision in section 3 of this Bill will ensure that the information will be more freely available to private developers.  I would like at this point to put on record my deep appreciation of the help and advice that Bord na Móna has given voluntarily to private bog developers in the past.  Section 3 simply formalises this practice by ensuring that the private developers will have access to the findings of the board's researches and experiments as a right. However, I believe that the board should be allowed to exercise some measure of discretion in cases where the giving of information could prove a threat to its own commercial interests and the Bill so provides.</P>
    <P>I strongly recommend this Bill to the House.  It will make an important contribution to our energy objectives, as I have explained earlier.  It will be a vote of confidence in the board which has always enjoyed the strong support of the community for the progress it has made down through the years.  The board has earned a high reputation for technical expertise and development and it holds an important place in the fabric of rural life.  I am confident that the House will join with me in commending the board for its efforts.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill to the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not any objection to this Bill in relation to what it sets out to do but there are matters which have arisen in the speech of the Minister of State and have also arisen in recent weeks that we would like to draw attention to and to express our apprehension in relation to them.  If one reads the annual reports of Bord na Móna over the last few years one will find a continuous litany of complaints about the refusal of successive Ministers to allow them price increases, the consequences of that and their inability to develop bogs and production facilities which they would be able to do if they were allowed these price increases.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna made the case very strongly and got it accepted by the Department of Finance that peat here should be charged for at what they call a market-related price, which in practice is an energy-related price, which in practice again means an oil-related price.  I have referred to that before and one could debate it at great length.  I do not agree with that concept.  However, the Government in 1982 decided on this course.  We were told that all would now be well for Bord na Móna because at long last they had got themselves into this situation and the amount of development we could expect from them would increase greatly, there would not be any strain on the Exchequer and so on.</P>
      <P>As the Minister of State said, in 1982 a four-phase price increase was approved which when fully implemented will bring prices for the board's products up to the market-related level and which should ease considerably the strain on the board's cash flow.  Perhaps the full significance of what the Minister of State said may not be fully realised.  My recollection is that of the four phased price increase two of them have come into operation and two further price increases are due to come into operation soon.  They will be not less than the substantial increases in the price of Bord na Móna's products which have taken place over the past 12 months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the public statements from the chief executive of the ESB on <Col N="1865" /> what he considers to be the appallingly high price that the ESB, as the main customers of Bord na Móna, will have to pay now.  That is nothing to what they will be expected to pay when the remaining phases of this increase are implemented. It was all justified by Bord na Móna, the Department of Finance and the Department of Energy at that time on the basis that once this was implemented we need have no further worries about projects like Ballyforan and the development of bogs in the west.</P>
    <P>In the speech that refers to the substantial four-phase increase we see acknowledged in the House for the first time, though not acknowledged by a Member of the House for the first time, that the proposal for Ballyforan and the development of the Derryfadda group of bogs is being deferred.  &ldquo;Deferred&rdquo; is a polite word for saying that it will be scrapped.  It is interesting that in the Minister of State's script he refers to the fact that a second factory was proposed for Ballyforan, County Roscommon, and that some site work was already carried out.  The Minister of State goes on to say that the Minister has initiated a review which will be before the Government in the next few weeks.  That is different from what the Minister for Finance was reported in the newspapers in Roscommon as having said in the last ten days.</P>
    <P>If there is now a decision, as appears to be the case, not to go ahead with that project, and since these substantial price increases beginning from 1982 were allowed only for that purpose, will these price increases now be reversed?  The Government of the day would not have agreed to those substantial price increases if they thought that Bord na Móna would utilise them for their own benefit and not carry out the development works for which they needed the price increase.  It should be borne in mind that if the decision to build a briquette factory with an annual output of 300,000 tonnes is not proceeded with, it necessarily follows that the development of the group of bogs in east Galway and south Roscommon, known as the Derryfadda group, cannot be proceeded <Col N="1866" /> with.  Substantial work has been done already in the drainage of these bogs for the purpose of supplying this factory. That will all go to naught because the milled peat which is being produced cannot be transported for use in any of the board's other factories and cannot be transported for use in ESB power stations on the other side of the Shannon.  If that milled peat is ever to be used it will have to be used either in a briquette factory or in a power station situated in the Derryfadda group of bogs in east Galway or south Roscommon.  We are facing not just the closure of the Ballyforan factory but the closure of the development of a large area of hitherto undeveloped bog in the west, indeed perhaps the largest group of bogs for development west of the Shannon.  It will be a great tragedy for areas with so little opportunity for industrial development and, because of the nature of the land, so little opportunity for agricultural development if this long awaited development, approved by me as Minister for Energy in 1979 and subsequently by my successors, Deputies Colley and Reynolds and formally started, as long ago as last November is not gone ahead with.</P>
    <P>In the revised capital programme issued after the budget this year the Department of Finance said that when the Ballyforan factory commences production in 1985 it will have an output worth £6.2 million per annum at 1983 prices and that so far £1.2 million had been spent on that factory, which would ultimately cost £25.5 million at 1983 prices.  They also refer to Bord na Móna's financial position having been aggravated by low prices and below target sales and they celebrated the introduction of market-related pricing for their products. We have a situation where £1.2 million was up to February, on the admission of the Department of Finance, spent on the factory.  Many millions of pounds were spent on the development of the bogs, which will be equally wasted if the project is not proceeded with.  Even in the revised Estimate this year, after been heavily cut, provision was made for the factory alone of £5.2 million as against an outturn of £0.6 million last year.  If the project is <Col N="1867" /> now ceasing will all that money go down the drain?  That is an unsatisfactory situation. It is a failure to use available natural resources and it is a major setback for east Galway and County Roscommon where the people were given every reason to believe that the project would go ahead.</P>
    <P>This is one of the very few kinds of projects that can be developed in an area of that kind.  We, when returned to Government, are prepared to do as we decided in 1979 and as we reiterated in 1980 and 1982.  We are prepared to go ahead with this project of building a briquette factory in this area.  It was interesting to note that at the end of last year the Department of Energy in preparing notes in respect of the expenditure in this area for 1983 said that the Ballyforan-Derryfadda scheme would provide 210 jobs between the factory and the bog in 1983 and that, in addition, outside contractors on the scheme would provide 75 jobs in 1983, a total of 285 jobs.  I understand that those jobs are there now.  If this deferral, as it is politely described, goes ahead those jobs will be gone this year, not to speak of the substantially larger numbers that will not materialise in the future.</P>
    <P>This year, 1983, will be celebrated for among other things the introduction of taxation for the first time ever on a turf with 5 per cent VAT.  I do not know what view Bord na Móna will take about that.  A further price increase on top of the various ones that I have referred to as having taken place or pending is imposed but Bord na Móna will not get any benefit from it.  I did not expect to see the day when VAT would be imposed on a principal Irish indigenous form of energy.</P>
    <P>This Bill makes reference to co-operation with private interests in the development of bogs here.  It is very heartening to be able to record that the Turf Development Act, 1981, which introduced a system of grants for that purpose and was introduced here by Deputy Colley, has proved extremely successful.  There are many applications and considerable production <Col N="1868" /> of turf by private operators last year which would not otherwise have taken place.  The contribution to savings on our balance of payments amounts to as much as £17 million from that source alone.  It has been suggested, and may well be borne out by section 3 here, that Bord na Móna have been less than anxious at times to co-operate with some of the private interests.  At least two instances have been drawn to my attention. One was in County Westmeath, and Deputy Reynolds may speak about it later because he would know more about it in detail than I do.  A certain private project required the purchase of 200 acres of undeveloped bog and when they went to purchase for industrial purposes and the creation of employment a CPO was slapped on them by Bord na Móna who resent anybody getting into business if they can prevent them.  Another instance has been drawn to my attention by Deputy D. Gallagher of the old Min Fhéir bogland near Bangor Erris in County Mayo.  Several years ago when we were looking at the question of whether Min Fhéir Teoranta should be continued in operation, while I was anxious to close the company I was not anxious to leave the area bereft of any kind of development and I suggested to Bord na Móna that they might take it over since it was essentially all bogland.  They would not take it for nothing; they would not take it as a present.  I understand now that since Min Fhéir Teoranta went into liquidation and the liquidator offered their assets &mdash; this bogland comprising a couple of thousand acres &mdash; for sale and since a private concern in Mayo expressed and interest and made a bid to the liquidator, Bord na Móna have made a succession of bids in order to prevent any private interests buying the land. Their latest bid stands at £400,000 for something they would not take for nothing three or four years ago when I asked them to do so.</P>
    <P>That is a pity and for that reason I welcome section 3 of this Bill.  Even though it relates only to information, research and so on, I would like to think that the co-operation with private interests would extend more broadly than simply <Col N="1869" /> technical information as a result of research, that it would extend to practical co-operation with private interests trying to develop boglands at all levels.  Not so many years ago no private concerns at all had the slightest interest in any Irish bogs or their developments.  We should all welcome the fact that quite a number of people now are prepared to show their interest and make fairly substantial investments, by their standards at least, and we should not let a statutory board stand in the way of that sort of interest and progress.  They have no right to do so.</P>
    <P>As the amount of bog in the Midlands will decline and as Bord na Móna appear less anxious or perhaps less in a position than they were a year or two ago to develop the bogs west of the Shannon, they should consider the question of the use of cutaway bogs.  They have done research on that.  Many of these cutaways have proved suitable for different purposes and there has been something of a debate with agricultural interests as to what should be done with the cutaway bogs as more of them become available. Bord na Móna have taken the view that because of the drainage problems and so on it may be better not to split them up into small, individual, private holdings but that some form of common usage must be arrived at; whether by way of short-leasing or usage by Bord na Móna themselves remains undecided.</P>
    <P>Experiments in horticulture in this cutaway bog have for the most part proved very successful.  The lack of a food processing industry is lamented frequently on all sides of this House and outside.  One of the principal reasons that we lack a food processing industry as far as vegetables are concerned is that we have no supplies and a processor cannot come in here unless he is in a position to import large quantities of supplies because he cannot get regular supplies from Irish farmers.  It is worth nothing that the Irish Sugar Company, with all their trials and tribulations, have the greatest difficulty in obtaining regular supplies, and irregular supplies are of no use to a food processor.  If Bord na Móna were prepared to diversify their operations by <Col N="1870" /> going into vegetable production on a fairly big scale on the basis of contracts with food processing factories to be set up which would have guaranteed production from Bord na Móna cutaway bogs, we could take some important steps towards achieving the level of vegetable processing that we want.  It has not proved successful, let us face the fact whether it is popular to say so or not.  It has not proved profitable to sign contracts with many Irish farmers for particular products because if a market is very strong they will tend to follow that market and if the market is very weak they will tend to want their contracts honoured. If processors were dealing with a State body who could guarantee supplies they would be in a much better situation. Of course, that assumes that Bord na Móna would be free to operate without restrictive practices in a way that would enable them to meet the requirements of processing factories at a reasonable price level.</P>
    <P>There are quite a number of speakers to this debate and for that reason I do not want to go on at any greater length, although if I had time I would like to go into other aspects of this Bill.  I reiterate our regret at the attitude that has been taken by the Government to the development in east Galway and Roscommon. It will be recalled by the House that this is the second review that has been carried out on the Ballyforan-Derryfadda proposal which I started in 1979.  The last one was carried out by another Coalition Government in 1981 and the position was restored in 1982 when Deputy Reynolds was Minister for Industry and Energy. Let us hope we do not have to wait until there is another Fianna Fáil Government following the next general election to have the situation restored once again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to welcome this Bill and to welcome the substantial increase in the borrowing requirement for Bord na Móna.  The board have done a tremendous amount of work throughout the midlands and west and have helped the economy considerably by reducing our dependence on imported fuels.  Every encouragement <Col N="1871" /> should be given to Bord ma Móna to continue the development of bogs and to ensure as far as possible that bogs are used to the maximum.</P>
      <P>It is extremely important having regard to the vast acreage of bog which the board control that they should consider the use of those bogs when it is no longer possible to produce peat from them.  We should be careful that our boglands do not become wastelands.  The board could do much more with cutaway bogs which are now down to the last 2 feet of peat.  They should be used for horticultural or agricultural production and this would protect employment.</P>
      <P>Every assistance should be given to private individuals or groups who are developing boglands.  They have not always received the greatest encouragement from Bord na Móna.  A typical example has been in regard to Erris where a private company were trying to develop the bogs.  I regret that they did not get the facilities and co-operation from Bord na Móna to which they were entitled.  It should be impressed upon the directors of the board that they should give every assistance in the drainage and development of boglands.</P>
      <P>For some reason Bord na Móna are slightly afraid of competition from smaller groups but competition is a healthy aspect of any democracy.  It is the life of trade and the Minister should encourage it.  Very often there are small tracts of bog which it would not be feasible for Bord an Móna to develop but which would be suitable for development by private individuals or groups.</P>
      <P>I welcome the extension to Shannonbridge and Lanesboro power stations which will give badly needed employment in those areas.  The Minister should encourage this type of development at every opportunity.  Very often employment opportunities in such places are very limited and we should encourage the maximum utilisation of natural resources so that people can benefit from the bogs, which were the curse of those areas for many years but which now have become excellent money spinners due to the high cost of other fuels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> The Minister outlined the expense of developing bog.  While I fully accept the point, it is vital to recognise that this investment is well worthwhile and must be continued.  From Shannonbridge to Glenamaddy much development has taken place on the Derryfadda bogs.  We must ensure that development continues and that the produce is processed locally and not transported elsewhere.  The implications of not having the peat processed locally would have to be very carefully examined.</P>
    <P>With regard to the remarks of the previous speaker, I would point out that the Minister for Finance did not say that the building of the briquette factory in Ballyforan was deferred.  The Minister said that the whole capital exenditure programme was being examined.  In view of the massive implications of any delay in the building of this factory in that area of Roscommon and east Galway, I appeal to the Government to examine the project carefully, having due regard to its social implications for that area of high unemployment.  Peat is the only natural resource available to help the Government to provide employment.  The people are looking forward to the commencement of the building of the briquette factory and they have been doing so since those bogs were developed. Some of those bogs were sold for very small sums, very often because the farmers believed that at a later stage they would provide secure employment for their families.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the building of that factory in Ballyforan is vital to the economy of south Roscommon and east Galway and I renew my appeal to the Minister to build the factory and save the jobs of more than 300 people who have been employed in bog development since 1976; on road and railway building, some of which cost vast sums of money, including £1.5 million to develop new roads and a site.  There are stagnation and total frustration in that area because of the delay.  That peat cannot be utilised in any other way except in a briquette factory. It is not feasible to transport it to other areas and it would be economic madness to attempt to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1873" /> I welcome many other aspects of the Bill, particularly the facility extended to manufacturers of turf-cutting machines. This is one matter that should be examined usefully so that the best type of machine will be grant-aided and so that the bogs will thus be utilised to the maximum. Two machines are manufactured in my area and the board should examine them with a view to giving grant-aid. Every ton of peat we produce means the importation of less oil and coal.  Therefore, we should utilise our bogs to the fullest and accordingly reduce our balance of payments deficit and ensure badly needed employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and am glad we will be able to get it through before the summer recess.  The matter that causes concern is the reference in the Minister's speech as follows:</P>
      <P>The second factory was proposed for Ballyforan.</P>
      <P>The word &ldquo;was&rdquo; in that context causes concern.  I initiated that scheme and at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party there was reference to a successful development which had got under way. I hope the Minister's use of that phrase is an error because the word &ldquo;was&rdquo; would indicate some rethinking.  I hope that is not the case.  The people in my constituency are concerned about a statement by the Minister for Finance at Roscommon, reported in a recent issue of the <i>Roscommon Herald.</i> The Minister was on a morale boosting trip and he announced that a review was taking place in regard to the briquette factory.  People regarded it as a warning, and this resulted in a well attended meeting in Ballyforan on 4 July. The meeting expressed great concern about the statement made by the Minister for Finance, but the statement here today by the Minister of State does not allay the fears expressed at the speech of the Minister for Finance because again today the Minister spoke of the matter being reviewed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is essential that a final decision will be made by the Government.  In 1979 Deputies O'Malley, Colley and Reynolds reaffirmed that the work on that project <Col N="1874" /> would be recommenced.  The last Coalition Government reviewed the matter and then the work had to be recommenced by Fianna Fáil.  I stated categorically that we were 100 per cent committed to the recommencement of that project and that was reiterated today by Deputy O'Malley who said that if the Government had any intention or proposal to defer the project Fianna Fáil, when they return to power, would recommence the work which we had started.</P>
    <P>In 1981 the last Coalition Government reviewed the project.  The Minister of State now present gave a categoric assurance at the time that the Government were fully behind the development at Ballyforan.  I hope he will prove that in his concluding remarks on this Bill by confirming that this project will continue as scheduled.</P>
    <P>There are at present 195 people employed in the Derryfadda bogs who are preparing, developing and draining those bogs and harvesting milled peat there.  In 1982 a total of 65,000 tonnes was produced and it is anticipated that this year between 70,000 and 80,000 tonnes of milled peat will be produced and made available to be stockpiled in the event of the commencement of our briquette factory in 1985.  All the work and investment to date has been geared towards the erection of the briquette factory. Therefore this Government cannot under any circumstances decide to delay or defer this project.  All of the investment of approximately £12 million to date has been put into the development of the Derryfadda bogs for the eventual use of the milled peat in the production of much-needed briquettes.  There is a major shortage of briquettes at present. It is a most attractive fuel for which there is no difficulty in obtaining a market within the State.  Even if that market did not exist there would still be a great export potential for those briquettes. Certainly we shall have sufficient customers at home to take up the supply of briquettes.</P>
    <P>I had the honour last year, on behalf of the then Minister for Industry and Energy, of opening the Littleton briquette factory in County Tipperary.  I was <Col N="1875" /> deputising for the Minister on that occasion. I anticipated at that stage &mdash; and said so in my speech &mdash; that the next briquette factory would be opened in my constituency and in the adjoining constituency of east Galway near Ballyforan.  I hope the Minister will confirm those plans in order to avoid this type of stop/start situation which is demoralising for the staff, for Bord na Móna themselves, with the Department interfering with the management and running of this project.</P>
    <P>The work taking place at present is on the development of 10,000 acres at Derryfadda. A workshop was provided at a cost of £500,000, a modern, well equipped, engineering workshop located near the site of the briquette factory.  The site for the briquette factory was acquired at a cost of £130,000 for 60 acres of land. Bord na Móna paid a sum of £150,000 to Galway County Council for the well developed service road to the factory site. There has been an amount of £400,000 spent since November 1982 on site works for the briquette factory.  Tenders have been submitted to Bord na Móna.  A contractor has been recommended for the main engineering contract which will entail a sum of between £5 million and £5,500,000.  I understand also that a boiler has been ordered for the briquette factory at a cost of £1 million.  The development to date indicates clearly the necessity for the erection of a briquette factory.  If they did not continue with this project the present Government would be accused of gross irresponsibility and total negligence in their running of the country.  We in Roscommon and in the adjoining constituency of east Galway demand that this project proceed, as planned by Fianna Fáil and which had commenced during our term of office. The area is in need of this type of development.</P>
    <P>In 1977, on my election to this House, I pointed out, along with the Ballyforan Development Association and colleagues from my constituency, the need for a project of this type in that area.  The first scheme was a proposal to build a 40 megawatts power station in Ballyforan to <Col N="1876" /> utilise the turf resources there.  After review, on the initiative of the then Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy O'Malley, it was decided at my request, and raised at a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, that a briquette factory would be the ideal type of development for that area.  I believe briquettes utilise a native resource in a much more economic way than does the production of electricity.  Therefore it constitutes a well-researched project.</P>
    <P>In 1977, when we were working on this project, the then public representative for the area, now Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton, made a most depressing type of comment.  I am quoting from <i>The Connacht Tribune</i> of Friday, November 11, 1977 and from an article entitled &ldquo;O'Malley Gives &lsquo;Thumbs Down&rsquo; To Ballyforan&rdquo;, which said:</P>
    <P>The question of the briquette factory for the Roscommon area was described by Senator Connaughton as a red herring and he described the &ldquo;half mentioned half promised&rdquo; development as nothing short of sending the deputation home happy but by now nobody is very enthused in the Ballyforan area about the possibility of the briquette factory, Senator Connaughton said.</P>
    <P>That was the type of attitude expressed by a present Minister of State of this Government.  I regret that he has never retracted those comments made in reference to a deputation I led to the then Minister, now Deputy O'Malley.  That was in 1977 after we had met the Minister of the day and he had agreed to consider the possibility of providing a briquette factory at Ballyforan.  At that time the then Senator Connaughton stated that it was a red herring.  That is the type of attitude for which he is well known and which would be confirmed by my colleagues, Deputy Kitt and Deputy N. Treacy.  That was the type of negative approach, demonstrated for political reasons at the time by the then Senator for that constituency.  I sincerely hope he has changed his views since then.</P>
    <P>We initiated that project.  On 31 May 1979 the then Fianna Fáil Government <Col N="1877" /> took a decision to build a briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan.  That constituted a continuity of the representations I made at that time and have continued to make to date.  When the first sod was turned there in November 1979 I felt that was the commencement of this great project, the end of any further controversy, reviews or considerations of this project.  I can state categorically that we in Fianna Fáil would have proceeded in the manner in which we had planned to erect this factory.  I want also to pay tribute to my colleague, Deputy Reynolds, who after the review initiated by the last Coalition Government decided that the project would proceed on target.  At that time he met a deputation, went to Ballyforan to meet the people of the area and confirmed to them, in July 1982, that the project would be on target.  Indeed, he gave the date on which it would be commenced &mdash; October or November 1982. That commitment was honoured by that Minister and the Fianna Fáil Government. I am now asking this Government not to play politics with the lives of the people in my constituency, to proceed with this project forthwith.</P>
    <P>The House is being asked to provide the capital required to permit Board na Móna to proceed with its capital works. We are supporting it on the basis that there will be adequate funds in the £180 million for the erection of a briquette factory at Derryfadda, Ballyforan, at a cost of approximately £25 million.  The village of Ballyforan is being built up and on the Roscommon side we have provided a water supply at a cost of £250,000 and a guaranteed 10,000 gallons of water to Bord na Móna for the factory. Through the rural housing organisation we have provided £500,000 roughly for investment in housing in the village and we have also supplied sewerage works. With the help of Bord na Móna and the county council Ballyforan will be a model town, but the development depends on the erection of the briquette factory.</P>
    <P>A decision to defer the project would be detrimental to the development work that is taking place in the village.  A delay will cost more money.  The peat available is of excellent quality.  The milled peat <Col N="1878" /> being stock piled has only one outlet, through a briquette factory.  The Minister will realise that milled peat is bulky and expensive to transport.  It would not be practicable to think of any other outlet except a briquette factory on the site being developed.  I wonder why the Government have decided to delay or refuse this project.  I accuse them of playing politics with the project because they know that Fianna Fáil are committed to this to such an extent that we have given an assurance that on our return to Government the project will proceed.  I cannot see any justifiable reason why there should be a second review of the project.</P>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that on 10 March 1983 Deputies Kitt, Noel Treacy and myself tabled a question to the Minister in regard to this project. We were assured by Deputy Boland, who was deputising for Deputy John Bruton, that the contract was out for tender and the normal processes would occur after which a contract will be awarded without any inordinate delay.  He said it was expected that later this year, or early next year, the mechanical contract will go to tender, followed by the delivery of certain pieces of equipment in the early part of 1984 and further work leading to the factory being commissioned in January 1985.  He said the estimated cost at current rates was £24.1 million for the factory and £24 million for the bog development. The number of jobs provided by contractors on the construction of the factory at present is 24.  Construction employment will peak at about 180 and long term employment on the bog and in the factory is estimated to be about 110 and 300 respectively.  In my view in the region of 400 people will be employed in the briquette factory and on the bog.</P>
    <P>At that stage the review was still under way and I should like to know why it has not been completed four months later.  In reply to supplementary questions on 10 March I was informed that the project would go ahead.  I do not see any reason why the Government should backtrack on their commitment to my constituents. On 25 September 1982 Deputy Reynolds, who was then Minister for Industry and <Col N="1879" /> Energy, informed me by letter that the work would be commissioned in January 1985.  Indeed, the sod turning ceremony took place on 5 November 1982.  When Deputy Reynolds sent that letter to me there was no possibility of a general election. The sod turning ceremony took place during the general election campaign but the arrangements had been made long before the general election was called.  People may make cynical remarks about the fact that the sod turning ceremony took place during the general election campaign.  That was not our approach when in Government.  The ceremony was scheduled well in advance of the unfortunate circumstances which led to the general election.  That move was unfortunate for my constituency because Fianna Fáil would have honoured the dates mentioned in the former Minister's letter.  That letter is available for any Member who wishes to challenge me on it.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, on behalf of Roscommon and East Galway, to announce this evening that the contract will be accepted and that work will proceed on schedule.  There is no joy in Roscommon with the uncertainty about that factory.  I hope the Minister, or his Minister of State, will meet a deputation from the Ballyforan Development Association in the next seven days to discuss the project.  That association, chaired by Michael Donoghue and with Fonsie Tully as secretary, has done tremendous work. The members of that body, who are deeply committed to that project, are anxious to meet the Minister.  The Minister should consider travelling to the area, as his predecessor did.  I hope when the Minister meets the deputation he will be in a position to announce that the project will go ahead.</P>
    <P>The Bill is welcome because Bord na Móna who are providing a lot of employment deserve every encouragement in their development work.  In relation to private development in Roscommon we are proud that the very effective turf cutting machine which can be attached to a tractor was developed by the Finan Brothers in Ballintubber.  Castlerea.  I <Col N="1880" /> should like to congratulate the managing director of the firm concerned, Gerry Hunt and his fellow directors, the Finan brothers, who designed this revolutionary machine which is being used extensively. It has given small farmers an opportunity to develop their bogs.  Many of the bogs now being used were regarded as uneconomic before the machine was invented.  The machine has had a great impact.</P>
    <P>The Bill introduced in this House by my colleague, Deputy Colley, in relation to development of bogs and the provision of grants for machinery has been a tremendous boost to the area.  In relation to general development of bogs, the smaller bogs have considerable potential.  It is essential that every assistance be given by Bord na Mona to small developers to enable development to take place.</P>
    <P>I should like on behalf of my constituents to place on record my appreciation of the Irish Sugar Company for providing machinery for turf development.  They have provided excellent facilities in the development of smaller bogs.  Bord na Móna have carried out their work effectively during the years and they have provided more than 6,000 permanent jobs.  I hope we will have our share of jobs in my area and that in the near future I will see undertaken a project which is near to my heart and one I am delighted to have been associated with since I was elected to this House.  I have been interested in this project during the years, whether in Government or in Opposition. I continue in the same vein in making this appeal to the Minister to proceed with the project.  If he does this we will be very grateful to him and the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Turf is part of what we are, as the cliche has it.  Indeed, the famous song-writer, Percy French, referred to the bogs below Belmullet in County Mayo.  Many people from western Ireland were labelled with the stigma of coming from the bogs and no matter where they went they were recognised as coming from areas where bogs were predominant. However, that kind of stigma has changed drastically following the oil <Col N="1881" /> crisis and difficulties with regard to fuel costs.  Turf is now the new black gold and industry and Government have turned their hand to harvest this vast natural resource.</P>
      <P>Man is probably the greatest desroyer of his environment and during the years his efforts have resulted in a completely changed landscape in many counties.  The same has happened in the area of bog and peat development.  Bord na Móna must be complimented for the work they have done during the years.  I hope the third development programme will prove successful.</P>
      <P>The Ballyforan peat briquette station has been referred to in detail by other Deputies.  Deputy Leyden referred to the turning of the sod.  I do not know if politics were involved at that point but I am led to believe some public representatives were not invited on that occasion.</P>
      <P>The Minister has stated he has initiated a review of all capital investment projects within his area of responsibility, including the Ballyforan briquette factory, to determine if the projects can be justified on acceptable norms.  I think that is reasonable in view of the fact that he recently called in the semi-State bodies and asked them for a quarterly financial report in addition to a five-year projection in relation to their plans.  In view of the vast amount of money that has been spent by semi-State companies during the years, some of which was ill-spent and mismanaged, in fairness to the Minister he is entitled to ask for a review of expenditure.  I have not doubt in my mind that he will see this development through.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said that at the moment borrowing is approximately £98 million but that the board will be undertaking various expenditures in the future that will require further borrowing. They have proposals to spend a further £82 million at present values.  I assume that will include the Ballyforan briquette station.  The Minister said that the report will come before the Government for a review of costings but I have no doubt that the statement from that meeting will be favourable towards continuation of this development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1882" /> The development of bogs under the scheme operated by Bord na Móna where they provide grant assistance has gone ahead in many areas on a successful scale. I must pay tribute to the inspectors of Bord na Móna who have been prompt, courteous and attentive to the applications put before them by private individuals, co-operatives or groups of interested people.  The development of roads into many of the smaller bogs that would not be suitable for the larger Bord na Móna machinery must be looked at.  Many of the roads are only used during the summer when it is necessary to take out the turf.  Consideration should be given to having further consultations with the Land Commission, with the local authorities concerned and the Department of Agriculture.  The various Departments seem to be at cross-purposes in respect of some aspects of this development.</P>
    <P>I am not in agreement with the Minister when he said that investment must take account of the fact that, from the initiation of a scheme up to seven years will elapse before a bog is capable of producing peat and yielding revenue.  I do not think that is true.  It may be so on raised bogs but the bogs in the west are different and have different climate and geographic conditions.  Development on a phased basis and carried out properly on a new bog will yield results before seven years.  The Minister's speech under-estimates the quick drainage capacity of a bog.  It is possible to drain bogs in such a way that they will reduce their physical level to a stage and to a state where work can start on harvesting the peat in less than seven years.</P>
    <P>During the years many of the smaller bogs have been destroyed because cutting has not been carried out on a phased basis.  In the old days many private developers using a spade or some other implement cut the bogs in such a way that all the levels were different.  In many cases substantial amounts of peat were left that cannot be cut or harvested.  Bord na Móna and the Department should look at the amount of bogland that is left, whether it be held in commonage or in private ownership.</P>
    <P>On many occasions I put down questions <Col N="1883" /> to the relevant Minister about a briquette station in the Erris region.  I was always given the stock answer that there was not sufficient bog in the area and that it was not sufficient deapth.  I can accept that it was not of sufficient depth in many cases but the extent of the bogland is enormous.  There is a complete peninsula which is practically all bog except for a small area.  Much of this is still held in commonage.  An attempt has been made by the authorities to acquire it for forestry; some of it has been bought by speculators and by private individuals, but there is still a considerable amount of bogland to be developed.</P>
    <P>The various Departments involved are at cross-purposes with regard to this matter. The forestry section seem to go out of their way to acquire land where they can but the financial constraints imposed on them at the moment only allow them to acquire land that is adjacent to existing State forests.  Bord na Móna, on the other hand, would have the potential to give grants to private developers for smaller bogs if they were acquired.  The division of commonage legislation, which was raised in the House recently under the auspices of the Minister for Agriculture, needs to be looked at in this context because there is potential development with subdivision and agreement.  Experiments that have been carried out by An Foras Talúntais on deep bog show that it is not economic to have to fertilise these deep bog areas in the hope that they will produce grassland to an acceptable protein content and level.  That has not worked and such bogs need to be cut down to a certain level before being used for that purpose.  The best use must be made out of what is left of these areas where turf cutting may take place.  The scheme of giving grants to various co-operatives and private individuals for machinery is welcome and there are half a dozen or more different kinds of machines operating on bog cutting at present.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to one area in my own county and the interest of the former Minister, Deputy Reynolds, at the time. <Col N="1884" /> The fact that Bord na Móna have total control over bogs is dangerous from the point of view that if a private individual or concern wish to develop the area it is up against a State monopoly with a board that has been in existence for a number of years.  It limits the extent to which private development can take place. There is a project still on the books in the Erris region of County Mayo.  There was an industry there under the auspices of An Foras Talúntais which was apparently known as Min Fhéir Teoranta, where deep bog was fertilised in order to grow grass which was then dried, made into grass nuts and treated with various other protein to bring up the level of the vitamin content and so on.  This project was discontinued some time ago which caused some redundancies and a liquidator was appointed.</P>
    <P>A private developer with expertise brought in people from Finland and other Scandinavian countries who were experts in bog development and their impression was that much of Bord na Mona's equipment was antique, that their projections were not correct in respect of the area to be developed and that, if at all possible, having regard to the professional surveys which they carried out, private enterprise should be approved by the Government. The private individual concerned wished to acquire the bogland which used to be fertilised under the original scheme, to harvest that by conversion of the turbines in the Min Fhéir Teoranta plant and to use it to produce milled peat and briquettes or peat pellets.</P>
    <P>There are three Government Departments involved: the Department of the Gaeltacht &mdash; because Udarás na Gaeltachta have given the private individual their backing; the Department of Industry and Energy, who are concerned with it in terms of future development; and the Department of Finance who, naturally, have to be involved when liquidators have been appointed.  The matter has dragged on for a long time.  The portion of ground concerned, which is approximately 1,000 acres, was offered to Bord na Móna previously to be acquired as part of their land bank for further development but they refused it.  Subsequently, <Col N="1885" /> when the word got round that there was a private developer interested in this area, Bord na Móna made a substantially increased offer.  They were also offered land in the Glenamoy area.  But this was not suitable either, even though they have developed boglands in other areas which are similar to that offered in the Glenamoy area.</P>
    <P>I know the former Minister, Deputy Reynolds, was willing to see the private developer concerned given an opportunity to complete successfully on a relatively small area of bog which would have provided summer employment for a substantial number of local people on a contractual basis.  This matter is still not finalised and I should like the Minister to refer to any progress made in this area. His speech referred to the fact that the fourth programme will take cognisance of various contractual obligations which the board have in terms of supplying the ESB at the Bellacorick power plant.  I should like further information on the long-term contractual obligations of the board in supplying this station.  It is very close to the area concerned and I can see the point of increasing the output and an extension of the life of the Bellacorick power plant but I should like clarification as to what the contractual obligations of the board are in terms of supplying the ESB.</P>
    <P>Biomass was planted in the area some years ago but so far there are no results. Also in that area there is a very large Don Quixote modern-type windmill, probably erected at great cost, which apparently blew down.  It was re-erected and I should like the Minister to tell us the purpose of that structure and if it has anything to do with Bord na Móna.</P>
    <P>I welcome the overall content of the Bill but I am not satisfied with various aspects of the work of Bord na Móna in terms of not allowing private developers who have carried out professional surveys to go ahead using their own dedication together with whatever EEC or Government assistance might be available to them.  I do not accept that it would be seven years before a bog yields results.  With more modern technology and equipment, smaller bogs development <Col N="1886" /> could take place which would be viable within a much shorter period.</P>

      <P>I join with other Deputies in welcoming this Bill.  Bog areas are usually associated with very poor roads and lack of infrastructure and, for that reason, we welcome development by Bord na Móna. I should like to deal mainly with the development that I hoped would take place in my constituency.  We had hoped that there would be a briquette factory built at Derryfadda near Ballyforan.  I raised the matter a fortnight ago with the Minister for Industry and Energy on the Estimate for his Department and I was amazed when he told me that this project was being reviewed.  He said the review was necessary to see if State investment was warranted and that the ability of Bord na Móna to make repayments on the loans was also being questioned.</P>
      <P>The answer to these two questions is readily available.  First, in an area where there is bog, a natural resource, and an area associated with poverty, State investment is surely warranted.  Deputy O'Malley gave the answer to the question of Bord na Móna's financial position. Deputy Reynolds as Minister for Industry and Energy gave a price increase.  If Bord na Móna are not going to develop their capital programme why should the Government allow a price increase to be sanctioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the Minister, after mentioning the four-phase price increase, did not tell us the project would be going ahead.  It was sanctioned on 31 May 1979 and we were very hopeful that work would start in 1981.  Instead we had the first review.  Now, two years later we have a second review.  Why is a second review necessary in such a short time? The project should be commencing, not being reviewed.  In 1982 £5.2 million was <Col N="1887" /> made available in the Public Capital Programme and the first sod was turned for the factory in November last year.  The civil engineering contract was to be awarded early this year.  A firm was recommended for the work.  Now we are told bluntly by the Minister for Finance on his so-called goodwill tour of the west that the project is being deferred.  I have to question the commitment of this Coalition Government.</P>

Our commitment was very clear.  Cold water has now been thrown on the project by certain people in the Fine Gael Party.  Cold water was thrown on it when the project was first announced and this was referred to by <Col N="1888" /> Deputy Leyden.  One Senator referred to it as a red herring.  When Deputy Reynolds was Minister he was brought in here on an adjournment debate and he explained to the House the project was to be built in two stages.  It had been alleged by a Deputy that we were getting only half a factory.  This so-called half factory was to provide 110 jobs with an output of 140,000 tons.  It was to be completed in 1985.  We had a public meeting in Ballyforan last Monday night and we were not able to tell the people the project was going ahead.  We are hoping in this debate the Minister will make a clear statement on the future of the project.</P>
      <P>There have been a number of myths about the delay in starting the project. One Government speaker said in Ballyforan that Bord na Móna had not applied for planning permission.  That is absolutely untrue.  The county manager of Galway signed the planning permission on 12 January last.  Another speaker said a contribution of £300,000 planning charges had not been paid.  I do not see how that could hold up the project because it was simply a case of a transfer of resources from one Department to another, to say nothing of its being a very small sum in a £1 million project.</P>
      <P>The county council have made a road into the site.  The other problems in relation to planning can be resolved.  All we need is the go-ahead to Bord na Móna to borrow the money.  We have now two projects in my constituency of east Galway which are being reviewed: one is this briquette factory and the other is the sugar factory 30 miles away.  Is there, I wonder, any other constituency which has two major projects under review?  In the last three years unemployment in County Galway has increased by 300 per cent.  I have not got the figures for Roscommon but the unemployment situation is also serious in that county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why this discrimination against one particular constituency?  This anti-western bias will have to be brought to an end if we are to create jobs in that area, especially jobs born out of a natural resource such as acres of bog waiting to be developed.  I deeply regret the attitude of the Government in having a further <Col N="1889" /> review of the project now.  I am glad Deputy O'Malley has given a commitment on behalf of our party to proceed with this project when we return to office. We turned the sod once and we may have to turn the sod a second time but, let there be no doubt about it, we shall get the project under way.</P>
    <P>With regard to the development of Derryfadda over the years, there are 200 people working there at present.  That figure includes many young people, apprentices who are learning their skills. There is a great deal of expertise in the area.  Drainage works are going on there continually.  Three bridges have been built at strategic points to bring the peat into the factory.  The factory site has been cleared and fenced off.  That work was done by a local contractor.  All is ready for the main contract to be awarded.  At the moment there are several thousand tons of peat in stock and that stock will increase until there is a decision as to the future of the factory.  I am informed by the people in the workshop that the charge for storage is £65,000 this year.</P>
    <P>What will be the end result?  The bog is being developed and there is nowhere to transport the peat.  Peat is bulky and is expensive to transport.  It has to be used in a briquette factory or a power station in the area.  I would remind the Minister that in 1977 a power station for this area was rejected and we were told then that the peat would be transported to Shannonbridge.  It would be impractical to transport peat from this vast area of bog.  The obvious thing is to let the project proceed.  I appeal to the Minister to make a positive statement about this and not continually have reviews on one particular project.  This is probably the most important project in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to the funds made available under the Turf Development Act, 1981, by the then Minister, Deputy George Colley when grant assistance was given for the development of privately owned bogs.  I mentioned this briefly during the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Energy.  I welcomed this scheme and said I hoped more money would be made <Col N="1890" /> available for it.  It is important to point out now that the other scheme we used to have for access roads to bogs, the local improvements scheme, is being curtailed in relation to the money for drainage and bog roads because there is a priority for farm roads.  Only one-fifth of the money we get in County Galway can be spent on bog roads now so it is important to get an extra allocation of money to enable us to have access roads and bog drainage work done under the Bord na Móna scheme.</P>
    <P>I join with the Minister in complimenting Bord na Móna and thanking them for the great assistance they have given to individuals and groups who have applied for the 60 per cent grant for development of bogs.  I hope this can be improved and more money can be given. I believe that in 1982 grants approved under that scheme totalled £1.267 million. That is a very important scheme.  It is important, when you have a lot of privately owned bog, that every encouragement is given to people to use it.</P>
    <P>I will conclude on the point I made at the start, that there is a great cloud of uncertainty over a very important project at Derryfadda.  I hope to hear the Minister talk about the commencement of this project, which will provide extra jobs in the area.  The position now seems to be that not only are we concerned about extra jobs but we are very much concerned about the jobs of people who are presently working in Derryfadda bog.</P>

      <P>I believe this Bill is absolutely essential and I welcome it.  I hope there will be no difficulty in relation to the passing of the Bill through both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Bill represents a vote of confidence in Bord na Móna by the Government in relation to the work they have done in the past, the work they are doing now and the work they will do in the future.  People throughout the country will be very pleased with this Bill especially the people employed by Bord na Móna.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe that people realise that borrowing by Bord na Móna at the moment is very close to the upper limit.  Now that it has almost reached the £100 million borrowing limits the Minister is proposing <Col N="1891" /> in this Bill that they should be allowed to extend their borrowing powers to £180 million.  This is proof that the Government are pleased with the work the board and their staff are doing.</P>
    <P>Bord na Móna have had a great impact on the whole of the country but especially the midlands.  A person who travelled through Offaly before Bord na Móna was established saw farmers trying to eke out an existence on land quite close to bogs. Most of them were unable to make a living.  Thousands and thousands of acres on this land could not be used.  A large area of bog in the midlands was idle. Bord na Móna met the challenge that faced them and we have seen the splendid results achieved by them and successive Governments in this respect.</P>
    <P>We were very badly hit by emigration from the midlands because there was no opportunity for anybody to obtain employment except in textile industries and agriculture.  The advent of Bord na Móna changed that.  The Minister of State told us that Bord na Móna employ over 6,200 people each year.  This is a very successful story.  In County Offaly over 2,500 people are employed by Bord na Móna.  When Bord na Móna and the ESB came to County Offaly the men and women employed by both concerns developed a great pride in themselves, their work and their county.  The success of Offaly in the hurling and football fields can mainly be attributed to the people getting jobs from Bord na Móna and the ESB in their own area.  It means a lot to the people in Offaly and to the people in the Midlands.  Bord na Móna have continued to expand and that is why they are so successful.  We must continue that expansion.</P>
    <P>I understand that the managing director of Bord na Móna, Mr. Louis Ratigan, will retire this year and I pay tribute to him for his magnificent work which will be looked back at for many years to come.  I wish Mr. Ratigan well in his last months in Bord na Móna and every happiness on his retirement.</P>
    <P>There have been talks about new factories at Littleton and Ballyforan but I would ask the Minister positively to consider <Col N="1892" /> the improvement of some of the existing briquette factories.  I visit these factories on a reasonably regular basis and many of them need considerable expenditure to maintain them in reasonable order.  The buildings of the briquette factories in my constituency are drastically in need of overhauling and the staff ought to have their working conditions improved.</P>
    <P>In relation to our overall energy policy, it must be noted that the first oil crisis in 1973-74 caught us unawares.  Before that crisis overtook us, at various meetings I had advocated the use of turf for energy at a time when motions were being put forward for us to change over to oil.  I opposed those motions and I was probably regarded as being parochial and unable to adapt to modern technology. Now there has been a change back to turf.  We were complacent about our energy and had allowed ourselves to be lulled into a false security.  I want the Minister to ensure that the Government will actively pursue a long-term policy with regard to energy so that we will not be left without a balance in energy policy. Lately there has been an abundance of coal and other forms of energy and there is a danger that we may again be lulled into a false sense of security.</P>
    <P>I discussed this matter with a number of people and I will give examples of how other countries provided for their energy requirements.  For years Sweden was not involved in any type of turf production but they are now investing hundreds of millions of pounds on turf development and production.  They are ensuring that in the event of a further oil shortage they will have native energy upon which to draw.  Canada is actively involved in developing their peat resources even though they have problems with the climate. Norway are also involved in peat production.  This development in other countries shows the correctness of our decisions in regard to peat production.  I understand that Finland produces the same quantity of milled peat and turf as we do.  We could look with benefit at what Finland are doing.  They have a well developed technique in relation to a local district heating system.  Bord na Móna <Col N="1893" /> should be forerunners here of district heating systems.  The way they work it is that they have a boiler house in an area from which pipes circulate around the houses.  This is a reasonably priced heating system and appears to be very successful. The peat is used as a base for it. We should try to develop that system here.  Bord na Móna could provide a large boiler house in some large town and this would be used to circulate heat around the villages and towns.  Perhaps there could be a pilot scheme.  I recommend that Bord na Móna try to develop some of these pilot schemes in, say, three towns.  I understand that the capital expenditure involved would not be excessive and the benefits to be derived would be enormous.  We would be using native fuel and cutting down on imports.  I understand that the ESB have been talking about a similar scheme in Ringsend, Dublin.  Finland have been operating such a scheme which has proved worthwhile and rewarding.  I ask the Minister in consultation with Bord na Móna to try to implement such district heating systems. Finland also utilise peat for process heating in industry.  This provides vast amounts of hot water which is used in boilers and so on.  Such a system represents a reasonably priced, sufficient and clean supply of energy for industry here.</P>
    <P>The Minister spoke about engineering construction and allied industries.  For about 50 years Bord na Móna have been producing machinery at their factory at Derrinlough.  They produce loaders and various types of machines which are used for harrowing, milling and harvesting. While a number of our native firms might be able to produce some of these machines, many of them are imported.  I understand that the machinery produced by Bord na Móna is entirely for their own use except for a very occasional job for the ESB.  Bord na Móna are experimenting with different types of machines and try to convert old type machines into hydraulics etc.  The main material used in this machinery is sheet metal and Bord na Móna process it into the finished product. The work is carried out by the staff of Bord na Móna at their Derrinlough engineering works and in this the company <Col N="1894" /> show initiative, enterprise and skill. I hope the Minister will ensure that every effort is made to expand the work that is taking place there.</P>
    <P>The Minister in conjunction with Bord na Móna, the IDA and CTT should investigate to find out what type of machinery, if any, is being imported which, could be produced by Bord na Móna, and so cut down on imports of machinery.  Millions of pounds are spent here annually on importation of machinery.  If necessary, existing legislation regarding Bord na Móna should be changed to empower them to manufacture the type of machinery that at present is being imported.  This is somewhat different from the original idea of Bord na Móna as a turf-producing company, but since they have shown enterprise and initiative in manufacturing their own machinery they should be given the green light by the Government to increase that production.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish the Minister and Bord na Móna continued success in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill which is to provide extra capital for Bord na Móna.  At the outset I would like to place the history of the Irish turf industry in perspective.  In the early part of the 19th century there was much discussion and there were many divergent opinions about how the boglands of Ireland could best be utilised.  The occupying British Government set up two commissions to inquire into bog utilisation, in 1809 and in 1917.  They made various recommendations which were never implemented. No real progress was made until 1933 when the Fianna Fáil Government through the Department of Industry and Commerce set up a special section to promote the production and sale of hand-won turf through the co-operative society system.  In 1934 the Fianna Fáil Government set up the Turf Development Board who were constituted as a private limited company and financed by means of grants-in-aid from the Department <Col N="1895" /> of Industry and Commerce.  This Turf Development Board made a major contribution to the nation during the war years and they were responsible for the production and distribution of hand-won turf on a large scale basis when imports of fuel products were restricted.</P>
      <P>In 1946 the Turf Development Board were dissolved by the then Fianna Fáil Government who set up in their place a State-sponsored body to be known as Bord na Móna.  I know at first hand the contribution made by Bord na Móna over the years because I live close to a major Bord na Móna development at Attymon in the heart of County Galway and I am proud of the great work being done there by the manager, staff and workers on that bog.  I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute and wish many happy years of retirement to the planning engineer who planned and developed that bog and retired from the head office staff of Bord na Móna last week, Mr. Dermot Power.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna's contribution has been immense through the years.  Over 6,000 people are employed in their activities with a pay-roll in 1983 in excess of £50 million.  Their contribution to the nation through PAYE and PRSI payments is very important to the national Exchequer. Bord na Móna now own over a quarter of a million acres of bogland. They produce peat, fuel for use in the ESB's peat-burning stations, which represents a major saving of millions of pounds to our Exchequer and a huge saving of imports of crude oil and coal. They produce machine turf and briquettes for the domestic market and for general industrial projects.  Here again the saving to the nation is outstanding. The production of moss peat for the domestic market has also been a success and has made a major contribution to our balance of payments over the years.</P>
      <P>I am alarmed and shocked at the Minister's statement this evening.  He stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second factory was proposed for Ballyforan, County Roscommon, and some site work has already been carried out there.  I should add, however, that because of the high level of borrowings <Col N="1896" /> and the need for effective use of capital to ensure a better return to the community, the Minister has initiated a review of all capital investment projects within his area of responsibility, including the Ballyforan briquette factory, to determine whether the projects can be justified on acceptable norms.</P>
    <P>My party initiated and nurtured the idea of a briquette factory at Ballyforan as far back as the mid-seventies.  It was scoffed at by the then Coalition Government, particularly by some of the western representatives. In 1979 the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, sanctioned the project and this was reviewed by the last Coalition Government and put on the long finger until Fianna Fáil came back to Government in February 1982.  Our Government, through the then Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, gave the go ahead for the second time to the construction of the briquette factory at Ballyforan, acknowledging once again the indigenous resource which our bogs are, the necessity to offset our crude oil and coal imports, the necessity to provide jobs at a low cost and the social problems in the western region.</P>
    <P>It appears on the Minister's own admission that the Government are reviewing the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the commencement of the briquette factory.  It is only right to inform the House that Bord na Móna have acquired over 11,000 acres of bog in the Derryfadda-Ballyforan area at a nominal cost.  They have further acquired in the region of 100 acres of arable land adjacent to the bog along the banks of the River Suck for the factory site and ancillary facilities.</P>
    <P>In 1982 under our Minister for Energy the contract for site preparation was awarded and it is now completed.  Bord na Móna have also invested in electrical and telephonic equipment.  Galway County Council have made major improvements to the roads in the area and brought them up to the standards required to cater for the heavy volume of traffic which will be coming to this factory and the county council will continue to develop other roads to the factory as the <Col N="1897" /> need arises.  In December 1982 the orders for the boiler and the turbo-alternator were placed.  The then Minister had planned that the civil engineering contract would go to tender early in 1983. Bord na Móna, confident of their plans and targets, arranged the sod turning ceremony in November 1982 and this was performed by the former Minister for Justice.  Deputy Seán Doherty, a representative of the Roscommon constituency.</P>
    <P>What has happened in the meantime? There was a change of Government and another Coalition reviewed the operations of Bord na Móna, one of the most successful enterprises in the history of the State which has given nigh on 40 years of outstanding service to the nation.  Can the Minister confirm that the consulting engineers for the Ballyforan project recommended during the past month a certain construction firm in the heart of the country for this contract and that Bord na Móna were almost ready to accept this until somebody interfered?  I would ask the Minister to confirm or deny this.</P>
    <P>Why has the Ballyforan briquette factory to be the victim of another review? It was initiated by the then Minister, Deputy O'Malley, in 1979 and reviewed by the Coalition Government in 1981, confirmed by Deputy Reynolds as Minister in 1982 and launched officially by our Government that year.  Are the Minister and the Government aware of the national shortage of peat briquettes?  Are they aware of the high cost of peat briquettes and of our trading imbalance with the North?  Are they further aware of the vast potential demand for peat briquettes in the North?  Are they aware of the serious shortage of turbary plots throughout the country for the harvesting of domestic peat and that the Land Commission cannot accommodate the many people who want to rent turbary plots annually?  The potential of peat briquettes as domestic fuel is enormous. This is due to their quality and size which makes them so easy to handle, transport, store and dispose of.  The large scale availability of briquettes would alleviate the necessity to import alternative energy such as crude oil and coal.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> It is ironic that we are debating the future of another western project this evening.  A week ago it was the Tuam sugar factory, and we all know the Government's attitude to that.  Are the Minister and the Government aware that over 10,000 people are unemployed in County Galway and that over 30,000 are unemployed in the west generally?  Do they want to add to this already growing number?  Do they want to add further misery to this deprived region?  Is the west not entitled to the same investment from any Government as the east and the south?  What about the cost of electrification of the Howth-Bray railway line, said to be about £110 million?  What about the Government subventions to NET, Irish Steel, Verolme dockyard and many others?  We do not object to this funding or any other funding for the security of the nation or the protection of employment but we expect comparable investment in the western region and we are entitled to it.  We consistently got such investment from Fianna Fáil Governments over the years and it looks now as if it will take the next Fianna Fáil Government to complete the briquette factory at Derryfadda-Ballyforan.</P>
    <P>Where tonight is the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Deputy Connaughton?  When a Senator he ridiculed our decision to go ahead with the project and he does not now seem interested in it.  On behalf of the people of east Galway and Roscommon, the Bord na Móna workers at Ballyforan and the unemployed in the area, I want a categoric assurance that the factory will go ahead as planned.  I want to know when construction will start and when the factory will commence production.  If the Minister cannot give this information, then he and the Government are not committed to this project.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate the management, staff and workers of Bord na Móna on their substantial contribution to the economic and social life of the country during the past 40 years. My final appeal is for the black gold of Derryfadda to be used for peat briquette production <i>quam celerimme.</i></P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill, especially in regard to the additional borrowing permissible by Bord na Móna.  Bord na Móna must surely rank among the most successful of our semi-State bodies.  We must look at their operations which have been continually expanding over the years.  During that time Ireland had not the same energy problems and costs that it has today and turf production was not capable of making the same contribution to the national economy.  It is all the more welcome, therefore.  I say to the Minister that in some areas there are bogs which have been developed since 1946 and which are on the brink of being run out, and it must be the objective and the policy of Bord na Móna to seek other bogs and to put to use on them the expertise and the craft of their employees so that the new bogs can play their part in the national economy.</P>
      <P>On a parochial basis, in my constituency there is one Bord na Móna development earmarked to be run down at the end of 1984 because the existing productive bog has come to an end.  However, I would point out that there are about 1,000 acres of undeveloped bog in the immediate vicinity, a substantial portion of which could be acquired for public development.  I hope the knowledge and expertise and staff of Bord na Móna will be utilised to begin development there before the beginning of the 1985 turf cutting season.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new development for private and group use of bogs is to be welcomed.  The two major problems in regard to virgin bog development are drainage and roads. It is useless to expect any group today to face development of virgin bogs without very substantial grant aid, because the magnitude of such a task is daunting otherwise.  Lack of development in this area has been due to lack of incentive because of the high cost of drainage and roadmaking.  Therefore, I am glad that in this legislation such groups and individuals will have technical advice and expertise put at their disposal.  That will <Col N="1900" /> be of tremendous help because the engineering services of Bord na Móna during the years have gathered wonderful information about roadmaking and this should be put at the disposal of co-operative groups and individuals immediately so that bogs will be developed which can make such a great contribution not only to family incomes but to fuel conservation.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the State, road development and drainage of bogs were a priority of the Land Commission, the OPW and the local authorities through the special improvement scheme.  This type of initiative is required again because private individuals will not embark on the provision of supplies of household turf because they cannot afford to embark on it due to the high cost of development.  The Government would be doing a good day's work for the nation if they made bogs properly accessible for private people.</P>
    <P>Another area of development which the Department of Energy should move into is that of bogs which have been acquired for planting by the Department of Forestry.  This has been a disadvantage to people who would be disposed to develop bogs.  I hope that in the future the remaining acreage of virgin bog will be retained for fuel requirements and that further undeveloped bogs will not be acquired for afforestation.  That type of land should never have been planted because such development has denied our people a substantial area of fuel.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to cutaway bogs. Deputy O'Malley made a useful contribution when he suggested they should be retained by Bord na Móna for horticultural and agricultural development.  The nature of the soil in those bogs has proved to be ideal for vegetable production. Bord na Móna have had success in this type of development and they would be an ideal body to move into this area.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and I hope Bord na Móna will continue their tremendous contribution to the Irish economy, that they will continue to expand and develop and that they will contribute also to the development of remaining undeveloped bogs.  Some of the cutaway bogs which <Col N="1901" /> are not suitable for vegetable growing could then be used for planting.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill but, like Deputy O'Malley, I must express grave reservations about what the money from the additional Bord na Móna borrowings will be used for.  We are all proud of the initiative of Bord na Móna and the great contributions they have made in rural areas and to our national economic development through the development of sources of energy on the one hand and the provision of employment on the other.</P>
      <P>However, I am concerned about a project which has given rise to much criticism here today.  I am surprised and concerned about the attitude of the Government, having put this on the shelf again as they did when they were in office previously. I should like to be told what kind of review the Government say they are to carry out in regard to the Ballyforan briquette factory.  Will they tell us clearly what they intend to do?  Is it not their intention to defer the project, not to go ahead with it?  Have they decided that the project is not worthwhile?  This book I have here suggests they are considering the commercial criteria, and the Minister for Industry and Energy has told us that it will have to conform to an acceptable norm.  Who is the person behind this?  Is it the Minister for Finance who went to Roscommon the other night and gave us the first ministerial indication?  I know what &ldquo;commercial criteria&rdquo; means.  Was he speaking with true conviction in Roscommon?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one talks about an acceptable norm, then one must ask: what level of political pressure will be exerted?  Will it be the same as in the case of the Tuam Sugar Factory when they got a lease of life for 12 months?  Incidentally rumour has it strongly around the House &mdash; because of political pressure and the unacceptability to certain Ministers of State and western deputies &mdash; that it is going to get another lease of life for 12 months.  All I would say to the Minister in the few remaining moments I have left is that that is a project that will conform to any criteria of any Government, or any <Col N="1902" /> Minister for Industry and Energy interested in job creation and national economic development.  If they want to apply commercial criteria alone to that project then they are reneging on their responsibility to national development.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that turf is an indigenous fuel and, as has been pointed out already, there is a market for briquettes that cannot be met.  In Deputy O'Malley's time as Minister he had to stop allocations being taken up by Border county merchants who were exporting to the North because they were leaving the market down here extremely under-supplied. The Minister knows as well as I do that there is a growing market for the product not alone here but in the North as well.  Are the Minister and the Government going to deprive this part of the country of that much needed development, of a product readily saleable both at home and for export in an area needing that development on which there has already been spent probably £3 million or £4 million?  Yet, seven months after assuming office, they cannot seem to make up their minds whether or not they should go ahead with it.  Is it not true that the contract for the building of the factory went out to tender, that those tenders had been received before Christmas?  If I am not mistaken it is a contractor in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency who should be extremely worried about whether this project will go ahead.  I do not know what effect it will have on that contractor.  If it is not proceeded with that will also create more indirect unemployment.</P>
    <P>Where is the philosophy of the present Minister for Industry and Energy in relation to development and job creation?  We had a song and dance about the establishment of a national development corporation, that it was to be the answer to all our problems.  If there is any single project that falls into that category of national development surely the Ballyforan project stands out a mile ahead of anything else about which one could dream.  I do not believe the Government have any other single project in view that would fit into that category, that should be developed &mdash; native industry, indigenous <Col N="1903" /> raw materials which can be used to supply a market badly in need of them. There are more jobs to be created directly and indirectly through that project. The Minister for Industry and Energy &mdash; whether he is at present in South Korea, Japan, the Far East or wherever &mdash; and the Minister of State present have had to make many trips prospecting for jobs, and we welcome all the jobs they can bring back.  But we know how little success they have had. There were 40 jobs announced from Japan which we all know were there before he left.  Apart from foreign travel if they sat down at home, did their job, got that project under way, they would create more jobs than they would from all the foreign trips.  I am not blaming the Minister personally for that because the international climate is so difficult.</P>
    <P>That is why it is important that the Government take some action in relation to the home ground, take decisions that have been sadly lacking since they assumed office.  There is a specific example of their ineptitude: they were in Government before for seven months and had an opportunity to examine that project, but they did not do so.  We came back into government and I was given that responsibility.  We went ahead with the project.  I had to take the unpopular decision of rectifying the bad financial position of Bord na Móna that successive Ministers and Governments had allowed happen.  Bord na Móna were not then in a position to service their borrowings. The European Investment Bank were not prepared to finance any more projects for them because they were unable to service their borrowings.  I took that unpopular decision.  As Deputy O'Malley rightly said, it was phased over four stages of price increases spread over a period to bring them back into the position in which they would be able to service their capital development.</P>
    <P>As the House will recall it was back in 1978 that the then Government decided there would be no more State equity or capital grants allocated to Bord na Móna, that they would have to stand on their own feet.  How can one expect a semi-State <Col N="1904" /> body to stand on their own feet if one is not prepared to give them their due entitlement, the market price for their product?  I hold no brief for the ESB trying to buy turf cheaply from Bord na Móna.  They should pay the going rate, whatever may be the value of that turf to them, be it milled peat or whatever.  The ESB should not be crying out in the public arena seeking sympathy, contending that Bord na Móna are charging them, this, that or the other amount for turf. They should pay the equivalent per unit cost of producing electricity.  To my knowledge they are paying no more or less than they should.  Indeed the investigation into electricity costs will bear out that contention quite clearly.  Bord na Móna should not be the Saint Vincent de Paul semi-State body for anybody else. They have a job to do by way of national development.  This Bill will afford them that extra borrowing capacity.  But we are deeply concerned that that project will be shelved yet again.  I do not know the length of time it takes to review a project. I do not know whether it is being reviewed in the Department of Industry and Energy or in the Department of Finance.  I suspect it is in the Department of Finance because most of the talk about it seems to emanate from there.</P>
    <P>Another point I want to make has to do with the attitude of people in the Department of Finance to development. This concerns the other part of the Minister's remarks about private bog development. That scheme was initiated in 1981 by the then Minister for Energy, Deputy George Colley.  It was a very successful scheme, whose outturn last year yielded something like 300,000 tonnes of turf for private consumption and sale, gave employment to over 2,200 people over a five to six months period and saved the National Exchequer £17 million in imports.  That is the type of scheme this country needs, and many more of them.</P>
    <P>When one looks at the budget for 1983, one sees that the provision under the subhead for private bog development was £1 million only this year.  When one recalls that the Estimates were prepared with the Department of <Col N="1905" /> Finance back in October last when the agreed figure was £1,400,000 for private bog development, I might well put on the record of this House &mdash; seeing that a change has been effected &mdash; that the attitude in the Department of Finance to that scheme at that time was to scrap it, get rid of it, finish with it.  If that type of philosophy is allowed to take hold at this stage in our national development, then I contend we are in for a rough time.  A sum of £1,400,000 was the decision taken by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, in my presence and also that of the officials of my Department and those of the Department of Finance.  This Government succumbed to the pressure to take £400,000 from a scheme that provided employment, that provided turf for the country at large and saved the national Exchequer £17 million in imports.  What sort of Ministers are there in this Government who will bend the knee and allow that sort of retrograde action to be taken in relation to national development?  Is it any wonder that the situation gradually worsens day after day, week after week and month after month if that is the sort of thinking obtaining within the corridors of power at present? If it is allowed to obtain much longer, then the figure of 250,000 people unemployed will arrive much sooner than a lot of people seem to think.</P>
    <P>I wanted to make those few points and a couple of others rather quickly.  One has to do with the possible reason for the insertion of section 3 of this Bill, that is the attitude of people in the higher echelons of Bord na Móna to private enterprise development.  I believe probably that is the reason for section 3 of the Bill. I had experience in that Department &mdash; it was referred to already by Deputy O'Malley &mdash; in relation to a private enterprise development in my constituency based at Rathowen, County Westmeath, the name of the company being Midland Peat, where Bord na Móna despised it in spite of the fact that I, as Minister for Industry and Energy, and the chief executive of the IDA had given an undertaking in the course of an industrial promotion trip to Germany that the project would be established.  I gave an undertaking <Col N="1906" /> that those promoters would get 200 acres of bogland.  We are all aware of the attitude of Bord na Móna to that development.  They strenuously objected to the transfer and subdivision by the Land Commission, something they failed to do while I was Minister, but within ten days of my leaving office they served a CPO in the public arena to take back the 200 acres of bogland that had been purchased by the two German brothers who had a captive market for their product in Germany.  Bord na Móna tried the heavy hand to put them out of business.  I tried to raise that matter on many occasions in the House.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank the Minister for Industry and Energy for informing me that, as a result of my interventions and the meeting I set up between those people and the IDA, the matter had been resolved.  They have agreed to exchange 200 acres of bogland with Bord na Móna and the project will now go ahead.  If the Minister does not get an opportunity to reply to me tonight I would be obliged if he would write to me stating how far the development plans for Bord na Móna have progressed in the area around the Ballygarvey bogs and Rathowen bearing in mind that they wanted that 200 acres so badly.  When are we likely to see development? With the amount of money they will be allowed to borrow I hope that project will be high on their priority list, although it was not very high when they tried to stop the two German brothers developing.</P>
    <P>Deputies O'Malley and Kenny referred to Min Fhéir Teoranta.  Here again the attitude of Bord na Móna to a private developer could not be applauded.  When Deputy O'Malley was Minister he offered them the entire bogland area of Min Fhéir Teoranta for development but they did not take it. When I was Minister I again made the offer because, like Deputy O'Malley, I was concerned to see that the jobs of people in that part of Mayo where jobs are scarce would be preserved.  They got the opportunity of getting thousands of acres of bogland for nothing on condition that they would employ the 20 people who were about to lose their jobs.  However, <Col N="1907" /> they declined the invitation, although we know that they are now trying to outbid private developers to the tune of £400,000.  They are willing to pay that amount of money for bogland they could have got for nothing on two occasions. If that is the use the money we are voting on tonight is to be put to I urge the Minister to keep a close eye on the activities of the board.  We need private and public development and one should not interfere with the other.  If a public company is not interested in going ahead and a private company is willing, as happened in the private bog development scheme, it is the Minister's responsibility to see to it that that private company is not interfered with.  It will be interesting to hear the justification for a bid of £400,000 of public money to put private developers out of work.</P>
    <P>The project in Ballyforan is, and will remain, a monument to the inactivity of the Government in regard to development and job creation.  Many jobs can be created at home if we develop what we have rather than spending many months abroad looking for the few jobs that are available on the international market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>In most counties there is a great problem because of the difficulty of gaining access to our bogs to save turf.  In the south west there are many good bogs but because the roads to them were not maintained when turf was not in great demand they are in a bad state of repair.  The Minister should arrange for the transfer of some grants from his Department to county councils to enable them carry out improvement works on those bog roads.  It appears that the only way they can be repaired is under local improvement schemes but it has been the policy of county councils to spend that money on the repair and improvement of accommodation roads to agricultural holdings and on minor drainage schemes. The amount allocated under the scheme by the Department is not sufficient to enable councils to carry out repair work on bog roads.  More money should be allocated by the Department for this work.  Extensive schemes are not necessary <Col N="1908" /> and the majority of road users only require that the roads be made passable for tractors, trailers and trucks.</P>
      <P>Many people are reluctant to cut turf because they cannot bring machinery to the bog and if they cut the turf by hand it is difficult to get it out of the bog by tractor and trailer.  County councils are properly organised to carry out repair work on those roads because they have experienced manpower and the proper machinery.  I agree with the suggestion by other Members that the forestry division of the Department of Fisheries and Forestry should not be permitted to buy up tracts of bogland for planting.  A survey should be carried out of all bogland and every effort made to ensure it is not planted.</P>
      <P>The area of Raecaol in south Kerry is well known in the turf development section of the Department.  A co-op was formed there more than a year ago to develop a major portion of that bog and I am surprised that negotiations have not yet been finalised between the co-op and the Department.  The negotiations should be completed as soon as possible.  It is in the interest of the community and of the campaign to reduce the amount of oil imported that the bog be transferred to the local co-operative in Raecaol.  I implore the Minister to allocate money to the county councils for the repair and improvement of bog roads.  No other organisation has the capacity to carry out that work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £14,322,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose, a Cheann Comhairle, with your permission to debate the Estimates for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation together.</P>
      <P>The sum of £14,322,000 is required to meet the cost of running my Department in 1983.  It includes the salaries of staff at headquarters and at 39 missions and offices around the world.  In all, my Department have about 800 people working in all grades at home and abroad.  Of our 39 offices abroad, 31 are staffed by three diplomatic officers or less.  Most of our embassies are, therefore, quite small.  The average cost to the Vote for Foreign Affairs of a typical small embassy is about £150,000 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proposed Vote also includes travelling <Col N="1911" /> expenses and communications services, which in my Department are understandably high.  A sum is provided for the repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens who get into difficulties abroad.  There is a provision for the cultural and information services which are an important part of the work of my Department.  A sum is also provided for the furtherance of North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation and also for cross-Border studies.  A small provision is included for contributions to bodies in Ireland which exist for the furtherance of international relations.</P>
    <P>The gross Estimate for my Department is £18,972,000 but receipts from passports, consular fees, sales of information booklets and films, repayment of repatriation and maintenance advances, recoupment by the EEC of certain travelling expenses and some other miscellaneous receipts are expected to defray £4,650,000, leaving a net Estimate required of £14,322,000.  This figure represents 0.25 per cent of the total Estimates for the public service.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have this opportunity of addressing the House on the external policy of the Government.  I hope that it may be possible later in the year to have a more lengthy debate on this increasingly important subject.  It is important that we come to an agreement about that when the Dáil resumes after the summer recess.  A debate of one hour and a half on this important Department is not sufficient. I hope to have at least a one-day debate on Foreign Affairs in the autumn.</P>
    <P>My task as Foreign Minister is to defend and promote abroad the interests of Ireland and its people and to that end I need the support of all sides of this House.  In Ireland we have a particular need for our traditional domestic concensus on external policy.  Our small size limits our influence on other countries: without broad agreement here at home on foreign policy, our ability to shape our external environment would be very slight indeed.  Serious divisions on foreign policy would be particularly damaging to Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are a country whose continued <Col N="1912" /> existence as a member of the developed world depends on external trade, to a greater extent than in the case of any of our neighbours.  In 1983, for example, more than half of our gross domestic product, 55 per cent, came from exports. Moreover, our further development depends not only on trade, but on a continuing inward flow of foreign investment, so that the productive potential of our people will not be frustrated by lack of capital.</P>
    <P>The efforts of our diplomatic missions overseas are increasingly directed to the promotion of exports and the attraction of foreign investment.  Diplomatic offices have a special role in relation to trade and investment in those areas of the world such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East where either State-to-State dealings are the rule or where the presence of a diplomatic mission is essential for doing business.</P>
    <P>Wherever they are located, our diplomatic missions provide a network through which the capabilities of Irish firms and organisations can be made known.  My Department work closely with other Departments, with Córas Tráchtála, the IDA and other semi-State bodies and with firms and individuals to help ensure that the total Irish external economic effort is successful.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned, many countries in the Middle East and all in Eastern Europe conduct trade more or less exclusively through State organisations. A State-to-State bilateral co-operation agreement is virtually a precondition for the satisfactory development of trade with such countries.  In recent years my Department have negotiated such inter-governmental agreements or similar arrangements with the Soviet Union, Poland, Iraq and Libya.  These provide for the establishment of joint commissions which meet annually to review progress and to examine ways in which co-operation can be improved.</P>
    <P>The general international political environment is of great importance to us. It is self-evident that in today's world not only our national prosperity but our survival as a national depends on peace, on peace in the world in general, but above <Col N="1913" /> all, in Europe and the surrounding area. Equally, it is evident that in Europe today peace depends on a stable equilibrium of forces between the two military alliances on our continent, or, to be more precise, on a mutual perception by the leaders of those two alliances that such a stable equilibrium exists.  A climate of minimal trust, predictability and understanding between the Soviet Union and the United States is, therefore, of fundamental importance to us all.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the best index of the state of health of the relationship between the two superpowers is their ability to discuss in meaningful and practical terms the control and reduction of armaments and particularly of nuclear weapons.  It is difficult in present circumstances to see the emergence of any early alternative to the present armed equilibrium.  What one can hope for is that the apparently inexorable growth in the size of overall forces will be halted and indeed reversed.  If this is to be achieved it is obvious that the means must be found for clear and adequate verification at each stage of the disarmament process that agreed reductions have been carried out.</P>
    <P>Even if progress in disarmament is dishearteningly slow, and if at times one is left with the impression that what is occurring is regression rather than progress, it is crucial that the effort should continue.  Ireland, therefore, attaches great importance to the two major sets of arms control negotiations now taking place at Geneva between the Soviet Union and the United States on strategic or intercontinental nuclear forces (START) and on intermediate nuclear forces (INF).  All the states of Europe, whether allied in military alliances or, like ourselves, outside all such alliances, have a vital stake in the success of these negotiations.</P>
    <P>In this connection no one should be in any doubt that this Government will maintain our military neutrality and will take no action which would be incompatible with it.  There is language in the recently-signed Solemn Declaration on European Union which envisages the &ldquo;co-ordination of the positions of member <Col N="1914" /> states on the political and economic aspects of security&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is important that it be clearly understood what is involved here.  The discussions on the political and economic aspects of security which take place with our partners in the Ten are conducted within the framework of European political co-operation, in which no decision can be taken other than unanimously. We have, therefore, in effect a veto at all stages of the discussion and on any conclusions arrived at.  As the Taoiseach explained to the House after the recent European Council, what is essentially involved is an attempt to arrive at a common approach among the Ten on security-related matters which are discussed or negotiated in fora in which all ten member states participate &mdash; for instance, disarmament and arms control deliberations at the United Nations or the negotiations at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE).  There is no question of any discussion of operational military questions.</P>
    <P>Our policy of military neutrality is, like all other aspects of our foreign policy, all the stronger because it is shared by an overwhelming majority in this House.  I am sorry that doubts have been expressed recently about the Government's commitment to that policy.  Neutrality is a subject which touches on the fundamental questions of peace and war.  It is, therefore, natural that it should arouse deep concern.  It relates also to areas of great complexity in the external world, and it is not surprising that periodically, a reassertion and clarification of basic concepts becomes necessary.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that this House would advocate neutralism or neutrality independently of the reasons for that neutrality. I should like to try to state as simply as possible what I conceive to be, and to have been from the beginning of this State's existence, the essence of its policy of military neutrality.</P>
    <P>There is no mystery about it.  We are talking about the field of national security, that is, of physical safety for our people in time of war.  We look at the world around us and we ask ourselves <Col N="1915" /> whether joining a military alliance would increase our security, would reduce it, or would leave it unchanged.  We find ourselves closer to the members of one alliance than to those of the other, both in ideological terms and in terms of economic and political links.  We find, as I said earlier, that in present conditions the balance between the two alliances is an essential element of world peace and, therefore, of our security.  We find no reason to believe that our membership or non-membership of the Atlantic Alliance makes, or will make in the foreseeable future, any crucial difference to the overall security of the region in which we live. We do find, however, that non-membership enables us to play a modest but constructive diplomatic role as a neutral country.</P>
    <P>Looking at the world as it is, I see no sign in the foreseeable future of any change in conditions which would require us in the interests of our people's safety or national security to re-examine that policy.</P>
    <P>A responsible foreign policy must be pursued within a framework of respect for international law and morality.  The oppression of human beings, whether individually or as nations, and the failure or refusal to grant them those things, whether food, freedom or hope for the future, to which they have a basic right, must claim the attention of those responsible for the external policy of any state, That claim is independent of the geographical location, race or religion of the oppressed or deprived and of the identity of any oppressor.  This Government will not shrink from identifying and from seeking to help redress instances of deprivation or abuse of human rights, whether these occur in Afghanistan, in South Africa, in Central America or elsewhere.</P>
    <P>There are elementary human rights &mdash; the right to the basic necessities of life, to food, shelter and clothing &mdash; which are still denied to many millions of people, often as much because of force of circumstances and history as of any selfishness or bad will on the part of their fellows. Fortunately, this is one area in which we <Col N="1916" /> as a country can make a positive and practical contribution, and we have in recent years become increasingly involved in the international efforts aimed at promoting the development of the Third World.</P>
    <P>We shall continue to work through the international organisations of which we are members for the development of new policies which reflect the needs and wishes of all countries and which provide a greater measure of equity and justice in the distribution of economic resources.</P>
    <P>On the bilateral level we shall continue the programme of aid to developing countries which we have built up over the last decade and which gives expression to our determination to contribute to the development of the Third World, however limited our contribution may be in absolute terms.  The Minister of State at my Department, who has a special responsibility for our Overseas Development Assistance, will deal in more detail with this area of policy later in the debate.</P>
    <P>The mutual economic and political interests which bind us to other countries and regions naturally tend to be deeper, more far reaching and more complex the nearer those countries or regions are to our own.  Our nearest neighbour is Great Britain, to which we are bound by uniquely close ties of people, language, history and culture, and with whom we share the tragic problems of the Northern part of our country.  Not least among the benefits which a solution to those problems would bring is a final resolution of the last vestiges of the ages-old Anglo-Irish quarrel and a definitive understanding between two peoples who have lived for so long in such close intimacy, but always with some shadow, greater or lesser, of mutual misunderstanding and unease.  I shall return to this subject later.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the quality of our ties with the United States of America places that country in the first rank of our overseas friends.  America is home from home for many of our people and to many of the people of that country Ireland is also a home from home.  We can be thankful that there are few, if any, bilateral problems of any magnitude <Col N="1917" /> between our two countries.  This was clear from the discussions which we had with Vice-President Bush, whom we had the pleasure of welcoming to our country earlier this week.  Whatever difficulties in the trade field there are between the US and the EEC can be overcome by open and frank negotiations between friends.</P>
    <P>Over ten years ago we bound ourselves by the strong institutional links of the European Economic Community to our European neighbours, inspired with the ideal of political and economic union between countries which shared a common cultural heritage and a multitude of common political and economic interests. We foresaw a deepening of the union between our peoples and foresaw as the fruit of that union a greater mutual understanding and knowledge among the countries of Western Europe and some levelling of the differences in economic development between them.</P>
    <P>The reality, however, is that in the past ten years there has been no significant bridging of the gap between the central regions of the Community and the less prosperous areas, such as Ireland.  I can only express disappointment at this lack of development, despite &mdash; and let us be fair here &mdash; the considerable advantages that have come to us from Community membership.  That said, however, I believe that the agreement at Stuttgart for a very specific and urgent set of negotiations on the prime economic questions facing the Community at the moment gives a basis of hope for the future.</P>
    <P>Over the coming six months we shall be involved in the most intense and far-reaching negotiations that any Irish Government have faced since our accession. The issues at stake in these negotiations, which concern the very nature of the Community as we know it and its future direction, have major implications for us.  Successive Governments over the last three years have, of course, had to face similarly tough situations. The difference on this occasion, however, is that the Community is fast running out of financial resources and that in consequence that European achievement of which I spoke some weeks ago to the European Association of Journalists is <Col N="1918" /> today in danger.  That danger threatens the basic structures of the Community and its policies, prominent among them the Common Agricultural Policy.  We should all be fully aware of these realities.</P>
    <P>In recent years the Community has been stumbling from one crisis to another.  We need in Europe to take quickly the necessary decisions to recreate a sense of direction and a new momentum in the Community.  We must in particular come to an early agreement on the provision of new financial resources for the Community so as to ensure the maintenance of existing policies and the development of new ones, which is the only way to make the Community once again relevant and responsive to its peoples.  I shall ensure that we play a full, forceful and positive part at all stages of the forthcoming negotiations, as we have already done in the preparation of their terms of reference. Here again the tradition of consensus on external policy is of vital importance &mdash; our hand as negotiators is immeasurably strengthened by our partners' knowledge that there is a consensus among the political parties here on the basic interests which we defend.</P>
    <P>The search for common positions in matters of foreign policy within the framework of European Political Co-operation (EPC) has recently become more wide-ranging and intense.  This is a welcome development, but in my view the various aspects of European progress are indivisible.  It will be the Government's endeavour to ensure that European integration proceeds in a balanced way, the political integration and co-ordination are paralleled by a convergence of the economies of the member states. This economic convergence can be assisted by the co-ordination of the economic policies of the various Community countries, as well as through the Community's Regional and Social Funds.  But we are an agricultural country and there is no question but that in our case convergence can have little meaning unless it is associated with continued effective operation of the Common Agricultural Policy within the basic principles laid down by the Treaties.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> Looking beyond Western Europe, which includes &mdash; apart from Spain and Portugal, soon to become part of our EEC family &mdash; several neutral states with whom our relations are warm and mutually beneficial, we come to the other half of our tragically divided continent: Eastern Europe and the USSR.  These countries, too, share in our common cultural heritage of European civilization and it is a tragedy that human contact between the two halves of our continent has been reduced by political and ideological differences to a level far below what the bonds between our peoples would in normal circumstances bring about.</P>
    <P>Historical faults on both sides have contributed to the present level of tension in East-West relations within Europe.  On the one hand there was perhaps less than sufficient understanding in the West of the Soviet Revolution in its early years and occasionally of certain aspects of the Soviet Union's sensitivities in relation to its security in more recent times.  On the other hand the Soviet Union cannot but be aware of the deep mistrust and even fear which are generated in Western countries by the combination of massive military power with a doctrine of the inevitability of conflict between social systems and of the ultimate triumph everywhere of the Soviet model of society. I believe that the Soviet Union could only benefit from a loosening of the constraints on human contacts between East and West.  I do not believe that greater human contact would damage the national security of the USSR and I look forward to the day when the cultural unity of Europe, which has continued in spite of all barriers, will again be permitted a full self-expression.</P>
    <P>These thoughts are particularly apposite as we look at the situation of Poland, a country with which we in Ireland have so much in common in the shape of Christian and European heritage.  I cannot believe that it is beyond the powers of any of the authorities concerned to devise a <i>modus vivendi</i> for Poland which will reconcile the Christian and European vocation of that great country with the <Col N="1920" /> essentials of the socialist system and with the security interests of the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Outside of Europe, North America and those countries which are historically and ethnically offshoots of Europe, no part of the world is closer to us in terms of geography or of political and trading links than those countries which together make up the Arab nation.  It would be foolish to attempt to deny that part of the importance to us of that region derives from its vast reserves of oil, but the links between the Arab world and Europe are older and deeper than any forged by a 20th century oil crisis.  Our diplomatic efforts, through European Political Co-operation and at the UN, have in recent times of necessity focussed upon the urgent question of the rights of the Palestinian people.  Along with our partners in the Ten, we accept the right of that people to self-determination with all that that implies.</P>
    <P>The creation of a Palestinian homeland, a state &mdash; the precise model is a matter for negotiation and for the Palestinians themselves &mdash; is an essential element of a solution that would be just and lasting.</P>
    <P>The other central principle on which Ireland and the Ten operate is the right of the State of Israel to a secure and peaceful existence behind borders recognised by its Arab neighbours.  But Israel's rights do not extend to the implantation of settler colonies in the West Bank and Gaza.  These are a major and growing obstacle to peace efforts.</P>
    <P>In the immediate future progress depends on the success of the efforts to have all foreign forces removed from Lebanon and to restore to that long-suffering country its independence and territorial integrity.  The recent signing, with considerable assistance from the US, of a troop withdrawal agreement between Israel and Lebanon is a step in that direction. I hope that it will be followed by others.</P>
    <P>Ireland has had close links with Africa, through missionary endeavour and otherwise, for many years.  The situation in Southern Africa at present gives rise to great concern.</P>
    <P>South Africa's continued intransigence <Col N="1921" /> has blocked progress in efforts to bring about a negotiated independence settlement for Namibia in accordance with the United Nations Plan.  I hope that, as a result of the efforts of the UN Secretary-General, agreement on arrangements for a ceasefire and the emplacement of the United Nations Transition Assistance Group will be achieved.  The Government remain willing to provide a contingent of gardaí for service with the group, as well as military observers and support personnel, if requested by the Secretary-General.</P>
    <P>In South Africa itself there are no signs of any serious efforts by the Government to dismantle the odious system of apartheid. As a result there is increasing frustration and anger on the part of the black majority and, if the pressures for change are not heeded, an explosive political situation seems inevitable.  Moreover, South Africa's destabilising activities in neighbouring states may well cause a major conflict on a wider scale with unforeseeable consequences for all concerned.</P>
    <P>The Government will continue to work at the United Nations, for the adoption of further mandatory sanctions against South Africa, such as an oil embargo, a ban on new direct investment and a strengthening of the arms embargo.  We will also continue to urge, in the framework of European Political Co-operation, that the European Community should use its economic weight to persuade South Africa to abandon apartheid.</P>
    <P>The United Nations, on whose Security Council Ireland has just completed a two-year term, has always had a special place in Irish foreign policy.  This is because of its universal membership and its role in settling disputes between nations and in helping to create an international atmosphere which reduces the likelihood of such disputes arising.  The Government support the present efforts of the UN Secretary General to revitalize the United Nations.  I was very glad to have the opportunity to discuss these efforts with Sr. Perez de Cuellar when he visited Ireland last April.  Participation in UN peacekeeping forces is one of the <Col N="1922" /> chief ways in which we in Ireland give practical expression to our commitment to international peace and security.  Our main involvement in UN peacekeeping at the moment is in UNIFIL.  In the present period of uncertainty we are following closely the developments affecting the future of that force.</P>
    <P>I have spoken of the tradition of consensus in our foreign policy and of the need, which is indeed growing, for a united front by the parties in Dáil Éireann in the external world.  I will do what I can to sustain and promote this Irish solidarity.  This Government will not seek ephemeral political credit from the promotion of the Irish interest abroad.  I look forward to hearing in this short debate and later, both inside the outside the Dáil, the contributions of all sides, and I will take them seriously into account in devising a common Irish approach to our international problems. In this one domain let us adopt as our guiding principle an old Irish saying: &ldquo;Ar scáth a chéile 'sea mhaireann na daoine&rdquo;. In no area of policy is this standard more vital than in Anglo-Irish relations.</P>
    <P>The three main parties in Dáil Éireann together with the SDLP are now participating vigorously in the New Ireland Forum.  None of us should anticipate the results of the deliberations of the Forum other than to hope that they will indeed achieve our common objective, which is the promotion of peace and stability in our island.  Policy on Northern Ireland and on Anglo-Irish relations should not be a matter of competition or dispute between parties in this House.  I hope that a major benefit of the Forum will be to reinforce that principle in practice and I would like to use this occasion to express appreciation of the attitude taken by the other parties in the Forum to its work so far.  The task ahead of the Forum is enormous but the challenge which faces us all is far greater.  The price of failure could be, as the Taoiseach has said, &ldquo;to make a bad and dangerous situation worse; it is a price that would be calculated in human lives and in ever deeper misery and despair&rdquo;.  On the other hand the prize of success, the fruit of successfully confronting the reality of Northern <Col N="1923" /> Ireland, would be to construct for the first time the basis for a real dialogue on this island.</P>
    <P>The work of the Forum is of fundamental importance.  It cannot however delay the work of developing Anglo-Irish relations and reconciling the Irish traditions. The Government are actively engaged in galvanising the Anglo-Irish process at several levels, including preparation for the Anglo-Irish Summit later this year.  Our objects is indeed to ensure that both Governments and both sides of the community in Northern Ireland will be in a position to give full and reflective consideration to the results of the New Ireland Forum in due course.</P>
    <P>My Department are engaged more intensively, I believe, than at any time before in expanding our range of contacts in Northern Ireland.  Since becoming Minister I myself have visited the North and I intend to continue to visit regularly.  We are working to ensure that the British Government and British politicians on all sides realise the dangers which lie in inaction, neglect and an excessive timidity of approach.  We are also engaged, both in the United States and in the other capitals of the European Community, in sustained attempts to reinforce an awareness of the seriousness of the situation we all face on this island.</P>
    <P>The area of foreign policy and, most of all, of Anglo-Irish policy is not the place for partisan politics.  The difference between politics and diplomacy was once defined as that between winning the argument and winning the result.  It is the common effort of all parties here in Dáil Éireann which will ensure that we win the result, to the advantage of all our people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to congratulate the Minister on his appointment and to wish him every success.  He will be glad to know that I do not propose to oppose this Estimate.  If I did, and if it were carried, there would be a lot of disappointed people in many parts of the world who might not receive their just entitlements at the end of the month.  I <Col N="1924" /> am delighted that we are having the opportunity to have this debate because since the Minister has been in office from 14 December last, seven months, we did not have an opportunity to have any parliamentary questions dealing with the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That is regrettable.  I apologise for not being here to put down some questions.</P>
      <P>I am very glad of the Minister's suggestion that perhaps during the next session we will have a limited debate, for whatever time can be agreed and whatever time the Minister thinks fit, on the work of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  That is very important because there are a number of aspects we would like to talk about.  I know from my party, and I am sure the Minister and others know from their parties, that there are quite a number of Deputies who would like to participate in this debate, who would have a lot to offer, but who are disappointed this evening because they will not have the opportunity since we have only very little time at our disposal.</P>
      <P>I welcome having regular debates on the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Two weeks ago when the Minister of State, Deputy J. O'Keeffe, was here deputising for the Minister he made the same suggestion. I hope there will be agreement all round in relation to that because we would all benefit from it and, more importantly, the people we represent would also benefit from it.</P>
      <P>I would like to place on record my very great respect, admiration and appreciation of the people involved in the Minister's Department and the people involved in the diplomatic service.  There is no doubt in my mind, and I am sure in the minds of all of us present, that those who represent us abroad are doing a magnificent job.  It would be very unfair of us if we singled out one or two people for mention but it would also be very wrong if we did not, because some people abroad representing Ireland at all levels carry a far greater load than others and at times they have a more difficult role to fulfil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe anybody in the diplomatic service would take me to task if I mentioned the very great service being <Col N="1925" /> rendered to the nation by Ambassador Noel Dorr at the United Nations, particularly during the two-year period of our membership of the Security Council.  The man did an excellent job and we are all very proud of him.  He was an extremely well thought of member of the Security Council and he was very highly regarded. Last September, when I had the privilege of being at the United Nations as Minister for Foreign Affairs, I was amazed at the number of ambassadors from different countries who congratulated me &mdash; as if I were responsible for it &mdash; on the wonderful performance given consistently by our ambassador in the Security Council on the many issues which came before them, always at very short notice.  I wish him every success.  I would like to mention two other ambassadors.  The danger is that one can fall into this trap so that when one names one person one has to name perhaps a second one and perhaps a third one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is easier for me than the Minister because he has responsibility and I have not.  In fairness to those who put in tremendous effort on behalf of Ireland and the Irish people I feel that our Ambassador to the European Economic Community has probably one of the hardest jobs any ambassador has in the service.  I want to place on record my appreciation of the very great performance given consistently by the present Ambassador and by his predecessor in Brussels in dealing with EEC matters.  I wish him every success because it is vital for us as a nation that we be represented by top-class people.  There is a wonderful back-up team in the service in Brussels. It is one of our largest missions, with a staff of possibly 90 there.  They are doing a great job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would, finally, like to mention our Ambassador in London, Mr. Eamon Kennedy, who is doing a tremendous job during a very difficult period.  He has given a very creditable performance in a very difficult situation during a period when our relations with our nearest <Col N="1926" /> neighbour have not been as smooth as we would like them to be.  I had better draw the line there or, as the Minister says, I might get myself into very deep water and I would not like to do that.</P>
    <P>We have a very elaborate foreign service.  I ask this question without any reflection on the Minister or anybody in the service.  Are we making the best use of our resources?  If I were longer in my job as Minister for Foreign Affairs perhaps I would have asked that question.  It does not do any harm to ask if we are making the best use of our resources, if we are involved in areas we should be and if we have stronger and greater links between the diplomatic staff in our embassies and the representatives of other State agencies in the particular countries, particularly in the United States.  I am thinking of State agencies such as the Industrial Development Authority, Córas Tráchtála, the tourist board and others which play an exceptionally important role and the success of whose efforts we all enjoy through the community at large.  I feel there is room for improvement there.  I have no doubt the Minister will look at this.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not think that it is my intention to score a political point off him, but I know that times are rough, money is scarce and during a recession and particularly during a time of cutbacks, the foreign service is probably not regarded as it should be by the Minister's colleagues at discussions when there is talk about savings.  The Minister has a very grave responsibility, to prevent other Departments taking some of what he has, because what he has is so very necessary.</P>
    <P>The decision was made by a former Government to close our office in Teheran. I will give the Minister every help to ensure that offices such as those in Teheran are maintained.  It was much more difficult for me after the change in Government in March last year to get a Government to rescind a decision made by a previous Government to reopen that office, so perhaps I have a vested interest there.</P>
    <P>Europe has had a major share of our investment in diplomatic manpower and <Col N="1927" /> it is time to stand back and appraise the situation.  There are five or six areas which merit input: the European Economic Community, Anglo-Irish relations, our relations with North America and the rest of the developed world, our relations with Eastern Europe and the Arab nations, our relations with the developing world and our role with the United Nations.  There is a danger that, like all diplomatic services, they are insufficiently rooted in the views and interests of the home base.  The right balance must be struck between defending and promoting Irish views and interests internationally and matching them with the preoccupations of other countries.</P>
    <P>Last year when we were in office we were very firm on the question of nuclear disarmament.  We made a number of forthright statements on this.  I would be happier if the Taoiseach were more positive in taking a stand on the nuclear arms race.  I would have welcomed news that the Taoiseach had had discussions on this with Vice-President Bush.  I only know that when I saw Vice-President Bush being questioned on this issue, the question of missiles had not been raised and he said that he guessed the Taoiseach understood their position.  I would like to think that it would be an important matter to have raised.  I have not seen any statement from the Taoiseach on this question or on any issues that were discussed with Vice-President Bush but perhaps we will have one before long.</P>
    <P>I suppose, like all Foreign Ministers and ex-Foreign Ministers, I have had the experience of attending meetings with heads of State.  It is always interesting to return to one's own Parliament and hear statements on those meetings by the Taoiseach of the day and by leaders of the other parties.  I do not share the optimism expressed by the Taoiseach following the Stuttgart meeting and I cannot see any grounds for his enthusiasm. There was no evidence of the British Prime Minister having changed her spots or that she will cease to obstruct the proper development of the European Community.  The use of the word &ldquo;summit&rdquo;<Col N="1928" /> in the sense of a conference between two or more heads of Government is something that has come since World War II.  I was never very good at climbing mountains but for mountaineers the summit has always been the peak of their achievement, something that they were proud to achieve with physical effort and much sweat.  Perhaps for our world leaders today there is a sense of achievement not because of the results of their deliberations but because they have managed to get together at all.</P>
    <P>In the past month we have had two summits, one at Williamsburg in the US and one at Stuttgart and both have been described by the media as a qualified success.  They have been an unqualified disaster for this country, for our economy and for agriculture.  At Williamsburg the leading industrial nations of the world met with President Reagan to try to resolve the current recession, to help cut unemployment and reduce interest rates. Mr. Gaston Thorn was there as President of the Commission representing smaller countries of the Community including Ireland.  These world leaders achieved nothing that would help this country.  Mr. Reagan merely promised to look at ways to reduce interest rates and cut the American deficit.  Both things have upset the money markets and weakened the Irish púnt in international trade.  Because we lack our own raw materials our manufacturing industry depends on our importing the basics.  A weak Irish púnt means that we have to pay more.  Our inflation rate adds to the cost of production and we are pricing ourselves out of the market.  This does not take into account the rising cost of diesel, petrol and electricity &mdash; the motive power of our industry.  Far more serious for agriculture was Mr. Reagan's refusal to stop the export of surplus American farm produce at heavily subsidised prices to what have been the traditional Community markets.  This attitude is from an administration which constantly complains about the rebates granted by the Community to our exporters to help them to meet world prices.  If this summit was a qualified success, I fail to see why.</P>
    <P>At Stuttgart we were represented by <Col N="1929" /> the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This was described as the most important summit of them all, designed to find ways of avoiding the apparent imminent bankruptcy of the EEC.  Mrs. Thatcher, the British Prime Minister, flushed with her success in the general election, was there too and she held up all progress until she got what she calls &ldquo;her money&rdquo;.  That phrase was first used in Dublin Castle about four years ago when we last held the Presidency of the Community and has been used ever since.  In the event Mrs. Thatcher received 540 million Irish púnts but she still has to clear the hurdle of the European Parliament.  If that assembly refuses to sanction this refund she will not get it. The trouble is that in that event she will insist even more strongly that the agricultural policy should be reformed so that there will have to be less money and she will be more strongly opposed to any plan to increase the Community's resources.</P>
    <P>Is it really her money?  I fail to see that it is.  If member states had to make a contribution to the budget in accordance with their GNP, as used to be the case, then Mrs. Thatcher might have a right to claim that the money is her Government's. What the British Government transfers to the Community is actually the Community's resources, a common customs tariff on imports from third countries, levies on agriculture and the first 1 per cent of any VAT rate imposed &mdash; all of which Britain agreed to transfer since she signed the Accession Treaty with Ireland and Denmark.  If Mrs. Thatcher wants to reduce her contribution to the Community all she has to do is increase her trade with the Community, the largest free trade area in the world, instead of giving preference to imports from her one time commonwealth to the detriment of her Community partners, including Ireland.  What this rebate means is that other member states have to make up the £540 million. It is encouraging to hear the Taoiseach say that Ireland's share of the extra payments should be abated, but it is no more than that.  In return for this at this summit meeting Mrs. Thatcher proposed that the Council of Ministers should decide on <Col N="1930" /> what measures should be introduced to improve Community finances and offer guidelines.  These guidelines include an indication of agricultural policy in order to see what savings can be made in the Agricultural Fund.  One must put the best face on things.  The Taoiseach should tell the Dáil under pressure from us that these guidelines have been softened.  I am afraid that there is no indication whatsoever that farmers will be able to get increases in line with inflation, except that limitations in spending and the introduction of a super levy in milk production have been deleted.  Nothing was said about the existing levy which for so long has been a millstone around the necks of our dairy farmers.  Rather than increase the VAT contributions, the summit wants the resources to be increased by savings.  If not from the CAP, from where are these savings to be made?  I suppose they are to be made from the Regional Fund, which is far too small to help resolve disparities between the richer and poorer regions of the Community.  Are they to be from the Social Fund which helps finance programmes to alleviate unemployment, gives grants for training, to help the disabled and to help school leavers?  Does it mean that Community policies which are already in the pipeline are to be put on the long finger because there will be no funds there to finance them?  The Taoiseach told us &mdash; I hope I am quoting him correctly &mdash; that that does not mean that any proposals were to be excluded.  We should not forget that other member states have as much right to exercise their veto as Ireland has.  We will have a very difficult job to protect our interests and we should be aware of this and ready for it.  A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, have I a time restriction?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent visit of the Pope to Poland shows the tremendous vitality and resilience of the Polish people even under the most adverse circumstances. Our duty is to give every form of moral support to the Polish people without interfering in their internal affairs or inciting them to actions not in their interest.</P>
      <P>There have been signs in recent weeks that the Russians may be seeking a genuine formula which would enable them to withdraw from Afghanistan.  Every encouragement should be given to such a decision in an unprovocative manner. The withdrawal of the Soviet Army from Afghanistan would make an important contribution to the survival of detente.  I believe it is three years last Christmas Eve that the invasion of Afghanistan took place.  I know from experience of the Foreign Ministers' meetings that there was a certain reluctance to continue to mention Afghanistan in the communiques after meetings because we felt that we were talking about it continually, but we must continue talking about it and we must encourage the occupation forces there and those responsible for them to move out.</P>
      <P>The Minister dealt with the Middle East in his brief and I agree wholeheartedly with everything he said.  We all long for peace in the Middle East and for the right of people there to live in peace and harmony, firstly in their own countries and secondly with neighbouring countries. We welcome every effort to get all foreign troops out of the Lebanon and we would like to see the rights of the Palestinians honoured and respected.  We wish to see the rights of the Israelis respected also.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of Central America, we are very unhappy about the situation there.  The conflicts in EI Salvador and Nicaragua show no sign of easing and genuine freedom may not be on offer <Col N="1932" /> from either side.  The US, the most powerful state in the region, are increasingly involved.  There is a special onus and responsibility to encourage an end to the civil wars there and to the slaughter of civilians and assist in the building up of acceptable political structures.  Human rights considerations must enter into the balance along with <i>Realpolitik.</i></P>
    <P>The debt problems of the developing world still present great difficulties. Western governments and banking systems must continue to find solutions which do not place unbearable burdens on certain developing countries which keep alive international trade.</P>
    <P>A new escalation of the nuclear arms race appears imminent.  Here Ireland has a duty to speak out.  We accept the fact that the Warsaw Pact forces facing Europe should be reduced but we are not convinced that the siting of new missiles in Europe will make any positive contribution to security, rather the opposite. Responsible international statesmen such as ex-Chancellor Schmidt have now said that they do not regard the deployment of a new generation of missiles in Europe as necessary.  We believe that such deployment will only aggravate Soviet intentions but at the same time peace groups should have the same freedom to demonstrate against the nuclear arms race in eastern Europe as they have in western Europe.  I deplore the harassment of peace groups by state authorities in both parts of Europe and they are not breaking the law.  The peace groups must be realistic and they should ensure that their demands are not directed exclusively at western governments but that they make the same demands on the Soviet Union and their allies as they do on the NATO alliance.  Subject to that qualification, we support their aims.  It would be difficult to find a state in western Europe that devotes less to military spending and has a smaller arms industry than Ireland.</P>
    <P>Neutral countries are often spoken of with contempt, but they have the crucial and honourable role of preserving some balance and sanity in a dangerous world. That is why I resented the remarks of the British Defence Secretary, Mr. Heseltine, <Col N="1933" /> when he brushed aside Ireland's neutrality.  I would like to know from the Minister whether he made it clear to the British Government that he rejected the views of Mr. Heseltine and if he received any apology.  The British Government certainly would not dare to make such statements about Swedish or Swiss neutrality. Why then should we have to put up with such impertinence?  The Vice-President of the US, Mr. Bush, spoke in much more positive terms about Ireland as a friendly neutral country and he declined pointedly to endorse Mr. Heseltine's offensive remarks.</P>
    <P>People often point out alleged inconsistencies and the alleged lack of credibility of our policy on neutrality, but they fail to point out that a similar debate about defence is going on in every democratic country.  Is there any such thing as a fully consistent and credible defence policy in the nuclear age?  People will recall in the recent British general election the perceptive and logical criticism made by Mr. Enoch Powell about the British independent nuclear deterrent.  A very similar debate is now going on in France about the strategic and nuclear force which is being described as providing the illusory security of a new Maginot Line.  It is difficult to think of a subject which has caused more continuous debate in the US over the past few years. The insufficiency of our neutrality in a nuclear world is a fact, but it is an insufficiency common to all defence policies including NATO ones and it is no argument for abandoning our policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>With regard to overseas development co-operation, overseas development assistance is important as a measure of our solidarity with the people in the developing world.  Like most of our wealthier partners, we must admit honestly that we do not do half enough and one of the problems in winning support for overseas aid is the feeling that it is only a drop in the ocean and also that it is hard in many instances to bring home to people its effectiveness.  The Minister, the Minister of State and the Government are to be commended for providing an extra £3 million for overseas aid.  I <Col N="1934" /> hope that they will take the trouble and find the energy to explain to the people, perhaps by visual means or with the help of RTE, what Ireland can do to help out as it is doing at present.  One must always pay tribute to the sterling work of voluntary organisations and thank them for what they are doing.  Injustice, poverty and gross inequality should be combated wherever they are found, but we must be careful not to equate them with one particular social or political system.</P>
    <P>There is not the slightest evidence that the sum of human happiness is any greater in Mozambique or Angola than in Nigeria or Zaire, that Viet Nam or Cambodia are happier places under communist rule than they were under the previous regimes or that Cuba is any happier than many of its Latin American neighbours.  Disregard for human rights and the exploitation of labour and foreign domination are evils that occur just as readily under communist regimes as under capitalist ones.  We must support the work of the relief agencies not only morally and financially but also at political level.</P>
    <P>I now refer to aspects of our relations with Britain which we have not had an opportunity to raise until now.  We are concerned at the repeated incursions into Irish territorial waters by British naval vessels in Carlingford Lough and the harassment of Irish boats.  Following one such incident last summer we stepped up our patrols in the area and I should like to know what representations have been made to the British to prevent the recurrence of such incidents and to make it clear that we resent such intrusions. There are a number of security issues which must be raised at an early stage with the British authorities and these are issues which, while they are unresolved, do nothing to contribute to a better atmosphere in the North.</P>
    <P>I might mention briefly the use of plastic bullets in the North.  This is unacceptable and the matter should now be actively taken up with the British Government.  There are statistics to show that the scale of deaths and injuries arising from their use since 1972 has been horrific.  Since that year 14 people have <Col N="1935" /> been killed by either rubber or plastic bullets, quite a high percentage of whom were children between the ages of ten and 15.  There have been hundreds of injuries including blindness and brain damage.  A report published in the <i>British Journal of Surgeons</i> in 1975 based on the examination of 90 Belfast victims of rubber bullets between 1970 and 1972 listed one death, two cases of total blindness, seven cases of blindness in one eye, five cases of severe loss of vision and four cases of facial disfigurement.  If the former Home Secretary, Mr. Whitelaw, could say categorically in the House of Commons that he was of the opinion that plastic or rubber bullets should not be used in mainland Britain there is equally good reason for not using them in mainland Ireland.  This is a point which should be brought home by the Minister when meeting British Government Ministers.</P>
    <P>We are glad to be participating in the Forum for a New Ireland, which is an all-party initiative.  It is important that I should say this because I feel slightly tempted at times when I hear people describe it as their initiative to talk publicly on it and that would not be helpful. It is an all-party initiative and the work it does will be useful to any Irish Government in the future in identifying more closely the problems and the most appropriate solutions.  I was not at Question Time today but I heard that the Taoiseach did not feel it was right or proper to avail of the opportunity to discuss the establishment or workings of the Forum with the British Prime Minister during their recent meeting in Stuttgart. That is a pity.  I had also hoped that he would have sought positive comment on Northern Ireland from the American Vice-President, Mr. Bush.</P>
    <P>During his speech the Minister stated:</P>
    <P>My task as Foreign Minister is to defend and promote abroad the interests of Ireland and its people; to that end I need the support of all sides of this House.  In Ireland, we have a particular need for our traditional domestic consensus on external policy.  Our small size limits our influence on other <Col N="1936" /> countries: without broad agreement here at home on foreign policy, our ability to shape our external environment would be very slight indeed.</P>
    <P>The Minister repeats that theme later in his speech.  As far as my party are concerned, we would want to feel that we could discuss policies freely and openly at home within this Chamber and the other House and any other forum.  We would want our views known, aired and understood.  When the Minister is abroad representing us in his official capacity he need have no fear that I would do anything to embarrass him or the Government. I know the predicament in which a Foreign Minister can find himself because I have experience of such a predicament. I remember an occasion when the then Leader of the Opposition, Deputy FitzGerald, appeared on British television and did not help us during a very difficult time.  I will certainly help the Minister to the best of my ability.  It is natural that we should have open and frank discussion on various matters and I cannot give a blank cheque as far as agreement is concerned.  However, I cannot see any great obstacles and I am sure we could reach agreement by consensus. If he travels abroad representing Ireland, the Minister need not fear that I will say or do anything publicly or privately that will make it more difficult for him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to speak about the area for which I have particular responsibility, namely, Development Co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken of our foreign policy objectives which, broadly speaking, are to seek peace and justice in the world and to protect the interests of Ireland and Irish people abroad.  However, we cannot speak of those objectives or of the strategies we adopt to achieve them without referring to developing countries which are playing an increasingly prominent role in world affairs.  The prominence of this role is in direct proportion to the extent of the problems facing developing countries.  Deputies will already be familiar <Col N="1937" /> with the grim litany of afflictions facing the three-quarters of the world's population who live in the Third World: tens of millions are dying of starvation each year, hundreds of millions more are living in poverty, there is widespread illiteracy, disease and unemployment.  The international recession and the oil price increases have also affected developing countries severely, to the point where in some cases the prospects for future development are now worse than they were some years ago.</P>
    <P>We cannot ignore these problems. Even if they did not affect us at all, we would still have a humanitarian obligation to help those countries and peoples who are immeasurably less well off than ourselves.  We must not forget that despite the many problems facing us here in Ireland, and they are undoubtedly severe, we are the twenty-fifth richest country of over 160 in the world and we cannot close our eyes to deprivation in other countries.</P>
    <P>We are affected by underdevelopment in other countries and we have a strong interest in greater development in the Third World.  Economically, we have much to gain from higher living standards in developing countries which would provide greater markets for the goods we produce.  As a country whose economy is very dependent on exports this is of great importance to us.  On a more general level, we have an interest in the maintenance of a stable international system in which relations between States are conducted in an orderly and peaceful manner.  To the extent that underdevelopment in the Third World threatens that stability, it is a danger to our political and economic wellbeing.</P>
    <P>Our links with developing countries, both political and economic, are, therefore, a crucial element in our external relations, and the attitudes and policies we adopt towards these countries are an integral and important part of our overall foreign policy.</P>
    <P>Our relations towards developing countries are conducted, broadly speaking, on three levels.  On a political level, we have contacts with them bilaterally, and through our membership of the EEC <Col N="1938" /> and at the United Nations.  In the latter framework in particular, we make clear our views on the many international questions such as human rights and disarmament which are so closely linked to the problems of underdevelopment.</P>
    <P>On an economic level, we play an active part in the international efforts, generally known as the North-South Dialogue, which are seeking to devise new approaches to the economic problems facing developed and developing countries. One of the principal fora in which the North-South Dialogue is being conducted is the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) which concluded in Belgrade last Sunday and which I addressed a few weeks ago on behalf of this country.</P>
    <P>It is difficult at this stage to give a definitive assessment of the outcome of this conference.  In terms of concrete results, it must be said that the conference did not live up to the expectations which many people had of it.  Although a wide measure of agreement was reached on the final resolutions, the substantive progress which had been hoped for by many of the developing countries did not materialise.  In my speech to the conference I stressed the theme of interdependence and I expressed the hope that all of the countries attending the conference would not fail to seize the opportunity which it afforded to recognise this interdependence and to treat each other as partners in a common endeavour.  We understood then, of course, as we do now, that, at a time of prolonged international recession, it is inevitably much more difficult for developed countries to agree to the economic concessions demanded by the developing countries which, in the short term, would place increasing pressures on living standards in the developed world.  However, the logic of interdependence is that, in the long term, development in the Third World is as much in our interest as it is in theirs.  The longer we postpone the necessary decisions to tackle the problems of underdevelopment, the more complex and intractable those problems become, and the more difficult it <Col N="1939" /> becomes to find and implement the appropriate solutions.</P>
    <P>I believe nevertheless, that at the UNCTAD Conference in Belgrade, we saw for the first time signs of a new appreciation among developed countries of the extent of interdependence between North and South and of the importance of ensuring that world economic recovery is accompanied by effective action to stimulate development in the Third World.</P>
    <P>In particular, the adoption by consensus of the Resolution on International Monetary Issues suggests that a new perception of the role of international economic institutions in the development process may be emerging.  This would be a very positive development and would help to strengthen the capacity of these institutions to respond to the particular problems of developing countries in a way which could only benefit the international economic system as a whole.</P>
    <P>There was also a concensus at Belgrade on the need to speed up action to deal with the problems of the least developed countries.  The conference adopted by concensus a resolution which urges donor countries to attain 0.15 per cent of their GNP as ODA or to double their ODA to the least developed countries by 1985 or as soon as possible thereafter.  Ireland's ODA to the least developed countries at present is about 0.09 per cent of GNP and three of the four countries in which our bilateral aid programme is concentrated are classified as least developed. However, in view of the renewed recognition given to their needs at UNCTAD VI, they must in coming years be an even more important objective for our aid than they are at present.</P>
    <P>This brings me to the third level of our relations with developing countries which is the direct contribution we make to their development through our official development assistance.  The total provision for ODA this year is £30.076 million which represents an increase of £5.475 million or 22 per cent over the expenditure in 1982.  As a percentage of GNP, our ODA this year is estimated at 0.23 which compares with a figure of 0.21 for <Col N="1940" /> last year.  A total of £19.425 million will be paid in the form of multilateral aid through the international organisations active in development.  This includes our contribution to the European Community's programme of aid to developing countries.  The balance of £10.651 million will be disbursed under the Government's programme of bilateral assistance to developing countries.</P>
    <P>Although the increase in ODA this year is substantial, we have not succeeded, regrettably, in achieving the full 0.05 per cent of GNP increase which we had hoped for.  This is because of the severe pressures on public finances in all areas of which Deputies on all sides of the House are well aware.  The difficulties we face in increasing ODA by the amount we would wish, because of our domestic economic problems, underline the negative impact which the international recession has had on development in the Third World.</P>
    <P>We must not become so preoccupied with our own problems that we lose sight of our obligations to the people of the Third World and of our special interest in their development which I outlined éarlier.  We must continue to increase ODA and to make progress towards the UN target.  I have already referred to the target for the least-developed countries which we are already on the way towards achieving.  Of course, progress towards this sub-target can only take place in the context of our overall progress towards the 0.7 per cent UN target for GNP.</P>
    <P>We realise, of course, that our aid to developing countries can make no more than a modest contribution to solving the overall problems which they face.  But achieving the UN target would clearly indicate solidarity with the people of the Third World and our firm commitment to help them.  It would also increase the influence which we can bring to bear on other developed countries to increase their aid and to adopt the sort of economic policies which will facilitate greater development in the Third World.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the details of our ODA expenditure under the Vote for International Co-operation in 1983.  As Deputies will be aware, the moneys which <Col N="1941" /> make up our ODA are derived mainly from three sources; the Central Fund, the Vote for Agriculture and the Vote for International Co-operation.  Subheads B to H of the latter Vote are concerned with Development Co-operation. For 1983 these subheads amount to £15.7 million.</P>
    <P>The multilateral development agencies have faced serious financial difficulties in recent years.  I have tried to take account of these difficulties in subhead B of the Vote for International Co-operation by providing for £1.650 million in this subhead, which is an increase of £470,000 on the provision for 1982.  These UN agencies to which contributions are entirely voluntary, notably the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), UNICEF, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), active in the Middle East, have been particularly affected. The needs of the world's children and of its displaced populations require no elaboration and I feel that the allocation for 1983 will permit our voluntary contributions to these agencies to be maintained in real terms.  The development of human resources is becoming an increasingly important element of co-operation for development as is the priority to be given to the strengthening of the administrative capacity of developing countries.  The principal UN source of funds for this type of technical assistance is the UNDP.  The Government will try to maintain in real terms the present level of their voluntary contributions to that body bearing in mind requests for assistance from the other agencies I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>Through our programme of bilateral assistance we can make a direct and identifiably Irish contribution to the development of several of the poorer countries of the world.  Our Bilateral Aid Programme, which this year has been allocated £8.411 million as compared with expenditure of £7.1 million in 1982 &mdash; is, for reasons of effectiveness and better planning, concentrated in four African countries, three of which &mdash; Lesotho, Tanzania and the Sudan &mdash; are classified among the least-developed countries, <Col N="1942" /> while the fourth, Zambia is only slightly above that category and has many serious economic problems, with many of its people living in great poverty.</P>
    <P>The programmes of assistance and co-operation which have been set up and developed over the last few years have now reached a stage where they can be said to be having a substantial impact on either a national or regional level, especially in Lesotho and Tanzania.</P>
    <P>However, our bilateral aid is not exclusively confined to these four countries. By assisting and drawing on the tremendous resources of the voluntary agencies &mdash; the main ones being Gorta, Trocaire, Concern and the various missionary bodies &mdash; our bilateral aid can be channelled to many other countries also.</P>
    <P>In fact, in 1982 our bilateral aid programme was able to assist a wide variety of development projects, large and small, in more than 30 developing countries. Through the scheme for the co-financing of projects with the voluntary agencies, just over £1 million was spent from the Bilateral Aid Fund in 1982 on more than 100 projects, most of them small, village-level schemes meeting basic needs such as health care, education and clean water.  It is proposed to increase the amount of funds allocated to this type of aid this year by 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>An important complement to this financial and technical assistance is provided by the Irish personnel, mainly volunteers, whose overseas assignments are assisted by the Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO), which this year will be allocated £1.6 million by way of a grant-in-aid.  Last year APSO was able to fund or assist the assignments of 324 persons in nearly 50 developing countries; many of these assignments were sponsored also by the voluntary agencies, while a number were also co-sponsored under United Nations auspices.  The substantial increase, 33? per cent, in the agency's Grant-in-Aid this year should enable it to assist an expanded programme of overseas assignments, thus enabling many willing and talented Irish persons to make a contribution to development in the Third World.</P>
    <P>The bilateral aid programme is now <Col N="1943" /> firmly established as a vehicle by which the knowhow and experience possessed by Ireland &mdash; things we may take for granted &mdash; can be used to make a very important impact on problems in Third World countries.  This provides not only the help that is often desperately needed by the poorer countries but also a showcase for the talents, skills and experience of Irish experts and institutions, private firms and semi-State bodies.  To mention just a few of the many examples, Irish personnel from Bord na Móna are enabling the people of two small land-locked countries of central Africa, Burundi and Rwanda, to develop valuable but hitherto almost untapped resources of peat, while in one of these countries, Rwanda, Irish expertise is helping them to develop papyrus as an energy source; in Peru, an Irish food-processing expert working with the International Potato Centre is spearheading research into new simple low-cost forms of processing which could be of immense economic and nutritional value to peasant producers in many countries. In Lesotho, Irish training has enabled students to graduate for the first time ever in that country in medical laboratory science and in accountancy, while in Zambia expert help from Irish Cement Ltd. has turned around an inefficient, loss-making cement plant into an enterprise not only meeting national supply needs but even generating a small surplus for export.</P>
    <P>The main bodies involved with, and experienced in, assistance to the developing countries are represented on the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation, which has as its mandate to provide advice to the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on all aspects of our development co-operation programme.  After the initial three-year period during which the council established itself and set about defining the areas it wished to study, the council has this year been given a new, more sharply focused mandate.</P>
    <P>We must, of course, bear in mind that our ODA programme is now a substantial element of Government expenditure requiring increased scrutiny by both the <Col N="1944" /> Oireachtas and the general public.  I welcome, therefore, the imminent re-establishmen of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries.  I believe that, in addition to affording Members an opportunity to scrutinise expenditure on ODA, it will provide them with a forum in which to discuss our policies and programmes and to offer valuable advice to the Government. I look forward to working with this committee and I can assure the House that I will give it every possible co-operation and assistance.</P>
    <P>I would also refer Deputies to Programme 46 dealing with ODA in the publication Comprehensive Public Expenditure Programmes, which sets out in detail the range and complexity of the activities which now go to make up that programme.</P>
    <P>Looking at our ODA programme as a whole, I believe that it is an effective and worthwhile contribution to the development of the Third World.  I know that Deputies on all sides of the House will share my desire to increase that effectiveness and to increase our contribution in this area.</P>
    <P>I therefore urge them to join with the Government in developing a new approach to development co-operation which transcends traditional party divides and ensures that our involvement in this area will continue to grow irrespective of whatever domestic difficulties we may face here in Ireland.  I believe that our commitments to development and justice for all nations and peoples demands no less a response from us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be very brief.  I should like to refer first to the Forum for a New Ireland and to the big deficiency in it, that is, that we do not have at the table representatives of the Unionist community in the North of Ireland.  It is difficult to keep telling ourselves the big real absence from the negotiating table, but we must keep doing it.  One would think that the UK Government, if they so wished, could exercise moral pressure on the Unionist grouping to ask them to participate.  This does not mean that they would be bringing any moral pressure to <Col N="1945" /> bear on them to change their views, but at least they could contribute their well known views to the general discussion.</P>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister and our spokesman, Deputy G. Collins, referred to some aspects of Anglo-Irish relations and relations with the United States.  I regret that the period for this debate is so short but the Minister did promise a limited debate later on.</P>
      <P>With regard to the meeting at Williamsburg, I do not think it was good enough to ignore the suggestion by the French President that the participants at the high powered economic conference should direct themselves to finding some kind of substitute for the Bretton Woods Agreement which served the economies of the western world so well for so long but which has now dissolved or broken up.  At least his suggestion should have been considered.  Admittedly since 1973, since the big hike in oil prices, the preconditions do not exist for the Bretton Woods type of arrangement in which Keynes played such a large part.  But that does not mean that it should not be considered. It is defeatism not even to consider it.  It is an indication that the powers that wield such huge economic power are thinking that this kind of economic situation will persist for ever &mdash; the problems that were created by the piling up of petro-dollars, the huge hike in oil prices and the general confusion with regard to the value of currencies that ensued.</P>
      <P>I should like to endorse the remarks of Deputy G. Collins with regard to Afghanistan.  There is a tendency to sweep things under the carpet if we do not like them, if it is inconvenient, if it offends.  I would totally agree with him that the plight of the Afghans should not be forgotten, rather should it be highlighted on every occasion.</P>
      <P>In passing I would appeal to the Minister to do something about passports for people who find themselves in certain need.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refer to what the Minister said with regard to our dependence on external trade.  Even today we find that protectionism is rearing its ugly head.  President Reagan of the United States made an announcement with <Col N="1946" /> regard to trading in steel.  We have here Irish Steel Limited.  They are in some difficulty, and indeed our people must subsidise them very heavily.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>They are in Cork, of course.  If the protectionism, which was a feature of the depressed era of the thirties, starts now to make advances, as it may very well do if President Reagan follows that road, it will not help other economies and will affect us here as it will the rest of western Europe.  Most of the noises being made are very hostile to what has been said.  The European nations are about to complain to GATT about what has happened.</P>
      <P>I am glad also that Deputy G. Collins referred to the <i>faux pas</i> of Mr. Heseltine when he was in the North and that he has urged the Minister to see to it that he does not get away with it.  Smart Alecry like that is not befitting a Minister of a Government supposed to be friendly.</P>
      <P>In the year in which Frank Aiken died, a man who dedicated himself for so long to establishing some kind of <i>rationale</i> in the nuclear field, our total dedication to peace and to the corollary, the control of nuclear weapons, should continue.  To be more parochial the incidents in Carlingford Lough and the use of plastic bullets, which is very near to home as far as I am concerned, are subjects of minor importance, I suppose, on the large stage that has been constructed by the Minister in his speech.  But they are of importance to us here and should command the Minister's attention as well.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot see in the bullish mood that exists in the United Kingdom, the British Government bringing their energies to bear on the problem, which is a serious one for us in this part of the country and <Col N="1947" /> for our fellow countrymen in the Six Counties.  The scandalously militaristic tone of newspaper articles and even of British Government announcements since the Falklands War would indicate to me that that bullish kind of mood will continue and that there is very little joy for us in that policy.</P>
    <P>I intended to talk about regional policy and social policy but, as you say, A Cheann Comhairle, the time has expired.</P>

I promise that I will, as a matter of urgency, endeavour to get the Whips to agree to some timetable for a debate on foreign affairs on the resumption of the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I want to correct one matter for the record, and to make a very brief reference to two others.  Deputy G. Collins, when speaking, said that the Taoiseach had said today in the House that he had not spoken about the New Ireland Forum to Mrs. Thatcher at Stuttgart.  The Taoiseach was asked had he brought up the matter of the Forum with Mrs. Thatcher when he met her in Stuttgart.  He replied that it was not the practice to break the confidentiality of these meetings and did not intend to do so.  He did not answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo; to the question.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the incursion into our waters, of course we do protest when we can establish the facts.  Evidently, Deputy Wilson did not realise that within hours of the British Minister of Defence making his remarks we had lodged protests with the British in London.  We did not expect an apology but we wanted to get our <Col N="1948" /> views across to them strongly in that regard.</P>
    <P>I should like to thank Deputy Collins for his remarks about the officials in the Department and I share his sentiments. I will have a lot of pleasure in conveying to the three officials he mentioned the complimentary remarks he mentioned tonight.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>Section 21: In page 17, lines 2 and 3, &ldquo;unless the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, has authorised such issue&rdquo; deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is an amendment to section 21 which is a standard provision found in legislation for State-sponsored companies.  It was included in the Bill for that reason. It precludes the issue of shares in the companies additional to those issues of shares which are expressly provided for in the Bill except as may be authorised by the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  During the course of the passage of the Bill a question was raised in <Col N="1949" /> reference to section 21 to an issue of shares additional to those issues of shares which are specifically provided for in the Bill.  The opinion was expressed that the section might be seen as leaving a way open, however unintended, for privatising part of the equity of the company.  In view of the provisions of sections 10 and 18 of the Bill which limit to specified categories the authorised and issued share capital of the company there is, of course, no such way open.  I fully accept, therefore, that the reference which I now propose to delete is unnecessary and could therefore be confusing.  The reference would only be required if the Bill was amended by further legislation to provide for issues of shares beyond the category specified in sections 10 and 18. No such legislation is envisaged.  Accordingly, this amendment provides for the deletion of the reference in section 21 to additional issues of shares.</P>
    <P>During the course of the Dáil debate on the Bill a number of amendments were introduced to ensure against privatisation or the sale of shares.  This section was overlooked and it was drawn to my attention before it was introduced in the Seanad.  I tabled an amendment in the Seanad yesterday on Committee Stage. I am glad that matter was drawn to my attention and to have the opportunity to table the amendment here so that there will be absolute consistency throughout the Bill as to our intentions in relation to the maintaining of the postal and telecommunications services firmly in the State sector.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the Minister's amendment.  This illustrates clearly the fact that we had so little time to discuss the details of the Bill on Committee Stage.  The fact that we passed all Stages of the Bill and sent it to the Seanad where it was amended in such a short space of time set a precedent.  Nevertheless the fact that the Bill has to be brought to the Dáil for final ratification highlights certain areas.  The Minister and I gave assurances that under no circumstances did we ever envisage the sale of any shares to private enterprise at any stage and the amendment confirms that.  It reassures <Col N="1950" /> the staff that there was not an ulterior motive in having the section in the Bill. I welcome the deletion proposed by the Minister because we must re-emphasise our commitment to the retention of both boards in the semi-State sector.  The deletion ensures that it will be necessary to bring amending legislation before the House if any change is proposed in the future.</P>
      <P>It would have been useful to have had more time to consider the provisions of the Bill because I have no doubt that elsewhere in it there are words or sections which may give rise to problems in the future.  While the detailed assessment of the provisions in the Dáil and Seanad was useful I am sure most Members would have liked to have more time to consider it.  Fianna Fáil are committed to a policy of the retention of both boards as semi-State organisations.  That reassurance is necessary because there are 30,000 people involved.  They are in a twilight situation in changing from civil servants to semi-State status.  That will be a traumatic experience for them because many of those officials joined when they were 16 or 17 years of age and have been in the service since.</P>
      <P>During the debate in this House I pointed out that commitments were given, possibly in good faith, by the Minister's party, and Deputy O'Sullivan's party, that civil service status would be retained.  We did not give that commitment because we could not do so.  We always put the facts before our people and we could not give that commitment even for short term political gain.  It is possible that as a result we lost out in some constituencies, particularly where many POWU members resided.  The passage of the Bill through both Houses has proved conclusively that the Government parties misled the electorate and the Post Office Workers Union.  I regret having to end the debate on that note but I do so in the interests of honesty and integrity.</P>

      <P>I accept that but I am <Col N="1951" /> anxious to explain why it was necessary to delete these words.  The Minister is endeavouring to honour to some extent a commitment given by his party.  It was given in 1981 and it could not be honoured. The removal of the two lines in question is in some way making amends to the workers.  We have been completely consistent in our approach throughout.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for accepting the amendment. It typifies his approach to the whole debate.  I should have preferred more time to go into greater detail with regard to the contents of the Bill.  The Minister has set a record in that he has shown he was open to suggestions from all sides and this is something that is desirable in a democracy.  Deputy Leyden may interpret this as succumbing to pressure but I see it as democracy in action.  The Minister has demonstrated he was big enough to accept an amendment where he saw it would be to the advantage of the workers and the board.</P>
      <P>By accepting the amendment the Minister has allayed fears of those who were afraid both companies would be privatised. While accepting that it may be necessary to raise capital from outside sources at some stage, there was great fear that in the future the boards would not be in a strong position because a large block of shares would be held by outside interests.  The Minister has demonstrated he is not in favour of privatisation.  I welcome the remarks of Deputy Leyden that his party endorse what the Minister said, that they do not want to create something that might in time go out of the semi-State sector and into private hands.  I thank the Minister for his co-operation and for accepting this amendment.</P>

      <P>I wish to endorse the words of Deputy Leyden.  I am on the record of the House as saying there was no intention to leave any loophole or path by which the two companies could be denationalised and sold to private interests.  Deputy Kelly comes into this House regularly and utters wise remarks. <Col N="1952" /> Their wisdom is in no way diminished by the wit with which he expresses his opinions. He has said we are inclined to be hypnotised by what happens in our neighbouring island.  All the suspicion arose from a tendency, arising from a certain ideology in the British administration, to sell off the telecommunications industry to private interests.  Deputy Kelly was quite right.  We are hypnotised by what has happened there.  The unions also were scared about what is happening there but there was no foundation whatever for their fears.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy Bermingham made a great brouhaha about how they were going to oppose this Bill, and this section in particular caused them some trouble.  I interpret Deputy O'Sullivan's comments now as trying to justify the noise he kicked up at that time, despite the fact that the Bill now before the House is substantially the same Bill, incorporating amendments I had accepted on Second Stage, as it was when he and Deputy Bermingham opposed it.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

      <P>Before we deal with the next amendment I wish to point out that the Order of Business has been departed from in order to take this Bill from the Seanad.  The Chair has no discretion as to the length of speeches or the number of Deputies who may speak. However, the Chair would like to remind the House that also ordered for tonight is Vote 42 which deals with Posts and Telegraphs and that must be concluded by midnight.  We will deal now with amendment No. 2.  Amendment No.3 is related and, by agreement, amendments Nos. 2 and 3 may be taken together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>Section 45: In page 27, line 20, after &ldquo;in its service.&rdquo; the following inserted:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;As provided in subsection (2), no <Col N="1953" /> such variation shall operate to worsen the scales of pay and conditions of service applicable to such staff immediately before the vesting day, save in accordance with a collective agreement negotiated with any recognised trade union or staff association concerned.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 deal with probably the most important section in the Bill.  This is the section dealing with security of tenure of the staff transferred on vesting day.  In moving these amendments it is only fair to recall the history of the section.  Deputy Wilson said that the Bill is substantially the same Bill that he introduced in the last Dáil.  That is true.  During the course of the debate on Second Stage Deputy Wilson indicated his willingness to accept a number of amendments, a commitment I have fulfilled.</P>
    <P>Even though there have been more than 150 amendments and the Bill is somewhat changed from that point of view, the purpose and intent of the Bill as drafted by Deputy Wilson is very much the same.  With regard to section 45 there has been a clear wish on all sides to give the necessary assurance and guarantee to the transferred staff that their tenure of office and security of employment will be as good, strong and safe as it is in their present civil service capacity.</P>
    <P>I mentioned there had been more than 150 amendments to the Bill.  With regard to this section, this is the third set of amendments.  Deputy O'Sullivan has been barracked a little from the opposite benches and also from these benches but it is only fair to recall his contribution. Even though many Deputies on all sides have contributed significantly to the improvement in the Bill, no Deputy has contributed more than Deputy O'Sullivan.  He deserves immense credit for his efforts in the past six months.  This section caused him and the Post Office Workers' Union and other unions the greatest concern.</P>
    <P>On Committee Stage in this House I tabled an amendment which clarified and underlined the guarantee in the original section.  Following contributions from all <Col N="1954" /> sides of the House during the debate on Committee Stage, further suggestions were made and I promised to consider them.  When it came to Report Stage I tabled further amendments which helped to underline the guarantee, even though I believed the amendment tabled on Committee Stage was more than adequate. However, I understood the need to underline and repeat the assurance. On Report Stage, further suggestions were made and I said I would consider them.  When the Bill went to the Seanad I tabled two further amendments which, in many cases, are a repetition of what is said elsewhere in the section but it is to underline and emphasise the guarantee. This is an amendment to subsection (3). Subsection (2) already outlines the need for consultation and agreement with the trade unions and staff organisations concerned.</P>
    <P>It is worth reading the full section and it would be very difficult to find such a rock-solid, emphasised, repeated guarantee of job security in any enactment in any parliament in the free world.  That sounds a very strong claim but I doubt if any lawyer will find in any enactment the guarantees that have been given in this section.  I am proud of that claim because it is right that those guarantees should be given in the most fundamental re-organisation of the public service since the foundation of the State and perhaps for much longer than that.  If we are asking people to transfer from the civil service into a commercial environment, they should be given solid guarantees of security. The fundamental reason for this Bill is to transfer the postal and telecommunications business out of the civil service, which they have now outgrown, into a commercial environment which is much more appropriate to them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>It is reasonable to expect that the Minister would bring forward new amendments to appease the Labour Party because, when a party gives a commitment at election time, which is subsequently broken, all the pious platitudes and compliments the Minister paid to Deputy O'Sullivan are useless because the electorate are discerning enough to <Col N="1955" /> know that the Labour Party voted against this Bill at the end of Second Stage in 1982.  They used every parliamentary tactic to try to defeat this Bill.  In 1982 we were a minority Government and yet we stood over our comitment in relation to this Bill.  It was initiated by Deputy Faulkner, the then Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, and carried on by Deputy Reynolds and Deputy Wilson.  We were consistent in our approach.  In 1982 we could have deferred the Bill for political reasons but we had the integrity to stand over it going into a general election.  I cannot say the same for the Labour Party. They attacked this Bill viciously in the House.  They voted against the Bill and every Member of the party, including Deputy Spring, voted against it.  The Fine Gael Party had not the courage to vote either for or against it and they abstained, which could be regarded as less than a commitment to the Bill and could be seen as playing politics with it.  Our approach now is the same as it was then.  We support the Bill and we see the need for it. Otherwise we would not have brought it before the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I have studied the section and the amendments very carefully.  The people in Cork are able to read the commitment which Deputy O'Sullivan and his party gave and which they have broken. No matter what is said, the Cork people and the POWU know that the commitment has been broken.  As the Deputy is adopting this attitude, I will read out the commitment again but before that I must refer to Deputy O'Sullivan's comments on my position in relation to the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan of the Labour Party said that any reorganisation must take into account the existing status of the staff within the Civil Service.  He said that status will not be undermined.  Does he understand the full impact of that commitment given on 10 June 1981?  Was that to ensure his election to this House?  That was a fraudulent approach by the Labour Party in the light of their support for this Bill.  In Fianna Fáil we were consistent. We could have introduced amendments to ensure that status would not be undermined and embarrassed the Minister and Deputy O'Sullivan.  But we have our integrity to preserve and so I, as spokesman for my party on Posts and Telegraphs, adopted the consistent attitude, followed all through by my party.  I could easily have tabled that embarrassing amendment and the Minister and Deputy O'Sullivan would have voted against it because there is a fundamental difference between this now discredited Coalition Government and a one-party Fianna Fáil Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The difference is quite clear.  Deputy O'Sullivan has forced me to say that because of his comments on my position in regard to this Bill.  If he is not prepared to withdraw those comments, then all I can do is stitch into the record Deputy O'Sullivan's position in relation to this Bill.  If he wants to revert to a Second <Col N="1957" /> Stage debate then I shall do so, however reluctantly.  The people in Posts and Telegraphs know the position.  They know what has happened.  The majority party, Fine Gael, stated there would be no loss of status.  But the Minister admitted he could not maintain status in a semi-State organisation.  That is the fact.  Deputy Wilson will verify what I say.  One cannot be in both camps.  One cannot have one foot in the Labour camp and another in the Fine Gael camp.  One cannot have one foot in the Labour camp in an effort to satisfy certain members of the Union who are not prepared to take a risk in an attempt not to jeopardise the Government.</P>
    <P>We brought in a Bill in 1982 and we agreed to amendments which could have brought the Government down in 1982. But we did not give commitments, though that may have meant the loss of an odd seat here and there.  We stuck to our principles.  We were consistent in our approach at all times as I am being consistent now.  We could have tabled amendments which would have embarrassed the Minister and the Labour Party. That would have savoured of short-term expediency, something we eschewed since we had no ambition to gain any short-term gratification.  We were simply not prepared to take that stand because it would not have been right in the long term.</P>
    <P>I sympathise fully with the 30,000 people who are changing from the security of the Civil Service.  As Deputies we have no similar security but we are prepared to safeguard the security of those affected by this Bill.  Deputy Wilson gave that commitment and we would have honoured that commitment.  Those civil servants who transfer to these two semi-State organisations should be given an opportunity of promotion within the Civil Service or at least an opportunity to transfer to other Departments.  The Minister said there was nothing to prevent that happening.  That should be written into this Bill.  From my discussions with union officials and civil servants I know they would appreciate such recognition of their situation.</P>
    <P>The law of diminishing returns has an <Col N="1958" /> impact here.  Returns are down by about £10 million at the moment.  This is a very worrying trend because the more costs increase the lower the returns.  There is now competition with the courier services.  I resent that service arriving at the GPO with mail as I resent it arriving at Leinster House.  Deputy O'Sullivan may not appreciate the significance of this development.  The Post Office will be in competition with these services.</P>
    <P>In regard to documentation we have a very sensitive area.  The personal files are stored.  Is it the intention to transfer these to the new bodies?  Various reports are carried on these files.  Who exactly will have responsibility for these files?  Will the residual Department hold them? There is concern about possible black lists.  Will these be held in the residual Department or will they be made available to the new bodies?  I would like the Minister to comment on this.</P>
    <P>We accept the amendments because they go further along the road towards ensuring the staff are satisfied and are getting further guarantees.  They are still a long way short of the commitments given and broken by the Government parties at this stage.  As far as I am concerned, I welcome the amendments which will assist in some way to appease the fears of the employees involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to welcome the two amendments the Minister has brought in.  They are significant advances on the original section in the Bill proposed by Fianna Fáil and as introduced by the Coalition initially.  The Minister praised himself concerning the introduction of those amendments, saying they were the best terms available to any worker in the free world.  They do not go as far as the terms which those in the civil service enjoy and which they will be giving up when they transfer to the new companies.  I welcome those amendments, particularly amendment No. 3 but they still do not go far enough to meet the conditions and the security which the employees of the Post Office enjoy at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are two other matters I wish to refer to, one of which has already been <Col N="1959" /> referred to by Deputy Leyden, that is the question of the transfer of files on existing staff.  I have received representations on this matter, as I am sure other Deputies also have.  It is a matter of concern, where so many employees are involved and where in normal circumstances, when employees are going to new employment, their former employers do not transfer confidential information to the new employers without the permission of the people involved apart from basic information. The Minister should give some kind of commitment that the files will not be handed over <i>in toto</i> to the new companies. I feel it would start the companies off on the wrong foot if there are feelings among staff that there are records which may or may not do harm to them or harm their relationship with the new company.</P>
    <P>The other matter which has been brought to my attention is the right of staff to have access to files kept on them by their employers.  As the companies will have large numbers of staff, no doubt the files will be computerised.  The tendency for large organisations is to feed in all sorts of scraps of information into their files when they are on computer.  I feel the staff in the new companies should have access to the files kept on them so that they are aware of what is in them and so that they can verify or correct any information which may be wrong.  It is not unknown for information collected on staff to be erroneous.</P>
    <P>Another point which I would like to raise with the Minister, also as a result of representations made to me, is the case of telephonists who, because of the type of job they are in and the fact that technology will undertake the kind of work they do at present, feel particularly vulnerable at present.  I understand the Minister gave some commitment in the Seanad in relation to their position regarding redundancy, retraining and so on.  I would like him to elaborate on that aspect of the transfer of staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy De Rossa I would like to welcome those amendments.  It is a recognition by the Minister that people were concerned <Col N="1960" /> about their future in both companies.  I do not want this to be regarded as a mutual admiration society.  Nevertheless, it is a measure of the man that he has responded in a very positive manner. Security of tenure was the great fear which members of the staff had.  I hope that as a result of those amendments these fears will be abolished if possible.</P>
      <P>During the course of this debate I was perplexed why at all times Deputy Terry Leyden was flanked by two senior members of his party.  It was said, if one can believe what is circulating in the House, that one of these people may probably hold before long one of the most prestigious places in Irish politics.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have made my point. I can see the reason why this is, with somebody like Deputy Leyden representing the Fianna Fáil Party.  Deputy Leyden failed to say that the reason why we are going through this exercise at this late hour is that the document circulated on the Second Stage of the debate was faulty.  There were many loopholes in it and, as a result of this, we have to go through this very minute examination in a short space of time.  He said that Deputy Wilson, as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, agreed to discuss these matters. I will not deny that there was discussion with the unions concerned but there was no agreement whatsoever.  One has only to read <i>Postal Worker</i> of May and June 1982 to see that there were over 230 items still outstanding unresolved.  I will produce them if necessary.  Is Deputy Leyden trying to suggest that all was well, that if Fianna Fáil had the opportunity to shepherd this Bill through the Dáil, all the problems we have discussed would have been resolved?  I do not think so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson said during the Second Stage debate that when he was Minister he was prepared to accept amendments to sections of this Bill.  It is recorded in the Official Report <Col N="1961" /> of that period.  Deputy Wilson as Minister was prepared to discuss them but there was nothing about agreement.  The amendments now before us guarantee discussion and agreement with the unions concerned.  Deputy Wilson refused to give me an assurance on the floor of this House that he would do this.  Each of the 230 cases is documented for history as a failure by Fianna Fáil to come to terms with the people employed in this Department who are now going into semi-State companies.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leyden may, as a diversion, try to launch an attack on me but I am quite prepared to defend my role in this whole debate, likewise that of my party. I draw a distinction between the contribution of Deputy Wilson as Minister and that of Deputy Leyden as spokesman, because at all times Deputy Wilson carried out the debate in a dignified manner. I regret very much that he should describe The Labour Party contributions from Deputy Joe Bermingham and myself as the noise we are making.  I do not believe the contributions will be measured in terms of decibels but rather in terms of the content of what we had to say regarding the various sections of the Bill.  That is the Deputy's choice and I cannot tell him what to say.  I again thank the Minister for accepting these amendments and I hope they will go a long way in allaying the fears of my colleagues in the Post Office.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has given rise to certain fears of people employed in the Post Office.  These fears have been made known to us personally and in writing. On Committee Stage at section 45 the Minister alleviated those fears by adding subsection (4).  I would like the Minister to give that assurance.  I would like to repeat what Deputy De Rossa said, that with advanced technology there is a fear in the minds of people employed as telephonists in the Post Office of certain forced redundancies.  I would be thankful if the Minister would give the assurance that he gave in the Seanad in that regard. I endorse Deputy De Rossa's point, that those employed in the two separate companies set up by this Bill should have <Col N="1962" /> access to the records kept in relation to their service.  It is important that we should have that open-mindedness about the matter and I am sure the Minister will be gracious enough to accede to that request.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to comment on what Deputy O'Sullivan said.  Experience in this House would have indicated to him that on Second Stage every aspect of a Bill is or may be covered in general rather than specific terms.  The framework of the <i>modus operandi</i> of this House for getting legislation has various stages so that what is dealt with in general on Second Stage may be dealt with specifically on Committee and Report Stages with certain conditions, as far as introducing amendments on Report Stage are concerned, written into Standing Orders. I find it very hard to understand why Deputy O'Sullivan's blood pressure is rising because at the end of Second Stage I did not say that I was accepting 238 amendments or whatever.  What I indicated was a state of mind.  I indicated two things: that I realised what Committee and Report Stages were for, that as far as amendments were concerned I had an open mind and was prepared to be convinced, that I would discuss all possible amendments with interested parties.  I had already been discussing them with the trade unions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to put on the record of this House that I have as good a record as has any Deputy in this House as a trade unionist.  I am of the second generation that can claim that.  There is no point in people trying to arrogate to themselves all virtues with regard to the rights of trade unionism, and I would reject that. I regret the heat that has crept into this post-Seanad stage.  It may serve a useful purpose in keeping us awake, as the debate must go on until late into the night, but I do not see why the House should be getting up to high doh in order to prove that Deputy O'Sullivan is true to his colours with the POWU or that he is way ahead of The Workers' Party in the defence of trade union rights.  Deputy O'Sullivan in raising the temperature here let slip an offensive remark as far as <Col N="1963" /> our spokesman, Deputy Leyden, was concerned.  In all fairness he should have withdrawn that remark when he was asked to do so and I regret very much that he did not do so.  The consensus of opinion in the House, including that of the Minister, is that we are here trying to launch these two semi-State companies for the efficient running of our telecommunications and postal services, that we want the workers in both sections to have all the guarantees possible &mdash; we must not forget that this is the primary purpose of the exercise &mdash; so that they will be able to provide a service to the people, and the objective is the very best possible service.  In the consideration of all the minutiae of this Bill we seem to forget sometimes what the whole thing is about.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting and curious that we find this Bill back before this House on the basis of dealing with section 45 and security of tenure.  At this stage Members of this House in all parties have bent over backwards to satisfy the demands of the employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to ensure their job security, wage security and everything else.  I accept and agree entirely with comments made by the former Minister opposite when he said that this Bill and its provisions are about providing a service.  As a Member of this House I regret deeply that this House has not spent one-tenth of the time debating consumer protection, the rights of the general public, the need to ensure that we have an efficient service, that has been devoted to this whole area of job security and wage security.  If an efficient service is provided, employees in An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann will have job security.  If a service is provided which is profitable from the point of view of those boards and efficient from the point of view of the general public nobody will want to interfere with the wage structures or job security of the employees there. They would be entitled to job security and decent wages by virtue of the service. I may not be thanked by anybody for saying that the length of time spent on this aspect of the Bill is quite extraordinary <Col N="1964" /> considering the insignificant length of time that has been devoted to discussing consumer protection.</P>
      <P>I said in this House on Committee Stage that I welcomed the amendments the Minister made then to the Bill to provide some additional protection at the consumer end but certainly nothing resembling sufficient protection.  I regret that so much time has been spent on an issue which if an efficient service is provided will be irrelevant.  It is a great shame that the sort of pressures that the workers in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs have placed on Members individually from all political parties and on the parties themselves was not mirrored by similarly active pressure on behalf of people who use and depend upon the postal and telephone services. Similar pressure groups in that area represent a far larger proportion of the electorate than do the employees of the Department.  If there were similar pressure groups in those areas the content of this Bill would be very different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my constituency I find, as other Deputies find in theirs, that the public are becoming more conscious of the debates taking place in this House and of a growing worry and disillusionment of the manner in which this Bill deals in effect with the general public and fails to protect their rights and their interests. Some of us as politicians have steered clear of getting into that because we all have constituents who are employees of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and who will become employees of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  Politics as it operates in this country demands that we create the minimum offence to all our constituents just in case somebody somewhere will not vote for us at some stage.  I recognise the worries of the employees, but I deplore the fact that we have not devoted a similar amount of time in debate in this House to securing consumer protection because the telephone service we have at the moment, particularly in Dublin, is the most atrocious that can be found in any EEC country.  It is recognised as such particularly by people living in Dublin who despair of having an efficient <Col N="1965" /> telephone service despite assurances by Ministers of all parties that telephones will be available on demand.</P>

I sincerely hope that those employees who have been so anxious to achieve security of tenure and to make sure that their rates of pay will remain at the same level as obtains in the civil service will show similar concern about providing the proper service which is so badly needed.</P>

      <P>I move that the committee agree with the Seanad in amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>Section 73: In page 39, subsection (4), line 33, &ldquo;by order&rdquo; inserted after &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of these amendments, which are closely related, is to require the Minister to make an order if he wishes to grant a licence on an appeal under this section.  Similar amendments are proposed to section 89, the corresponding section for Bord Telecom Éireann.  Section 73 empowers An Post, with the consent of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, to license others to provide postal services within the exclusive privilege granted to it under section 63. If the company refuse to grant a licence sought by a third party subsection (4) permits the Minister to grant a licence on appeal if he is of the opinion that this would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the justifications in section 63 (2) for the grant of the exclusive privilege to the company.  That subsection was inserted on Committee Stage in the Dáil in lieu of the original subsection which did not qualify the power of the Minister to grant a licence on appeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has since been represented to me that the section as it stands could be availed of to bypass the provisions of section 111(1) which require the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs to make an order before he can license others to provide any service within the exclusive <Col N="1967" /> privilege of either An Post or Bord Telecom Éireann.  In other words, under section 73 as it stands a person might seek a licence from An Post knowing full well that it would be refused but the Minister could grant a licence on appeal without having to make an order which would have to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Obviously that possibility was not envisaged in the preparation of the section.  As I have repeatedly emphasised, these licensing provisions are purely and simply fall-back provisions designed to enable the Minister if unforeseen circumstances arise to meet his overall responsibilities in the public interest and the issue of such licences is not contemplated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>This is further confirmation that there is no question of giving away any of the monopoly rights of the Department.  Basically I agree with these amendments because it is an area which would be of great concern to staff.  The exclusive privilege is very dear to the hearts of all the workers because it guarantees their position in the future.  This commitment is absolutely essential.</P>
      <P>Couriers are at present creaming off the most lucrative parts of the postal service.  I have already stated my views in relation to couriers.  They are not providing a door-to-door service once or twice a day five days a week, nor are they providing a service in rural areas.  They are taking away the city deliveries which are economical and profitable.  I would oppose any application to grant a licence to a courier service operating in this manner.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware that certain courier services are using the free transport facilities available to old age pensioners to send bags of mail from one city to another and the mail is then delivered by the couriers to the various destinations.  The Minister may have some information about this abuse.  It is a very lucrative business and they are charging excessive rates for deliveries.  They have a young staff who use motorbikes and come even to the Dáil.  They also have the audacity to <Col N="1968" /> arrive at the GPO with courier mail.  It is an illegal service and I appeal to business people not to support it and to rely on the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.</P>
    <P>The Department pride themselves on their credibility, reliability and guaranteed delivery of the mails.  We had an example a few weeks ago of a company who absconded, leaving thousands of undelivered pieces of mail, but the Department took it on themselves to deliver certain pieces of mail that had been thrown into letterboxes, for a small surcharge.  I suggest that the new company will have to introduce an express delivery service in the cities which will compete successfully with the couriers. The Department have the personnel and the expertise to do it.  In my time in the Department certain investigations were instituted about this possibility and I know that the unions will co-operate fully because their bread and butter are involved.</P>
    <P>I hope that never again will a licence be issued to private couriers to skim the cream of the service here in the city. There will be some difficulty, of course, because &ldquo;letter&rdquo; is not defined properly in the Bill and this could result in litigation. It is a pity the definition is not there to ensure successful prosecution of couriers. It is difficult to define a letter by shape, size and weight.  However, I support the amendment because it will ensure control by future Ministers of the issuing of licences.  As I said before, I hope the board will consider in the interim, the institution of a guaranteed delivery service in the cities.  I hope that they will approach business people and groups in the cities to encourage them to rely on the dependability of the Department to provide a reliable delivery service.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the major sections in the Bill.  The Minister has spoken about these services being used for emergencies but he has not specified the kind of situations in which private courier services could be used, and that is a weakness in the Bill because some future Minister or Government could <Col N="1969" /> allow the development of private postal and communications services.</P>
      <P>Deputy Leyden spoke about what would happen when he would be Minister when he would not allow a courier service to operate.  The fact remains that on at least one occasion known to me last year the then Minister for Justice used a private firm to distribute thousands of letters to householders throughout the State. There is that kind of inconsistency and we must juxtapose it with the trend in other countries towards privatisation of national services.  Who knows whether there might not be elements in Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to favour delivery services run by private enterprise?  We have no guarantee of what may happen in the future &mdash; the inconsistencies are there.  I could refer to another instance involving another party, but I have not the precise facts.</P>
      <P>There are grounds for believing that this section leaves the door open for a weakening of the national delivery service, and though the Bill tightens things up somewhat, the weakness remains.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable that we did not have time on Committee Stage to deal fully with this matter.  I regret that Deputy Shatter is not here, but I must make some reference to his contribution and his emphasis on the staff side.  I do not accept Deputy Wilson's claim that I have any monoploy, nor indeed am I <Col N="1970" /> their exclusive spokesman.  Everybody throughout the country has lobbied and I played my part, as requested, to the best of my ability.  I would not say that my contribution was any greater or more genuine than that of, say, Deputy Wilson or any other Member of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the Labour Party would suggest for a moment that we have a monopoly of trade unionists in this House.  That goes without saying.</P>
      <P>The greatest assurance to any potential customer is a staff who are happy in their work; that is the basic requirement for any staff.  Some of them have given in excess of 30 years' service.  They are entitled to some expression of thanks from this House for the service they have rendered over the years.  I should like that to go on record to the staff of what will now be An Bord Telecom and An Post, a sincere thanks for the service they have rendered which is second to none. Granted since 1979 things have not been good.  Nobody would deny that.  Nonetheless, between 1922 and 1979, they had unbroken service, something which is without precedent in any democracy in which people are entitled to express their views regarding conditions of employment. The postal and telecommunications workers of this country have an envious record, something for which this State should be grateful.  It is only right that some Members would express their gratitude.</P>
      <P>I have no doubt that, with the formation of these new boards, both the present and former Ministers wanted to revitalise the whole organisation.  I hope they will achieve that goal.</P>

      <P>I would hope that the specialist services will be developed, that they will keep abreast of modern technology, winning back the business <Col N="1971" /> poached from them in the recent past. For example, in the postal service, there are the couriers and in the telecomunications service the PABX, which is quite lucrative despite the fact that the telecommunications side undertake the really difficult, heavy outside work.  The lucrative side of the business is given to private telephone companies who demand a high fee for their modern technology. I would hope that the telecommunications board will now enter into that field.</P>

      <P>Section 80: In page 41, lines 29 to 36, subsection (2) deleted.</P>
      <P>Subsection (2) was inserted by an amendment tabled by me on Report Stage in this House following an undertaking given by me on Committee Stage to consult the parliamentary draftsman about the wording of an amendment moved by the Opposition.  The purpose of the amendment was to ensure that all concerned, including public representatives, would be alerted in good time to any proposed closure of a sub-post office and so have an opportunity of making representations to the company.  This seemed reasonable and the Report Stage amendment met with general acceptance.</P>
      <P>In the meantime there had been representations from the Opposition spokesman on postal and telecommunications services and from the Irish Postmasters Union that the subsection was widely misunderstood and causing anxiety amongst postmasters.  Apparently it is seen as giving encouragement to the closure of sub-post offices.  Of course it does no such thing.  In order to allay what I am told is widespread anxiety amongst postmasters, I propose the deletion of the subsection.  Of course its deletion will not have the slightest effect on the practical position that any proposed closure of a sub-post office would be appropriately publicised in advance in the area concerned, and that there would be ample opportunity for public debate and representation on the matter, save of course in regard to disciplinary matters.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to express my appreciation to the Minister for his co-operation in relation to this subsection. The background outlined by the Minister is absolutely correct.  The actual subsection was originally an amendment of mine which was not pressed to a vote and <Col N="1973" /> the Minister agreed at the time that he would consider the amendment I put forward. He did so and returned with an amendment on Report Stage which was inserted in the Bill.  Since then there has been concern expressed by the Irish Postmasters Union.  I conveyed their representations to our spokesperson in the Seanad and directly also to the Minister. In fact last Thursday evening I had a brief discussion with the Minister when I told him I would be meeting the Irish Postmasters Union at the weekend.  I had a meeting with the Irish Postmasters Union executive members on Saturday last in Roscommon when we discussed the background to this subsection.  I felt they deserved more security of tenure than was included in their contract.  I must admit that the Minister was very anxious to include a subsection which would guarantee them as far as possible security of tenure of office.  That is the background to the actual amendment which was included and which is now being deleted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Furthermore, as I conveyed to the Irish Postmasters Union, my information from experience of working within the Department is that the contract being used at the time I was there &mdash; and I believe it is still in use at present &mdash; is one which states at section 5 that the service of a postmaster may be discontinued without notice should the Department in any circumstances decide on such a course and that no compensation will be payable to a postmaster for loss of office.  That is the contract which a postmaster signs.  On their appointment there is a requirement of them to give three months' notice, in advance, to the Department prior to their resigning from their post.  I understand from the Irish Postmasters Union that they have an understanding with the Department that for conciliation and arbitration the three months would apply both ways.  From my experience within the Department, however, that is not the case.  Indeed, having obtained advice on certain occasions, my understanding is that the contract could be adhered to exactly as it stands.  Furthermore, it is my understanding that An Post will inherit all the contracts of postmasters, that the existing contracts signed will apply and <Col N="1974" /> will be those inherited by the new board. Nevertheless it is my view that there should be some section of the Bill which would give security of tenure to postmasters. As it happens, the postmasters themselves initiated the request to have this subsection removed.  I requested the Minister to do so and he kindly agreed.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate that, as far as he is concerned, he will ensure that postmasters are not dismissed and that sub-post offices are not closed.  It is a matter that causes me grave concern because of the great service which has been provided by the postmasters throughout this country, over 2,087 of them working for the Department in a most dependable and reliable way.  I understand from the new chief executive, Mr. Garvey, that he has plans to utilise the sub-post offices to a greater extent.  I hope there will not be any problem in the future as far as security of tenure is concerned. The present remuneration for such people is below subsistence level.  In fact, it is less than what a person on unemployment assistance would receive. Postmasters are held in high esteem in rural areas and the public have a false impression that they are very wealthy. That is untrue in many instances.  I can show from my records that many postmasters receive a remuneration of between £35 and £40 per week.  At least 120 postmasters have an income of £1,382 and that is well below subsistence level. For that miserly sum they must maintain an office, provide heat and light and pay rates to the local authority.  They do not receive a pension at the conclusion of their service.  They receive a letter of gratitude from the Minister similar to the one sent to staff after 40 years' service. Those who have 40 years' service in the Department will at least have a reasonable pension but postmasters do not receive a pension even if they have served for 50 years.</P>

      <P>In my view it is relevant and it clarifies our motivation in asking the Minister to provide security of tenure <Col N="1975" /> as far as possible.  The Postmasters Union would prefer if this section was not included.  I am aware that the Minister is concerned about the remuneration for such people and that he is having consultations in regard to this.  I appeal to the Department to conclude an agreement prior to vesting date or otherwise the whole question of remuneration will have to be opened again.  The Department before vesting date should make an honourable settlement so that postmasters will get a decent weekly wage.</P>
      <P>I appeal to the new board not to consider the closure of any sub-post offices which provide an essential service in rural areas.  Those areas are losing their schools and other essential services and the sub-post office is the last service available to them.  The new board should ensure that sub-post offices are not closed unless with the agreement of the Postmasters Union.</P>

In regard to the section it is highly unlikely that the Department would give a licence to provide a telephone service above and beyond that provided by the new board.  Nevertheless the safeguard has been included in the Bill but it does not prevent the provision of internal telephone services.  The new board should give attention to the provision of internal telephone services.  The Department and the new board will be in an ideal position to provide a first-class internal service.  In future years the new board will find that the demand for installations will reduce because we have peaked in this regard.  In the next five years we should be in a position to provide telephones on demand.  That ambition was outlined in a programme some years ago and when that occurs it will be necessary for Bord Telecom Éireann to develop new features regarding internal telephone services.  I am aware that there is an excellent internal telephone service in the GPO, one which would be ideal for private enterprise.  We will not go into the SL console about which the Minister is aware having made wild allegations which later proved to be totally incorrect.</P>

      <P>Bord Telecom Éireann will have to develop the sales area and utilise the excellent engineering headquarters we provided.  In co-operation with An Post they should provide sales offices throughout the country to sell their equipment such as the Shannon telephone developed by Ericsson of Athlone, a concern that provides many jobs.  Bord Telecom Éireann will have to give consumers a choice of telephone consoles. That is an area of great concern to the staff because they realise that the ambition is to be able to provide telephones on demand.</P>

      <P>I hope these amendments will go some way towards averting what could be the greatest disaster.  There is no other section in the service that could be as attractive to any outside concern as telecommunications.  It could be the most lucrative area.  For that reason I hope the amendments will tighten up the likelihood of the issuing of the licences.</P>

      <P>I am talking about what I consider would be a means of generating finance in the interest of the State rather than of any group of individuals. Vast amounts of money can be made in this area of telecommunications. I have referred already to an area which I consider the Post Office have neglected up to now, namely, the PABX.  The Post Office carry out the very expensive cabling operations that are necessary to provide the service throughout the country but then someone else takes over. This was due to negligence on the part of some of the people who were charged with that responsibility.  I hope that under the new system efforts will be made to win back this work because I consider that the future of the telecommunications industry depends on it.  The earlier amendments accepted by the Minister will go a long way towards ensuring that the company have a free hand to exploit the full potential of what they have at their disposal, namely, the advanced technology for which the State has paid dearly in recent years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum exceeding £379,480,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Posts and Telegraphs and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I move this Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs at an historic moment.  The Oireachtas has just enacted the Postal and Telecommunications Services Bill, 1982.  Before the next Estimate An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann will be vested.  Therefore, this should be the last Estimate for the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as it has existed since the foundation of the State.  The Post Office is the oldest Department of State and will celebrate its 200th anniversary next year.  I hope the new arrangements will also last 200 years and that they will be as successful in their time as the Post Office has been in its time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to thank all those who have been associated with the Bill, including Deputy Wilson and Deputy Leyden and <Col N="1980" /> all my predecessors going back to Deputy Faulkner.  I wish to thank all Deputies, particularly Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy De Rossa, who played an active part in the debates.  I wish to thank also the staff of the Department who worked very hard in drafting the Bill and the amendments.  They deserve our warm congratulations and thanks for a job exceedingly well done.  I also wish everyone in the two services well in the future. I believe there is a bright future for both services.  It will not come automatically but it can be achieved given the commitment and effort.</P>
    <P>In relation to the postal service, the standard of service has improved considerably in recent years but it has not yet reached the standard we are aiming for. About 85 per cent of first-class letters are on average being delivered on the next working day following posting.  This is still below the service objective of 90 per cent for first-class letters.  The principal cause of the shortfall has been the persistent failure to clear the night mail dispatch at the Central Sorting Office in Dublin.  The causes, in turn, of that failure are complex.  However, the problem is being tackled and there are reasonable hopes of an improvement.</P>
    <P>Our postage rates have been criticised for being high, the comparison usually being with British rates.  Around four-fifths of the cost of the postal service is made up of pay and pay-related items and is heavily influenced by inflation, which has been very much higher here than in Britain.  For that reason alone &mdash; given the policy that the postal service has to pay its way &mdash; our rates would be higher than British rates.  But postal economics in Britain are also helped by the fact that postings per head of the population are about half as much again as they are here.</P>
    <P>This year I have insisted that there should be no increase in postal charges. This is the first time in several years that stamp prices have not increased.  I believe that this policy of price stability ought to be pursued for as long as possible.</P>
    <P>The postal service is a price sensitive one and for some years volume of mail has declined as prices increased.  The first <Col N="1981" /> four months of this year have witnessed an encouraging increase in volume and this is the trend to be pursued if the postal service is to be of its best.  On the basis of the improvement in the quality of service that has taken place and of maintenance of postage rates at current levels for this year, I am confident that mail volumes will rise again as economic activity picks up.</P>
    <P>My Department are in the business of handling cash on a very large scale.  Consequently, the problem of security has always had considerable attention. Regrettably there has been an increase in the incidence of armed robbery, a development not peculiar to this country.  We have taken a range of measures to combat this and they appear to have had some success.  A special crime prevention unit is in operation in the Department.  All cash carrying and cash-holding arrangements as well as the physical aspects of security are kept constantly under review to ensure that they are as satisfactory as possible.  The prime concern at all times is the personal safety of all the people working in the postal service.</P>
    <P>Severe financial constraints have been placed on my Department this year as part of the general strategy to reduce public expenditure.  The postal service will be hard put to it to conduct its operations within its money allocations while maintaining the quality of service at an acceptable level.  To help in this some services which are clearly very little used and which are over-expensive to provide are being examined to see if they should be ceased or restricted.  To date, economies have been made mainly through the cessation of Saturday deliveries completed in 1981 and the motorisation of rural deliveries which, despite the increase in motoring costs, continues to show scope for economies.</P>
    <P>Progress continues to be made in the purchase of sites for the erection of new post offices and in improvement schemes. The new post office at Mullingar was formally opened on 16 June last.  Major improvement works are going ahead at Castleblayney and New Ross.  Work has commenced on the fitting out of new delivery offices in Clondalkin and <Col N="1982" /> Tallaght.  Tenders are being invited for the new post office in Shannon and for major renovations to Roscrea post office. Postal sites have been acquired in Athlone, Carrick-on-Suir, Galway, Lifford, Tralee and Waterford and legal formalities are in progress for the purchase of postal sites at Bandon and Cork.</P>
    <P>New services are also being developed. I am especially pleased to report on the success of Ireland's first Postbus service, launched in County Clare in July last year.  This service, as well as carrying mails, conveys passengers on a route linking Ennis twice daily with Ennistymon, Lahinch, Lisdoonvarna, Corofin and other intermediate points.  My Department are currently examining the feasibility of introducing the service on other routes.</P>
    <P>On the international scene last September a new bulk parcelpost service to the United States was introduced, which is designed to reduce conveyance time to the USA utilising air services between Shannon and New York.</P>
    <P>Our postage stamps play an important part in presenting an image of Ireland both at home and abroad.  They also represent a source of sizeable revenue to my Department.  Considerable strides have been made in the marketing of our stamps in recent years.  Last year revenue from philately came to £1.3 million.  The major part of this amount came from overseas sales.  Marketing efforts are being strengthened to increase this revenue further.</P>
    <P>By the end of next year, Ireland will have one of the most advanced telephone systems in Europe.  Already in large parts of the country, including one-third of Dublin, new phone applications are met on demand.  As each month passes more and more areas will be on demand and by December 1984 almost the entire country will have phones readily available. Indeed, from 1985 onwards, I can foresee a situation whereby people will be encouraged to seek additional phones.</P>
    <P>What I have just said needs to be said because of the very persistent and widespread media coverage which tends to suggest little or no progress has been made in recent years.  Of course, we will <Col N="1983" /> have considerable problems but the five year programme commenced in 1979 is largely on target and should by the time the five years are up at the end of next year be almost completed.</P>
    <P>I cannot claim much credit for this although some significant improvements have been made in recent months. Largely the credit must go to my predecessors Conor Cruise-O'Brien, Deputy Padraig Faulkner, Deputy Albert Reynolds, Deputy Pat Cooney and Deputy John Wilson.  Moreover, an enormous development task was taken on with zest by officials of my Department and the progress I have spoken about, which will become manifest as the months go by, is in no small measure due to them.</P>
    <P>In the very near future I will be announcing further steps which have been or are about to be taken to improve further my Department's performance in the telecommunications area.  We are now in the fourth year of the current five year development programme and it would be appropriate at this juncture to review what progress has been made towards meeting the targets on that programme. I would have liked to deal extensively with this service in the course of my speech but in the time available to me this will not be possible.  However, I will cover as much ground as possible.</P>
    <P>The programme set out to achieve six main objectives.  These were: to wipe out the waiting list for telephones; to convert all manual exchanges to automatic working; to extend STD to all areas of Northern Ireland and Britain; to reduce call failure on the automatic system to 2 per cent on local calls and 4 per cent on internal trunk calls; to provide an acceptable repair service; to answer 90 per cent of calls made via operators within 10 seconds.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the programme in 1980, the waiting list for telephones was about 90,000.  This represented the equivalent of about two years work.  The target was to reduce that to the equivalent of two to three months work.  The present target is that the waiting list is under 70,000 or the equivalent of about 12 months installation capacity.  Based on <Col N="1984" /> the current rate of demand for telephones and on the connection targets for this year being met, the waiting list at the end of this year will be the equivalent of eight to nine months output.  The action already taken in building up resources of staff and equipment will, it is expected, enable the target of wiping out the waiting list nationally to be reached by the end of 1984.  In parts of the country the waiting list has already been wiped out.</P>
    <P>Dublin, where the waiting list is about 45,000 at present, is the main area of concern.  The progress made so far has been much less spectacular than in most other districts.  There have been particular reasons for this.  Most of the problems have now been resolved or are in the course of being resolved.</P>
    <P>The aim this year is to instal up to 35,000 telephones in the Dublin area.  If this is achieved, and it will not be easy to do so because the resources did not become available in time, the waiting list would be reduced to about 35,000, and I believe the target of being on demand by the end of next year is attainable.  I should add that it is possible to meet about one-third of applications in the Dublin area on demand at the present time.</P>
    <P>Confusion has been created by some commentators who asserted that because the Department were not making the number of connections that were envisaged at the beginning of the programme, it was falling down in meeting the programme objectives.  This is not so.  What was planned was to wipe out the waiting lists by the end of 1984 and to make whatever connections were needed to achieve this.  Clearly, more connections cannot be made than the demand supports. It is important for an appreciation of what is involved and what has been achieved that this should be clearly understood.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of the five year programme, about 11 per cent of telephone subscribers had only a manual service. At present there are 370 manual exchanges and the expectation this year is to convert about 130 of these to automatic working, leaving 5 per cent of subscribers with a manual service.  Much of the development work for converting the <Col N="1985" /> remaining 240 exchanges to automatic working is in hands and the programme should be completed by the end of next year or very largely so.</P>
    <P>Belfast was the only area in Northern Ireland to which subscriber trunk dialling was available from automatic areas here and calls to only Birmingham, Edinburgh, Glasgow, London, Manchester and Liverpool in Britain could be dialled. STD was extended to all areas in Northern Ireland late last year and to all of Britain in April and June of this year.</P>
    <P>The failure rate on trunk calls within the country at the beginning of 1980 was over 40 per cent.  Since then substantial progress has been made.  Two key trunk exchanges have been provided in Dublin, the hub of the trunk system; major trunk exchanges have been opened in Cork, Limerick, Galway, Athlone, Mullingar, Tralee, Portlaoise and Naas, and others are due to be opened at Waterford, Sligo, Drogheda and Dundalk over the course of the remainder of this year.  The trunk failure rate is now below 20 per cent.  The target this year is to reduce it to 12 per cent or so.  A failure rate of 4 per cent by the end of next year, which was the target set by the Post Office Review Group, is in prospect.  The failure rate on the local automatic service is already below the target rate of 2 per cent set.  The standard of international service has always been high and continues to be so.  Progress in this whole area is clearly satisfactory.</P>
    <P>The standard of repair service is a critical factor.  In general, faults in exchanges and in subscribers' premises are attended to quite quickly.  Repairs to cables, particularly underground cables, can take time.  The standard of the repair service on cables outside the Dublin area is in general satisfactory.</P>
    <P>In the Dublin area the repair position has been much less than satisfactory over a long period.  To get the position under control almost all jointing staff on installation work were diverted to maintenance for the second half of last year and much of this year.  The position is now much improved, all but some difficult faults being cleared in less than two weeks, but this is still less than satisfactory. However, the action being taken <Col N="1986" /> should bring the position under control and so greatly improve the prospect of giving a good quality repair service.</P>
    <P>I would now like to say something about telephone accounts.  These have been the subject of fairly widespread comment and, I think it is fair to say, unease.  Many measures have been taken to improve the position:</P>
    <P>(1)  The number of units used is now shown on the bill;</P>
    <P>(2)  All meters are now read by meter photographs and processed by computer to reduce the scope for clerical errors.</P>
    <P>(3)  Meters to enable subscribers to check their own usage are now available at a rental.</P>
    <P>(4)  The percentage of cases in which callers making trunk calls via the operator are now rung back has been greatly increased, thus virtually eliminating the risk of fraud in telephone numbers being quoted.</P>
    <P>(5)  Details of subscriber dialled trunk calls will be given to some subscribers in the Naas area, on a trial basis, about the end of this year.  A charge to cover the costs involved will be made.  If the trial is successful and if there is a demand for this service, similar arrangements will be made for subscribers at other exchange areas where it is practicable to do so.</P>
    <P>I must stress that the metering equipment used here is the same as that used in many other telephone administrations and is highly reliable.  The billing system is, essentially, sound and the availability of meters for subscribers who would like to be able to check their usage should, I believe, meet the case of those subscribers reasonably.</P>
    <P>Before leaving telecommunications, I should say that the waiting list for telex has been virtually eliminated outside Dublin and in Dublin the backlog will, it is expected, be largely overtaken this year.</P>
    <P>There has been a peak demand for data lines and for modems to enable computer data to be transmitted over the telephone <Col N="1987" /> system.  Substantial inroads will be made into this in the current year and the position should be well on the way to being under control by the end of the year.</P>
    <P>Finally, I would like to refer to some new developments.  The first is a mobile car radio system and it is expected it will be in service early next year, initially in the Dublin area.  A new packet switching data system will also be in service early next year.</P>
    <P>An earth station which will give us direct access to satellite circuits to the North American continent should be ready for use next year.</P>

      <P>Deputy Seán Walsh will share the time with me.  I will take approximately ten minutes and I will give ten minutes of my time to Deputy Walsh.  I would like to thank the Chair most sincerely for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  I realise that it is very late in the night, that several other Deputies have been endeavouring to raise matters on the Adjournment and that it has been difficult for you to decide which matters are of importance and which should get priority for raising on the Adjournment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am raising this matter on the Adjournment because I consider it to be extremely important at this time.  We all know that Clondalkin Paper Mills are closed since 22 January 1982 and that approximately 350 workers are unemployed in that area.  They are skilled workers who have from five to 40 years service.  They have pursued their trade in the paper making industry and they are very anxious to know what their future is.  Those people have families and have now been unemployed for a long time.  I am endeavouring tonight to find out what <Col N="1989" /> will happen to the Clondalkin Paper Mills.  I am anxious that the Minister of State gives us a firm reply.  I do not want to be told that the Government are trying to sell the Clondalkin Paper Mills to Canadians, Germans or anybody else. That was tried without success in March 1982.  At that time the then Minister. Deputy Albert Reynolds, gave a commitment to open the Clondalkin Paper Mills on 9 June but that fell through.</P>
    <P>At that stage they were trying to sell the paper mills at Clondalkin to Canadians or Germans without success so I do not want to be told at this stage that that is still going on.  That situation went right on through the summer of 1982 and the Clondalkin Paper Mills were not opened. In November 1982 before the election the deal was almost brought to a conclusion and the then Minister, Deputy Albert Reynolds, gave a firm commitment that the mills would be opened. After the election, when the Coalition Government came into power, trade union members and the workers from Clondalkin Paper Mills met the Tánaiste, who stated that he would do everything he could to open the mills.  In February 1983 a meeting with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and members of the action committee of Clondalkin Paper Mills took place just before this year's budget. My information is that a deal was done. I am sorry if that is the wrong way to phrase it but I have been informed that the Coalition Government were very anxious to get their budget passed.  The union said they would withdraw their support from the Labour Party if the Coalition Government did not agree to re-open Clondalkin Paper Mills.  At 4.30 a.m. in the morning it was agreed to buy clondalkin Paper Mills.  I would like the Minister of State to say if this is the case because my information is that this happened.</P>
    <P>A sum of £1.75 million was paid to purchase Clondalkin Paper Mills because the Coalition Government were of the opinion that if they did not do this the Congress of Trade Unions would withdraw support from the Labour Party regarding the details of this year's budget and they would not agree to the implementation <Col N="1990" /> of the budget.  We know that the Minister in the Fianna Fáil Government gave a firm commitment on 16 November 1982 to re-open and refurbish Clondalkin Paper Mills and the incoming Coalition Government gave a firm undertaking that they would honour the commitment given by the previous Minister. I am trying to find out what the present situation is.  I know there is a care, maintenance and refurbishment agreement or plan to be submitted to the Department.  That means it is just a plan for care, maintenance and refurbishment, not to do the refurbishment.  The Government have not given any undertaking to carry out refurbishment of the mill.</P>
    <P>There is a sort of statement at the moment.  The Government will not say that they will definitely close the mill, although at a meeting about two weeks ago when the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy John Bruton, met members of the action groups and members of the trade union, he stated emphatically that the Government had no intention of opening the mills as a State or semi-State concern.  He said he would try to sell it to Canadians or anybody else who might be interested in purchasing it.  I want the Minister of State to tell us if that is true. If it is not true and the Government have no intention of opening the mill as a State or semi-State body what do they intend to do with the mill?  They bought the mill for £1.75 millions of State money.  Will they let the mill fall apart?  Will they do anything with it?  Will they leave it until it rots away?</P>
    <P>Every piece of paper we use in this House now is probably imported.  We need an Irish paper mills to make the paper we use every day.  I am trying to discover from the Government if they will allow this industry to disintegrate? Will we in the future use paper in this House, on which our Bills are printed, which has been imported?  It would be a disaster if we allowed this paper industry to dissipate.</P>
    <P>There is another thing I do not know a lot about but I have heard people speaking about it on more than one occasion. I believe the trees in our forests, which <Col N="1991" /> were planted 50 years ago, are about ready to be harvested and that trees could be used in the paper pulp industry.  Wood is being sold at £1 a ton or some such ridiculous price out of a port in the south while we could be using it here.  Is all that industry to fall by the wayside?  I want a definite answer tonight from the Minister of State.  I ask him please to tell the workers at Clondalkin Paper Mills whether they will get their jobs back and whether the mills will reopen.  If not what exactly is to happen to Clondalkin Paper Mills?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanWalsh" hpid="Mr. S. Walsh Mr. S. Walsh">

      <P>I would like to associate myself with the words of Deputy Lemass in thanking you, a Cheann Comhairle, for allowing this matter to be raised and I thank the Minister of State for coming here tonight.  This has been a long day, but this is a very important matter for areas such as Clondalkin and Tallaght, two new towns in developing County Dublin.</P>
      <P>We heard in a reply to a parliamentary question yesterday that something like 2,000 people are on the unemployed list in Clondalkin and 3,000 on the unemployed list in Tallaght.  Both of these towns have been served very well by Clondalkin Paper Mills in regard to employment.  I hope that the Minister of State will clarify the position tonight once and for all regarding the future of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  After discussions between the Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Bruton, the ICTU and the action committee, grave doubts exist in the minds of the workers there and of the action committee about the future of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  Will they ever re-open?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is true that Fianna Fail gave a commitment regarding the mills prior to the general election in 1982 but the mills are now in the ownership of the Government. According to a reply to a parliamentary question addressed to the Taoiseach on 19 April this year about £200 million worth of paper was imported into this country in 1982.  Therefore, the markets are there.  Many of the workers in Clondalkin Paper Mills have over 40 <Col N="1992" /> years experience in the paper making business.  It is possible that the mills may have been overstaffed prior to the partial closure in 1981 and the final closure in 1982, but during discussions with the former Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Reynolds, agreement was reached that the mills, if reopened, would employ a work force of about 250.  The re-opening of the mills in the very near future and the re-employment of some of the former staff would be of great benefit not only to Clondalkin, Tallaght and Ballyfermot but to the country in general.</P>
    <P>The mills have been purchased and are in the ownership of the Government.  I am surprised that some of the Deputies supporting the Government are so quiet about this matter.  I was invited to a meeting organised by the action committee and the former employees of Clondalkin Paper Mills in June 1982.  This meeting took place after the by-election in Dublin West when Deputy Skelly was elected. Deputy Skelly was at that meeting. Deputy Lemass was the defeated candidate in that by-election, and Deputy Skelly attributed a great deal of his success to the fact that Clondalkin Paper Mills remained closed.  A number of other Deputies, some of them not now in this House but in the Upper House, were present at the meeting, as also was Deputy Taylor representing the Labour Party, and they all gave a commitment that if they were returned to office Clondalkin Paper Mills would be reopened.  I do not like to criticise people in their absence and I am disappointed that some of these Deputies are not here tonight. We had to accept a good deal of criticism on that occasion in 1982.  We were the Government of the day and we had a duty to provide employment for the people of Clondalkin, Tallaght and the surrounding district.</P>
    <P>I understand that agreement was reached in regard to care and maintenance.  I am well aware of the difficulties involved in getting the wheels to roll.  I hope that the Minister will give the commitment we are seeking here tonight and that we will leave here quite happy about the future of the mills.</P>
    <P>In reply to another parliamentary <Col N="1993" /> question yesterday addressed to the Minister we were told the IDA had plans to encourage new industries to establish themselves in the areas of Clondalkin and Tallaght.  The industry we are discussing has been there for years.  The skills and experience of the workers in Clondalkin, Tallaght, Ballyfermot and so on, in some families amounting to 35, 40 and 50 years, must not be lost.</P>

      <P>I would like to associate myself with the remarks of Deputy Lemass and Deputy Walsh.  I too have been involved from time to time with the workers in Clondalkin Paper Mills.  They have been treated very shabbily during the past couple of years.  It is extraordinary that the Government, having committed themselves to buying this factory, have not made moves to have it reopened.  As Deputy Lemass stated, timber can be utilised in industry here and it is remarkable that it is being exported at £1 a ton and no effort is being made to produce the paper which this House and the local authorities use in abundance.  I ask the Minister of State to confirm on what date it is intended to reopen the factory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry and Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful for the opportunity of clarifying once again the Government's position with regard to Clondalkin Paper Mills.  The Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy J. Bruton, dealt with the question at some length in his reply on the Estimate for the Department on 21 June 1983.  He stated:</P>
      <P>The aim I have in regard to this Mill is to provide an attractive opportunity for the recommencement of papermaking, on an entirely viable and economical basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to note that this is the criterion which the Minister has laid <Col N="1994" /> down for the re-opening of the paper mills.  He went on to state:</P>
    <P>I believe it is very important that we obtain a substantial participation, on a risk-bearing basis, by other interests apart from the State in papermaking in Clondalkin.</P>
    <P>That is the position of the Government. It is not very different from the position taken by the former Minister for Industry and Energy, Deputy Reynolds, in his advice to the then Fianna Fáil Government. My understanding is that he regarded his remit as securing the re-opening of the mill on a basis which would provide viable employment in the long-term and he was very much aware of the involvement of the IDA and their attempts to attract an outside purchaser. It is important to note that the positions of the two Governments are not very dissimilar.  Despite all the ballyhoo, it was this Government who purchased the assets of the mill last March for £1.75 million.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EileenLemass" hpid="Mrs. Lemass Mrs. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What do they intend to do with it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Since then the Minister for Industry and Energy has been acting for the Government in seeking to have the mills re-opened on a viable basis. There is no point in re-opening the mills on a short-term basis knowing that the undertaking will not succeed and will not be profitable.  The Government are committed to re-opening the mills on a basis which will be sustainable in the long run.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The best prospect lies in the involvement of private interests which would be prepared to share the substantial risks.  A number of possibilities were explored and Deputy Lemass referred to them.  In the absence of firm financial commitments no satisfactory proposals have as yet emerged.  The most reasonable prospect appears to be a proposal submitted by Canadian interests.  It is important to note that those Canadian interests which are currently being considered by my Department and the IDA are not the same interests that were present a year ago.  These negotiations are proceeding <Col N="1995" /> actively and it would be premature to make further comment at this stage.  It must be stressed that the Minister is not the sole arbiter of the pace of these negotiations and that the setting of a date for the re-opening of the mills is not possible at this time.  I share the concern expressed and assure the House that it is the Government's objective to re-open the mills at the earliest possible date on a basis that will provide sound long-term employment.</P>
    <P>Since the Government acquired the assets of the mills essential care and maintenance work has been carried out to ensure that the building and plant do not deteriorate.  Most of this work was completed recently, leaving only certain structural repairs on hand.  A detailed and extensive study is being done in tandem with this work on the refurbishing requirements of the mills.  Decisions on this work must be closely related to and influenced by developments regarding the participation by private interests in the operation of the mills.  The Government and my Department are acting very responsibly in this regard.  We have clearly stated the basis on which the re-opening of the mills can take place.  This will require the involvement of private interests and the profitable operation of the mills.  Any other basis would not secure long-term employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lemass mentioned the pulp mills.  These mills were closed in 1980 and are not involved in the question we are at present discussing.  Their main customer in England closed down.  The pulp mills are owned by the Clondalkin Group and were not involved in the closure and <Col N="1996" /> the subsequent purchase by the State of the paper mills.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh asked about the value of imports of paper products.  The figure quoted of £200 million does not necessarily mean that paper to this value can be produced profitably in Ireland. That is a matter which must fall to be determined by the new owners of the mills &mdash; the Government and private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The Government's position was made very clear to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions on 22 June.  It is understood that we are not prepared to open the mills except on a viable basis and with the involvement of private interests.  That is a reasonable and responsible position.  It might not meet with the requirements of Deputies opposite but we have a responsibility to ensure that public funds are expended on a sound and intelligent basis.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the difficulties faced by former workers at the mills during the past few months.  It is fair to point out that they were compensated by extrastatutory redundancy payments.  Even taking that into account, it is our wish that the mills should re-open at the earliest possible date and we will do everything in our power to secure the long-term viability of the mills.  Hopefully the negotiations in which we are involved will bear fruit and we can look forward to the re-opening of the mills in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>The Dail adjourned at 12.30 a.m. on Thursday, 7 July, 1983 until 10.30. a.m.</P>

    <P>Notes on Col. 1:</P>
    <P>5 of the 10 posts were filled by officers seconded from other Departments.</P>
    <P>Two posts of Counsellor were filled by officers from the Departments of Agriculture and Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Two posts at Third Secretary level were filled by officers from the Department of Agriculture (one of these was Trade Officer in Liverpool) and one post by an officer from the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>(b)  Reasons for staff increases</P>
    <P>Col. 2:</P>
    <P>One Counsellor post was upgraded to Minister Plenipotentiary because of the higher level of contacts in Anglo/Irish relations.</P>
    <P>An extra officer at Third Secretary level was seconded from the Department of Agriculture because of the increased workload arising from the growth in agricultural trade.</P>
    <P>Col. 3:</P>
    <P>The five years from 1970-1975 marked the period of greatest expansion by the Embassy since it was established.  In all the number of the diplomatic staff increased by 5.</P>
    <P>Three posts &mdash; one each at Counsellor, First Secretary and Third Secretary level&mdash;were established to deal with the growing volume of work relating to press and Northern Ireland affairs.</P>
    <P>One post of Third Secretary, Agriculture, was upgraded to First Secretary because of the increase in the level of duties and responsibilities.</P>
    <P>A new post of Labour Attache was created at First Secretary level to which an officer of the Department of Labour was seconded.</P>
    <P>A post of First Secretary was created to deal with European political affairs following accession by Ireland to the European Communities.</P>
    <P>Col. 4:</P>
    <P>No change.</P>
    <P>Col. 5:</P>
    <P>One post of Third Secretary, Agriculture, was suppressed following the closure of the Trade Office in Liverpool.</P>
    <P>(c)  Cost of Embassy</P>
    <P>Figures for the total cost of the embassy to the exchequer are available in respect of recent years only as the computerisation of accounts in the Department was not completed until 1980 and accurate records are not readily available for earlier years.  The total cost to the Votes for Foreign Affairs and the Office of Public Works for the embassy in London for 1981 and 1982 amounted to: 1981, £789,000; 1982, £1,026,000.</P>

I have also recently advised local authorities of a substantial reduction, amounting to over £1½ million, in the 1983 demand on local authorities for arterial drainage.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 623 and 624 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There were two abnormal disruptions to telephone service in the Galway area during the week commencing Monday, 20 June.  The first occurred at 12 noon on 23 June when the coaxial cable from Galway to Athlone was accidentally dug up by a county council contractor.  A number of circuits on this route were disrupted until 5.30 p.m.  The second occurred on June 24 when a fault on power equipment in the old Galway <Col N="1800" /> exchange disrupted service intermittently between 8.45 a.m. and 2.30 p.m.</P>
    <P>While the quality of service in Galway city and county is not yet satisfactory there have been improvements with the coming into service of the new trunk exchange at Mervue at the end of April last.  Further improvements will follow with the bringing into service of a new radio-link between Clifden and Galway in the next few weeks and the bringing into service shortly of a new 1800 circuit radio link between Galway and Dublin. Other measures include the progressive transfer over the next nine months or so of the exchanges at Oranmore, Kilcolgan, Claregalway, Turloughmore, Corrandulla, Inverin, Carraroe to the trunk exchange at Mervue and the conversion of the remaining manual exchanges in County Galway to automatic working.</P>

      <P>The Deputy is no doubt aware that with effect from the close of business on Friday, I July 1983 the principal associated bank lending rates were reduced by 1¼ percentage points in the case of the AAA and AA rates and 1 percentage point in the case of the A rate.  Reductions ranging from 1 percentage point to 1¾ percentage points were made at the same time in associated bank deposit rates.</P>
      <P>These reductions were facilitated by a fall in interest rates in the Dublin interbank market.  They bring the AAA and AA lending rates back to the levels which obtained immediately prior to the increase of 18 March last.  The reductions bring the A lending rates down to their lowest level since May 1981.</P>
      <P>There does not appear to be any scope at present for further reductions in associated bank interest rates.  Future domestic interest rate movements will depend on international trends and on the degree of progress at home in reducing inflation, the balance of payments deficit and the Exchequer borrowing requirement.</P>

      <P>Under the provisions of the Social Welfare Acts a person must have at least 156 contributions paid since entry into insurance in order to qualify for payment of disability benefit for a period exceeding 52 weeks.</P>
      <P>According to the records of the Department, the person concerned had a total of only 111 such contributions since entry into insurance.  Her entitlement to disability benefit was exhausted on 26 August 1977 when she had received benefit for 52 weeks but she was subsequently paid in error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1817" /> In order to requalify for payment of disability benefit, a person whose entitlement to benefit is exhausted needs a total of at least 13 weeks of insurable employment, in respect of which contributions at the appropriate rate have been paid, after the date on which the title to benefit became exhausted.  According to the records of the Department the person concerned had seven such weeks of employment in 1978-79 and has not been in employment since.  She therefore needs a further six weeks of insurable employment before she can requalify for disability benefit.</P>
