      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>I was saying last night that there is a complete lack of confidence in Bord Iascaigh Mhara on the part of fishermen. Frustration has been building up in fishermen over a period of years.  The first retrograde step taken by BIM was when they opted out of the marketing of fish.  There is little or no supervision by BIM or by any agency of the State now on some of the buyers of fish.  It is disgraceful in the extreme that as lately as four weeks ago fish buyers could issue cheques with nothing behind the cheques and really take the Howth fishermen to the cleaners.  I am quite sure the Minister or the Minister of State has seen a photostat of some of those dubious cheques. It is indeed a sad state of affairs for the industry when these fly-by-night buyers can operate at will, and I would hope that from today onwards at least some precautionary measure will be taken.</P>
      <P>In response to parliamentary questions some time ago I was informed that 75 per cent of all the fishing fleet in this country was in arrears.  That is indeed a sorry mess to be in.  If that trend continues I have no reason to believe otherwise than that the fishing industry is doomed for all time.  There is a crying need at present for a rescue agency such as Fóir Teoranta to look after fishermen and I ask the Minister or the Minister of State to set up such an agency.  Can anyone in this House visualise the hardship, humiliation and the anxiety of a fishing family and their relatives who have been fishing for years when they see their trawlers repossessed and taken out of the harbours?  We are going back to the penal days when the landlord sent his men to batter in the door and the tenants were evicted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1980, 20 trawlers have been repossessed and the loss to the State of the repossession and resale is almost £3 million.  Of the 20 boats which were repossessed, nine were resold to Irish fishermen.  There was no mention of how the others were disposed of.  Some of those boats which were repossessed over the years have been left to rot in harbours and been written off as bad debts by BIM in their annual accounts.  It would be better if the fishermen who originally <Col N="1049" /> owned these boats were allowed to continue fishing and given advice as to how they could meet their arrears.</P>
    <P>Let no one construe from my remarks that I am in favour of people who get a boat, drink the money and make no effort whatsoever to repay their loan.  However, I know that 98 per cent of the repossessed boats are repossessed for genuine reasons.  A little sympathy, concern, understanding and maybe a little psychology should be shown to fishermen who are in this predicament.  The time has come for officials of BIM, civil servants in the Department of Fisheries and the Minister to leave Dublin occasionally and head for Castletownbere, Caherciveen, Dingle, Achill Sound, Killybegs and Galway and listen to the fishermen explaining their point of view and the difficulties they have in meeting their repayments.  When the Minister is appointing members to BIM I hope, from now on, that it will be done on a regional basis and that every area will be represented and every shade of opinion will be respected at board level.</P>
    <P>It is no wonder the fishermen are frustrated when they see Spanish trawlers shooting off their bow capturing all kinds of fish, and yet there is no monitoring on those catches.  How many times has an Irish fishery official gone aboard Spanish trawlers to inspect their catches?  It is very significant that the catch of one boat which came into Castletownbere recently was discovered to have 60 per cent of under-sized fish.  What about the Spanish trawlers fishing within our limits who are legally entitled to a quota because some of them have traditional rights there? They head straight back for Spain.  Is their catch ever inspected?  Has any Irish official ever gone to the trouble of seeing that the catch of that trawler is inspected in Spain if he was not prepared to board the trawler off Achill Island or Inishvickillaune?</P>
    <P>Fishermen know there has been little or no supervision of the total Spanish fishing operation off our coast.  How many times has the gear been inspected? How many Spanish trawlers have been brought into port and prosecuted because they have illegal fishing gear on board? <Col N="1050" /> Did anyone hear of such a prosecution? No, we do not care because the fishermen have not much political muscle.  More than likely, they will be fishing the day of the election and they will not make any great difference to the result.  We abandoned the 50 mile limit and then we came down to 12 miles.  Was it not a shame that, for the first time in the history of the State, some of our fishermen were sent to jail by the Fianna Fáil Government because they were fishing herrings in the Celtic Sea?  These men were left to rot in jail because they caught a few herring off Kinsale Head.  At the same time, other trawlers could fish right beside them and there were no prosecutions because no fishery official had the proper equipment such as wearing apparel specially designed for going into deep freeze stores which some of those Spanish, French and Dutch factory ships have.  Why was this situation allowed to continue?</P>
    <P>I appeal this morning to the Minister of State to make sure that there will not be a recurrence of this.  Everyone in this House expects to see legislation brought in before the recess which will prohibit the flags of convenience being flown by third countries.  At least that will be a small token of our concern for the fishermen. I cannot understand the reason for the delay in introducing this legislation. It has been mentioned here at least seven times in the last ten weeks and we are promised it day after day.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour should look into the matter of Spanish trawlers re-registered in Ireland and fishing in Irish EEC waters with Spanish crews, none of whom has a work permit.  The Department of Justice are very quick to afford special facilities to captured Spanish trawlers, having an immediate special sitting of the District Court so that these trawlers can go out and catch more fish. I suggest to all the Departments concerned that these people take their place in the queue and await their turn for a trial.  Why are they treated differently?</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister of State to take a look at Dingle Harbour, at my own back door.  The type of dredger sent there in 1972 was taken by lorry to Cromane and then went by sea to Dingle Harbour. <Col N="1051" /> The length of time it took to arrive and the amount of dredging which it carried out made it the joke of the century in the area.  I have appealed here several times to the Department of the Gaeltacht under successive Governments to have this harbour dredged.  Even at this late stage I make a final appeal.  Dingle harbour is tidal and if the channel is not kept clear the fishermen cannot gain entrance. The amount of money already spent on repairing the torn keels of boats using the harbour is unbelievable.</P>
    <P>Any remarks which I have made in this debate were not intended to be a reflection on the Minister for Fisheries or his Minister of State.</P>

      <P>Ba mhaith liom an deis seo a ghlacadh chun comhgháirdeas a dhéanamh leis an Aire Stáit, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, agus leis an Aire é féin, Deputy Paddy O'Toole, as ucht iad a <Col N="1052" /> ainmniú mar Aire agus Aire Stáit don Roinn Iascaigh, Foraoiseachta agus na Gaeltachta, agus a chinntiú don Aire go bhfaighidh siad gach cuidiú ón taobh seo den Teach más rud é go bhfuil sé ar mhaitheas gach duine atá baint aige le tionscal na hiascaireachta.</P>
      <P>I am only too well aware of the importance of the forestry and fisheries industries. Their potential is far from being realised.  If the proper measures are taken, however, the full potential of these industries can be realised, but urgent measures must be applied in a number of critical areas.  It is important to point out that the raw materials on which both these industries are based are renewable resources and renewable resources must at all times be conserved.</P>
      <P>That brings me to the subject of conservation. We must ensure that all our fishery stocks are conserved, including all types of fish &mdash; salmon, shelfish, all white fish, herrings and, at the moment, particularly mackerel.  We must ensure that the conservation programme is implemented, uniformly enforced and monitored by the EEC.  I hope that the EEC base will be here on our west coast but I shall refer to that later.</P>
      <P>I pose a suggestion which I have made on numerous occasions in the past &mdash; that all boats fishing within EEC waters should have observers on board to monitor all the catches and ensure that quotas are not exceeded.  If quotas are exceeded &mdash; and I am speaking in a European sense &mdash; the death knell of the fishing industry will be sounded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to monitoring quotas, these observers could ensure that scientific knowledge is made available to the industry. That would serve a useful purpose in making availble such knowledge as the type of gear used, the water temperature, the plankton content of the water and aids in detecting spawning areas and the location of other species of fish.  They could do all this in their capacity as observers on behalf of the European Community, building up this bank of scientific knowledge which would prove invaluable to the industry.  The Minister should try to ensure that all that information is fed back to a base which should <Col N="1053" /> be located on our west coast, not because we want it to be based in Ireland but because that is the best and most advantageous location for it.</P>
    <P>If we adopted this suggested system, it would ensure that only the total allowable catch recommended by the scientists would be landed, thus enabling the supply of all types of fish to be sustained.  We must ensure that the scientific knowledge is given to us earlier in the year.  For many years it has been made available too late. It is not the fault of any Minister, but it is ludicrous that now, at the end of June 1983, we are discussing the 1983 quotas, instead of those for 1984.  It is time that we ensured that these quotas are discussed earlier in the year.</P>
    <P>We should strive to add more value to all our products in the fishing industry. This would create much more employment ashore.  I am realistic enough to know that it would be a fallacy to suggest that that could be done overnight and that fish packets could be produced ready for the shelf in a short period.  All assistance should be given and processers encouraged to add as much value as possible, so that more people have jobs ashore.  This would be preferable to exporting fish in the raw state, making jobs available elsewhere, within or outside the EEC.  I realise that there are marketing problems attached to any developing industry when one is competing against the professional, established multinationals.  However, we must first strive to go up the added value scale in the hope that at some time in the future we will see ourselves at the top of it.</P>
    <P>There is urgent need for greater co-operation within the industry, possibly through a type of council. This could embrace the various sectors of the industry &mdash; the catching, processing, marketing and service sectors.  It would have the backing of the Government and the Department.  They would meet frequently and have discussions with the Department of Fisheries.  I have respect for the officials of the Department but a council such as this would be a tremendous asset to them.  It would involve various people who have practical <Col N="1054" /> experience and include the Irish Fisherman's Organisation and the Irish Fish Producers Organisation.  I compliment these bodies on their dedication and commitment to the industry.  They should have discussions not only with the Department but with BIM.  Reference was made to BIM by Deputy Begley and I have no doubt that the Minister will answer all the criticisms made, some of which I agree with and many of which I do not.</P>
    <P>The price structure in Europe, for historical reasons, is not sufficiently flexible to take account of changes in the market situation.  It is unfair that duty free fish in a frozen state are brought into the EEC from countries such as Canada.  This is affecting our competitiveness in Europe. We must ensure that this structure is altered to meet the changes in the market supply within the Community.  Sufficient allowance should be made in price negotiations to take account of freight costs and in particular our geographical location. We are two sea crossings away from the main markets in Europe and in third countries.  We are in a less competitive position than North Scotland or Plymouth where they are only one sea crossing from the main European markets.  The price is similar in Donegal or Kerry or anywhere along the coast where mackerel and so on are caught.  The cost of freight is as high as £65 a tonne so that in other countries they have that advantage over us.  Third countries should not be in a position to compete with us and so affect the price we obtain on the Continent. As a result processors are paying a lower price to fishermen and, irrespective of the price of fish, at the end of the day the fisherman suffers.  The processors can buy accordingly and it is the fishermen who have to take the brunt of the reduction in the price.</P>
    <P>When the Minister goes to Europe and any time he gets an opportunity he should ask the Commission to consider a price support for the industry comparable to that available for the agricultural industry. It may well be suggested that we cannot compare fishing with agriculture. If such a suggestion is made in Europe and if it is said that the differences are <Col N="1055" /> too great, the reason will be the attitude of the Europeans towards the fishing industry.  They always considered agriculture to be more important to them and consequently we are the sufferers.  Farmers receive a favourable hearing from the EEC while the fishing industry have only received limited support over the years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Daly referred to a national policy last night.  I am disappointed, having heard the Coalition Government suggest that immediately we had a Common Fisheries Policy this would be a base from which to develop a national policy, there was not one iota in the contribution made by the Minister last night to suggest there was any intention to bring a national policy before us.  A Common Fisheries Policy can only be used as a base and is only useful if we develop a national policy. Deputy Daly referred to this last night so I will leave it at that.</P>
    <P>There is a general proposal to reduce EEC quotas by one third.  We cannot accept this nor could we afford it.  As regards mackerel, a reduction from 80,000 tonnes to 55,000 will not be acceptable.  We will give the Minister every assistance from this side of the House in opposing this.  He must be as vociferous as is necessary to ensure that not only do we obtain the 80,000 tonnes we had last year but he has an obligation to veto any contrary decision and ensure that he comes back with a minimum of 100,000 tonnes.  That is what we require. Like other countries, we exceeded the quota last year.  That is indicative of the need for an increase.  It was necessary for fishermen to take in extra mackerel to ensure they could meet the repayments on their boats.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil were in Government we were told on numerous occasions that we had agreed to give 7,000 tonnes to the Danes.  We received no credit for anything we did which was right when the Common Fisheries Policy was signed.  We did not agree to give the Danes 7,000 tonnes.  That decision was wrong.  Hopefully we can accept the Europeans for what they are worth when they say that it is a once-off situation.  Over that period the Danes took 14,000 tonnes out of our <Col N="1056" /> waters.  If they were in a position to exceed the quota of 7,000 tonnes how can we believe they will not come in this year and take a substantial quantity of fish as well?  We must make sure they do not get in.  If they do come they must be taken to court and penalised.  I am not worried about the Northern section because the British are in a position to monitor the boats there.  They have all the facilities necessary.  We also should have the facilities. When in Government it was our intention to build a new protection vessel here and thus create further jobs.  This was the subject of a Private Members' Bill discussed here the other evening so I do not intend taking up the time of the House in discussing it now except to say that the Government should be committed to further protection in this area and to ensuring that these foreign boats and third country boats particularly &mdash; the Danes and others &mdash; do not continue to plunder our seas.</P>
    <P>If there is over-fishing, it is unfair that our fishermen should be expected to pay for the sins of other countries.  If there are to be reductions in quotas, they should be on an equitable basis.  We are not over-fishing our waters so it would be only fair that our fishermen be given an increase in the quotas instead of the Government taking the easy way out and slashing by one-third the quotas for every country.  I hope that the quotas being talked of will not be accepted but I understand that the Department have introduced a management scheme allowing quotas per boat per week as follows: 55 to 70 foot boats landing 150 tonnes per week; 75 foot-plus boats landing 200 tonnes per week; 75 to 90 foot boats landing 300 tonnes per week and 90 foot-plus boats landing 500 tonnes per week.  This is not acceptable.  It would not pay the fishermen to go out to catch those quantities in any one week.  The Minister must use any power of vetoing he may have in that regard.</P>
    <P>The practicality is that 55,000 tonnes would be a sufficient quota only for four large refrigerated seawater boats.  Each of those boats would bring in 12,000 tonnes per year.  Therefore, we need a quota of at least 100,000 tonnes.  In addition, <Col N="1057" /> 55,000 tonnes is far from sufficient so far as the processers are concerned. All along the coast from Kerry to Donegal and particularly at Killybegs, the processors have expanded their freezing capacity on the basis of increased landings.  Apart from the private and public cold storage facilities in Dublin, the freezing facilities in these other areas would become obsolete.</P>
    <P>If the Department introduce this 55,000 tonne quota, they will be attracting more freezing boats within a short period.  Even in the context of a 100,000 tonne quota, consultations would have to take place with the fishermen and with the processors to ensure that the maximum benefit is derived for them.</P>
    <P>As I said, we are not the offenders so far as over-fishing is concerned.  Last year the Dutch had a quota of 35,000 tonnes but they went cap in hand to the EEC and expressed regret for having caught 36,000 tonnes, one tonne more than the quota.  However, the Dutch Government claimed a subsidy from the EEC in respect of 190,000 tonnes.  We might ask where the Dutch caught the extra 150,000 tonnes.  They tell us that the fish was purchased from other countries within the EEC but that would not be too difficult to check out.  These other countries give reasonable statistics to the Commission but the figures do not add up in the end.  To claim export subsidy on 150,000 tonnes is indicative of what the Dutch propose doing.  Their present building programme is a measure of their intentions. They have progressed from the 1,000 horse power vessel in respect of which the catch is about 30 tonnes to the 2,000 horse power vessel in respect of which the catch is 50 or 60 tonnes and then to the 4,000 horse power vessel which is in the process of being built and which is capable of freezing between 130 and 150 tonnes.  We may ask what the Dutch propose doing with the 24,000 tonnes this year.  I have no doubt but that they intend fishing these larger boats and catching in excess of what they caught last year.  They are responsible, too, for the reduction in the export subsidy to third countries.  That subsidy was of tremendous benefit to us but I believe that <Col N="1058" /> it is because the Dutch have claimed five or six times in excess of what they should have claimed that the Europeans have decided to reduce the subsidy on a sliding scale to countries such as Ireland.  At the end of the day the fishermen are the people who are losing once again.</P>
    <P>The Government must provide an export credit guarantee for our exporters. There is this sort of provision available to our main competitors, the Dutch and the British.  In our case the export credit should be provided by the Industrial Credit Company with the risk being a great deal less now than it was in 1981-82.  I would refer in particular to November of last year.  The Minister and his officials must have been well aware of the gravity of the situation at that time when it appeared that the fishermen would have to terminate the season in mid-November because of the impossibility of exporting fish to Nigeria as a result of the difficulties with the export credit guarantee.  If it had not been for the efforts of the then Minister, Deputy Daly, the situation would have been very serious.  He, together with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy MacSharry, and the then Minister for Trade and Tourism, Deputy Flynn, took time off during the general election campaign in order to secure an agreement between the various exporters and the ICC to prevent the ending of the season at that time.  While we may say that it was the duty of the then Ministers to act in the interests of the fishermen, I should like to congratulate them on behalf of the industry for what they achieved.</P>
    <P>I am putting the Minister on warning at this stage in the season that the export credit guarantee is absolutely necessary. If he has not begun investigating it he should do so immediately.  It is the Central Bank of Nigeria who carry the bulk of the risk.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer also to the State-to-State arrangement with Egypt.  That, too, was initiated by Deputy Daly as Minister. I was laughed at both inside the House and outside it when I suggested that the Minister go to Egypt to explore the market there but his subsequent visit proved successful.  It is necessary now <Col N="1059" /> merely to consolidate the arrangement. There is tremendous potential so far as exports to Egypt are concerned but in the event of failure to provide export credit the industry will come to a standstill with our fleet having an outlet for no more than 25 per cent of the catch.  This will go to the foreign freezing boats in respect of which there is no onshore refund.  I understand that the factory at Castletownbere is being used now as a transit shed.  This is not the purpose for which grants were allocated.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to hear that at long last legislation will be introduced in relation to third country boats and to flags of convenience.  The Minister has asked that that legislation be given a speedy passage through the House.  It will get a speedy passage through the House only if it provides protection for all those involved in the industry.</P>
    <P>We need more research and development in relation to the white fishing industry and more finance must be provided for conversion to the traditional type of fishing.  The Minister spoke last night of the finance that would be available from Europe for the permanent and temporary laying-up of vessels to relieve over-capacity in the fleet.  I would ask the Minister to give more details when replying. There is to be encouragement of exploratory fishing for new species but the Minister did not tell us that the size of boat must be in excess of 24 metres. There are many owners of smaller boats who would welcome an opportunity to be involved in exploratory fishing but unless their vessels exceed 75 feet they will not be able to take part.  Larger vessels can participate in exploratory fishing well off shore but there are certain areas off the south and west coasts where smaller boats could carry out exploratory fishing.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated that assistance would be provided towards the construction of new fishing vessels and the modernisation and conversion of vessels already in use, but he did not point out that this will apply only to boats of between 12 metres and 33 metres, that is, boats between 39 feet and 108 feet.  What about the small half-deckers and boats <Col N="1060" /> which are larger than 108 feet?  I believe the amount involved is in excess of 65 ECUs or £45,000.  Perhaps some change might have taken place within the past few days.  That sort of information is grossly misleading to the House and to the fishermen who believe that grants are available to them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should also investigate the price of fuel and oil which varies from port to port.  In Greencastle, far removed from Dublin, it is much cheaper than in Howth, while in Killala it is much cheaper than in Burtonport.  The price of oil for fishing vessels should be similar in all ports.</P>
    <P>Regarding salmon fisheries, we were given last night a figure of £3.4 million as the value of the salmon catch last year and this indicates the importance of the salmon fishery, particularly to the small half-deckers who cannot obtain any assistance from Europe or from FEOGA.  Very few small boats obtain FEOGA grants.  Salmon is vitally important to the small fisherman.  We have a difficulty because many salmon are imported and it is difficult to detect the difference between the farm fish and the wild fish.  Naturally the processor and smoker wants to purchase farm fish because this will ensure that he will not have to purchase all his raw material within a few months but can spread it over the year, thus reducing overheads. We must be very cautions in speaking about the salmon industry because it is a very sensitive area.  Processors and smokers are not entirely dependent on salmon landings and the Minister must act with caution.</P>
    <P>It is disgraceful that so little money was made available to BIM for the provision of new boats.  I understand they are interested in making secondhand boats available to people who may not be particularly interested in such boats.  When fishermen apply to BIM for small grants to repair their boats they may be refused but told that boats worth, perhaps, £200,000 may be made available to them. We cannot allow any official in BIM or the Department to pass the problem to the fisherman.  The buck must stop with <Col N="1061" /> BIM, the Department and ultimately the Minister.</P>
    <P>In 1979 the administrative costs of BIM amounted to £1.1 million and they had to write off only £200,000.  In 1982 administrative costs amounted to £2.5 million and the write-off was £800,000.  The increase in the amount written off is far greater than the increase in administrative costs.  These figures are a glaring example of the problems within BIM.</P>
    <P>In relation to herring, I regret that there has not yet been a decision to open the Celtic Sea.  This decision should be taken by the Government and the EEC as scientists have recommended.</P>
    <P>The Book of Estimates prepared by Fianna Fáil prior to leaving office provided that £20.5 million would be made available to the fishing industry.  The Coalition reduced that figure to £18.75 million.  For main fishery harbour works the figure was reduced from £4.25 million to £3.25 million.  The port which has suffered most as a result of this cutback is Burtonport, a tidal port.  The Minister should give a commitment that the necessary works will be included in the Estimates next year.  The cutbacks are indicative of the attitude of the Coalition towards the west.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for a home-based timber industry in Donegal.  In the centre of the county there is a large area of forest and the maximum distance the timber would need to be transported is 45 miles.</P>

We should produce stakes, post rail fencing, pallet wood and general construction materials and the accured waste could be compressed into briquetters for fuel.  This would give employment to 20 or 30 people.</P>
      <P>It is vital that the Minister should ensure that the fishery quota is not reduced from 80,000 tonnes but rather increased.  I hope I have contributed in a constructive way and I look forward to the Minister's reply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Coming from a constitutency which depends to quite an extent on the fishing industry, it is only right to air the grievances of that industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our four main industries are agriculture, fisheries, forestry and tourism, but throughout the years fishing and forestry have been treated as Cinderella industries. There has been a lot of talk but no action.  There are more than 9,000 fishermen trying to earn a livelihood from fishing but there are only 2,600 people employed in the fish processing end.  This is a sad reflection on an industry that should be generating more on-shore employment.  It is a sad reflection on the people who are responsible but who have <Col N="1063" /> been letting the processing side drift into such a bad state.</P>
    <P>In Denmark, for every one fisherman at sea there are eight engaged in on-shore processing.  In all the other EEC countries except Ireland an average of five people are engaged in on-shore production for every one fisherman at sea.  Here we have only half a person, on average, engaged in processing for every one fisherman. Our total catch was £44 million worth in 1982 of which only 2 per cent was finally processed.  In 1982-1983 we imported more than £12 million worth of fish.</P>
    <P>This again is a sad reflection on the handling of the processing industry.  The vast majority of our exports of fish go out unprocessed, whole, frozen or fresh.  We have some of the best fishing grounds in the world for mackerel, herring and cod. More than 80 per cent of our catches come from within the 12 mile limit, leaving fish such as blue whiting and hake virtually untapped by Irish vessels.</P>
    <P>As well, we have the sad spectacle of millions of pounds worth of fish being dumped under the withdrawal policy dictated by the EEC.  Almost 10,000 tonnes of fish was dumped in 1982, worth almost £1 million.  One Kerry fisherman said that he dumped almost £80,000 of fish, mainly herring, between January and April last year.  Why not get that fish processed and sent out as food to the starving millions in the Third World?  Instead of giving hard cash to the Third World we should explore the possibility of getting the fish that is being dumped under the withdrawal EEC policy processed and sent to the Third World to feed the hungry there. Surely to heavens there is some other way to utilise the fish than dumping the God-given catches back into the water? It is an insult to both God and man.</P>
    <P>I submit that we should build a fishmeal factory in Castletownbere.  Most of the fishmeal processing is done in Killybegs and nothing has been done to cater for the south-west and the fishermen there.  As well, BIM should explore the Middle East market for our processed fish.  A huge potential exists there for marinated and smoked fish.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1064" /> The fish processing industry needs skilled personnel and that means special training courses and a development plan. ACOT are training young farmers to become viable and AnCO are training young people to become tradesmen, but can we see BIM training our young people, boys and girls, to become efficient fish processors?  No action has been taken in that respect.  It is of vital importance that this training be given to our young people if there is to be a future for our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>The quota proposals for 1983 represent a reduction on last year.  This should not have been allowed to happen.  The 1982 quota was entirely inadequate and therefore the latest proposal is disastrous.  Why close certain areas for herring fishing for ten years or more when the average life of a herring is only five to seven years?  It seems to me that an enormous number of herrings will die of old age in the closed protected areas of the Celtic Sea.</P>
    <P>We see Spanish boats landing their catches in Ireland for trans-shipment to Spain for processing there, thereby enlarging their tonnage of catches pending their entry to the EEC.  It is well known that undersized fish in abundance are being caught by those Spanish trawlers. Is it possible to get a minimum net, size on the Spanish boats operating off our coasts?  The Spanish company in Castletownbere have four fishing boats, built in Spain, we are told with aid from the Irish taxpayers' contributions &mdash; money to build boats for foreigners but no money to build them for our fishermen.</P>
    <P>It is well known that Spanish trawlers, re-registered in Ireland, fish in Irish waters with Spanish crews, none of whom has a work permit or has applied for one. If all those fishermen do not pay taxes here but earn their living here it seems only just that Irish fishing skippers are entitled to do likewise: they could apply for foreign crews who would not be liable for PAYE or PRSI payments.</P>
    <P>As a fishing nation we have been given dwindling quotas from Brussels while the Spanish landings are included in our catch tonnage.  That should not be so. The Spaniards have been doubling their landings.  There is no proper monitoring <Col N="1065" /> of Spanish landings at Irish ports, not to mention their unsupervised fishing on the high seas.  There has been very little overall supervision of Spanish fishing off our coasts.  By comparison with monitoring of Irish catches there has been very little inspection of the Spanish.  The same applies to inspection of gear.  The original justification for permitting Spanish landings into Irish ports was to supply Irish processing plants.  It has been proved long since that that was only a trick and was never meant to be.  Are we now in total opposition to the establishment?  In my opinion the Spanish boats are being paid a State sponsored subsidy for diesel because they are supposed to be fishing west of the 12º line.  Any Irish employee on board any of the Spanish boats operating out of Castletownbere, the few who serve on those ships, can say that they were never more than 20 miles west of the Blaskets or Bull Rock instead of the required 140 miles.</P>
    <P>As far as I can see BIM are in need of a complete revamp.  Down the years they have been dragging their feet as far as the building up of the fishing industry is concerned. Few members know more about the fishing industry than I because I am a member of a fishing family.  My late father exported marinated mackerel to the US long before I was born.  After a night's fishing he worked at marinating the catch the following day.  From my early years I was aware of the importance of the fishing industry to the survival of the people of west Cork.  I know only too well that if we do not have a viable fishing industry here, particularly along the south-west and west coasts, those areas will be denuded of population within a few years.  Small farmers and fishermen kept the economy going in those parts of Ireland.  As Deputy Begley said last night, we are not blessed and never will be with huge industrial developments along the west coast.  Their only industries are fishing, farming, forestry and tourism.</P>
    <P>I have seen boatyards inhibited in their efforts to complete boats through lack of progress payments by BIM, a disgraceful state of affairs.  Some boatyards have <Col N="1066" /> been inhibited because BIM failed to sanction grants for new fishing boats.  The board, instead of taking into consideration the difficulties being experienced by those boatyards, are horse-trading about a few thousand pounds trying to force the boatyards to accept uneconomic prices for the building of boats.  Surely that is not the treatment that should be meted out by BIM to the boatbuilding industry that is experiencing great difficulty in trying to maintain the work force.  It is well known that if the Baltimore boatyard in south-west Cork does not get clearance for the building of a boat immediately it will have close with the loss of 100 jobs.  If that happens the Exchequer will have to pay out £10,000 per week in dole, or £500,000 annually. Is that progress in the right direction? BIM stand indicated for their misconduct towards those who are trying to keep the industry going.</P>
    <P>The Minister should clear up the mess he inherited and ensure that the jobs of those in that industry are maintained.  He should ensure that they are not subject to horse trading activities by BIM.  I cannot condone the decision of the last Government to make two political appointments to the board of BIM and I urge the Minister to do a Deasy-style operation on BIM, as occurred in Bord na gCapall.  He should clear out the mess and get rid of the cobwebs in BIM and appoint people who understand the industry.  The Minister should appoint people who understand fishing and fish processing to help build up the industry.  I am amazed that there will be a cutback in the work scheduled for piers this year.  It is well known that Schull pier in County Cork was to get priority in 1981.  There was a change in 1982 and on Wednesday, 28 April 1982, in the course of a question to the Minister for Fisheries, Deputy Daly, I asked when work would commence on the extension to that pier.  The Minister said in the course of his reply that tenders for the work were being examined and subject to the acceptance of a tender, work should commence towards the end of 1982.  What has happened?  The development work has not taken place.</P>

      <P>The people of south-west Cork will not accept such treatment at a time when £8.5 million is being allocated for the development of Howth Harbour. The pier at Schull is crumbling and falling.  Schull has a long fishing tradition and I call on the Minister to commence work on that pier immediately.  He should honour the commitment given by his predecessor, Deputy Fitzpatrick, and put the wheels of work in motion.  I was not surprised to hear Deputy Begley refer to the fact that the unoccupied palace in Dún Laoghaire has gobbled up all the money that should have been devoted for the maintenance of piers throughout the country.  The people of west Cork will not tolerate that treatment by a State-sponsored body.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sufficient money has been spent on Howth Harbour and the remainder of the development there should be left for better days.  Why are areas on the south-west coast penalised while Howth is developed? People in those areas must make a living also.  It is well known that the processing of fish has failed hopelessly here.  The Norwegians, Germans and Dutch have herrings in wine, brine, beer and tomato sauce but what do we have? <Col N="1068" /> We do not have anything but imports. Surely we can do something more and better on behalf of our fishermen than throwing their catches to the continental wolves.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Minister what inspections or controls exist on the Russians, the Japanese, the Koreans, the Norwegians and the Spanish fishing fleets who are trawling inside the 50 mile box zone that was supposed to be established off our coast?  I do not think anything is happening in that regard but all the surveillance is being devoted to our poor Irish salmon fishermen who can fish only 30 mesh nets that float to the surface. Those fishermen are inhibited from making a living.  In the name of Heaven who is codding whom in this regard?  I would like to make sure that justice is done and that our salmon fishermen are given a chance to make a living because they have only a very short season in which to work.  The marauders of our salmon stock are the big trawlers operating from third countries.  They take the salmon back to their countries for processing.</P>
    <P>I have tried to emphasise what should be done to help fisheries, but there is a lot more still to be done.  I call on the Minister and his Minister of State to brush the cobwebs out of the Department and BIM.  I admit the Ministers inherited those problems.  Nobody can blame them for the present situation.</P>

      <P>I am giving the facts. Fianna Fáil have sold the fishermen down the drain for centuries.  It is time they listened to common sense.  I invite the Ministers to come to Schull, Castletownbere, Dingle, Killybegs, Burtonport and the Aran Islands to meet the men who have practical experience of the fishing industry.  I invite them to come to Schull or Castletownbere during the summer recess and I will arrange a day's fishing experience for them on one of our trawlers and I will accompany them on this trip.  They will then see at first hand the rigours and hardship experienced by these men.  They will see how difficult it <Col N="1069" /> is for them to bring their trawlers into Schull Pier, a pier which was supposed to be extended 30 years ago but still badly needs that extension.  This is the only way the Ministers will get on the spot information about an industry that is almost untapped.  It is time the Ministers found out the facts from the men on the ground. Do not listen to people who have only book information; they are not giving the real facts.  I hope the Ministers will accept my invitation for a full day's fishing during the summer recess.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to make a few brief comments on the fishing industry.  We have heard from a number of eminent speakers already and I will not dwell on the points they raised.  I refer the Minister to an editorial in <i>The Cork Examiner</i>, Thursday, 2 June 1983, which says:</P>
      <P>...it is high time that some government became serious about a coherent Irish fishing industry rather than leaving the whole thing for unbalanced exploitation which profits too few and is not carried out in the national interest.</P>
      <P>I would like the Minister to draw up a coherent plan for fisheries and, in particular, in the national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to refer to the situation on the south-west coast where the Spanish trawlers are doing very serious damage to the industry.  On a few occasions recently I tried to raise this matter and the question of work permits with the Minister but was fobbed off.  I was told it was not the responsibility of the Minister for Labour.  I was told the Minister had no official responsibility for stating the law in relation to work permits for non-national crewmen.  There are a few people trying to make a living from seasonal salmon fishing in Cork.  Recently a fishery inspector said there were only 90 men pursuing the local tradition of salmon fishing because the fishermen were using illegal nets.  It is about time this harassment of a few islanders trying to get a living from this industry stopped. We should have a system other than the confiscation of nets in operation.  The <Col N="1070" /> Minister must be aware of people selling those nets and others buying the salmon catches.  I cannot see why a quota system should not be introduced.  It is very hard on a part-time fisherman if his gear is confiscated and his livelihood put in jeopardy, especially if one considers that if a quota system were in operation this would not happen very often.  It should not be beyond the bounds of ingenuity to have such a system.  We should legalise the use of these nets and allow these fishermen to fish until they have reached their quota.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's assurance that legislation will be introduced shortly to do something about third country fishermen, in particular the Spanish fishing vessels which are improving their quotas and damaging Irish local fishermen because of a technicality.  I welcome the processing being carried out at Eirenova in Castletownbere, but those facilities are being used as a base for the trans-shipment of fish.  I cannot see any justification for issuing additional licences to Spanish vessels as long as that processing industry is able to cater for only a small percentage of their catch.</P>
    <P>I agree with my colleague, Deputy Sheehan, that BIM have acted irresponsibly towards the boat-building facility in Baltimore, west Cork.  It took a deputation consisting of the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy J. O'Keeffe, Deputy Sheehan and myself to meet the officials of BIM and to wring out of them a progress payment on a vessel.  I cannot see why it took three elected Members to get this progress payment.  That kind of action in regard to outstanding boat-building facility is nothing short of irresponsible.  I was delighted that the Minister of State was able to go down there himself and see the boat building facility and the outstanding work being done.  I ask him to ensure that no technicality, bureaucracy, or red tape will cause that facility to be wound down or, perhaps, closed altogether.  I ask him to look very seriously at that matter.</P>
    <P>We have the famous problem of the pier in Schull.  At least six Ministers in different Administrations have promised <Col N="1071" /> me and the House, in reply to parliamentary questions, that work on that pier would commence before the end of a particular year.  I am sure that before I came here the very same promises were made and people were misled and codded up to the two eyes.  This is a very important matter for a peninsular area.  Unfortunately, the population is declining, and it would be a tremendous boost to the area if that job were done.</P>
    <P>I had a question down in the past two weeks about this matter and I was told an underwater survey is being carried out now.  I am sure everybody has heard of people having their heads in the sand, but having an underwater survey carried out after 30 years of acting the fool with the pier is asking too much of the patience of the people on the south-west Cork coast.  If there is no commitment to do the job, why not say so?  To talk about an underwater survey after 30 years is outrageous. If there is a preference for Howth or for palatial buildings in Dún Laoghaire, why not say so?  Perhaps some regional fund or social fund could be tapped in Brussels when some visitations are made there to enable the project to get off the ground.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to the amount of research and development in the fisheries industry.  That is a very neglected area.  I want to refer in particular to the only research vessel we have, the <i>Lough Beltra</i>, which was refitted fairly extensively recently.  It is due to be laid up again at the end of this month.  I cannot see how proper monitoring and development of the industry can take place without some degree of research.  The NBST stated that it would cost £60,000 to keep that vessel in business.  Surely that is not too much money to spend on one research vessel for a basic industry like fisheries.</P>
    <P>I want to refer the Minister to the same editorial in <i>The Cork Examiner.</i>  It states:</P>
    <P>The hand-to-mouth existence which seems to be the life style of a great proportion of those currently engaged in fishing was exemplified earlier this week when the country's leading marine research scientist, Prof. <Col N="1072" /> Padraig O Ceidig, issued a last-ditch appeal to the government to provide adequate funding and structures to keep the marine research vessel <i>Lough Beltra</i> in operation.  So far this year this vessel has only been used for about six weeks and it is currently engaged in oceanographic research work off the south west coast.  At the end of the present month, however, it would have to be laid up because the National Board of Science and Technology, which has responsibility for the vessel, does not have sufficient funds to keep it in operation.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that this vessel stays in business and to look at the possibility of having more co-ordinated research carried out in the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>We have a multipilicity of agencies doing bits and pieces of research.  The National Board for Science and Technology, BIM, the Department, An Foras Forbartha, and I am sure a dozen others. The Minister should try to achieve co-ordination in the whole research effort into the fishing industry.  For a number of years I have been asking the Department of Fisheries what they are doing about a fishery research field station at Castlepark, Kinsale.  That area was recommended as an ideal location for a fisheries research field centre.  I keep getting the same old reply, that they cannot find the owner of the property.  Surely between the resources of the Department of Fisheries and the Land Commission, it is possible to find the owner of that property. I ask the Minister to have a look at that matter.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous potential in the area of aquaculture and fish farming.  I hope the Minister will provide more funds for fish farming.  On the south-west coast we have had a number of co-ops and people involved in oyster farming and mussel farming.  At the end of the day they seem to run into trouble because of lack of expertise and lack of knowledge of the industry.  In the long term, fish farming will become more and more important.  Other speakers said it is virtually impossible to distinguish between <Col N="1073" /> native fish and farmed fish.  The Minister should put a little more effort into that area.</P>
    <P>It is scandalous that we imported in the region of £26 million worth of fish products in the past 12 months.  That is an indictment of the people with responsibility for fisheries.  I hope the Minister will ensure that every possible effort is made to process the maximum amount of fish caught in our waters.  I cannot see why the technology in our food industry cannot be used in the fishing industry as well.  In the food processing industry there has been a sort of a cave in against the amount of imports coming in.  Erin Foods have capitulated to foreign imports of processed products.  We have their factories in different parts of the country with their technology, their processing facilities and their expertise, and I cannot see why they cannot be used in the processing of fish products.  Perhaps the Minister would have a look at that area as well.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief.  I have heard about the debate on this Estimate and read about it before under previous Administrations.  I am sure we would be unanimous in coming to the conclusion that there is no real, co-ordinated, overall, national policy for the fishing industry. The reason for this is that the Department have been treated as a virtual light-weight within Government structures over many years.  For example, there is no real policy on the marketing of fish.  In many towns you cannot buy fish.  You can get tinned fish which has been imported, but you cannot get fresh fish in the majority of our towns.  Very few of our towns have shops which sell fish even in well-known fishing areas.  The Government must realise that this industry has a real employment potential if the will is there to do something positive about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The industry was given a body blow by the increase in the taxation on fuel which is an essential ingredient of the industry. Fishermen find it very difficult to earn a livelihood and pay back substantial loans for these very expensive boats.  The problem about the development of piers in <Col N="1074" /> Cork is not unique.  One of our longest established fishing ports is at Clogherhead pier.  Clogherhead village and the surrounding area have depended economically on the fishing industry, fish processing, and so on, for over a century now.</P>
    <P>Over the past ten years the repair of the pier at Clogherhead has been promised by Ministers in a number of different Governments.  Ministers and MEPs have come down to the area, particularly prior to elections.  We were always promised great things for Clogherhead prior to elections.  I do not know how many times Ministers or potential Ministers have promised the replacement of Clogherhead pier prior to general elections.  The main problem there also exists in Cork. We have only to consider the amount of bureaucracy involved in that particular subject.  Louth County Council, the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Environment and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry are involved in it.  I received a reply yesterday to a question which I asked the Minister about the hydraulic model being investigated in UCD.  Over a year has gone by and Louth County Council and various Ministers have promised that this report would be forthcoming.  I was told in the reply I got yesterday that it is being finalised at University College, Cork.  It will then go to the Office of Public Works, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, Louth County Council and, like the last report, it will probably be passed back to the Department of Fisheries and Forestry, the Office of Public Works, the Department of the Environment.  We go round and round while very expensive, boats, which have been grant-aided by the State, are piling up at Clogherhead pier. This pier is totally inadequate to accommodate the fishing fleet there.  Many of those boats have to go to other ports to berth.  They have to go to Drogheda, Mornington and elsewhere.  They are at the mercy of the bad weather.  The lives of the fishermen are in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>Clogherhead pier has been patched and patched like a patchwork quilt.  That pier was built for £5,000 many years ago. Money was subscribed by the traders of <Col N="1075" /> Drogheda to erect that pier.  It looks as if we will need to have a collection among the traders of Drogheda again if we are to get a replacement at Clogherhead. Would the Minister give a positive indication to the fishermen in Clogherhead that there will be a decision made on this in the very near future?</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the forgotten people of the fishing industry, the net fishermen, those who earn their livelihood from salmon fishing on the various rivers.  I would like to refer particularly to salmon fishing on the River Boyne which will become extinct unless there is some positive policy in relation to it.  The shellfish industry at Mornington has been closed down because of pollution. People suffered as a result of pollution to the mussel beds and the shellfish industry there.  The cause of this is domestic sewage.  This shows the lack of co-ordination between different Departments.  If the salmon industry is to survive on the River Boyne a sewage treatment plant is required.  We are talking about the fishing industry but dealing with a different Department.  I find, in relation to the fishing industry, that too many Departments are involved in it. Much more co-ordinated activity within the Department is required so that decisions can be taken and implemented quickly.  This is an industry with great employment potential.  It is one of the very few industries in the country with any potential for increased employment among young and old.  Would the Minister take into consideration that the problems of the fishing industry are the same in Cork, Clogherhead, Howth and elsewhere?  Would he do something positive in relation to the co-ordination of all the services?</P>
    <P>I agree entirely with my colleague who referred to the question of research. There are a number of agencies dealing with research within the industry, all doing little bits and pieces but without any co-ordinated effort.  My colleague forgot one important one in the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards. They have carried out substantial research and investigation into fish processing. <Col N="1076" /> The money spent on that research is wasted because there is no overall co-ordinated body dealing with the fishing industry.  Would the Minister take that into consideration?</P>

      <P>It is quite clear that the fishing industry is of very great significance even to Members of this House.  In debating any Estimate for any Department we should have the health of the economy uppermost in our minds.  Agriculture, tourism, fisheries and forestry are vital national assets.  Do we give those areas the attention they deserve?  The answer is that we do not.  The areas I have just mentioned are of great importance and can create employment at very little cost.  Why is it that we let things happen in those Departments rather than encourage their potential?  If we directed the same energy and finance into those industries as we do in relation to other high cost industries with a high import level would the country not be in a better position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish fishing industry, as has been said here so often, is in a shambles with very little thought given to a direct policy. The industry is wandering aimlessly, reacting only to the jolt from the EEC, who are now permanently settled in our waters.  Our fishermen have lost out heavily to their European counterparts for many reasons.  The basis for a good fishing industry is good fishing grounds, which we have in abundance around our shores.  Those must be protected.  Foreigners have moved in to wipe the Irish fish and certainly the Irish fishermen off the map.  We must stand up to this onslaught and we must not stand by and watch Spanish fishing trawlers flying a <Col N="1077" /> flag of convenience and taking the bread out of our mouths.</P>
    <P>The activity of the Government in this respect has been disastrous.  I would like to quote from a letter from the Minister for Fisheries in answer to a question about the provision of permits for such fishermen off our coasts.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the Minister for Labour, Mr. Liam Kavanagh, TD, that the present position in relation to work permits for non-Irish EEC nationals engaged in off-shore activities is as follows:</P>
    <P>(i)  The Minister for Labour in the past required employers of non-Irish EEC nationals engaged in off-shore activities to secure a work permit for such employees.</P>
    <P>Everybody accepts that.  Then it continues:</P>
    <P>(ii)  As far as can be ascertained from a preliminary search of the Department of Labour&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a preliminary search, mind you&mdash;</P>
    <P>work permit records, employers of non-Irish EEC nationals engaged in off-shore fishing activities have not been issued with work permits for their employees.</P>
    <P>That is from a preliminary search only and means that there are hidden drawers in that Department it would take an extra special effort to locate.  The letter continues:</P>
    <P>(iii)  When and if applications are received from such employers, the Minister for Labour will seek legal advice under the Aliens Act, 1935,</P>
    <P>&mdash;one would think it was spacemen we were talking about&mdash;</P>
    <P>as to whether work permits are applicable with regard to the aforementioned fishing activities...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> That says it all, in other words, that the present Government are afraid to take on these pirates.  The pirates are clearing the wealth of our seas beneath our very eyes.  Does the Minister intend taking on the EEC?  Does he intend to let them know that as far as we are concerned our fishermen come first?  Is he going to let them know that our fishermen are being robbed of their livelihood by these new pirates or cowboys of the high seas?  They use the flag of convenience; maybe the Jolly Roger would be more appropriate. We in Ireland &mdash; and I say this of our Government also when we were in power &mdash; have been the gentle people of the EEC in almost every respect.  This has been more evident in the fishing industry where it has been claimed by fishermen, perhaps with some justification, that we have sold them out to the Europeans.  It is time to say that when our fishermen are accommodated we will consider allowing foreigners in, foreigners, mind you, whose only interest is to clean out and get out.  Our fishing industry needs support.  It is an area of vast potential both at sea and on shore.  Our harbours are very little better than they were in the last century and this curtails fishing time.</P>
    <P>I should like to comment now on the contribution of the Minister last evening. I was interested to note that Wexford, the south-east and very little of the south coast were mentioned at all.  I am very disappointed at this particularly since the Minister of State comes from Wexford. Listening to the debate one would think that fishermen resided only off the west or south-west coast.  There are fishermen all around our coasts with a great tradition in the industry, who have given their lives to the industry.  Many speakers in this debate have fallen into the trap set for them by the Minister, the Department and by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, which is one of divide and conquer: if we can get the west to fight against the south-west and the south-east, if we have them fighting amongst themselves, then the Department and the Minister can get away with putting less energy into the industry.  Surely if we are to succeed as a nation, if our fishing industry is to succeed, it must be accepted that our fishermen <Col N="1079" /> are sited right around our coastline. If we are to have a fisheries policy it must not be fragmented but rather one for the entire coastline.</P>
    <P>Lest the south-east might be forgotten or that it might be felt there are no fishermen in the south-east, I should like to continue my contribution in relation to the south-east mainly.  Recently there was a massive breach in the quay at Kilmore which was repaired on a temporary basis by Wexford County Council.  The local authority are awaiting a grant from the Government to protect the pier and, if this is not forthcoming in the near future, we will not have a quay at Kilmore. I appeal to the Minister of State to make this money available in accordance with the philosophy that a stitch in time saves nine.  The same port is in urgent need of dredging.  At present skippers must await a full tide to go to sea and dredging would give them an extra two hours fishing when often those two hours can be the vital ones.  Let us see some commitment to these fishermen in a growing port, one that has contributed much to the industry.</P>
    <P>Recently a skipper fishing from Kilmore Quay, Mr. Billy Bates, sighted a submarine only yards from his trawler. Two days later a larger submarine was sighted by the crew of the same trawler off the south-east coast.  Neither submarine carried any identification.  I asked permission to raise this issue here in the light of what happened last summer to the <i>Sharalga</i> when a trawler was literally pulled to the bottom of the sea, in the Irish Sea, and when the crew were extremely lucky to escape with their lives. It was later admitted that a British submarine had been responsible for that accident.  Obviously it must be a source of worry to the Kilmore fishermen, to fishermen all around our coastline, that their lives and property are at risk while these unwanted dangers lurk in our waters.  What action have the Government taken over the Kilmore incident? If, as I suspect, they have done nothing, then our fishermen will know clearly that this Government just are not interested. I want the Minister of State to give me a <Col N="1080" /> detailed account of the Kilmore incident and activity, if any, his Government have engaged in on account of it.</P>
    <P>Celtic Sea herring fishing has been a bone of contention for some years now. Last year, following good work and strong negotiation on the part of the former Minister for Fisheries, he succeeded in persuading the EEC Fisheries Ministers that the Celtic Sea could withstand heavier fishing by Irish boats.  I am saddened to learn now that the quota for herring in the Irish Sea has been allowed to lessen by the present Government in respect of Irish fishermen.  I am posing the question directly again: are we more interested in obliging foreign fishermen than our own?  Small inshore fishermen are experiencing dreadful treatment at present from many points of view.  One is that they are owed £30,000, due in intervention of these fishermen of the Duncannon and Passage areas.  I am sure much more is due in respect of other areas around our coasts.  These people had to dump fish last year.</P>
    <P>We heard of many incidences of such dumping around our coasts.  What are the Minister's intentions to ensure that this does not recur in the next herring season? Is it his intention to set up a fish processing unit in the Duncannon region to ensure that we shall not have a repetition of the situation that prevailed last year when fishermen had to dump herring at £5 a box, when ten years earlier the same box of herring would have fetched £10? The herring fishing industry in some areas is now non-viable.  Many skippers are finding it difficult to make repayments. We have heard instances of this throughout the debate in respect of fishermen right around our coastline.  I say to the Minister of State present that Duncannon pier now warrants immediate attention. There are massive stones at the tip of the pier and if they were removed there would be berthage for two boats.  This has been promised year after year but nothing has been done.  Now that we have a local man on the scene I ask him to upgrade the pier at Duncannon.  The plans have been put forward to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  Has the Minister asked them to put forward this project as a <Col N="1081" /> priority?  I was very disappointed that Wexford was not mentioned once in the contribution of the Minister last night.</P>
    <P>The salmon season has been shortened in recent times from 15 March to the end of June.  Originally it was from 12 February to 15 August.  The licence fee has been increased to £115 but very few fish have been caught in the south-east in recent years.  It has been claimed by fishermen in the south-east that this is because of illegal salmon fishing off the west coast.  Salmon return to their river of origin for spawning and if they are caught off the west coast on their journey to rivers in the south and south-east quite obviously they will never reach the sunny south-east.  I should like to comment on these matters.  I ask him to consider lengthening the season in the south-east to 15 August to give parity to the fishermen.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will encourage the promotion of mussel fisheries.  There is a very successful mussel fishery in Wexford harbour where 4,000 tonnes are harvested each year.  Demand for the product of this export industry far outstrips the supply.  I am told that at present the demand exceeds 10,000 tonnes.  Since this is an export industry I am sure the Minister will provide finance to improve the situation.  The fishery could grow this year to 6,000 tonnes and it could create 20 new jobs at a cost of £20,000.  Surely this low cost job-creating enterprise will succeed in attracting finance?  Money is necessary to locate mussel seed beds out of the sea that, because of the predators, would not survive in that environment.</P>

Ta súil agam go n-éireoidh go maith leo sin fosta.</P>
      <P>Last year I had an opportunity of contributing fairly extensively in debates on the fishing industry.  I regretted then that I did not have an opportunity of contributing in another very important area, namely, forestry.  There is great potential in this sector particularly in the west of Ireland and in Donegal but it has been ignored by successive Governments during the years.  Statistics today show that only 4 per cent of our total land area is under forestry &mdash; the lowest in Europe with the exception of Iceland and we all know what difficulties they have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, this has not always been the case.  It is estimated that in 1600 12½ per cent of our total land area was under forests.  That was run down and when our native Government took over in 1922 only 130,000 acres were under forest. One of the first policies to be adopted by the native Government was to press ahead with a positive policy of afforestation. In 1923 &mdash; and we all know how difficult that year was &mdash; 1,000 acres was planted.  In 1929 approximately 3,500 acres was planted and that increased in 1937 to between 7,000 and 8,000 acres. The next positive step was taken in 1948 under the programme for recovery when the Government of the day adopted a policy that we would plant 10,000 hectares per annum.  That policy was endorsed in the First Programme for Economic Expansion in 1958.  Had we adhered to that policy of planting 10,000 hectares per annum, today there would be 500,000 hectares under forest, but we have fallen far short of that target.  As the Minister said last night, the amount of land under forest is well below 400,000 hectares.  That shows the neglect of forestry in the past 50 or 60 years.  I am not blaming the present Minister or the Minister of State.  The blame must be <Col N="1083" /> attached to every Government in the past 50 or 60 years.  There is not a parish in the country without half a dozen town-lands that derive their name from a forest, a wood or a grove.  Even in my area of Gweedore where there are very few trees, there are half a dozen &ldquo;doires&rdquo; which takes its name from the word &ldquo;grove&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I should like to make a few suggestions to the Minister of State as I understand he is interested in forestry.  I ask him to adopt a positive policy of land acquisition. If we do not acquire land, how can we plant it?  There is much unproductive land available in the west and I appeal to the Minister to have a positive approach towards the acquisition of land.  There has been a steady decrease in land acquisition and planting since 1977.  I understand in that year about 7,000 or 8,000 hectares were planted but in 1981 that had decreased to about 5,500.  There is plenty of land available if a fair price is given to the people who own it.  The Minister should make arrangements to ensure that people become more aware of the benefits of afforestation.  For instance, there is a scheme in force at the moment called the Shelter Belt Scheme. In my area the demand for that scheme far outstrips the supply of seedlings available. In my area it is usually announced in church on Sundays that the forms are available.  There is a rush to the sacristy afterwards but people often find that no forms are left.  Even when people apply, more often than not word comes back that no seedlings are available.  The interest is there and we should make a effort to supply people who are interested in planting.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the Department should use the schools and make the children more aware of the advantages of trees.  Schools every year have a sports day and I cannot see why we should not have a national arbour day when the teachers, the children and other institutions would go out and plant a tree and have a few lessons on the benefit of trees and so on.  Not alone would it create jobs but from the tourist point of view it would be an advantage also.  There is nothing as pleasant on <Col N="1084" /> a summer evening, or indeed on a winter afternoon, than to go out for a walk in a forest.  I understand that something is being done about this at the moment, but I appeal to the Minister to open up more forests and have nature trails and walks.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, before going on to Fisheries, I would like to say that in my county, where unemployment is so high, we have 21 forest units and in 1981 a quantity of 50,000 cubic metres of timber was exported from County Donegal into Northern Ireland, Sweden and other countries from which it was probably bought back later.  Here is an opportunity for establishing an industry in some part of the county, perhaps in the Finn Valley, Ballybofey and the Stranorlar area where the unemployment rate is high.  Keep this timber at home, process it at home, create employment and save the money that we must pay when importing it again.</P>
    <P>As I said at the beginning, I had an opportunity of speaking at some length on fisheries last year.  We all realise, as I believe was said last night and again this morning, that the industry is in a very bad state at the moment.  We all know what the reasons are.  The fishermen and the fleets have difficulties with their repayments because their overhead costs are escalating by the year and even by the month.  We have probably the highest fuel cost in Europe.  The cost of labour is escalating as is the cost of gear, insurance and so on.  At the other end of the scale the prices that fishermen are paid for their catches are more or less static and very often fail to keep up with inflation. I do not know what can be done about this.  Perhaps fuel subsidies could be considered, although I understand that that is against the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  Nevertheless, I believe some European countries adopt such measures. If I am not mistaken, the French do it and the Italians at the moment have some scheme whereby they subsidise the Sicilian fleet.  Perhaps the Minister could give some thought to this.  I appreciate that in the budget subsidy for fishermen's fuel has been maintained but perhaps it could be increased in view of the difficulties they are experiencing at the moment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" /> Much more employment could be created in the fishing industry.  As Deputy Sheehan said, for every person we have fishing at sea we have one employed in the processing industry on the mainland. A comparison of that with what is going on in some European countries where the ratio is one to six gives an indication of what can be done especially in the west of Ireland where so many people are engaged in the fishing industry and where the unemployment rate is much higher than in many other parts of the country. I ask the Minister and the Minister of State to consider during their four or five years in office the setting up of small processing plants along the western seaboard. We do not want giants employing 500 or 600.  Small plants scattered right along the coast from Donegal to Cork and Kerry and around the south-east employing 20 or 30 people would be of great benefit to those areas which are depending so much on the fishing industry at the moment.</P>

      <P>I have tried to deal with things on a national basis.  There are a few things I would like to say about Donegal where we have the major fishing port of this country and it is an utter disgrace that the town of Killybegs, that major fishing port, has not yet got the services of an automatic telephone exchange.  The people there are still depending on the manual exchange and the House knows how important an element time is when you are dealing with fish.  The buyers and processors there very often must leave that town and go to some other part of the county or into Northern Ireland to make contact with their buyers and others abroad.  I ask the Minister to make representations such as I have made consistently in this last year to the Department of Posts and Telegraphs to make Killybegs automatic as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>I regret the time limit on this debate because it prevents any of us from making any kind of worthwhile contribution such as I am sure every Deputy who speaks here would wish to make. The forestry industry has not in the past got the recognition it deserves.  It has been treated more or less as the Cinderella of economic development as is evident in the course of this debate, which has gone on for many hours.  With the exception of the previous speaker who spoke on forestry for about five minutes and my contribution which will be about ten minutes, the matter was not referred to.  This reflects the manner in which the timber industry in general has been treated.  On too many occasions it has fallen the victim of a lack of political commitment to its development.  This erratic approach resulting in a lack of continuity in policy has affected all aspects of economic development in this country but particularly the development of the forestry industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The timber industry, from the initial stages of ground preparation and planting to the various stages of harvesting and processing with the value-added content of all of those stages, should be a major source of profitable economic activity providing valuable employment and reducing the very high and unnecessary import of timber and timber products. Also, the industry is the victim of isolated planning.  Just as you cannot isolate agricultural development from all of its subsidiary industries, neither can you isolate the forestry industry from what should be its subsidiary industries.  I am referring mainly to the construction industry.  We should not allow short-term economic difficulties to deter us from investing in forestry just because the return is slow. We have been the victims of this attitude in the past, but with our knowledge and insight we should not deprive future generations of the benefit of a well-planned forestry industry for which, in fairness to the Department, the foundation has already effectively been laid.  We must <Col N="1087" /> identify all land which is unsuitable for agricultural development.  The State must become more actively involved in the acquisition of this land, paying realistic prices to its owners, and in cases where the owner wishes to develop it himself, making grants and giving advice and, if necessary, subsidised loans available for private forestry development.</P>
    <P>Even at the initial stage of development many more productive jobs could be created in our nurseries in the propagation of trees and in the planting and maintenance of young forest.  Foresters say that lack of care and attention at the initial stage of development seriously retard early growth and the maturity of our forests.  Much progress was made in the area of planting between 1940 and 1950 and we are now in a position to commence reaping the benefit of that investment.  The output of forests is expected to increase from 840,000 cubic metres in 1978 to over 1.6 million by 1993.  This is a very significant growth and presents us with a real opportunity of capitalising on the State investment of 30 or 40 years ago.</P>
    <P>The processing industry will be very important in the years ahead.  It is essential for the purpose of creating jobs and reducing the unacceptable level of timber imports, especially in the construction industry.  The saw milling industry has made significant progress under difficult conditions in terms of output and quality of products.  There is, however, still considerable scope for increasing the value added content of the industry and this is vital at this stage in the national interest. The saw milling and processing industries are the hub of the value added process and it is the duty of the Government, and especially the Department, to create the economic climate in which it can operate and expand, The industry is extremely competitive and is subjected to unfair competition from Northern Ireland where the industry enjoys great State support and a more favourable exchange rate.  The Minister should co-operate more fully with the industry in relation to the sale of timber from State forests. Transport costs are now a major factor <Col N="1088" /> and it should be possible to ensure that unnecessary transport of timber is avoided in relation to the purchasing of this timber by national processors.</P>
    <P>I realise the Department have made a significant contribution to the establishment of the industry.  Forestry workers down through the years have had a remarkable interest in and commitment to its development.  With the increasing volume of timber coming on stream, the time has come to take a more critical look at the Department's entire operation in this field.  Consideration and thought should be given to the establishment of a national agency with full responsibility for developing all aspects of the industry so as to maximise its value to the nation. I do not wish to condemn the system operating at present but I want to ensure that we capitalise and expand on the sound base which has already been established. I have the height of respect for the civil service but I do not believe this programme can be carried out under their aegis.  It would be more effectively carried out by an independant authority. If we are to maximise our income from State investment in forestry, we must increase the capacity of our plants, either by the provision of a national plant or, perhaps more preferably, by providing grants and subsidies to existing operators to increase the capacity of their plants. This step is necessary if we are to reduce our present import bill amounting to approximately £200 million in 1982.  With good organisation and marketing, it should be possible to increase employment in the industry from the 4,000 employed at present to approximately 15,000 in the years ahead.  Recognising the national advantage of reducing timber imports, we cannot afford to neglect the obvious economic gain which exists at present and, more importantly, its potential for development in the future.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister and the Department to give greater attention to the need and the importance of research into forestry. He should consider expanding the training school in Offaly.  I very much regret the difficulties which young foresters are experiencing at present in securing employment.  Last year 12 trainee <Col N="1089" /> foresters who graduated from the forestry school in Kinnitty were unable to find suitable employment within the industry.  That is a regrettable situation which we should try to redress.  I was very pleased to note that the Department will give greater consideration in the future to amenity development.  That is the road ahead.  In the Slieve Bloom area progress has been made and I am very grateful for it.</P>

      <P>I do not know if I am the only Deputy from the Dublin area to speak on this Estimate but I want to make different points to those of other Deputies who obviously had a different attitude because of the relevance of the Estimate to their own constituencies.  A very worth-while exercise could be carried out in educating school children on the importance of forestry.  As a member of a local authority, I am aware that there is a programme in the Dublin Corporation area of tree planting in the grounds of schools to help children to identify different forms of trees and to respect tree life.  Deputy Hyland referred to amenity areas but I believe that trees in a main street are an amenity and can be a great environmental asset.  Children are being taught to respect and to understand the need for proper forestation.  I hope the Minister's remit will extend beyond forests.  I cannot understand why the Minister, as part of the educational process, does not take on direct responsibility for a programme to encourage people to extend respect for trees.  Most trees planted in Dublin in the seventies were vandalised as soon as they were put up, but because of the programme of education trees have been flourishing even in the hardest areas of Dublin.  It is fantastic to see this because in other cities, especially Berlin, they take an interest in tree planting in the centre of the city and ensure that the population will have an understanding of the beauty of trees and of the importance of trees to the economy.  The amenities in the Dublin mountains are very welcome but could the Minister not consider a programme for an <i>Unter den Linden</i> in Dublin?  It would be a very good environmental and <Col N="1090" /> public relations exercise.  In my constituency we have the Rivers Camac, Poddle, Liffey, Dodder and the Grand Canal.</P>
      <P>I am very pleased that a coarse fish stocking programme is being undertaken in relation to the Grand Canal.  That canal divides the outer and inner city areas of my constituency.  This is an area of very high unemployment and many young people who cannot afford summer holidays spend their time fishing from the banks of the canal and catching the odd pike or perch.  I have been pursuing this matter of stocking of the canal for some time and am happy that my representations are coming to fruition.</P>
      <P>I ask the Minister to undertake an examination of all the Dublin rivers.  The river Camac is a trout river in County Dublin but in the city area it is so polluted that fish would not survive in it.  I understand, however, that it will soon be suitable for coarse fishing.  I ask the Minister to ensure that fish life in these rivers from an amenity and a public relations point of view are protected, so that the young people who may be open to encouragement towards vandalism will, instead, take an interest in forestry and fishery matters and spend their time using these amenities.  This would not cost a lot of money.  I ask the Minister not to leave these things to the Department of the Environment.  His Department could do much good for itself in taking the leading role here.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>A Cheann Comhairle, ba mhaith liom ar dtús mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leat féin, leis an Taoiseach, le ceannairí Fhianna Fáil agus leis na Teachtaí go léir atá anseo i ngeall ar an fáilte a chuir sibh romham agus an cuidiú a fuair mé nuair a tháinig mé anseo.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that this is a very serious national issue.  However, by way of example, I refer to the problems of Killybegs which are similar to those of other fishing ports right around our coasts from Donegal, without leaving any port out until one gets back to Dundalk.  The problems are many, but I want to highlight <Col N="1091" /> a few.  First, there is great concern in Killybegs over the proposed reduction in the mackerel quota.  I understand that the current figure of around 80,000 tonnes is being reduced to 55,000 tonnes. The Killybegs fishermen believe that this reduction may be disastrous for them. They claim that the quotas should be increased to approximately 150,000 tonnes.  I qualify that by saying that the Killybegs fishermen have invested heavily in new boats and very expensive equipment.  The larger trawlers are costing them per week something in the region of £4,000 to £5,000.  The initial price of the trawlers is somewhere between £2½ million to £3 million.  Unless these quotas are maintained or increased, the repayments &mdash; which are as high as £½ million per year &mdash; will not be supportable and the fishermen and all involved in that industry will be in trouble.</P>
    <P>The second problem facing the fishermen relates to the larger boats by comparison with the smaller.  The larger trawlers around Killybegs are capable of landing 60,000 tonnes in any given year. Had the quotas been left as they were, that would leave only 20,000 for the smaller trawlers, and here I am speaking about those from 50 foot to 75 foot.  In that case somebody has to suffer.</P>
    <P>My next point is the concern of the fishermen about the apparent lack of control of foreign boats.  I know that we have fishery patrol vessels, but it is a widely held view that many of these foreign boats exceed their quotas.  The only figures available to the public in general and to our fishermen are those given by the countries involved, in other words they are not monitored while fishing in Irish waters.  The vessels from 75 foot to 80 foot depend largely on white fish.  They are affected by the high costs of fuel and of operating which for them are in the region of £1,500 to £2,000 a week.  This does not take into account the cost of repayment to An Bord Iascaigh Mhara. It must also be appreciated that the smaller boats do not have the earning potential of the larger ones.  The fishermen say that the price of white fish in <Col N="1092" /> Donegal is relatively good at the moment, but that some steps should be taken to increase the quantity of fish landed.  They, and everybody else concerned, would like to know if anything is being done to develop the white fish industry.</P>
    <P>Our main mackerel markets are Nigeria and Egypt.  The processers in Killybegs are concerned at the present delay of up to 11 months between the time of dispatching the processed food and at receipt of payment.  They cannot operate in such a fashion.  They ask the Government to guarantee them credit facilities and say that unless this is done they will be unable to buy fish which, in turn, will bring about a severe curtailment of employment in the industry.  It has already been mentioned that Egypt are accepting and paying for fish at the point of entry.  This is not acceptable to the fishing industry, for very obvious reasons.  The fishermen ask if the Minister could negotiate a more favourable agreement with the Egyptians.</P>
    <P>If the problems relating to these two countries are not over come, it will have a devastating effect on the employment situation in Killybegs.  There, between October and March, at least 1,000 people are employed directly in the fishing industry. The Minister has mentioned that Killybegs is being developed and that dredging is completed.  However, there are other problems in our fishing ports which have yet to be dealt with.  We are all aware that no fishing industry can survive or thrive without proper landing and off-shore facilities.</P>
    <P>The fishermen of Burtonport are adversely affected, firstly because the larger trawlers cannot enter the harbour and secondly, because although they were promised an extension of the pier and dredging of the harbour, neither of these has been done to date.  If Burtonport is not developed the fishermen of that area believe that the port will decline because the engineering and other service industries associated with fishing will concentrate on Killybegs.</P>
    <P>Another question was, if the Minister would clarify if all port development has been stopped.  There was some development <Col N="1093" /> of smaller ports such as Inver and Greencastle.  People wonder if the developments which were promised have been shelved for the time being.  When speaking to fishermen I found they could not understand why foreign boatyards can produce boats much cheaper than we can here.  They feel that something should be done about this.</P>
    <P>What has the Department in relation to the Common Fisheries Policy for this year?  What is their policy towards fisheries for the future?  Fishermen believe there should be more consultation between them and the Government before decisions are taken at Government level.  They find that decisions are made for them rather than with them. Further research should be carried out in relation to diversification from overdependence on herring and mackerel. There is need for a move towards white fish and non-traditional species such as horse-mackerel, ling, dog-fish and sprat. These should be processed.  By doing so more work will be made available.</P>
    <P>My next point is on behalf of inshore fishermen.  They operate with half-deckers and sometimes smaller boats.  They claim that there is a great increase in the number of seals evident along the coast. They want to know if anything will be done about this.  We can conserve seals but we also need to conserve salmon. They do not consider the season which starts in March and ends in July as suitable. I am sure the same applies to fishermen around the coast.  They want to know how the Government would feel about a suggestion that fishing should start in May and end in August.</P>
    <P>It is important from the fisherman's point of view to keep operation costs to a minimum.  Fuel accounts for about 70 per cent of a fisherman's total costs.  The Minister should look seriously at the possibility of making a special arrangement with the fuel suppliers.  Oil prices are falling but there is no evidence that the benefit is being passed on to the fishing industry.  The most important issue as far as fishermen are concerned is the price they are paid for the fish they land.  Guaranteed minimum prices would be the answer.</P>

      <P>I rise to make a plea to the Minister on behalf of the Mornington mussel fishermen.  County Meath has a very small coastline of about five miles. I often envy counties with large coastlines. We have a problem in County Meath which is caused by sewage in Drogheda.  The Mornington mussel has a very proud tradition in the UK and on the continent.  There are about 50 families involved in the small fishing village of Mornington.  The sewage problem emanates from Drogheda.  Drogheda Corporation are seeking to put in an intersector plant to arrest the sewage problem which is affecting the mussels.  The Department are fully aware of the problem as are the North Eastern Health Board and the Eastern Health Board.  I appeal to the Minister to use his influence to have the problem in Mornington arrested.</P>

      <P>A number of Deputies spoke about the need for a planned development programme following completion of the negotiations on the common fisheries policy.  While I fully agree with the concept I wish to dispel the idea that no plan exists as far as the fishing industry is concerned.  Nothing could be further from the truth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any plan contains a number of elements. In the case of the fishing industry these can be broken down into four categories &mdash; catching, marketing, education and training, harbour development and research.  Considerable progress has been made under these headings.  The efficiency of the existing programme is being actively reviewed in the light of the common fisheries policy.  The central advisory committee which functions under the auspices of the Department of the Taoiseach has set up a fisheries advisory committee.  The committee comprise representatives of the various fishing interests as well as outside experts.  I look forward to receiving from them shortly a report which should be of tremendous assistance in the preparation of <Col N="1096" /> a cohesive plan for the future development of the industry.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies spoke of the concern on the part of a large body of fishermen who have fallen into arrears with their repayments.  I wish it to be known that BIM have been asked to consider each of these cases on its merits.  I am satisfied that this is being done.  The board have set up a rescue unit and talks have taken place with a number of fishermen who have been assisted by way of the restructuring of their accounts, by the provision of additional grants and loan facilities for the repair and restructuring of their vessels and by way of technical advice.  Examination of the remaining cases that are seriously in arrears is proceeding as staffing circumstances permit. I am very familiar personally with the borrowing problems as a result of the difficulties being faced by farmers in Wexford in this respect.  Therefore, I appreciate the extent of the problem. Any skipper who makes a genuine effort to meet his commitments will be dealt with sympathetically.  If any Deputy on either side of the House is of the opinion that any boat owner or skipper is being badly treated in this respect, he should contact me personally when I would be prepared to deal with the case.  I have acted in this way with members of the IFO and I will continue to do so on the basis of representations from Deputies on either side of the House.  I am offering that facility because I consider it to be necessary at this stage.</P>
    <P>I do not share Deputy Begley's view in relation either to my Department or to BIM.  During my short term in office so far as Minister of State with responsibility for Fisheries and Forestry I have found an exceptionally sound administration both in the Department and in BIM backed up by very competent staffs.  I look forward to a fruitful term of office in both these Departments.  There is no basis for Deputy Begley's criticism.</P>
    <P>One of the main items referred to has been the EEC negotiations, about the outcome of which concern has been expressed in the context of total allowable catches and quotas for 1983.  I assure the House that the strongest possible <Col N="1097" /> resistance will be mounted by the Minister and by myself to any arrangement that would involve a reduction for this country in terms of total allowable catches.  I appreciate that each country will fight its own case.  We are now down to a situation in which there is a total allowable catch for the entire Community so that everyone will be doing his best so far as the catch is concerned.  I am giving the undertaking that we will fight tooth and nail to maintain our level of the catch.</P>
    <P>One of the major issues raised here has been the question of Spanish vessels and about their operation in our waters.  I should like to clarify the situation.  There are involved three different categories of vessel.  First, there are Spanish vessels that were registered in Spain and which on the basis of holding an EEC licence can fish in our waters at a point up to the 50-mile limit but which if they do not hold such a licence can fish only outside the 200-mile limit.  The restriction is being policed by the Naval Service whom I should like to compliment on their swift action in the past fortnight particularly.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are vessels that were formerly Spanish but which have registered in Britain thereby securing the same rights as the British in relation to fishing in our waters.  Legislation to deal with this problem will be introduced in the House shortly and I am confident that it will be enacted before we adjourn for the Summer Recess.  I wish to emphasise that there has been no delay on the legislation so far as the Department are concerned but most people will be prepared to accept that the Bill is complex and difficult.  Thirdly, there are former Spanish vessels which have registered as Irish vessels and which in some cases are owned in part by Irish citizens.  These vessels are operating in the Castletownbere area.  I spent a day there to find out first-hand what the position is.  I am not pleased with the operation but it, too, is a matter that will be dealt with in the legislation.</P>
    <P>I assure the House that the Department will not allow any erosion of our position so far as the Spanish fishermen are concerned.  It would be fatal for our <Col N="1098" /> fishermen to do so.  While there is pressure from all sides for certain developments relating to Spanish interests, that pressure will be resisted.</P>
    <P>Another question raised is that of harbour development.  As the House will be aware, we have five major harbours. These harbours have been given priority in terms of development.  While I do not intend to criticise the people who made the decision in that regard, there should have been a certain allocation to the smaller harbours.  The small harbours have suffered as a result of the huge investment in the five major harbours which include Killybegs.  Unfortunately, the smaller harbours are now in a very bad state of repair.  I have been considering the 1983-84 Estimate and in that context, I will be ensuring that the smaller harbours receive some allocation. I am glad to inform Deputy Byrne that Wexford County Council at their meeting next Monday may expect an announcement that £60,000 has been allocated for the repair of the breach at Kilmore Harbour and also that money owed to Wexford County Council for development at Courtown has been agreed.  In this respect a sum of £21,000 will be paid over to the county council.</P>
    <P>Deputy Byrne said that the Minister did not refer in any way to the Wexford constituency.  In introducing an Estimate, it is not for the Minister to mention an individual constituency.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <P>I did not notice a great deal of interest in afforestation during this debate.  That is regrettable.  It is an area in which I am very interested and one that has tremendous potential for our economy.  I am hopeful of being able to make a special announcement in the very near future about land acquisition for afforestation purposes.  A huge area of land which could be growing timber is lying idle and it is my duty to encourage the owners of that land either to plant it or allow the Department to acquire it. Huge tracts of land are at present carrying one livestock unit to six or seven acres and this is waste of a natural resource.  It is my intention to introduce completely new policies in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Daly mentioned the large amount of timber imports.  It is true that imports are far too high but I can assure the House that the Department are doing all in their power to bring about an increasing use of home-grown timber.  In this they have the active support and assistance of bodies such as the Department of the Environment, the IDA and the IIRS.  Import substitution is a primary objective but it must be realised that the <Col N="1100" /> process will be gradual because of the age structure of our forests, some two-thirds of which have not yet reached the stage of producing saw log timber.  The report on the timber industry to which Deputy Daly referred has already been published by the IDA and is entitled &ldquo;Development of Timber Industry for the Eighties&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I understand it will be published in the very near future. Regarding the marketing of fish, I am setting up an advisory board comprised of representative of all interested parties, processors, exporters and fishermen. There are serious problems in the area of marketing which must be dealt with quickly and we will also deal with processing.  We are now moving towards the herring and mackerel season and we must prevent dumping.</P>

      <P>I am not removing any powers from BIM.  The board will be set up in co-operation with BIM and the headquarters will be in the BIM offices. I will be acting as chairman of the board because I believe they must have political support.  BIM will also have representatives on this board.  The dumping of fish must be avoided at all costs.</P>
      <P>Fishery and forestry are valuable natural resources and it is my intention to develop both these areas.  My main effort is to consolidate the fleet.  There is a serious problem in this regard which has not arisen overnight.  Marketing is the next problem and it is a matter which has been neglected in all sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding forestry, the important matter is the acquisition of land.  We are down to about 16,000 acres per annum and the land bank is about 22,000 acres, less than a year's planting.  I hope to make announcements concerning these matters within the next month.  I thank everybody who took part in the debate and look <Col N="1101" /> forward to a more lengthy discussion in the coming months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Energy (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £213,365,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1983, for salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>The Estimate for my Department for 1983 provides for a total of £213,365,000, a decrease of approximately £50 million on last year's outturn.  My Department's Estimate takes fully into account the Government's objective of reducing public expenditure.  However, the reductions do not imply a les effective role by my Department in the development of industry and energy in the country.</P>
      <P>Most of the saving in 1983 is due to the fact that no provision has been made this year for the Irish National Petroleum Corporation or for Irish Steel Limited, for which provisions of £10 million and £25 million respectively were made in 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other major savings were in grants-in-aid to the IDA for capital purposes <Col N="1102" /> (£28 million), State support for mining operations (£4.2 million) and the town gas subsidy (£2.6 million).  The reduction in the grants to the IDA reflects the somewhat smaller demand on IDA services in a number of spheres, notably in their building operations where they have adequate stock of advance factories.  The town gas subsidy reduction is possible because of the development in the use of our natural gas resources in the Dublin and Cork areas while most of the money saved on mining operations is due to the winding up of the Avoca Mining Company.</P>
    <P>These savings were partially offset by the provision of £7 million for the National Development Corporation, £3 million for the National Enterprise Agency, a shipbuilding subsidy of £2.2 million and the provision of £1.7 million for the purchase of Clondalkin Paper Mills.  In addition, there was an extra £2.8 million provided for the IDA administration and almost £1 million extra for SFADCo grants to industry.</P>
    <P>The areas I will concentrate on in my speech are the development of industrial policy, improving the efficiencies of State-sponsored bodies and the cost and security of energy supplies.</P>
    <P>We are at a crucial stage in industrial development.  Our indigenous industry is internationally uncompetitive and is even losing market share on the domestic market. Wage increases are wiping out hard earned productivity gains.  There is a growing trend towards protectionism worldwide which will seriously damage both our exports and our ability to attract new foreign investment.  It is clear then that competitiveness &mdash; all round competitiveness &mdash; must be central in our strategy for recovery.  It will be the dominant theme in the White Paper on Industrial Policy which I am having prepared in my Department.  The White Paper will spell out measures designed to improve the environment for industry, thus enabling us to take advantage of the economic recovery.  Whatever changes of emphasis may be evident in the White Paper, it will be based on one clear premise. It is that in this country in the eighties <Col N="1103" /> and nineties industry will be the motor of economic growth.</P>
    <P>We must be ready and willing to adapt to rapid technological changes, improve our industrial relations and our quality image.  We must achieve high rates of productivity and output growth if we are to create the wealth that in turn will provide the jobs for our unacceptably high numbers of unemployed.  Government action alone will not solve our industrial problems.  It also requires the goodwill and active co-operation of both employers and trade unions.</P>
    <P>The commercial State-sponsored bodies play a critical role in the economic life of the State.  For example, the seven commercial bodies operating under my aegis have a combined annual turnover of £900 million approximately and employ in the region of 21,500 people &mdash; over 10 per cent of the industrial work force.  The State bodies have been a useful source of commercial and entrepreneurial innovation in our economic development since the foundation of the State.  However, they have been subject to growing criticism in recent years for a variety of reasons, principally the overall deterioration in their financial positions and the level of their prices or charges in certain cases.</P>
    <P>I believe that the right way to address the problems of the commercial State bodies is to look to their boards and senior managements who are primarily responsible for their control and supervision. Board members must be fully aware of their individual and collective responsibility for the performance of their organisation.  A problem in recent years has been the tendency to pass on their problems for the Cabinet to solve.</P>
    <P>There must be more accountability to central Government and the Oireachtas for the performance of the bodies and targets must be set against which their performance may be measured.  The introduction of corporate plans for the bodies is under consideration.  This will necessitate a more professional and highly-focused monitoring of their activities by central Government and involve improving the expertise and business <Col N="1104" /> experience of central Government staff as well.</P>
    <P>Turning to energy, my main concerns are with the cost of energy, security of supply, the development of indigenous resources and an adequate return on the very large public sector capital investment in this area which comes to £300 million this year.  This is a complex area in which the different factors have to be carefully balanced and account taken of the massive investment and long lead times that are necessary to bring about fundamental changes.</P>
    <P>The cost of energy has risen dramatically in the past decade.  This price rise was initially &ldquo;fuelled&rdquo; by the impact of OPEC in raising oil prices and in more recent times by the continued strengthening of the dollar.  These were international trends broadly affecting most industrialised countries in a similar fashion but which hit Ireland more than most countries.  But these are now being added to by domestic factors and it is becoming clear that growing energy costs are seriously affecting our industrial development and competitiveness, as well as raising the cost of living of ordinary consumers.  The effective performance of the public sector agencies in supplying electricity, peat, natural gas and oil is a major part of the Government's review of State-sponsored bodies to which I have referred.  I will return to this in more detail.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to proceed with the publication of the White Paper on Industrial Policy in the coming months.  I do not propose to speak in detail about the likely content of this paper.  When I took office I reviewed the work which had been done on it and I concluded that I should not simply rubber-stamp this work and hastily publish a document which must address probably the most fundamental task that faces us during the remainder of this decade. As I have said, competitiveness is the major objective.</P>
    <P>What might be described as the basic professional work on the White Paper has been carried out.  There are the NESC and Telesis Reports and the analysis and recommendations by an <Col N="1105" /> inter-departmental committee on these reports.  The IDA have prepared a strategic plan which has been reviewed in joint discussions which I and officials of my Department have had with the IDA.</P>
    <P>In the course of these discussions both with the members of the Authority and with the executive board and senior managements of the IDA, we have reached a broad consensus on issues of strategic importance.  We are in general agreement on how the international environment for industrial development and promotion is likely to work out when the present world recession lifts.  We have considered the range of problems, some of them complex and not easy to solve, which must be tackled to improve the domestic environment for growth in the industrial, service and commercial sectors.  We have also agreed broadly on the lines on which future policy should proceed.</P>
    <P>The completion of work on the White Paper will be carried out under my supervision and in consultation with the Government Task Force on Employment. My intention is that the development programmes for industry which will emerge will be consistent with and complementary to the Government's overall economic policies.</P>
    <P>I should make it clear that the White Paper will not contain any &ldquo;soft options&rdquo; but will chart in a realistic way the Government's industrial strategy for the decade ahead.  The emphasis will have to be on action rather than rhetoric.  Against this background, industry will be in a position to plan its business with a degree of confidence and assurance for the future.  The eighties will be the toughest period ever in the history of Irish industry because European markets' growth rates are unlikely to exceed the low levels of the seventies; competition in the market place will intensify in response to slow growth, rising unemployment and increased competition from newly industrialised countries; technological change will intensify as competition accelerates and mobile investment will be reduced and competion for it greatly increased.</P>
    <P>It is in this changing economic environment that Ireland has the challenge not only of reducing its high unemployment <Col N="1106" /> level but also to create employment for the most rapidly growing labour force in Europe.</P>
    <P>In recent years manufacturing industry's competitiveness has been seriously undermined.  To put the blame on external factors would be to fail to recognise the reality that domestically generated cost and price inflation have been the principal source of the problem.</P>
    <P>We have many advantages which are appreciated in the countries from which we hope to attract industrial investment. But it would be a mistake to assume that our weaknesses go unnoticed.  A number of German businessmen whom I met recently expressed their concern at the rate of wage and price inflation in Ireland relative to the rest of Europe.  The unreal level of some of the wage claims lodged here can have an alarming effect on potential investors on the Continent and in the US.  They expect, even allowing for the niceties of bargaining and asking figures which one always expects to get, a greater sense of realism in industrial relations than may be evident here most of the time.</P>
    <P>Apart from the damage which these cost increases impose on firms which are fighting for survival, they seriously damage Ireland's attractiveness as a location for the establishment of new industries and the expansion, often decided outside the country, of existing companies here.</P>
    <P>As a first step to tackling this problem we must measure and assess the trends in the major cost elements affecting industrial performance.  In the past Government policies have often added to industry's difficulties.  This is why I have recently established a committee to monitor costs and prices to industry and to advise the Government on the implications for industry of any new policy proposals in areas such as taxation, social welfare and State company pricing.</P>
    <P>When viewed purely in an overall statistical light, Irish manufacturing industry's productivity record has in the past five to six years been moderately encouraging. However, the gains which we have made have been bought very dearly. Despite State support by way of grants and tax concessions amounting to many <Col N="1107" /> hundreds of millions of pounds in recent years, manufacturing employment is now down to its 1975 level.  The hard and bitter lesson which we have to accept is that the growth in industrial earnings has been wiping out the advances which we have been making in productivity.</P>
    <P>This requires that we seek to pursue excellence, not alone in production, but in the key strategic functions of marketing and design.  It is only by doing this that we can make up for the losses in competitiveness in other areas.  Increased market share &mdash; and this is the only path to growth &mdash; can only be achieved by higher productivity and efficiency in the use of all factors of production.  In short, it means we must be internationally competitive.</P>
    <P>Enhancing our competitiveness is not simply a matter of curbing wage levels or shedding excess labour.  It is, of course, important that industry keeps its costs in check and that manning levels are consistent with efficient operation.  It is equally important that the services bought in by industry from outside represent good value for money.</P>
    <P>This is only part of the picture.  Non-cost factors such as management efficiency, sound financial control, marketing expertise and new product development are even more critical to the survival and growth of a manufacturing undertaking.  Productivity is a key element in competitiveness.  There is no magic formula to increasing productivity. It requires a combination of the efficient organisation of production; flexible and co-operative work practices, and increased sales and value added.</P>
    <P>It is patently obvious that if we as a nation are to increase our living standards we must continue to improve our performance on export markets.  We are totally dependent on export-led growth and our greatest threat at present is the move towards short-sighted protectionist policies even among countries who have traditionally been committed to a free and open market.  This protectionist trend has manifested itself in the EEC in moves to curb Japanese imports.  The Government are opposed to such moves <Col N="1108" /> and we will use all our influence in the EEC to prevent any form of protectionism because it is against our interest as an export nation and also is against the prospects for an early economic recovery in the world.</P>
    <P>The best way that European industry can limit imports from outside the EEC is to become equally as competitive on world markets and this is what we will be trying to do with Irish industry.  As part of this on-going development we are prepared to learn from the success of the industrial countries such as the US, Germany and Japan and of course we will continue to attract and wholeheartedly welcome new investment from these countries.</P>
    <P>The nature of much of modern industry is that change, and rapid change at that, are constant threats to survival.  Many of the products and processes of today could be relegated to the realm of history in 12 to 18 months time, if not sooner.  Modern technology and its successful implementation make traditional demarcation and restrictive work practices totally irrelevant. Every product, no matter how well designed, conceived or marketed, has limited product life.  People must remember this and that we are going through a phase in which new products will replace old and industries will rise and fall.</P>
    <P>There have been instances in the past where new machinery and equipment have never been brought into use because of an obdurate resistance to change by workers.  In other instances compensation has been conceded as a right where the installation of new machinery and the associated improvement in work practices were essential to the firms survival and, therefore, to the survival of the jobs in question.  In blunt terms that means compensating people for having their jobs saved.  In future the rewards for greater productivity will not generally be felt in the wage packet but in the satisfaction and security of a long term job.  It is only through that that jobs can be secured by further investment in new technology.</P>
    <P>Industrial relations are, of course, a two way thing.  Bad industrial relations very often arise and are allowed to fester <Col N="1109" /> because managements fail to give unavoidable problems on the factory floor the time and attention which they deserve.  If changes are dictated by the marketplace the onus is on management as well as workers to face up to the new and harsh realities.</P>
    <P>Absenteeism has been an even greater scourge to industry than strikes.  In fact, man days lost through absenteeism have in some recent years been between 15 and 30 times greater than those caused by strikes.  We can no longer tolerate or indeed afford this type of selfish and unjustified attitude.</P>
    <P>This serious problem is one which surprisingly has received little public attention so far.  In the case of a number of large Irish firms the absenteeism rate has been steadily increasing during the seventies and is currently running at levels of up to 20 per cent.</P>
    <P>An ESRI study in 1982 contained some frightening statistics which give some idea of the scale of the problem.  For example, the number of working days lost through illness in 1978 was 12 per cent of total potential working days.  This was equivalent to over five and a half weeks lost time per person per year or to withdrawing 100,000 persons from the insured labour force for that year.  It represented lost production of £340 million or 5.5 per cent of GDP.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, a large proportion of these cases were genuine but there is more than a strong suspicion that abuses in this area are commonplace.  Perhaps a more disturbing element is that such abuses are no longer regarded as socially unacceptable.  It may be that there has been some improvement in absenteeism rates of late &mdash; perhaps influenced by the high unemployment levels and greater anxiety about job security.  Nevertheless, I have noted that a number of firms still regard this matter as a major problem which adversely affects their costs and competitiveness.  I have to confirm that on visits to a number of foreign firms located here this problem has been mentioned as being serious for them and a difficulty for them in recommending to their parent companies that further expansion should take place here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1110" /> Lest I have given the impression that all or many of the problems of industry are due to the workers, I would like to address some even harder words to Irish management generally.</P>
    <P>There are a number of disturbing factors in the performance of Irish industry in recent years.  The sad reality is that many Irish firms &mdash; in fact too many of them &mdash; are not competitive in free trade conditions.  One thing which causes me most concern is increased import penetration which is the one most readily rectified by a little thought on all our parts.</P>
    <P>There can be little excuse offered by any of us for the fact that importers' share of our domestic market has increased from 29% in 1977 to 37.5% in 1980.  The effects of these increased imports are particularly keenly felt in the textile, clothing, footwear and leather and furniture sectors.</P>
    <P>When one considers that import prices in these sectors have been growing faster than domestic prices in recent years, serious questions need to be asked about the marketing efficiency, quality, choice and delivery reliability offered by Irish firms.  It is not just a question of cheap imports but a question of imports being able to beat us in fields such as marketing efficiency, quality, choice and delivery reliability which are factors essentially within our own control and within the control of our management.  These are areas in which we need to do better and to do so quickly.</P>
    <P>Again, when I look at the number of industries established in Ireland in recent years, all of which import a large volume of their everyday needs, I see a huge opportunity lost by Irish industry.  In 1978-79 new industry firms purchased only 14.5 per cent of their requirements in Ireland and most of these products are made up of packaging, simple metal products and other goods not normally imported on a weight for value basis.</P>
    <P>New industry firms could double the value of their domestic purchases with ease and, in fact, are anxious to do so.  But again we are faced with the old problems of poor quality control, inability to meet delivery dates and a lack of price <Col N="1111" /> competitiveness.  The first two are as important as the last one in this context. A lot of discussion on import penetration tends to concentrate on prices and wage costs rather than on other matters more directly within the competence of industry, such as quality control, delivery dates and so on.</P>
    <P>Our much heralded export success in recent years is largely attributable to the expansion of new overseas industry, particularly in electronics and chemicals. I have not tired of pointing out that in a world market which contracted last year by ½ per cent Irish exports increased by 13 per cent.  This was largely the result of new production being brought into being by much maligned foreign industry. Export growth in indigenous industry has been poor.  In the period immediately ahead, I will be looking for a new dynamism from native Irish industry.  Our exports grew remarkably last year.  It is in one sense a reproach to us, however, that this surge in exports was laid mainly by foreign companies.</P>
    <P>Few new Irish firms established in the past 15 years have managed to overcome the formidable barriers to exporting in a competitive world.  Irish companies should be doing much more in this area. This may be due to a lack of long-term commitment to marketing, and to general conservatism on the part of traditional Irish industries.  It may also have something to do with the status of enterprise in our scale of values and our tendency to be suspicious of business success. Let me draw a clear distinction between successful creative enterprise, which should be applauded, and mere opportunist speculation.  We need enterprise and profit-making industries in this country as surely as our soil must have water.</P>
    <P>Many references have also been made in recent months to import substitution. True import substitution is about improving the competitiveness of our own goods and services through improvements in quality, price, product design, delivery and after sales service so that Irish products can win the genuine support of our population in the domestic market place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1112" /> Quality is among the most important of these considerations.  Many Irish firms have been slow to recognise the importance of quality and are clearly more preoccupied with production and price considerations.  Successive surveys have revealed that quality is the main influence in determining whether overseas customers buy from one supplier rather than another.  I could not stress that often enough.  Many small firms fail on their first export ventures because of poor quality.  This must also be of relevance as far as our home market is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Irish Quality Control Association have estimated that over £245 million is lost by Irish industry because most firms pay insufficient attention to the application of quality control systems and methods. There is a misconception that quality can be controlled by finished product inspection rather than by systematic and careful attention to the more fundamental matters that go to make up quality, namely, market research, advance design, supplier evaluation, incoming raw materials control, in-process control and after-sales service.  There is no point having a good quality control product if you are producing the wrong product.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that improving product quality improves competitiveness dramatically, not only through an improvement in the quality of the product, but also through cost reduction and elimination of rejects.  The direct result of improving competitiveness is, of course, job security and the prevention of job losses.  We must now formulate the policies necessary to strengthen the indigenous manufacturing sector.  This is a task we must face up to and overcome if we are to provide the standard of living demanded by our people.</P>
    <P>The basic elements of our industrial strategy of the future are already clear. For medium and large firms the objective must be to strengthen their business so that they can regain a greater share of the Irish market and contribute significantly to exports.  The primary onus for these changes will rest with the management of the firms concerned.  We must also get the committed involvement of workers and their representative in this process.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> The role of State assistance to the sector must, however, also be adapted to these ends and strike the right balance between investment, market development and technological capacity.  This will require: first, the development of close on-going relationships with the staff of the State development agencies and companies so as to be aware of their precise needs and to be more effective in tailoring State aid to companies' requirements, and secondly, the provision of financial and non-financial aid as appropriate, and the latter may be even more important in the future.</P>
    <P>In the area of small firm development it will be necessary to build on the expansion and development of Irish small firms in recent years and to aid firms in successfully meeting the challenges of the eighties.  Ideally the most efficient and cost-effective manner for promotion and development of small firms is by being closer to the client.</P>
    <P>A start has already been made with the regionalisation of the IDA's small industry programme.  The IDA are at present in the process of assigning a small industry specialist to each of their regional offices.  In addition, a concentrated small industry programme has been launched on a pilot basis in Cork city and the non-designated areas of County Cork.</P>
    <P>We have in recent weeks suffered severely from redundancies due to the closure of large industrial firms.  Many of those who lost their jobs are highly skilled people.  I have asked my Department and the IDA to explore the opportunities which may enable these people who have become redundant to set up in business for themselves using their skills.  Indeed taking the &ldquo;Start your own business&rdquo; theme further, I have arranged that the IDA will soon be opening an office in Dublin specifically to help people who wish to launch a business or industry on their own.</P>
    <P>This office will be open not just during normal office hours, but in the evening as well so that people who have existing employment, and who do not wish to have to take leave and explain to their employer why they are taking leave to visit the IDA, will be able to meet IDA <Col N="1114" /> specialists in this office in the evening. This will be of valuable assistance in the development of the enterprise sector, particularly in the Dublin area.  If it is successful, it can be expanded to other major centres as well.</P>
    <P>I should also add on this subject, if I may, with your indulgence, Sir, that, apart from their advertising campaign which most Members here will have seen either in the papers or on television, if they get a chance to see the media with the heavy pressure we work under, the IDA have launched a series of regional meetings, about 20 or 30 of them, in various provincial centres where people who might have an idea for a small business are being invited to meet IDA executives.</P>
    <P>The main thrust of Shannon Development's industrial development programmes in 1983 is to secure major manufacturing projects for the Shannon Industrial Estate and to develop Shannon intensively as a major service industry location within Ireland.  Under SFADCo's Small Industry Programme the focus will be on lifting competence in technology, design, marketing and management skills in new and existing firms. Development of new programmes and systems, in addition to experimentation in field services and related business services support systems, will be undertaken in an intensive way.  Special emphasis will be placed on the development of the small indigenous food processing sector and a specially designed food processing enterprise centre is to be built in Limerick city.  I know my predeccessor will be interested in this development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, in this field the value of SFADCo is that it is an authority wherein one can try out new markets and new ideas with a view to possibly applying them nationally afterwards and, if they do not work out, we are not committed to applying them over the whole country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Innovation Centre is to be given additional factory &ldquo;nursery&rdquo; units where small firms or individuals can develop <Col N="1115" /> new products or refine technology transfer processes to particular products. Indeed, the services and advice of the centre are available on a nationwide basis and are being used by people and firms throughout the country.  Other policy initiatives include ways of stimulating a higher number of high technology start-ups and methods of improving the &ldquo;linkage&rdquo; performance of Irish industry.</P>
    <P>The Programme for Government provided for the establishment of a National Development Corporation which would have an important innovative and developmental role directed particularly towards potential growth areas of the economy.  At present, I am giving consideration to the structure and role of the proposed corporation, including the statutory measures to establish it, and how best to integrate the operations of the National Enterprise Agency into the corporation.</P>
    <P>It is essential that the detailed criteria governing the operations of the corporation and its structure are properly thought through.  This is necessary in order to ensure that the corporation has a clear mandate and solid foundation to undertake its development functions relating to investment in new job creating commercially viable projects and its supervisory functions over commercial State bodies in the manufacturing/energy sectors.</P>

      <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy will deal with the role of the National Development Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need also to establish mechanisms which would channel available institutional money into small and large firms, thus reducing their excessive <Col N="1116" /> dependence on loan finance &mdash; a major constraint on company development. The Government are confident that appropriate measures can be put in place which will ensure the further development of a vibrant indigenous industries sector.</P>
    <P>I have recently met the investment banks with a view to encouraging them to play a greater role in providing venture type capital to industry.  The absence of an effective venture capital market in Ireland has been a constraint on developing indigenous high technology companies.</P>
    <P>Much of the necessary planning and research and development work has to be undertaken at the pre-commercialisation stage when a firm is earning little or no revenue.  Therefore, traditional bank borrowings are not a feasible or appropriate method of financing because of high interest and debt repayments which have to be met even before the project is making any return.  I am convinced of the need for a venture capital industry in Ireland, similar to that which has been so successful in the United States in recent years.  I am currently developing proposals following consultations with both the banks and the stock exchange on how we bring this about here.</P>
    <P>If I may elaborate on that, as I see it, there is an undue reliance on bank finance for a great deal of industrial development.  We have real interest rates of about 6.5 per cent.  When you compare a rate of inflation of not much more than 10 per cent in the year ahead with interest rates of 16.75 per cent, or in that sort of region, that means you are paying 6.5 per cent just to have the money.  A few years ago effectively we had negative interest rates, although people were complaining bitterly about interest rates.  Inflation was actually running higher and faster than the amount people were paying.  When people who are trying to get a new industry going with a new project have to pay that sort of interest rate, it is a very heavy burden.</P>
    <P>Perhaps we could get some of the equity which is available.  I am thinking of pension funds and other bodies who <Col N="1117" /> collect and save money for people and for whom the tax code makes it more attractive to put their money into Government gilts which are the most attractive of all because there is no capital gains tax on Government gilts as we all know, or into housing.  We are all aware of the section 23 concessions about which there is a great consensus here.  They attract money into housing.  We have almost reached the point of saturation in the rented accommodation market because of the success of section 23.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about it.  In terms of creating jobs, it is more urgent that we should get money into manufacturing than it is that we should get money into housing, and it is probably more urgent that we should get money into housing than it is that we should get money into Government gilts and the financing of Government borrowing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister's colleagues agree?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think they would.  I think we would all accept that.  Yet, the scale of Government incentives is precisely the opposite to national need. There is the greatest incentive to get your money into gilt, the next to housing, and the least to manufacturing.</P>
      <P>The market for internationally mobile manufacturing investment is more competitive now than at any time in the past as European Governments strive to cope with ever-increasing unemployment levels. If Ireland is to maintain its position as the prime location in Europe for such investments, it will be necessary to emphasise our national commitment to overseas investment in the most practical way possible &mdash; by generating and sustaining a favourable environment for such activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Nothing less will suffice if we are to increase the share of available overseas investment coming to Ireland while, at the same time, deepening the involvement of overseas companies once they are established in this country by encouraging them to develop total businesses and by increasing the degree to which <Col N="1118" /> overseas firms assist the development of indigenous industries.</P>
    <P>Competition for new investment is now quite fierce.  No overseas businessman has to locate his plant in Ireland.  He will be welcomed in many other places.  He will come here only if we maintain our advantages over those other competitors who now vie with us for investment and jobs.</P>
    <P>Although the international environment is clearly beyond our control the Government are commited to creating within Ireland an environment in which the type of commercial risk taking which is the basis of modern successful industries is encouraged and rewarded.  The Government believe that some existing company structures are not conducive to the creation of strong, well managed Irish companies, which are internationally competitive.  In particular, there is a need for structures to be developed within Irish manufacturing companies to encourage top calibre, professional managers into industry and to enable them to use their knowledge and skills to the full.</P>
    <P>As part of my industrial strategy, I want to see closer links between our second level schools, technological colleges and universities and the industrial and commercial world.  We must cultivate an awareness of the importance of industry in our society.  I would welcome contributions in the House on how best we can enhance the links between schools and industry.  How many students in our schools have been told recently by the teacher or lecturer that their father's job, and their own pocket money, entirely depends, directly or indirectly, on our ability to sell our goods in a harshly competitive export market?</P>
    <P>The years ahead pose major problems for the development of the industrial base in Ireland.  It will be necessary if we are to succeed to take full advantage of the many fine assets at our disposal.  We must, in particular, maximise the advantage that our young, able and skilled work force offers us.  We must build on our already proven ability to support high technology industry in this country.  Of prime importance will be the acquisition and correct applications of suitable technology <Col N="1119" /> for the development of industry. In particular, it will be necessary to ensure that,</P>
    <P>&mdash; personnel trained in relevant technologies are available to industry,</P>
    <P>&mdash; information on technology is available and that companies are assisted to acquire technology,</P>
    <P>&mdash; that optimum use is made of acquired technology.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will know, responsibility for the National Board for Science and Technology has recently been transferred to me.  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards is already under the aegis of my Department.  With these two bodies and with the high-technology developments being promoted by the IDA and SFADCo, there is an opportunity to take a fresh look now at how this total potential for improving our technological standards can be used to best advantage.</P>
    <P>I do not think the answer lies in new organisations or new structures &mdash; some might argue that we have too many of them already &mdash; nor do I think we should try to compete with the resources of major industrial economies in the realm of pure R and D.  I would, however, like to see substantial efforts being made to secure the monitoring of technological developments which would be of interest here and for the transfer of appropriate technology to Irish firms.  I will be developing these ideas and will look to have a close relationship between the scientific bodies, the promotional bodies like the IDA and SFADCo and the people actively involved in industry.</P>
    <P>Technological innovation is vital to the development of a successful industrial base.  For this reason we must be prepared to allocate funds for the development of technologies appropriate to Ireland.  Since we cannot hope to compete in technology across the board, the best option for a small country with our limited resources is to fund development in selected niches in many sectors of the economy.</P>
    <P>Niche selection &mdash; this is the key thing <Col N="1120" /> because you cannot identify every niche &mdash; is a highly specialised activity which needs a combination of technological and commercial foresight.  I am exploring ways of ensuring an effective means of developing technological niches suitable to Ireland and this will be a priority in the closer co-operation between the scientific, technical and industrial promotion bodies which I envisage.  We must also explore the possibility of technology funding for:</P>
    <P>&mdash; the development of technological concepts to the laboratory prototype state in universities and research institutes; and</P>
    <P>&mdash; companies doing pre-commercial development work in identified niches.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important that the work of the National Board for Science and Technology, the IIRS, the IDA and Córas Trachtála be properly integrated. I am very lucky that I have such an opportunity as the National Board for Science and Technology has been assigned to my Department, which is where, in my view, it should always have been.  It is essential that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the IDA, in particular, work closely together.  One of the things I have been discussing in a general way with the institute and the Industrial Development Authority is the possibility that some of the staff from the IIRS might be located abroad, either in IDA offices or CTT offices where they could be scanning the market for new technical innovations which could be applied and used by Irish firms.</P>
    <P>The success, as we all know, of Japanese industry in recent times has not been that Japan has been the great technological innovator of the world or that the most brilliant fundamental research was done in Japan.  Far from it.  It has been that Japan has kept its eyes and ears open all over the world to new ideas developed by other research institutes in other countries. The Japanese have been the best at developing and applying these in their firms.  As an island nation, not totally dissimilar from Japan in many respects, <Col N="1121" /> we should be adopting the same approach.</P>
    <P>In the further development of individual sectors of industry, I look forward to the advice and guidance that will be forthcoming from the various studies now underway by the Sectoral Development Committee.  These cover such important sectors as electronics and information technology; beef; manufacturing related to the construction industry; textiles and clothing; chemicals and pharmaceuticals.</P>
    <P>I have already stressed in this House, on 10 and 11 May last, that I believe we are not exploiting to an adequate degree the potential offered by the food industry and my sentiments in this regard are shared, I think, by the other side of the House.  The studies by the Sectoral Development Committee, which operates under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach, should provide some of the material we need to get, as I might put it, our act together in relation to the food industry.</P>
    <P>I see a particular role in this area for the National Development Corporation. At departmental level, there is, as was pointed out, and not for the first time, in the Telesis Report, a need for much closer co-ordination of activities, for instance between the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Industry and Energy and the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  For that purpose, I have initiated detailed discussions with the Ministers for Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry.</P>
    <P>As well as the general development of the food processing industry, these discussions will focus particularly on matters such as product development, marketing, competitiveness, import substitution, long-term production contracts between processors and primary producers, and the possible development of a future market. I look forward to making significant progress in this sector through these very important discussions with my colleagues, one of whom has just joined me.</P>
    <P>The present recession has proved to be longer and deeper than most commentators predicted a couple of years back. It has taken a considerable toll in terms of jobs lost through factory closures; jobs <Col N="1122" /> lost through cut-backs in employment in individual firms in an effort to ensure survival; and jobs not created because investors decided to postpone or abandon new projects.</P>
    <P>In recent months this problem of job losses has impacted on the public mind to an even greater degree than ever before because of the closure of, or threats to the future of, a number of large firms including some very long-established ones.</P>
    <P>The attention given by my Department and by the State agencies to the problem of industrial rescue has intensified greatly in recent years as more and more firms began to encounter difficulties as a result of the recession.  In earlier years the incidence of rescue activity centred almost entirely on older, established traditional industries which have previously been protected from free trade and which catered mainly for the home market.  In latter years, however, the firms encountering difficulties ranged across the entire spectrum of manufacturing industry and included many of fairly recent origin that had been established to cater wholly or mainly for the export market.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the season is lengthier than the Sugar Company would wish.  They are aiming at a target of a 100-day season.  Unfortunately, because of the inadequate capacity at intake, they overreach this.  The Deputy has asked if there are plans to increase the capacity for intake.  It is the intention in Carlow to increase the intake by 1,000 tonnes, to bring it from 5,000 tonnes up to 6,000 tonnes a day, and to have that done by 1986.  It is the intention in Mallow to increase the intake from 4,000 tonnes to 5,000 tonnes a day and in Thurles to increase the intake from 3,900 tonnes to 4,500 tonnes a day.  I might point out that the capacity in Tuam is underutilised, where it accounts for only 60 per cent of existing capacity.  At present the campaign runs on average for 115 days in Carlow and for a similar length in Mallow.  It runs for 104 days in Thurles and for 60 days in Tuam but the Sugar Company are endeavouring to get it down to 100 days.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that much of the machinery in all of our four factories is outdated, that some of it has been there since the factories were opened?  I repeat the question &mdash; and I hope the Minister will tell me this time &mdash; what are his intentions in regard to shortening the beet harvest campaign?  Is the Minister aware also of the severe loss in sugar content from about mid-November onwards?  Is he aware that this constitutes a big loss to our economy and, because of that, would the Minister not now endeavour to have factory capacity improved significantly before 1986?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I pointed out, this work is going on at present.  If Deputies visit any of the sugar factories they will see <Col N="1124" /> there a vast programme of modernisation going on.  The work is being done with a view to having that capacity increased by 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is urging the Sugar Company to reduce the sugar beet harvesting campaign. Would the Minister accept from me that if the Tuam Sugar Factory was to close the campaign would be increasing in the remaining three factories as the beet would have to be transferred from the Tuam catchment area to the other centres?  As Tuam is being discussed today by the Sugar Company, would the Minister bear this in mind, that should the Sugar Company decide to close Tuam the beet would have to be transferred to the other three factories to have it harvested in those factories?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">

Further, would he agree that no modernisation whatever has taken place in Tuam for a number of years, while on his own admission it is taking place in the other factories? It is obvious, therefore, that there has been discrimination against Tuam for a long period?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1128" /> for Agriculture if he will consider payments to farmers, particularly dairy and beef farmers to accommodate the losses sustained by them with the delay in farm price fixing in the EEC for 1983; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>The delay in reaching agreement on prices for 1983-84 was the result of a combination of factors beyond my control but despite the delay the date of settlement was, in fact, the second earliest of the past six years.  Moreover, the agreement reached at the Council meeting of 17 May included &mdash; beyond the benefits to Ireland that were already on the table &mdash; a commitment to a further 1.2 per cent devaluation of the Irish green pound and an increase of 3.3 per cent in the buying-in co-efficients for intervention beef here.  Together these improvements are worth some £25 million to the Irish farm sector in a full year as against an estimated cost of some £20 million from the delay in settling the price package.</P>
      <P>I estimate that directly as a result of the measures negotiated in the package the Irish farm sector will benefit by £255 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to this line of answering.  My question asked what was the amount of money lost to Irish farmers by the delay in price fixing.  I did not ask what benefits would accrue.  The Minister did not reply to my query about the amount of money lost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I stated in my reply, the estimated loss is £20 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My second question asked the Minister if it was his intention to consider making a refund in respect of those losses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no provision made for any compensation because of delays. As I pointed out in my reply, this was the second earliest settlement in the past six years.  In none of those years was compensation paid and I am afraid that our <Col N="1129" /> appeal for compensation was not received with any great enthusiasm by the Commission.  I would point out that this year the settlement on prices was reached on 17 May.  Last year it was 18 May.  In 1980 it was 30 May, in 1979 it was 22 June and in 1978 it was 22 May.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state what proposals he has for next year to ensure that prices will be fixed at a far earlier date in view of the fact that £20 million was lost this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have repeatedly made the point at Council meetings that there should be a review of the mechanism for the fixing of prices so that they would come into effect on 1 April.  The new President of the Council, the German Minister for Agriculture, also considers a change is necessary and I hope he will put proposals to the Council in the coming months.</P>

      <P>In recent years, much has been done to improve the winter feed supply for cattle by such schemes as the winter fodder scheme and the silage incentive scheme.  In addition, improved grassland management, winter feeding and housing for cattle all have featured prominently in the advisory programmes operated by ACOT.</P>
      <P>Grants for cattle housing and fixed assets such as silage bases are, of course, available in western areas under the programme for western development.  In other areas, approvals under the farm modernisation scheme for such works as winter housing for cattle, which were issued by my Department before 10 February 1983, are not affected by the current suspension.  A revised system of grants under the scheme will be introduced as soon as possible, probably in the late autumn, and I intend to place particular emphasis on basic housing for livestock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he views with alarm the disintegration of the food industry in Ireland as evidenced by the closure of food processing plants throughout the country, and the increase in food products being imported into the country; and if he will give details of the action he is taking at present to reverse this trend.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the detailed statements which my Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, and I made in the House on 3 and 4 May in the course of the debate on the state of the food processing sector.  In particular, I wish to emphasise that a major aim of the Government is to create the conditions that will generate greatly increased output at farm level and to encourage increased processing of this output.</P>
      <P>I have recently set up a committee to monitor food imports, to establish the precise types and quantities of produce being imported, to identify those items which can be produced at home and to assess the reasons for such imports.  As I emphasised previously, the setting up of this committee is not a solution to the problem created by food imports but rather as an aid towards achieving the goal of identifying and assessing the position.  The real solution lies in the expansion of our own agricultural production and in updating and improving our production, processing and marketing techniques to a level at least as good as, if not better than, those of our competitors abroad.</P>
      <P>Also, my Department are participating in the work of the Sectoral Development Committee who are operating under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach. This committee are at present examining the beef and dairying industries with a view to suggesting means of increasing production and diversifying processing operations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The problems faced by the horticulture industry as a result of imports are of a complex nature and the Horticulture Development Group who have recently <Col N="1133" /> been reconstituted are devoting particular attention to the question of meeting import competition in that sector.</P>
    <P>I might add that substantial grants are available through my Department and the IDA for projects relating to the processing and marketing of agricultural products, and these include contributions from FEOGA of 50 per cent in the west of Ireland and 25 per cent in other areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has identified the problem clearly, but that is not what my question was.  My question was whether he views with alarm the extent of the problem and, secondly, if he will tell us precisely what he proposes to do. It is no use coming into the House and telling us that he is endeavouring to create the environment for an improvement in the processing industry.  Could he point out specifically what he is doing now as a matter of urgency in order to strengthen, develop and save from complete fragmentation the processing industry? With regard to the second part of my question what is he doing &mdash; other than setting up committees for which we are famous in this country &mdash; to stop the desperate cancer &mdash; which is what I consider it to be &mdash; of the millions of pounds of food products being imported every week?  What is he doing in order to solve that problem?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the investigations his Department have undertaken to establish the cause of the deaths of farm animals on a farm in Ballydine, County Tipperary; the findings of the investigations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department's regional veterinary laboratory in Kilkenny has, since February 1981, been investigating conditions on a particular farm in Ballydine. In the course of this work, veterinary research personnel have visited the farm and numbers of animal specimens and of blood samples taken from animals on it have been examined by the laboratory.</P>
      <P>My Department are willing to undertake further investigations on the farm if certain relevant data which the farmer and his veterinary surgeon have accumulated can be made available in order to establish the appropriate nature and scope of the investigations that might be undertaken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is something we have not been able to clarify.  Because of continuing complaints about conditions of livestock on the farm, my Department offered in early January to send a research team to do further investigative work there.  No positive response was made to that offer.  However, on 25 January last, as a result of suggestions by various interests who were concerned about the situation, a team comprising three veterinary research officers visited the farm and it was made quite clear that the Department were willing and anxious to undertake further work on the farm but that, in order to establish some kind of base line for that work, the research team must have access to various records, clinical data and other information which <Col N="1139" /> only the owner and his veterinary surgeon could provide.  They both declined to provide access to the information sought.  The owner said he would not disclose anything pending the outcome of his legal action against a neighbouring factory.  Consequently, letters were sent to the owner of the farm and the veterinary surgeon on 8 February confirming once more the Department's willingness to undertake further investigations on the farm and again asking for the relevant data and information which would be treated in confidence.  To date, neither has responded to that request.  As late as 3 May the owner of the farm and his veterinary surgeon were asked if the farmer would be prepared to sell a live animal or animals to the Department of Agriculture in order to prepare a series of toxological analyses on animal tissue. We understand that the veterinary surgeon concerned is still considering this request.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister agree that it is in the best interests of the agriculture and food industry and the factory that the source of this problem and its solution are found as soon as possible? Does the Minister also agree that it is a problem with very serious implications and that any further hiding or misrepresentation of facts should end?

      <P>I agree with the Deputy that we must do everything possible to get to the root of the problem to see if it is being caused by external factors.  We have been examining the situation since February 1981 but it is an extremely complex case.  In reply to the latter part of the Deputy's question, it was decided by the Government on 25 March that the Minister for Labour should co-ordinate with the Ministers for Agriculture, Health, Industry and Energy and the Environment to consider certain questions of factory safety and the environment in relation <Col N="1140" /> to the factory plant at Ballydine and to report back to the Government.  My Department are co-operating fully in the furnishing and evaluation of all the material and in preparation of the report which is expected to take some weeks to complete.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Improvement of the marketing arrangements for fruit, vegetables and potatoes is primarily a matter for the industry itself.  I am pleased to note that a number of initiatives are currently being taken in this direction.  Financial aid is available for setting up producer groups in the fruit and vegetable sector and aid is also being provided towards the cost of a post of market co-ordinator for glasshouse crops.</P>
      <P>A recent proposal submitted by the Irish Farmers' Association to my Department about the setting up of a marketing organisation for potatoes is at present under examination.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked if the Minister <Col N="1142" /> would set up a marketing board without delay as the future of the industry depends on it.  Is the Minister aware that in 1982 there was a 20 per cent increase in imports?  We are now importing approximately £100 million worth of fruit and vegetables, much of which could be produced here.  There were 242 tons of lettuce and 2,250 tons of cauliflower imported last year.  One would only have to visit the Dáil restaurant to see potatoes visually of good quality and possible to eat, but imported.  Not alone should the Minister set up such a board, but introduce standards in respect of such vegetables so that the buyers would recognise that they were well represented and of much better quality than the imports.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that such importation is a scandal and share the Deputy's views on this.  Various Ministers over the years have considered the possibility of setting up marketing boards.  The Deputy is probably aware that a marketing board would require legislation and it is my information that such a board would be very expensive to run and would be in conflict with EEC regulations.  However, the initiative has been taken as far as potatoes are concerned in that the IFA have come forward with a proposal which would not involve a marketing board, but something in the shape of a national co-operative. Part of the problem with potatoes is the obtaining of uniformity of quality and continuity of supply, but these are being tackled fairly realistically. It is hoped that this co-operative would be put in motion fairly quickly and that would take care of the problems concerning potato imports.</P>
      <P>The Minister has already referred to a committee which will have their second meeting tomorrow.  This committee have been asked, as a matter of urgency, for suggestions with regard to other horticultural products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister not arrange for the Irish Potato Marketing Board to function for a few months each year with regard to exports alone, so that we would not import, as last year, 74,000 tonnes?</P>

      <P>This message was spelt out quite recently by the supermarket people in the seminar held at the Green Isle Hotel.  They said that visual presentation accounts for 80 per cent of the purchases by the housewife.  We are very conscious of this fact and one of the terms of reference of the horticulture group would be to see how best to present our produce.  Because a lot of these crops are seasonal, we must take the matter a stage further and look at controlled preservation of what we would normally call fresh produce.</P>

      <P>The acreage under potatoes, which had been declining in recent years, increased by about 5 per cent in 1982.  Commercial production of potatoes is adequate to meet domestic requirements but, as stated in reply to a question on 10 February, there is considerable scope for better marketing and presentation of potatoes.  My Department are endeavouring to effect an improvement in potato quality by enforcement of the potato quality and grading regulations and &mdash; something which I favour &mdash; by encouraging better organisation of the market by producers and traders.</P>

      <P>The most effective way of meeting competition from imported vegetables is to provide well-graded and well-presented products of top quality at keen prices.  Many of our growers are successfully meeting competition in this way, but there is need in the industry as a whole for more co-ordination in production and marketing.  Producer groups can provide the framework for this and financial aid is available from my Department for setting up such groups.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he has noted the constraints on the development of the poultry processing industry as indicated in the IDA report <i>A strategy for the development of the agricultural processing industry in Ireland;</i> and, if so, the action he proposes to take to put the industry in a more competitive position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Under EEC rules national aids for the production and trade in poultry are prohibited.  The scope for action by the Government in this area is therefore very limited.  Aid for processing firms is, however, available through the IDA and the FEOGA guidance grants scheme and the industry here has been encouraged to avail of this.  Under the latter scheme Ireland has submitted to the EEC Commission a national programme for FEOGA aid for the poultry processing industry covering a period of three years to help to put it on a better competitive basis.  While my Department will continue to do all it can to help poultry production and processing, in the final analysis, however, responsibility for <Col N="1149" /> improving competitiveness rests with the industry itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>About 25 per cent of poultry meat is imported.  Does the Minister accept that the industry has potential for a greater contribution to GNP? Would he further agree that urgent counteraction is needed to offset the inroads made by foreign producers into the Irish market?  Feedstuffs account for 70 per cent of total production costs and this is what is doing the real damage.  We do not seem to be able to meet that as they do in Northern Ireland and England.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that feedstuffs are lower in Northern Ireland.  That is a problem.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 17 to 19, inclusive, together. I am assuming that the questions and the article mentioned by the Deputy refer to the FEOGA scheme of grants for projects relating to the processing and marketing of agricultural products under Regulations 17/64 and 355/77.  The position is that more than enough applications are received annually to absorb the funds allocated for Irish projects under these regulations.</P>
      <P>The funds are allocated to individual firms to carry out investment projects and it is a matter for the firm concerned to claim the money when the work has been completed.  It is the practice to encourage firms to submit their claims as rapidly as possible but in many cases investment projects take a number of years to complete. The take-up of funds has, in fact, improved significantly in the last couple of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Commissioner Burke said a short time ago that of the 1978 allocation, in 1981 only 34 per cent had been taken up as against 89 per cent for Luxembourg, 87 per cent for the Netherlands and 83.5 per cent for the Federal Republic of Germany?  Approvals in 1979 which should now be taken up were down to 19.8 per cent as against 75 per cent for Belgium and France and 96 per cent for Luxembourg.  When I sought information regarding the industries which did not take up their allocations, thus denying them to other industries who were unsuccessful, I was unable to obtain that information.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that up to 1980 they were quite slow; but the IDA, who process claims, encourage firms to carry out projects as quickly as possible.  Then they claim their grants from Brussels. Our take-up figures under the scheme were fairly low until 1980.  It has improved steadily since then with over <Col N="1152" /> £8.7 million being claimed in 1982.  Better take-up figures are expected in 1983.  Basically we take that much longer than other member states to carry out our projects.  No doubt the high rate of inflation coupled with high borrowings mean that projects take longer than originally envisaged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister not agree that it is a dog-in-the-manger attitude on the part of firms to fail to take up the grant thereby denying other manufacturing industries who are unsuccessful in their applications for FEOGA aid?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not my intention to be argumentative, but would the Minister not agree that the IDA are sometimes very slow in grant-aiding food processing industries who subsequently turn out to be very successful?  One of the conditions is that an industry must qualify first for IDA aid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree that if somebody requests FEOGA aid but then as a result of carelessness or for some other reason fails to proceed with the project he is acting in a dog-in-the-manger way.  But, as I have pointed out, much of the delay is not due entirely to the person looking for the grant because it often happens that he is not in a position to finance the completion of the project.</P>

      <P>Has the Minister plans to strengthen the food section of the IDA in respect of grant-aiding purposes for food processing?  We seem to be capitulating totally in this matter.  In order to qualify for aid an industry must first engage in enormous amounts of paperwork. One must go first to the IIRS, to An Foras Taluntais and to various other agencies.  I am asking the Minister to consider the possibility of putting a food expert into the regional offices of the <Col N="1153" /> IDA so that somebody in the authority would be aware of the situation instead of the present situation in which we are capitulating in the face of £800 million worth of food imports.</P>

    <P>That a sum not exceeding £213,365,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on 31st day of December, 1983, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Energy, including certain services administered by that Office, and for payment of certain loans, subsidies, grants and grants-in-aid.</P>

      <P>Though the primary responsibility for the well-being of any enterprise rests &mdash; and must be seen to rest &mdash; with the owners and managers of the enterprise, every effort is made, within the constraints of the law under which they operate, by the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, in particular, to ensure that no enterprise that can reasonably be preserved is allowed to go out of business. This rescue activity is a matter in which I and my Minister of State are actively concerned on a day-to-day basis.</P>
      <P>In that respect I am looking at the possibilities of improving the present early warning system even though I am satisfied that it works reasonably well. The &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; or interventionist approach which the IDA intends to adopt under the new Strategic Plan, which they have for fostering the further development of existing companies, will also improve that agency's capacity to detect early signs of incipient weakness and will put the IDA in a better position to urge on individual companies where necessary the need for timely attention to the problems identified.</P>
      <P>But again I must emphasise that the role of the State, and the State agencies in relation to firms in difficulties, is to assist, to whatever extent they consider appropriate or necessary, the efforts of management to rehabilitate the company. This, of course, presupposes that the managements are ready and able to implement the measures needed, including the ability to utilise to good advantage such assistance as may be offered by the State services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of the diversity of the activities of the commercial State bodies and the varying reasons for their incorporation into the State sector, little serious attention has been devoted by past Governments to developing a properly structured relationship between these bodies and central Government.  <i>Ad hoc</i> arrangements have been in existence and there has been insufficient reflection on developing the optimum procedures to encourage the successful commercial development of these bodies, while <Col N="1186" /> ensuring that they are run in the most professional and efficient manner.</P>
    <P>The difficulty has been to devise means of achieving the elusive balance between freedom and control, that is, the legitimate freedom of the bodies to pursue their operations within a commercial framework and the need to safeguard the interests of the public who are their ultimate shareholders.</P>
    <P>The present financial position of the commercial State bodies collectively is very bad.  Instead of being a source of strength to the economy and the Exchequer, they are a growing burden on both. While most commercial State bodies meet their interest and loan repayments, the average rate of return on share capital and repayable advances from the State is estimated at 4 per cent &mdash; a grossly inadequate figure considering the present cost of funds, even allowing for the socialstrategic nature of some of the activities involved.  Interest rates are 16.75 per cent and a return of 4 per cent is very inadequate against that background.</P>
    <P>The Government wish to see a major improvement in the performance of the commercial State bodies and a continuing reassessment of their operations in the national interest.  While acknowledging that a significant improvement in performance will be a difficult task, particularly in view of the Exchequer's inability to provide the levels of equity investment being requested by some of the bodies, I feel that this could be facilitated by the State bodies themselves becoming more commercially orientated and being more openly accountable to their ultimate owners through central Government and the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>With this in mind, I have invited the chairmen, chief executives and directors of the seven commercial State bodies operating under the aegis of my Department to meet me on Saturday next for a full day of discussion on the rold of these bodies in the national economy and their relationship with my Department.  I will be accompanied by the Minister of State.</P>
    <P>This meeting is designed to facilitate an exchange of views on a wide range of general issues.  It is not &mdash; as has been suggested in certain media reports &mdash; an <Col N="1187" /> exercise to criticise the performance of individual bodies but to explore means of making these bodies more commercially orientated and more openly accountable to central Government.  I will, of course, be highlighting to the State bodies my concern about their overall financial position and my determination to ensure that they are professionally run.</P>
    <P>The aim in these discussions is to call on the expertise of both the executives and the board members of these companies to draw up generally applicable guidelines for their operation, to learn from their experience as to how they can be better supported by the Department in their work and how the Department in turn can lay down guidelines for their work, such as corporate plans against which their performance can be measured, better control of capital projects and so on.  The aim will be to get general guidelines of general applicability rather than to go into the problems of the companies individually.  That is something which is more properly done in discussion with each of the boards concerned.</P>
    <P>Control of capital projects by commercial State bodies is an area that has caused major concern and controversy in recent years.  Experience in relation to a number of projects suggests that in the crucial areas of planning and feasibility studies, execution, project control and commissioning, potential weaknesses have emerged on the part of the commercial State bodies which have had profound financial implications later, both for the bodies themselves and the State.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has recently reviewed the procedure for planning and controlling public capital expenditure. He wishes to ensure that effective procedures, at present employed in some areas but not in others, are consolidated and employed by all public authorities. His aim is to encourage a more systematic approach to the appraisal of all capital expenditure projects and programmes and to improve the quality of information available to decision-makers at all levels. The Minister has recently issued detailed procedures for the planning and control of public capital expenditure by Departments <Col N="1188" /> and all bodies under their aegis. The Government expect that the implementation of these procedures will mitigate a considerable proportion of the cost overruns which have been experienced on overall public sector investment, in particular in respect of some of the bodies under the aegis of my own Department.</P>
    <P>Although primary responsibility for the vetting and overall control of capital projects in the commercial State-sponsored sector rests with the boards of the bodies, the Government, as part of their responsibility for ensuring that investment in the public sector is productive and soundly based, are reviewing a number of capital projects in the energy area in consultation with the bodies in question.</P>
    <P>Other than in a small number of cases, there are few readily identifiable corporate plans or other planning targets in existence relating to the commercial State bodies.  The fact that these are not specifically required by the shareholder means that there is little impetus for the bodies to draw up such plans or targets. Their continued absence means that the performance of the commercial State bodies cannot be assessed in any meaningful or effective way.  Such plans normally include financial particulars (e.g. projected profit and loss accounts, balance sheets, cash flow statements, projected rate of return on investment, financing details), production targets, marketing and organisation strategies, operating efficiency targets, details and justification for proposed capital expenditures, cost reduction proposals, etc.</P>
    <P>The plans could cover a five-year period and be on a &lsquo;rolling&rsquo; basis with a detailed budget for the first year.  They would have a flexible format to accommodate the range and diversity of the State bodies to be covered.  The Government are at present considering the introduction of such plans in the commercial State bodies.</P>
    <P>The re-establishment of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on State-sponsored Bodies will result in an increasing interest in, and awareness, on the part of the Houses of the Oireachtas, of the activities of the commercial State bodies. <Col N="1189" /> I also intend to take specific steps to improve the format and content of the annual reports and accounts of the State-sponsored bodies under my aegis to facilitate a better comparative appraisal from the viewpoint of public policy of the operations of such bodies and generally make available more information to the members of the Oireachtas and to the public of their operations and financial performance.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the subject of energy.  An arrangement has been agreed so that the Minister of State at my Department will contribute to the debate and he will cover in more detail a number of energy areas, including, in particular the oil sector and minerals and petroleum exploration and development.  I will, therefore, confine my remarks to a few major issues.</P>
    <P>I have already drawn attention to the Government's concern about energy costs and I have recently taken action for the monitoring of industrial costs and a review of electricity costs and prices in particular.  Apart from what can be done by Government in the area of supply and distribution of energy, costs can also be abated by consumers by using less energy through the adoption of conservation measures and efficient use of energy.  The trend of energy consumption in the economy has shown a welcome decline since 1979 and I would like to see this continued.</P>
    <P>The excessive dependence on imported oil which existed some years ago is now well on the way to being resolved and a more balanced pattern of supply is now emerging.  Indigenous natural gas and peat are replacing oil and the ESB's programme for coal-based electricity in the latter eighties will continue this trend.</P>
    <P>In the present comfortable supply position it is easy to become complacent about the security aspects of energy supply but this must remain a dominant factor in long-term planning.  There will always be pressures when easier supply and price conditions in the oil market prevail but a balance which is critical in the long term must be maintained so that development of indigenous resources is not thrown overboard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1190" /> The development of our natural gas resource is central to the Government's policy to strengthen energy security, to keep down costs from what they otherwise would be and to generate resources for the Exchequer.  Bord na Móna directly and through the administration of the private bog scheme are increasing peat production at competitive prices.</P>
    <P>The public sector agencies are the dominant producers and suppliers in the area of electricity, natural gas, peat and more recently in oil procurement and refining.  The general level of efficiency of these bodies' activities has a major impact on energy prices and on the return on the substantial capital investment, more than £1,000 million, and new capital investment now at £300 million a year.</P>
    <P>Even though only a relatively small part of the ESB's activities are assisted from the Exchequer it is, nevertheless, important to look at the role of electricity in meeting a vital part of our energy requirements.  The central strategy of policy in relation to electricity has been to diversify generation away from excessive dependence on oil which reached more than 70 per cent in 1979 and to maximise the utilisation of our economic basis of indigenous energy resources, particularly natural gas and peat.  This is complemented by a programme to utilise imported coal in the future.  This objective has required a very large investment programme, one of the largest in the public sector.</P>
    <P>The diversification programme has been successful to the extent that, by the end of this summer, the proportion of generating capacity solely dependent on oil will have fallen from 60 per cent to 33 per cent and the amount capable of using native fuels, or dual fuelling, will have risen to 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>A consequence of this programme, however, is that the amount of capacity surplus to normal requirements has grown substantially and this is aggravated by the stagnation in demand for electricity. The adverse effect of capital charges arising from a surplus capacity is a matter of concern and I have asked the Board of the ESB to review the timing and further progress of certain aspects of their capital <Col N="1191" /> programme which are not essential to meet demand in the rest of this decade.</P>
    <P>The cost of electricity has now become a matter of considerable concern to the ESB themselves, to the Government and to industry and other consumers.  I recently announced the setting up of an inquiry into electricity prices which has been welcomed by the Board of the ESB. The last major inquiry into ESB costs was done by the Fletcher Committee in 1972.</P>
    <P>The action of the Government and other public sector bodies of course, affects electricity costs.  There have, in recent times, been significant increases in the price paid by the ESB for peat and gas.  These price increases have been a reflection of the general increase in energy market prices triggered off by the upward movement of oil prices.  The price of peat has been increased to about the same level as imported oil prices prevailing last year and the earlier part of this year in order to enable Bord na Móna to continue development of our peat resources.</P>
    <P>As well as increasing natural gas prices the Government have also, over the last two years, more than doubled the quantity of gas available to the ESB.  This has displaced about ¾ million tonnes of imported oil which would have been significantly more expensive than the cost of the gas which replaced it.  The Cork-Dublin gas pipeline, completed last December, will enable the ESB to utilise part of their gas allocation more efficiently in Dublin than elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I might also add that gas and peat prices are not subject to the uncertainty and fluctuations, as are oil prices, arising from international market movements and the dollar exchange rate.  The net effect of these decisions is to keep the ESB's fuel costs below the level which they would otherwise have to pay if they relied on imported oil.  The effect of taxation on electricity prices has been alleged to be a major factor in price increase.  The Government in their budget this year reduced the contribution in lieu of rates by £15 million and exempted electricity prices from <Col N="1192" /> increases in VAT and fuel oil which saved consumers a further £16 million a year.</P>
    <P>It could be argued that the net sum total of Government decisions in recent years, both negative and positive taken together, have actually held ESB prices at a lower level than they might otherwise be.</P>
    <P>Deputies will have noticed the provision made in the Estimate for FEOGA &mdash; Western Aid Electrification.  This scheme commenced in August 1981 with aid amounting to £16 million over a ten-year period being provided jointly by the Exchequer and EEC funds.  The aim of the scheme is to alleviate the special problems of the farming community by making aid available toward the cost of connecting and improving electricity supply.</P>
    <P>To date there have been 1,650 approvals at a cost of £3,599,717.  This money has been spent on new and increased supplies, three phase supplies, network improvements and a number of marketing and processing plants.  It is anticipated that a further 850 farms will benefit under the scheme in 1983 and that almost 7,000 farms will benefit during the scheme as a whole.</P>
    <P>Bord Gáis Éireann have responsibility for the development and transmission of our natural gas resource.  The Government's policy is to supply natural gas for distribution by efficient and forward looking town gas companies in our major cities and towns when a supply can be economically provided, and to underpin the security and cost of electricity generation to which I have already referred and to develop remunerative export markets for natural gas.  The completion of the Cork-Dublin pipeline in December 1982 on time and within budget, marks a major milestone in the development of this strategy, and all involved are to be complimented.</P>
    <P>The supply of natural gas to the Dublin Gas Company has enabled that company to reduce their prices to consumers substantially and to plan an ambitious development programme to expand the sales of gas in Dublin for domestic and industrial use.  The terms of supply are at present <Col N="1193" /> under discussion between Board Gáis Éireann and the company.</P>
    <P>The next stage of development will be to consider supplies to towns when a supply proposal is economic and can be regarded as having an acceptable prospect of commercial success.  Urban areas with existing gas distribution systems such as Limerick, Waterford and Clonmel, have made considerable progress in putting such projects together.  The extension of supply to other population centres and industries, especially those near the Cork-Dublin pipeline, which do not have a town gas supply will also be considered.  The preparedness of such centres themselves to distribute and market the gas will be an important factor in any decision.</P>
    <P>BGE's capital programme for 1983 amounts to £22 million about 30 per cent of which will be funded from their own revenue and the remainder from borrowings. The programme covers residual expenditure on the Cork-Dublin natural gas pipeline project, the construction of a loop line to the north of Dublin and the possible expansion of the grid to other centres, such as Clonmel.  Provision has also been made for some expenditure in connection with the Dublin-Belfast pipeline. Negotiations on a supply of gas to Northern Ireland are continuing and I expect to conclude these with the incoming British Government as soon as possible. In this regard we had made an amount of progress in the few weeks before the British general election was called.  It was a matter of regret for me and my counterpart involved in these negotiations, Mr. Adam Butler, that it was not possible for us to finalise the discussions before the election. Obviously, during the election it was not possible to progress with the discussions any further.  I should like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation of the manner in which Mr. Butler conducted the discussions.  I hope it will be possible to conclude these with whoever will be negotiating on the other side of the table after the Government is formed in Westminster in the next few days.</P>
    <P>Peat production has always played an <Col N="1194" /> important part in our energy supply and security and I expect that it will continue to do so in future.  Peat production is possible at prices that are currently competitive with imported solid fuels for domestic and commercial use and oil for electricity generation and as long as that can be maintained Bord na Móna is making a positive and valuable contribution to the national economy.</P>
    <P>The task now facing Bord na Móna is to continue a further development of our peat resources on a basis that will remunerate capital investment and keep energy costs competitive.  The capital resources available to the board for this purpose in 1983 are £36 million and most of this expenditure is to complete long-term bog development work now well advanced under its third development programme.  Where new projects are in the early stages I have asked the board to review these investment projects to ensure viability on acceptable norms.  I have stressed the need to remunerate capital investment.</P>
    <P>While Bord na Móna will remain the dominant force in bog development and peat fuel production, the efforts of private enterprise in the development of smaller bogs must continue to supplement the board's achievements.  Such has been the response to the private bog development scheme that last year's allocation has been fully taken up and I have increased the amount available this year to £1 million to provide for the demand expected during 1983.  The scheme provides an incentive to private developers, who have established a local market for fuel but who would otherwise be deterred from developing the smaller tracts of bogland by the high cost of drainage, access roads and turf cutting machinery.</P>
    <P>To date 312 schemes covering 17,524 acres have been approved at a total cost of £3.8 million, of which grants amounting to £1.8 million have been approved. I am advised that turf production under the scheme is leading to savings of £17 million a year on fuel imports and is increasing and maintaining local employment in rural areas.</P>
    <P>My remarks on the topics which I have covered reflect the priorities which I have <Col N="1195" /> set for myself for the next few months. As I indicated at the outset, they are: establishing the framework for future industrial progress; making a start on securing financial control over, and rationalisation of, the State commercial enterprises which are under the aegis of my Department and addressing the problems of uncompetitive energy costs which are having serious effects on our industry and the economy generally.</P>
    <P>These are challenging objectives which have always loomed large in our economy.  They have never been more vital than now.  Surely if we have learned anything in the past couple of years it is that there is not an easy way out of our difficulties.  These easy ways have been tried and the cost of their failure is part of the price we now have to pay.</P>
    <P>I have spelled out many of our serious problems.  It is necessary to face reality. It is equally important to avoid an undue sense of pessimism about the future. There is no need for such pessimism.  We have many strong advantages on our side. It is up to us to make the most of them. What we must do now is to equip ourselves to grasp the opportunities already on the horizon.</P>
    <P>There is encouraging evidence of a recovery in the international economy and in business activity.  It will be up to us to conduct our own affairs in a manner that will ensure that we benefit from that recovery, using the many plus factors we enjoy.</P>
    <P>The industrialists I met in my recent promotional visits in the US, Britain and on the Continent all regarded Ireland as an outstandingly profitable location for modern industry.  This is regarded as much as a function of Ireland's young productive and adaptable labour force, as of the industrial incentives offered by the State agencies.</P>
    <P>This means that so long as we continue to act resolutely to improve the fiscal and business environment here, we will benefit largely from economic recovery.  As an export nation Ireland can expect to get disproportionate benefits from that recovery.  But we must always remember that we must compete on cost, quality <Col N="1196" /> and delivery with tough competitors who are more anxious than ever before to enlarge their share of the market at our expense.</P>
    <P>The most forcible message that I got from a recent visit to the United States industrialists who have invested in Ireland was that they came here because we have a better work force than other locations in Europe.  As a result of this, and other factors, we have got almost half of all the new green field United States investment coming to any location in Europe in recent times.</P>
    <P>We have made a major investment in higher education facilities, particularly in the technological area, and these are now paying dividends.  While world markets are declining, Irish industrial exports are growing.  Our industrialists, particularly the new ones, have been able to beat the international trend.  Unlike Britain, Germany, France and most other European countries, Ireland has new industrial capacity.  They have older and obsolescent industries.  As a result we are better placed to avail of the economic recovery than they are.</P>
    <P>We have a large young population. Whereas in Germany, the number of people in the age group 15 to 19 is set to collapse from 4.9 million in 1985 to 3.4 million in 1990, the number of Irish people in that age group is likely to grow. Obviously it makes much more sense for investors to come to an expanding market where there are many young people than to a declining one.  Our high proportion of young people also means that Ireland provides a rapidly expanding home market for Irish industry.  We should not see the number of young people we have here simply as a problem; we should also see it as a market and a source of dynamism for growth in our economy.</P>
    <P>Some people looking at our population statistics, would tend to despair about the possibility of getting our employment situation back under control.  But let us get the problem into perspective.  It is predicted that there will be about 100,000 more people seeking employment in 1990 than are now seeking jobs.  But they will be young, adaptable, and educated people.  Modern industry has become <Col N="1197" /> much more skill-intensive than was the case in the past.  Irish workers, being young and well educated, must have advantages in attracting industry to this country over workers in other countries who are older, and possessed of redundant and inflexible skills.</P>
    <P>In the past we have proved that it is possible to get a national consensus that is necessary for and conducive to rapid economic growth.  The Government have taken essential, though temporarily unpalatable steps to get the basics on the right track.  The next stage is that of building on a sounder basis of national financial stability and industrial stability and planning and that stage must command all our support and commitment.</P>
    <P>I recommend this Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to point out to the House that while industry and energy forms the total responsibility of the Minister, on this side of the House we have divided responsibility with industry and employment on one side and energy on the other.  I should like to inform the House that my colleague Deputy O'Malley will deal with energy when the debate resumes on Tuesday and I will deal with the industrial side.  I am sure Deputy O'Malley will not mind if I refer to a few minor matters in the energy field, ones in which I had a particular interest. There was a reference by the Minister to negotiations in relation to Kinsale gas for Belfast and Northern Ireland.  I listened attentively to what the Minister said, that negotitions were still in progress, but we have now passed the first birthday of these negotiations which were finalised not started &mdash; in May of last year between Mr. Adam Butler and myself, as Minister for Industry and Energy.  Like the Minister I should also like to express pleasure at the manner in which those negotiations were conducted.  However, I fail to understand why after two long evenings, one in Iveagh House and the second at Stormont Castle, the matter has not been finalised.  We reached agreement on all heads for the supply of gas.  It is understandable that the agreement had to be put into contract form but it is important <Col N="1198" /> to record that we reached full and final agreement on all aspects of the supply of natural gas, the quantities asked for, the price, the escalator clause, the mix of currencies to be applied in payment for the gas and the energy components making up that complex area of negotiations. I do not underestimate the problems that had to be dealt with and I should like to pay tribute to the officials in the Department who were involved in the intricate negotiations for their untiring efforts in the negotiations.</P>
      <P>It is important to record that around the table at Stormont Castle we reached agreement.  Not alone that but we shook hands on that agreement.  At Mr. Butler's request we proceeded to the steps of Stormont Castle for him to announce that agreement had been reached.  It was then only a matter for the Irish and the British Governments to approve the terms of the agreement.  I do not know of any situation where two Ministers of two sovereign Governments reached agreement and announced it in public before the television cameras and in the media in Belfast. Naturally enough I was only too delighted to join with Mr. Butler in the same announcement.  It baffles me to think what we have all been at over the past 12 or nearly 13 months.  Before I left the Department I went through all the final telex messages and there was no doubt that it was only a matter of getting together and signing the documents.</P>
      <P>Have the negotiations been reopened? What has happened?  The British Minister had officials with him from the Treasury in London.  I can understand those officials trying to get a better deal and taking advantage, as they saw it, of an incoming Government.  Perhaps they thought they could upset the deal and get better terms.  At the first meeting with Mr. Butler in Iveagh House he gave the clear impression &mdash; probably good tactics in negotiations &mdash; that he thought the price we would be looking for the gas would be a lot lower than the price I was talking about.  He said that impression was given to him clearly by my predecessor. I have no knowledge of that.  Perhaps there was some element of truth in it and perhaps not.  I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1199" /> If they are trying to upset the deal and looking for a cheaper price, applying all the pressures for which British Governments are well known in negotiations and in tactics, I expect the Minister to stand firm on the terms.  They are related to the price at which the gas will be sold in Dublin.  I believe it was an excellent deal. Obviously they thought it was too good a deal for us if they tried to upset it. Where agreement is reached at ministerial level, with nothing remaining but the formal rubber stamping at Government level, I would expect the agreement to be implemented.  Everybody attending these negotiations had plenipotentiary powers.  I had from the Government here, and the Government had no hesitation in endorsing what I said.</P>
    <P>We still do not know what the present position is.  The Minister said this matter went on right up to the time of the British election.  There was an interesting announcement during that election campaign from John Hume.  He said he had it from the highest authority in Dublin that the deal was over and done with. Listening to the Minister today one would not get that impression.  When questioned in more depth about it John Hume was absolutely adamant that that was the true position and he had it from the highest authority in Dublin.  I would expect that the Minister opposite would be the highest authority in relation to this matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>He did not get it from me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>One does not know who to believe.  I am saying to the Minister that he should not sell it any cheaper than I was selling it.  If they made a bad deal, so be it.  You cannot always make a good deal.  You have to take the good and the bad, and roll on from there.  I am sure Deputy O'Malley will not mind me mentioning that matter in the energy area to get clarification from the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are many omissions from the Minister's long speech.  There is another area which worries me slightly.  I am always worried about development being <Col N="1200" /> postponed, especially having regard to the experience we had before in the energy area.  The Minister did not mention the peat briquette factory in Ballyforan. Is it going ahead?  I do not know what the problem is.  Recently I heard there is some sort of bureaucratic argument going on between Bord na Móna, the Department of the Environment and Galway County Council.  I do not know whether the Department of Industry and Energy are involved.  In straight and forceful terms I want to say to the Minister that he should not tolerate any nonsense from any semi-State body standing in the way of development.  I came across many instances of that.  At coffee next Saturday morning the Minister should take a message from me to the gentlemen who sit around that table.  As Minister he should tell them that he will not tolerate this nonsense of bureaucratic arguments holding up development.</P>
    <P>On various occasions in this House I tried to raise another problem because it illustrates this bureaucratic opposition and nonsense when we are trying to get something done, and get it done fast.  The people will want us to tell them in this debate what we intend to do about the 188,000 people who are unemployed, not counting the 19,000, approximately, young people who are not included in that figure and the 19,000 to 20,000 small farmers who are available for work.  We are reaching a national crisis in unemployment. People want to see positive action from the Minister, the Government and this House.  I will not be destructive in my criticisms.  I know the tough job that has to be done.  After six months in Government people will be looking for little more than they are getting here today.</P>
    <P>To get back to the point I was making about the bureaucratic opposition which arises from time to time, I am a little more patient than other Deputies but I tried to raise a matter three times and I was told I would have another opportunity to raise it.  I am raising it now.  On my last visit to Germany on an industrial promotion tour with the IDA, I met two German brothers, industrialists who wanted to set up peat moss factory here. <Col N="1201" /> They were short of approximately 200 acres of bogland which would have enabled them not only to carry through their original proposal but to double it and to provide 70 jobs in a very rural area, actually in my own constituency.</P>
    <P>I did not pick the place, they did.  They asked for assistance and I pledged them that night in Germany that when I came home &mdash; they gave me a list of people &mdash; I would try to arrange a sale for them. I arranged a sale for them, I got them their bogland but when that sale came up to be approved by the Land Commission the most strenuous efforts were made by Bord na Móna to block that sale.  I could understand that if Bord na Móna had plans for the development of that area of bogland.  When I asked them for their plans they had none.  In my view they had no right whatsoever, when they had no plans for development, to object to a private development and deprive a rural part called Rathowen in County Westmeath on the Longford&mdash;Westmeath border of 70 jobs.</P>

      <P>It is Midland Peat.  That is the Irish name and there are two German brothers.  I have not their names with me now.  With the help of officials of my Department and with all the to-ing and fro-ing we had with the Department of Agriculture and the Land Commission &mdash; Bord na Móna had no right under the Land Acts to object to it, as transpired when we made full inquiries in my Department, &mdash; finally the Land Commission overruled the objections and this sale took place.  Within two weeks of my leaving office a compulsory purchase order was put in the local newspapers to acquire that bogland.  What sort of dictatorial, bureaucratic approach is that by a semi-State organisation towards development, their Minister, their Department and breaching the faith which the Minister and I know one carries with one when one goes abroad on industrial promotion? The chief executive of the IDA was present on the night in question. What did those two German industrialists <Col N="1202" /> think of me as Minister, of Mr. White as the chief executive of the IDA, or of Ireland when one section of a Government in a country would get in the way of development for which there was no logical basis?  It is a national disgrace.</P>
      <P>I tried to raise the matter three times in the House and I was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle each time.  I was told there were different ways and means of raising the matter.  When the German people came to Ireland they came looking for me.  I arranged a meeting for them with the IDA and I told Mr. White to let Bord na Móna know in no uncertain terms from me that if there was not agreement on this I would have to do something about it.  I realise that Bord na Móna had mapped out certain areas of bog in this area but those people only wanted 200 acres and they did not care if it was that 200 acres or some other 200 acres.  As far as I was concerned, I wanted Bord na Móna either to leave them alone or exchange this 200 acres for another 200 acres.  As far as I know this has been tossed around between the two of them. I believe at this stage Bord na Móna are seeing the light and I believe we will have a resolution.  I am putting it to the Minister in the interests of the credibility of Irish Ministers going abroad, in the interests of the credibility of the IDA and the Government to take the strongest action possible in relation to that situation.  The Minister will meet more of that as he goes along the way, although perhaps not as glaring as that.</P>

      <P>I know that.  I did not think it was possible.  That is the sort of thing which happens.  Those are the two areas in energy I wish to deal with.  I <Col N="1203" /> would like to go on with other areas in energy but my colleague will be dealing with them.  The Estimate presented today is, by and large, the Estimate I prepared when I was Minister for Industry and Energy and published last November in the general election situation.  Very marginal changes have been made, so it is for all intents and purposes the same Estimate. It reflects the job done in approaching the Estimates in the Department of Industry and Energy and reflects the conviction and the commitment of the previous Fianna Fáil Government to getting down expenditure.  When one looks at the overall figures, a reduction of approximately £57 million from the outturn of 1983, which, in effect, is approximately a reduction of 20 to 21 per cent in overall expenditure, in the context of a very considerable contribution to the July cutbacks, one gets a distinct impression. It is a clear impression which has to be given, in fairness to the officials in the Department of Industry and Energy of how hard they worked in getting down expenditure which the Minister and I agree is fundamental to the development of the economy.  It is a clear reflection of the commitment there was there to do the job properly.</P>
      <P>It is worth stating that on the outturn of 1982 and the figures which were estimated for current Government expenditure in the March budget that not alone were they reached and kept within the limits but there was a saving of approximately £53 million, which is not generally recognised.  I have heard time and time again in debates in the House people on the other side trying to label the previous Fianna Fáil Government as a spendthrift Government.  The facts are there, the commitment was there.  There was natural resistance to it and always will be when one tries to cut current Government expenditure.  If the will and the commitment are there they will go right down through the system and you will find you will get the response from the various Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a time in Irish politics when the successful Minister was the man who could go to the Cabinet table and get the <Col N="1204" /> most money for his Department.  That was always the way he was judged, that was the strongest man around the table, that was the man who had the muscle, that was the fellow who could get the biggest allocation.  I believe the criteria of success of future Ministers around the Cabinet table will be those who can go in and manage their Departments, show savings from year to year and show that they are prepared to take the courageous and honest decisions to get rid of services that are no longer really necessary in today's climate.  They will be the people who are prepared, as I was in the short time I was in this Department, to take unpopular decisions, to get rid of services that are not wanted or to shut down activities that have no possibility of being viable.  They made their contribution to the reduction in expenditure this year.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention Ardmore Studios in Bray.  I remember the &ldquo;hollering&rdquo; there was in the House time and time again by two Ministers of the present Cabinet and the way they talked about taking it over, putting State money into it, without caring where it was got.  The question is always asked over here every time we talk, &ldquo;Tell us where we will get the money&rdquo;.  Nobody on the other side was concerned about where we were to get the money to nationalise Ardmore Studios and keep it going, even though at the time there was no way that a viable future could be seen for it.  The board of Ardmore Studios were the very first people to admit it.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the closure of Avoca Mines.  I feel a bit aggrieved about how the Government handled that situation when they came into office.  Avoca Mines was not a State-owned company. Avoca Mines was a privately owned company for which a certain amount of money was provided in the Estimates by the previous Coalition Government.  I was running out of money in the summer. I looked at the overall position in relation to Avoca.  There was no question of any more viability in it.  There might be another couple of months in it but the money was not there for it.  I did not howl, as did other Ministers, come into this House and howl from the roof tops: <Col N="1205" /> Oh, there were no allocations made by the previous Government.  I took my decision and I took it on the chin.  For four solid weeks pickets were placed by the same Avoca miners who refused to let a receiver into that mine.  Not alone did they pillory my Department with telephone calls and pickets on the offices at Clare Street and everywhere else but they used the maximum pressure to get extra-statutory redundancies to which they were not entitled.  That was not a State company.  Indeed in the present situation it is debatable &mdash; because of extra statutory redundancies and the problems the Minister will have &mdash; whether that whole area should be examined in more detail.  I was not prepared to bend to that pressure.  Yet during the same election campaign the present Taoiseach, Minister for Education and Minister for Labour, one after the other, gave commitments that if they were in Government they would pay that money. If I was there yet I would not pay it because I do not believe that Governments should bend to that kind of pressure.</P>
    <P>I had a different view of that prospective government.  Within a week or ten days, one of the first acts of this Government was to pay that almost £1 million of taxpayers' money to those people who refused to obey the law and would not let in a receiver.  I noticed that the payment of that money was not announced by the present Minister for Industry and Energy.  I do not believe he believes in that sort of thing, but he did not have any option because his Taoiseach and two Cabinet colleagues had given the commitment and it had to be paid.  He did not announce it.  It is quite clear that he does not agree with it &mdash; I am sure he does not &mdash;and I would be surprised if he did.</P>
    <P>Then we had the howl about the school buses, the Minister for Education asking where she was supposed to get the money.  But she did not give any thought to the school children who had to be put off buses when she threw away £1 million of taxpayers' money just to buy off pressure and a few votes in the Wicklow area. So be it.</P>
    <P>Those are the sorts of decisions that will <Col N="1206" /> be necessary, have been necessary in the past and will be more necessary in the future to produce the savings on current expenditure and not waste taxpayers' money badly needed in the future.  It reflects what was our approach, mine as Minister and that of the Fianna Fáil Party, to putting our scarce resources into areas of economic development and job creation.</P>
    <P>There are areas I shall go through one by one in relation to the Estimate.  I notice the Minister has picked out a few but there are many omissions from his statement.  Though he may have picked three particular areas on which to home in, nevertheless it is rather strange that other areas have not been mentioned, areas of very large expenditure, problem areas which, perhaps for one reason or another, he may have chosen not to mention. Perhaps it is good politics not to mention them at this stage.  Perhaps it was felt better to make a good, strong speech, full of philosophies, full of ideas about more committees and so on than to home in on some of the difficult areas in that Department, and there are plenty of them.</P>
    <P>We have heard nothing of what will be the future of Clondalkin Paper Mills, which the Minister purchased in the early hours of the morning not in his offices but in a city centre establishment to make sure that the budget would go through. I notice the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is smiling.  There was probably a commitment on the part of his party to ensure that Clondalkin Paper Mills was bought over for £1.760 million.  We have not heard anything about it since.  A lot of taxpayers' money has been invested there.  What are the plans for it?  Does the Minister propose to run it as a semi-State body, or is he going to sell it off again, as some people have suggested since?  Will the Minister set it up and run it on a management contract with particular people, or what?  Plenty of people whose money has been spent on it want to know.  They want to know what will happen it.  Will it lie idle or what?  Perhaps the Minister would let us know when replying.</P>
    <P>Then there is Nitrigin Éireann <Col N="1207" /> Teoranta.  When the Minister talked about value for money in overruns, this must be one of the greatest scandals of wastage of public money in the whole of the political arena in recent years.  It was an operation started with something in the region of £30 million to £40 million; there has probably been a £100 million overrun or something to that effect &mdash; I have not the figures before me &mdash; but it is in that region.  When the Minister talks about overruns, when he talks about committees and so on, I would like to know what is his view of accountability for that type of financial recklessness that was carried on in NET.  What are the Government of the day going to do about this sort of operation, where one is presented with a semi-State body, with plans for a project estimated to cost £X which, by the time it was finished, costs three times £X?  That is the pattern of the day and was in relation to NET; nobody seems to be held accountable or responsible.  I ask this House, and everybody concerned, if this was the people's own money &mdash; the people responsible for allowing that situation to develop &mdash; would they do it?  If they were working in private enterprise would they not pay a price for it?  But no, no accountability; out the door.</P>
    <P>The Minister has another one on his desk which I spotted in the short time I was over there and in respect of which I initiated an inquiry before I left &mdash; the overrun on the bill for the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  That was another one that started at approximately £2,500,000, estimated, no fixed price contract &mdash; probably the same kind of situation as NET &mdash; no accountability, no monitoring process, which I agree is needed and which I established in areas when I was over there.  I agree with the Minister that such areas must be monitored very closely.  That is now finishing up somewhere in the region of £7 million and, included in that £7 million, is £1 million on professional fees, architects' fees &mdash; it may be a few shillings less but not a lot &mdash; with again no accountability. Who is going to carry the can of responsibility for this type of operation?  Somebody has got to do it.  I was not very long <Col N="1208" /> in Government &mdash; one-and-a-half years in Posts and Telegraphs and seven months in Industry and Energy &mdash; but it frightened me to see the lack of control there was on the spending of public money.  I fully accept that the Government of the day have the right to decide to undertake whatever project they feel collectively should be built.  That is their decision; all right.  It is after that that the operation and control of the expenditure is involved.</P>
    <P>I have yet to see, with one exception in my short time, that there has been sufficient control.  As the Minister correctly says, there has been sufficient control on the project of the Cork to Dublin gas pipeline.  It proves one thing, that it can be done.  It should be done in every single exercise.  I want to pay tribute to everybody concerned in that project.  It was a hallmark for what can be done in the public sector as well as in the private sector with proper controls, proper management expertise being applied to the job.  It is an excellent job and a shining example to the rest of the public capital projects to be undertaken in this country. There is there the blueprint that can be followed.  It proves it can be done if only the right people and management are deployed on it.  Perhaps that is where the question arises, as to where the right management is to be obtained.  In fairness to the civil service, I should say &mdash; and there are excellent people in the civil service &mdash; there is a trend of thought in some of the higher echelons, in some places, that frowns on private enterprise. Perhaps it is because they have been enclosed in that system, a system of accountability for how money is spent.  I suppose they have no real, I should not say commitment because they have a commitment, but no real purpose in asking, as would somebody in private enterprise: are we getting value for money? The system is geared towards accounting for all the money that is spent but the question is, do we get value for that money.  In my view there is little difference between managing a Government Department, managing the country and managing a business.  The same basic principles apply.  Have we the expertise <Col N="1209" /> in all sections of the civil service? Government Departments are geared towards doing a certain amount of capital development.  I accept that there is expertise in some areas but the question is whether it exists in all areas.  I rather doubt that it does.</P>
    <P>There must be a new approach to the management of Government expenditure. There is need for an inter-change of experts from the hard commercial world outside into the civil service and <i>vice versa.</i>  I welcome the decision regarding the National Board for Science and Technology. There is a wealth of experience there and also in the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the Irish Productivity Centre, although I have not noticed the latter figuring very much recently.  There are also approximately 16 semi-State bodies.  There is a wealth of talent available to the Minister in all of these bodies but there is no point in leaving people in these areas merely to produce more reports.  What we need is action, expert management and advice. People have to be moved out of those areas.  I do not think they should spend their whole lives in one organisation.  A new approach should be adopted that they would not stay for longer than, say, three years.  I am putting that forward as a practical suggestion.  Excellent graduates, the cream of the country, wind up in many of those bodies and they go to seed eventually.  This happens because they do not have the challenge to take the action that is necessary.  I say they should be given a contract of three years and then they should return to the hard world of industry.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's statement that the level of management is very poor.  When I was in the Department I found that 50 per cent of the failures were due to bad management.  We can talk about the workers but the standard of management must also be questioned. The question arises where will we get management?  Many old firms are afraid to employ the experts coming out of our universities and elsewhere.  These businesses cannot grapple with new technology; it has passed them by.  They are afraid to take in these new people <Col N="1210" /> because they do not understand them and they cannot control them and many business people are afraid they will take over their firms.  The Minister has a wealth of talent available to him that should be used to develop new projects.  That is the only way we will build up indigenous industry.  As the Minister said in his speech, the level of development by indigenous industry has been poor by any standards.  We owe our success to the fact that we attracted foreign industrialists and investment.</P>
    <P>We have been criticised for such investment and so have the IDA.  However, what would this country be like if we did not have the IDA during the past 25 years?  They have been criticised for the policies they have pursued but who is to blame for that?  Successive Governments are to blame.  The IDA wrote their own industrial policy.  There has not been a White Paper on industrial policy since the foundation of the State: this is the first time it has been done.  I thought I would have the opportunity of making history but the Minister can have that honour.  I look forward to reading the paper.</P>
    <P>I should like to take the opportunity of welcoming the setting up of a food processing enterprise in Limerick.  I understand the Minister will give SFADCo responsibility for that operation.  This should have been done years ago.  If we want to develop indigenous industry surely we should start with our natural resources.  It is a complicated and difficult area, where we need expertise for the development of new products and for new approaches to marketing.  Marketing, delivery, presentation and design are great weaknesses in Irish industry.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see that the opportunities that exist in the food processing area are being tackled at last in a co-ordinated way.  I hope the Minister will see it through to the bitter end.  He will get opposition from the Department of Agriculture and other vested interests. However, he should say loud and clear that he is going ahead with this operation. The country cannot afford the bureaucratic agrument that goes on between Departments.  The matter should be settled <Col N="1211" /> at Government level once and for all. It should be stated firmly that one Minister will be responsible for the development of our food industry and he should be allowed to get on with the job.  There have been many reports on this matter, as there have been on all the problems that ever afficted this country in the past ten or 15 years.  These reports would fill offices.  If these is one criticism I have of the 44 pages of the Minister's script it is the talk of more committees, reports and so on.  We all know what are the problems. It is time that we had action.  In the food processing area there should be one Minister responsible and he should be in the development area of the economy.</P>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture do a fine job for the farmers.  The Minister for Agriculture does his best to get increases for them in Brussels but that is where it stops.  To get added value for our products and to create wealth we must start with our natural resources.  For most of industry the raw materials have to be imported and we have no control over their supply or their price.  We are subject to currency and price fluctuations.  Running a business in those circumstances can be very difficult.  We have the best grassland in the world and we have the opportunity to produce the best food.  If we, as a small nation of 3,500,000 people, cannot put our act together on that score, we deserve to fail.</P>
    <P>I know of the problems for small business people.  Eleven years ago when I came to various Government Departments they did not want to know about me.  They told me the small enterprise I had in mind did not have a hope of succeeding. I was told there was no place for me in the market place, that I could not compete with the multinationals.  How many more small business people are being told that today?  I have no doubt there are many.  We can do the job as well as anyone.  We have proved it in the past and I cannot see any reason why we will not do it again.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the home market. The penetration of imports into the Irish market is a national scandal.  We should be ashamed of ourselves that we cannot <Col N="1212" /> take on those people.  As the Minister said, import prices during a period of years far exceeded price increases in Ireland.  There was no excuse at that time for Irish manufactures not to hold their share of the market.  What went wrong? The attitude was that delivery on any day would be good enough, that the package was all right and we did not have to change that.  We would produce what they should sell, not thinking about what the customer wanted to take off the shelf. For too long much of Irish industry has been production orientated and not market orientated.  In that marketing the design, presentation and delivery &mdash; all those elements in the competitiveness everybody talks about &mdash; are as important a factor as the wage cost that the Minister talks about.  Wage costs can affect some industries more than others, but the wage that you pay a guy does not matter as to its size as long as he produces enough for it, and the sooner we adopt that approach the better.  We talk about how far out of line we are in wage costs with our competitors in Europe, but where we are really out of line is not in the wages we are paying; it is in the production for the wages we are paying. We know what the wage costs plus the social costs and everything else are in Germany.  They are only about half our wage costs plus the social costs and everything else; they are only about 55 or 60 per cent, but there is a hell of a difference between what one unit of labour produces in Germany and what one unit produces in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We must get away from trying to screw down everybody and begin to realise that it is a big wide world out there.  There are 250 million customers in Europe.  If you can produce X you can be paid Y.  That is the criterion we must adopt.  At the end of the day the Irish worker, given the proper incentive, is interested in how much money he has in his pocket going home on Friday evening.  If he can see that by producing more he can get more &mdash; here is where the other important element comes in &mdash; there is no point in telling him that on the other hand Mr. Taxman will come along and say, &ldquo;The <Col N="1213" /> more you do that the more I will take&rdquo;. Everybody becomes fed up with that.</P>
    <P>When the Minister talks about his industrial strategy, policy, White Paper and so on, he is wasting his time in the sense that the best industrial policy designed and implemented will fail if it is not part of a total national economic plan.  He talks about wanting competitiveness, investment, this and that; but it is quite clear that the way to get investment is to create the climate for investment, and surely nobody on that side of the House would stand up and say barefacedly that the climate for investment has not been seriously damaged and worsened by the recent Finance Bill. Apart from the areas that were changed, it sounded a note of warning in the advance corporation tax, for instance.  It sounded a warning to foreign investors and industrialists of what we in the taxation area were thinking of here.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows as well as I do that when he was in America, Germany and wherever else he was, one of his high sales pitches was political stability in Ireland irrespective of what Government are in power.  Whether the Government change or not, one common theme running through Governments in Ireland is that the taxation climate is right.  That is more important than what other people in Ireland seem to think, that it is the IDA incentive, the grant, that brings investors here.  It is not.  It is political stability.  It is being able to plan their finances properly for the future and to make their financial arrangements and do financial borrowing.  The Minister for Finance started with an advance corporation tax without realising the repercussions of it and what it would do to the financial budgeting of any financial company. Very quickly he took it out when he realised what damage it would do, but in doing so what did he do?  He created clear discrimination against good, strong Irish companies who were in a position to invest here.  He took away an incentive from them.</P>
    <P>Where does that cut across the philosophy being expounded by the Minister, his Government, Telesis, the NESC and so on?  On the one hand he is <Col N="1214" /> expounding a philosophy to say that strong and indigenous firms must be built up here, but when a few of them go to invest, as one did, to the tune of £177 million the Government come in immediately with a Finance Bill containing a section that destroys that.  They create the suspicion and they breach the confidence that has been there.  Time and time again they turn back the clock.  We have certain things going for us.  For heaven's sake do not destroy them.  That is what I am trying to say in relation to the Government's industrial strategy and industrial White Paper.  They can be the best designed and implemented but if the Government do not get the economic climate right the venture capital that they talk about, that very necessary adjunct to investment in industrial development, will not be forthcoming.  From what I have seen they will not get it.</P>
    <P>I will tell the Minister how to get venture capital, although I am sure he knows.  He knows the risk.  You must pay. If somebody wants to take a risk with investment money you must pay the going rate for that.  If you do not you will not get that money.  It is as simple as that. I do not care what country you talk about, any private enterprise economy, capitalist state or whatever, that is the name of the game.  Are we doing it?  We are not. Out of £350 million or £400 million available for private investment in Ireland is any of it going into the industrial area? No.  The Minister talks about the attraction of gilts as against industrial investment and the attraction into housing against industrial development and so on. Until we take the bold, radical step of developing the venture capital market in the right way we will not get it.  The Minister was in the US, as I was, and he knows how it is got there.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is said that professional people here are making a great deal of money on the side.  I do not know whether they are.  If they are, for heaven's sake let us get it back into use in the economy.  Give them a tax credit. <Col N="1215" /> If they put in their money and it wins and shows a profit, tax them at capital gains. If it loses give them a write-off.  Let them put in their excess earnings &mdash; if they have it.  Good luck to anybody who can make money, but for heaven's sake let us create the environment to get it all back working.  Do not run around corners like the Department of Finance for the last while, saying, &ldquo;Let us find out if such and such a person has another £1,000 more than we thought he had&rdquo;.  That mean approach is nonsense.  If you want to get money to work, create the environment to get it to work.  If you do not do that it will not be here.  I am sure that the Minister met people running across the Border with suitcases.  There was great sale there for a few weeks and suitcases full of money were brought up there.</P>
      <P>Let us not fool ourselves.  We must not hide our heads in the sand.  The thinking in the Department of Finance is that because they have exchange control with the EMS they can control everything. They are not living in the real world and the Minister knows that as well as I do. The Minister talks about taking away money from gilts.  Fair play to him but they will not like it.  Until the Government get a co-ordinated plan at national economic level so that the Minister knows what the Minister for Finance is doing and the Minister for Finance knows what the Minister here is doing, the right hand knows what the left hand is doing, until you get that cohesion which at the moment is lacking all that the Minister is trying to do here will be negatived on the other side by the Department of Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some areas within the Minister's responsibility are the question of energy costs and the impact that they have on industrial costs.  We turn over to another Department and ask how much they charge for communications and postage stamps and we find they are the most expensive in the world.  I was part of that development, but if I was I can say that the people in the Department of Finance view the Department of Posts and Telegraphs as revenue collectors.  They will come along and say that they will write £30 million increase in charges.  That is <Col N="1216" /> all the consideration they give to whether the traffic can bear it, whether it is right for industry, whether industry can afford to pay it.  All across the board various Government services are being charged at the price at which they have to get to satisfy the Department of Finance.  This is undermining the whole industrial development area because those added costs which can be collected by public services or whatever cannot be recouped by the people engaged in the exposed sector of the economy.  In order to do it they must either improve their productivity or increase their price.  The Minister knows that prices in the export market cannot be increased on a whim in the way that public services or some companies can do it here under the National Prices Commission.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to take that as an indication of the feeling that exists in our constituency on this matter.  I would preface my comments by saying that this matter is probably the source of my greatest disappointment as a politician since I first entered the local authority in 1968 and subsequently had the honour of being elected to this House.  It frustrates, <Col N="1217" /> annoys and angers me that people in Finglas have been deprived of a facility which is essential to their wellbeing for no other reason than that which I must describe as the conundrumming of the bureaucrats and institutions of State, local and central.</P>
      <P>In April 1980 I had the pleasure and the honour as Minister of State at the Department of Education, known more generally as Minister with responsibility for Youth and Sport, to disburse a fund which was made available to me resulting from the tripartite employment fund.  We need not go into the nature of the establishment of that fund but it was a fund agreed upon by the Government and the trade unions which was to be made available for certain developments.  From that, £5 million was given to me and I did a fast examination of the needs of the country generally in respect of recreation and community centres.  I do not want to labour the merits of such centres.  Briefly they are centres to which young people, or indeed people of any age, can retire and pursue any form of exercise, physical or otherwise, which they feel would be of advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These establishments were built throughout the country and already they have proved their worth.  For far too long we looked upon the school, the Garda barracks, the church and dwelling houses as the only worthwhile buildings which should be in any area.  We overlooked the importance of recreational and sporting centres.  That oversight has been corrected in many areas and they are vibrant as a result of these centres.  Out of the funds available to me, I was happy to allocate £166,000 to the Finglas area, not just because I represented that constituency, but because in the examination that had taken place, it met all the necessary criteria.  The arrangement was that, having given £166,000 to Dublin Corporation, they would provide another third of the total cost of a quarter of a million and also provide the site.  After the normal deliberations that took place in respect of the site, I was informed that the city of Dublin VEC had co-operated in supplying a site and that the sod would be turned in late 1980.  The sod has not <Col N="1218" /> yet been turned and the £166,000 is lying somewhere awaiting approval of the Department of the Environment so that they can guarantee a loan in respect of the other amounts which Dublin Corporation think it necessary to have before they build the recreation centre.  There is an Irish proverb about three days you can never recover.  One of the three days you can never recover is the day you miss from school or any mental or physical exercise.  When I think of all the days that have been missed by the young people, housewives and all the other people in Finglas by not having this facility available to them, it angers and grieves me.  It also makes me despair of some of our Departments and also of that great local authority of which I had the honour of being a member for many years.  In the same constituency there are two private enterprises, the Erin's Isle GAA club, Tolka Rovers Soccer Club and the Boy Scouts, all voluntary organisations which were given relatively small grants out of the fund.  They have provided the facility out of their own resources and, as Deputy Flaherty and Deputy De Rossa know, these establishments are alive with activity which is very beneficial to the whole community in west Finglas.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the corporation, the centres at Bonnybrook, Tallaght and Clondalkin have all been provided but, for some unknown reason, Finglas has been excluded.  I do not think anybody would make the case that it is not necessary in Finglas because we all know, from rather unfavourable comments, that there is a great need there.  I hope that the opportunity which you have given me, a Cheann Comhairle to refer to this will serve as a shock tactic on the Department of the Environment to release whatever confirmation is required by Dublin Corporation so that they can proceed with this centre.  If, for reasons unknown to me, it is outside the competence, capacity or the ability of the Minister for the Environment to guarantee the difference between the grant which I made and what is necessary to build the recreation centre, I hope he will say so and hand over that £166,000 plus the amount originally agreed to by the corporation <Col N="1219" /> £84,000, and for heaven's sake proceed with the building of a centre for a quarter of a million pounds.  I know that costs have risen and it angers me to think of what could have been built three years ago for that money as against what it will cost now.  At least one could provide, for £250,000, a building which would serve the needs to which I refer.  I repeat that it is not to serve aspiring Olympic competitors. That would not be, and never was, the function of such a facility, as I would see it.  It would serve, perhaps, as a creche in the mornings and as a centre for the young married women who were not going out to employment to retire and indulge in physical exercise suited to their preference and ability.  I would have nothing against its serving as a centre where they could have chats and gossip &mdash; perhaps a form of therapy which has been rendered out of fashion for some time and which makes ladies the poorer and in need of other more expensive and more dangerous therapy.</P>
    <P>It would serve as a centre for the schools in that area &mdash; the Patrician College, Scoil Íde, St. Michael's secondary school &mdash; which are not blessed with gymnasia, where the students could be time-tabled into it.  It would serve as a centre where all the members of the local football teams which are not catered for by Tolka Rovers or Erin's Isle could retire, especially in wintertime, for their physical exercise.  There is no reason why such a centre should not be used every hour of every day.  Under proper management there could be no better investment for the State and the people of the country.  The Minister for Justice has given us a shattering figure &mdash; it is not his fault &mdash; that it costs £425 a week to keep a prisoner in Mountjoy Prison.  We can multiply that by 20 or 30&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I appreciate having had an opportunity of putting on the record of the House my annoyance and frustration and, on the other hand, my faith in the Minister of State that he will convey to the Minister of the Environment what I have said about this lost recreational facility in west Finglas, a position which will now be confirmed by Deputies Flaherty and De Rossa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first thank Deputy Tunney for raising the matter and for being particularly generous with the time.  This tradition of co-operation I hope will redound to the benefit of the area.  I am particularly glad that the Deputy raised the matter now, because it coincides with the initiative which I have undertaken at Dublin Corporation level to see whether the matter can be moved more speedily from there.  It does seem that the wrong Minister is present. To the best of my knowledge &mdash; and this will be indicated in his reply &mdash; the grant given by the Department when Deputy Tunney was Junior Minister is still available and quite clearly the delay has occurred in the Department of the Environment. It is there that I would lay the blame and the responsibility for the inactivity.</P>
      <P>The delay has been of almost three years, some of which was taken up by unavoidable negotiations in relation to the site, but a year-and-a-half's delay has occurred directly because the Department of the Environment have refused to allow Dublin Corporation to borrow the remaining money necessary to build the type of facility that the corporation and the area see as necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The desire is to build a multi-purpose sports hall which will be available for meetings as well as sports activities.  It is extremely badly needed in the area.  That is inevitably quite clear because of the size of the area and the exploding youth population.  Its population is now close to the size of Galway city's and the facilities in no way resemble those of that comparative group of people.  As Deputy <Col N="1221" /> Tunney has pointed out, the only facilities in the area are those which have been provided by voluntary activities.  It is very disappointing, when we think of the concentration given to many of the problems of this area, that this should be so &mdash; that at this point when part of the area is 26 years old, part 13 years old and the most modern part two or three years old, we can still say, in terms of community facilities for meeting together, spending leisure time together, other than the swimming pool, that no other facilities of an indoor nature have been provided by the corporation or the State for this massive community which we have housed there as part of a, supposedly, coherent policy for developing our city.</P>
    <P>This project when first mooted was very much welcomed and it is intolerable that it should be allowed to go no further. It is even more extraordinary when one considers that the other project mooted by Dublin Corporation at the same time &mdash;Bonnybrook &mdash; has been built, the money having been made available for that last year.  I do not object to any other area getting money, but it is extraordinary that the decision was not extended to include a similar facility for the Finglas area, which has great need of it.  It is extremely important, because so much of our activity in the Finglas area was aimed at improving the quality of life there and must be involved in providing this type of facility.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister here present to use what initiative he has to co-ordinate activities in his own Department and the Department of the Environment in seeing that the views expressed here reach the Department of the Environment as well as his own Department and, ensuring that the project will go ahead without any delay and that sanction will be given in this year for commencement of this building.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank Deputy Tunney for the opportunity of contributing to this debate on a very important matter.  On 3 May, in reply to a question which I put, the Minister for the Environment indicated that the £190,000 which the corporation had requested to <Col N="1222" /> borrow was not available because money had to be made available for priority services and, accordingly, there were no funds at his disposal.  That is an extraordinary statement, when one considers the dire need for facilities in the Finglas area. What facility would be more of a priority than a sports complex for Finglas West?</P>
      <P>At a time when the problems of the Finglas area have received such national attention, it is appalling that the Government should refuse to support this project which could play a very important role in reducing crime and juvenile vandalism, not just in the Finglas area but in a wide area surrounding it.  It is typical of the present Government which indulge themselves in public hand-wringing about problems of law and order that they should, at the same time, cut back on recreational projects and educational services.  They are the very facilities that are most needed by the people at risk of coming into conflict with the law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the corporation that the money which they now require to borrow &mdash; they are not looking for a grant, but to borrow &mdash; is in the region of £250,000 in addition to the money which they already have on hand. This is as a result of the delay.  One hundred and ninety thousand pounds would have been adequate 18 months ago when tenders were first sought and got. Even that £250,000 is tiny, compared with the money which the corporation will pay out this year for malicious damages &mdash; they are facing a bill of £11 million. It is complete nonsense to fail to provide recreational facilities in areas around this city and at the same time provide money for the payment of malicious damages which result directly from a lack of facilities for young people in any given area.  It is not just this Government but successive Governments which are responsible and must share the blame for this position.  I am not referring to the Finglas position but to the lack of facilities everywhere in the city.  Many of those involved in petty crime and vandalism come from unstable homes and situations of real poverty.  The Government's policy of cutbacks in education, health services, social welfare and their failure to provide <Col N="1223" /> recreational facilities aggravate that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the initiative taken by Deputy Tunney and the other representatives for the constituency in raising this matter.  It should be stated clearly that we are in no doubt about the needs of the Finglas area.  From my first day on entering politics as an elected member of Dublin Corporation when I took my seat alongside Deputy Flaherty, I was left in no doubt about the problems in that area.  The Government have shown that they recognise the fact that youth services are a priority and must be funded as a priority.  They showed their concern in the most practical way possible by reviewing the Estimates prepared by the previous administration who provided for a 1 per cent increase in funding in the youth area and replaced it with a 36 per cent increase.</P>
      <P>Deputy Tunney began his contribution by telling a tale of conundrums of bureaucrats local and central.  The situation he described was something of a tangled web.  It would be helpful if I outlined the facts briefly and in chronological order.</P>
      <P>In May 1980 two capital grants each of £166,000 were allocated to Dublin Corporation towards the cost of providing sports centres in Finglas and Darndale. These grants formed part of a package of over 60 capital grant allocations to various proposed recreational building projects throughout the country.  Subsequently in each of the two cases a sum of £84,000 was approved from the Local Loans Fund by the Department of the Environment.  Each development had a resource fund of £250,000 to meet construction costs.  The next hurdle to overcome was the selection of sites.  On 16 October 1980 Dublin Corporation wrote to inform the Department of Education that discussions had been entered into with Dublin VEC with a view to siting the proposed sports centre in the grounds of the girls' vocational school in Finglas. The site was investigated by officials of the Department and considered suitable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A design common to both the proposed <Col N="1224" /> Darndale and Finglas projects was submitted for approval in November 1980 and the Department's approval was conveyed to the corporation within the same month.  The facility comprised on the ground floor a multi-purpose sports hall, equipment store, changing rooms, showers, toilets and a games room.  On the first floor there was a table-tennis and a balcony area, kitchen, store and another games room.  Following that, tenders were invited.  For the Finglas project they were invited by means of public advertisement in August 1981.</P>
    <P>As regards the costing and financing, on 4 December 1981 Dublin Corporation wrote to the Department stating that five tenders had been received and that the lowest amounted to £586,529.  The corporation's technical staff examined the feasibility of cost reduction without radically altering the design and produced savings which would reduce the overall contract figure to £442,788.  However there remained a shortfall of £190,000 between the project resource fund, that is the £250,000 accumulated as I have indicated, and the contract cost. The corporation sought supplementary grant assistance of £380,000, that is £190,000 for each of the two projects, from the Department to enable construction work at the proposed centre to proceed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Was it a loan or a grant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is correct.  It is a loan.  In a letter dated 6 January 1982 the Department informed the corporation that it could not exceed its previously determined level of grant assistance and requested the corporation to indicate by early reply whether construction work could be commenced in both cases.  We must be clear about this. At that stage the corporation was just seeing what might just be available and if someone would give them a bigger grant they would take it.  The corporation informed the Department that the city council at its meeting of 5 April 1982 had authorised the submission of an application to the Minister for the Environment for sanction to borrow an additional <Col N="1225" /> £300,000 from the Local Loans Fund to enable both centres to proceed.  In September 1982 the Department of the Environment notified the corporation of its rejection of this application.  In October 1982 the corporation formally proposed to the Department of Education that both grant allocations be combined so as to enable the construction of one of the proposed centres to proceed.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education was examining this proposal when in November 1982 the then Minister for the Environment, Deputy Burke, gave the corporation sanction to borrow from a source other than the Local Loans Fund an additional sum of £190,000 to enable work on the proposed centre at Bonnybrook to proceed.  Work on Bonnybrook commenced in February 1983 and to date the Department has issued £41,000 of the approved grant.  There have been some recent developments.  On 25 November 1982 the Department of Education asked the corporation to outline the position with regard to the Finglas proposal in view of the Minister for the Environment's approval for additional borrowing in the case of Bonnybrook.  On 10 February 1983 the Department issued a reminder to the corporation.  In a brief reply the corporation stated that the proposal to build a sports hall at Finglas was deferred as they had not sufficient finance available to undertake the project at present.</P>
      <P>The position can be summed up as being that the allocation of £166,000 from my Department still exists but no action can be taken by my Department or any other Department while the matter remains in the court of Dublin Corporation. However, that would not do justice to the case.  I invite Deputies from the constituency to meet me so that together we can consider how progress can be made on this difficult situation.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if work permits have been issued to non-national crewmen working on Irish registered fishing boats while fishing in Irish territorial waters and while landing fish on shore; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under powers conferred on him by the Aliens Act, 1935, the Minister for Justice has imposed certain restrictions on the admission of aliens into the State.  One of these restrictions is that an alien may not <Col N="1157" /> enter the service of an employer in the State save in accordance with a permit issued to the employer by the Minister for Labour.</P>
      <P>It is long-standing policy to issue such a permit only when an Irish national or a national of another EEC state is not available for the position on offer.  This is normally established by consulting the National Manpower Service, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and SEDOC &mdash; the EEC-wide placement service.</P>
      <P>An application was recently received in my Department for work permits for a total of 31 persons in respect of the crews of two vessels owned by an Irish-registered company.  It is understood that the vessels are fishing trawlers.  The application is being processed in the normal way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry if he is aware of the serious damage being done to the Irish fishing industry by Spanish trawlers re-registered in Ireland who tranship their landings straight to Spain, when the original justification for any Spanish landings into Irish ports was to supply Irish processing plants; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickOToole" hpid="Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole) Paddy O'Toole">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Fisheries and Forestry (Mr. O'Toole)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that these vessels are causing serious damage to the Irish fishing industry because their catches consist mainly of species of fish not generally landed in quantity by Irish fishing vessels.  The vessels were represented to have been acquired to supplement landings to Irish fish processing factories and some of their catches are disposed of in that manner.  However, a proportion of the catch consists of species of fish which are normally disposed of and yield a greater return in the fresh state in Spain.  It is not the practice to dictate to owners of Irish registered fishing vessels how they dispose of fish catches.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am concerned, however, about the implications of further Spanish vessels <Col N="1158" /> being registered by purely Spanish interests here or in other EEC states, under flags of convenience, in order to gain access to national or Community fishing rights in our waters.  I have therefore asked the Government to approve of urgent legislation which will be designed to restrict greatly both the registration of such vessels in Ireland and the operation in Irish waters of such vessels registered in other EEC states.</P>

      <P>The provision of additional nursing staff for St. Joseph's Hospital, Clonmel, must be viewed in the context of the additional costs involved and the restriction on the creation of additional posts in the public service.  All health boards have been directed to achieve a 2 per cent reduction in the numbers employed on 31 March 1983, as compared with the number employed on 21 July 1981.  Consequently the provision of additional nursing staff at the hospital would depend on the ability of the South-Eastern Health Board to redeploy existing staff and financial resources.  The Board have in fact appointed two extra nurses to the hospital in this manner.</P>

      <P>Following a routine re-investigation of the means of the person concerned to take account of an increase in her spouse's occupational pension it was recently decided by the local pension committee that she is entitled to a pension at the rate of £26.45 per week from 28 January 1983.  Pension at this rate was in payment pending the committee's decision on a question for a reduction in her pension from £28.45 a week.</P>
      <P>The pensioner has appealed against the committee's decision and the case is being referred to an appeals officer for determination.  She will be notified of the outcome.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is being paid disability benefit at regular weekly intervals and payment has been made to 18 June 1983.  A form on which to claim invalidity pension has been forwarded to him and on its return, duly completed, the claim will be dealt with without delay.</P>

      <P>The person concerned who is a self-employed plasterer does not satisfy the contribution conditions for entitlement to unemployment benefit.  He applied for a qualification certificate to enable him to claim unemployment assistance but as he refused to make available details of his bank accounts his application was disallowed.  The disallowance was upheld by an appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He re-applied for a qualification <Col N="1176" /> certificate and his case has been referred to a social welfare officer for investigation. It is expected that the inquiries will shortly be completed after which his application for a qualification certificate will be reviewed and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined accordingly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the benefits for which public employees paying reduced rates of PRSI are not at present eligible; and the likely cost from 6 April 1983 and in a full year of extending these benefits to serving public employees, excluding those already retired or who have otherwise left public employment prior to 6 April 1983.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Permanent and pensionable employees in the public sector covered by the reduced rate of pay-related social insurance contribution are not entitled to disability benefit, unemployment benefit, maternity allowance, pay-related benefit, invalidity pension, retirement pension, old age (contributory) pension, death grant or treatment benefit.</P>
      <P>The reduced rate of contribution payable in respect of these employees gives cover for widows' and orphans' pensions and deserted wife's benefit and limited occupational injuries benefit only.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As entitlement to social insurance benefits depends on the establishment of an appropriate record of insurance, the extension of full social insurance cover to serving public sector employees from a current date would not give rise to any immediate cost.  If, for example, full insurance cover was extended to public servants from 6 April 1983 entitlement to disability benefit and pay-related benefit would not under the normal contribution conditions arise until January 1985 while entitlement to retirement pension would not arise before 1993.  However, once entitlement to benefits had been established, the extension of full insurance cover to public servants would ultimately involve additional expenditure from the Social Insurance Fund and the Occupational Injuries Fund of some £127 million in 1983 terms for a full year including administrative costs.  This cost is based on the assumption that the incidence of claims, other than for unemployment payments, from public servants would be the same as from the current fully insured population.  No provision has been made for unemployment payments as it can be <Col N="1180" /> assumed that such payments would be negligible.</P>
